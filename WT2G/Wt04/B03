Bankruptcy considered a last, but viable, resort

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 4

by Matthew Miller

China has abandoned its historic reluctance to let its most
unprofitable state-owned companies go bust, but economists are not
predicting a wave of bankruptcies in the immediate future.

A record number of bankruptcy petitions was filed this year and
Beijing recently issued provisional regulations on the dissolution
of state companies.

But experts said fundamental questions on resettlement of state
employees who once enjoyed cradle-to-grave welfare benefits, as
well as resolution of outstanding bank loans, continued to make
bankruptcy the choice of last resort.

The state would keep trying to save its state-owned enterprises
whenever and however it could, a Beijing-based economist said.

Li Shan, executive director of Goldman Sachs (Asia), agreed. "There
will not be massive bankruptcy," Li said. "There are issues of
social unrest [to consider] but more importantly effects on the
banking system need to be resolved."

During the first nine months of this year more than 3,400 companies
petitioned for termination and the number could rise to 5,000 by
year-end. That would be about the same number of companies that
have filed for bankruptcy in the 10 years since the National
People's Congress passed the first bankruptcy law in 1986.

Ministry of Finance provisional regulations on the settlement of
financial issues call for further merging and bankruptcy of China's
most indebted state enterprises. The regulations apply to 58 large
and medium-sized pilot cities selected by the State Council
(cabinet) earlier this year.

Most importantly, the regulations for the first time identify
concepts of senior and junior debt in Chinese bankruptcy
proceedings. Wages owed, social security payments and other welfare
provisions will take priority over repayment of debt. Workers'
housing, schools and hospitals cannot be liquidated to pay off
debts.

Giving the welfare and resettlement of workers priority has been
the practice in Chinese bankruptcy proceedings but there have been
no such regulations in the past.

Even if state planners could resolve problems of employee
resettlement, the massive debts of state companies make bankers
wary of any spate of bankruptcies.

Earlier this month the State Statistics Bureau revealed that in
1995 total debt in the state sector amounted to 3.36 trillion
renminbi (US$405 billion), outstripping total private bank deposits
of Rmb2.97 billion. The bureau reported the asset-liability ratio
for the 148,000 state enterprises at 85 percent.

Historically, debt owed to state banks is the last to be paid in
any bankruptcy proceeding. Moreover, local officials have never
shied away from bankrupting enterprises so the companies can avoid
repaying large creditors, typically state banks.

Even when state banks have been allowed to foreclose on factories
holding mortgage-backed loans, the results often have been
disastrous.

The Sichuan provincial city of Mianyang is one of the pilot
locations for the new bankruptcy regulations. When the city's
Miaoting Paper Mill declared bankruptcy in April 1995, the local
court ruled that an Rmb11.22 million mortgage-backed debt owed to
the local branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
(ICBC) would be settled through foreclosure of the factory's walls,
roads, toilets and sewers.

The local courts also ordered five more factories bankrupt,
creating total losses for ICBC's Mianyang branch of Rmb70 million.
Total assets at the branch amounted to only Rmb110 million. Branch
general manager Li Yichun said it would take the bank 15 years to
write off the foreclosures.

State bankers pointed out that overvaluation of state assets also
made bankruptcy an unacceptable practice. Last week's unsuccessful
auction of land use rights at the bankrupt Shanghai No 4 Plastic
Products Factory is indicative of the problem.

The land auction, which would have been Shanghai's first for a
bankrupt enterprise, was organized to raise funds to relocate and
re-employ factory workers, as well as repay a company debt of
Rmb11.26 million, much of which is owed to ICBC's Shanghai branch.

But the Shanghai municipal land planning bureau attached a minimum
value to the real estate of Rmb2,600 per square meter, well above
the Rmb2,000 per square meter that developers were prepared to pay.
When bids for the minimum price failed to materialize, the auction
was canceled.

A spokesman for Shanghai Light Industry Holding, the parent company
of Shanghai No 4 Plastic Products Factory, said the failure would
certainly influence the future auction of property rights for other
bankrupt state companies.

Despite such setbacks, observers remain hopeful that recent
developments signal a new willingness to tackle the difficulties
facing the state sector.

"It's significant that they're speaking about the process," said
Goldman Sach's Li. "If the austerity program should continue it
will create conditions for deterioration of state-owned enterprise
performance. These new bankruptcy

provisions will give them an outlet to make better use of their
assets."

Membership to OECD gives Seoul host of labor headaches

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 3

by Elizabeth Pisani

Only a few days before South Korea is due to sign on the dotted
line for membership of the OECD, the club for rich nations,
international trade unionists are once again waving the flag of
workers' rights, demanding that labor law reforms promised by Seoul
be speeded up.

International activists tell tales of abuses in South Korean-owned
factories around the world. "Anti-unionism and worker exploitation
has become another Korean export," said a forthcoming article in
the trade union magazine Free Labour World.

Their voices form an unlikely chorus with those of the very
companies they criticize. South Korea's giant conglomerates, too,
want to see labor laws changed, but for very different reasons.
While trade unionists complain that present law makes it too hard
for workers to organize, employers complain laws make it too hard
to fire staff.

The Brussels-based International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
(ICFTU) had been lobbying hard for labor laws to be changed before
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development formally
invited South Korea to join the body, which now groups 28 of the
world's leading economies.

Unionists feared that once the invitation was issued, as it was on
October 15, Seoul would have no incentive to change restrictive
labor laws. European Union Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan recently
reminded South Korean legislators that OECD nations would continue
to press for labor reforms. But when Seoul finally signs an
agreement to join the largely Western group in Paris on Friday, the
impetus may well be lost.

"We have written again today to the labor minister to remind him of
the commitments he has made," an ICFTU official said on Monday. The
trade union grouping, working with two South Korean affiliates, is
concerned above all with a law which forbids unionists who do not
work in a given company to support or mediate in that company's
labor disputes.

Ironically, this law is something of a headache for employers, too.

While it does cut out the possibility of activists working across
a whole industry, the present system puffs up wage bills. Employers
find they are picking up the paychecks for dozens of workers who
spend all their time on union activities.

Unionists would like, too, to see workers permitted to join any one
of a range of labor organizations - at present the law limits
workers to one union per company. "Our third bone of contention is
the prohibition on public sector workers' union membership," the
ICFTU official said.

None of the international trade union body's demands go beyond
conventions promoted by the United Nations' International Labor
Organization (ILO) agency. As Asian governments fight to keep
workers rights off the agenda at world trade talks scheduled for
December in Singapore, they are touting the ILO as the proper forum
for labor issues.

Asian nations reason that elaborate social security systems that
protect workers are inappropriate to their level of development.
Labor activists counter that they are asking for the ILO minimum.
They have also said that the "developing economy" argument did not
hold water coming from South Korea, the OECD's second Asian member
after Japan. South Korea exported US$3 billion in investments in
1995 and half that amount again in only the first three months of
1996.

Every day the European media has stories of a new South Korean
triumph. Investment is promised in televisions, in semiconductors,
in cars. Even European aircraft are on the block to South Korean
bidders.

And yet, pointed out Free Labour World, papers around the world
were also heaving with reports of labor unrest at Korean-owned
factories. From Argentina to Vietnam, workers are reported to be
humiliated or mistreated by their South Korean bosses. "Korean
multinationals make very bad ambassadors in most countries," said
an article due to appear in the November issue of the magazine.

Its bad reputation notwithstanding, Korea appears keen to pass
skills on to others. Several groups, finding they have lost senior
staff in overseas companies after a takeover, have called for more
training of foreign managers in Korea. And Seoul has promised to
pump US$10 million into a job training center in Beijing.

Opening floodgates of goodwill

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1

by Francesco Lao Xi Sisci

Sino-German relations are back on track after several months of
friction, according to both sides, and China has welcomed Bonn's
important backing for its Three Gorges dam project.

Four months after Beijing angrily canceled his original visit,
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has been given a high-profile
reception in Beijing. The welcome did not cool even when Kinkel
raised the thorny issue of human rights.

"There had been bumps in Sino-German relations... but things are
now resolved," Kinkel said on Monday after meeting his Chinese
counterpart Qian Qichen. Qian also said relations were back to
normal.

China has welcomed plans for a visit by German President Roman
Herzog next month but was even more pleased by German support for
Three Gorges.

Bonn in recent weeks has agreed to guarantee German investment in
the project, the German side announced. It was a groundbreaking
result for China after the United States and Japan had refused to
do likewise and the World Bank withheld support. The dam across the
Yangtze River, brainchild of late chairman Mao Zedong, and
personally encouraged by Premier Li Peng, will cost US$30 billion.

Opponents fear it will cause serious environmental damage for
questionable benefits.

The Chinese believe the dam, which when completed would be the
world's largest, will end periodic floods along the Yangtze and
increase China's power capacity by 18,000 megawatts.

German support is politically and economically very important
following China's recent announcement of a US$1 billion bond issue
to finance the project.

The Chinese Financial Daily reported on Monday that 17 billion
renminbi (US$2 billion) had already been invested. On Tuesday the
Guangming Daily reported that Li Peng had visited the site and
spoke to people who will be forced to move.

A total of 1.07 million people must be relocated from the area to
be flooded. The dam will be completed in the year 2009.

Kinkel's July visit was postponed after the German parliament
passed a resolution on Tibet critical of Beijing.

Kinkel, who met Communist Party leader and State President Jiang
Zemin and Li Peng on Tuesday, raised the cases of dissidents Wei
Jingsheng and Wang Dan during his meeting with Qian on Monday.

Wang Dan, 27, a veteran of the Tiananmen Square protests, has been
charged with subversion and could receive a sentence ranging from
10 years to life.

Wei, sentenced in 1994 to a 14-year jail term for subversion, has
already spent nearly 15 years in prison.

Kinkel described his meeting with Qian, at which he raised the
plight of the dissidents, as very cordial.

Other foreign visitors who raised human rights issues, and
specifically individual cases, customarily received a frosty
response.

The German government has been accused by opposition parties in
Bonn of going soft on China over human rights for the sake of
lucrative contracts. Engineering giant Siemens is bidding to supply
generators to Three Gorges.

Kinkel said on Tuesday Germany was considering opening an
industrial park in the central city of Wuxi. He said China was keen
to use German technology in the fields of transport,
telecommunications and infrastructure.

"China and Germany complement each other in many ways, they ideally
dovetail," he said.

Germany is China's largest European trading partner and its fourth
largest global trading partner. Two-way trade last year was worth
DM21 billion (US$13.6 billion).

Police put their feet down on no-hands truck drivers

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1

by Shu-Ching Jean Chen

Police are about to get tough with Taiwan's notorious truckers - by
ordering them not to steer with their feet.

The Ministry of Transportation and Communications will soon
announce a rule making it compulsory for drivers to keep their
hands constantly on the wheel.

"Our policemen have seen truck drivers relying on their feet to
steer at speeds of 70 or 80km per hour," said an official at the
Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau. "That has greatly increased
the risks of driving on the highway.

"Some were even spotted eating from lunch boxes or playing with
their mobile phones while letting go of the wheel."

Such maverick driving often occurs at night, when traffic is light
or drivers are tired after long hours on the road, or in traffic
jams.

But without a new rule police have no legal power to crack down.
The rule will clearly specify that steering with one's feet or
taking both hands off the wheel is an offense.

Offenders will face a fine of NT$3,000 (US$109) to NT$6,000.

Enforcing the rule may, however, prove difficult. "Even the camera
might not be able to catch a clear picture of what's going on
inside a truck," said Lin Wein-hsien, secretary-general of the
Truck Cargo Transportation Association. "The police will have
technical problems in coming up with solid evidence."

But Lin said the passage of the rule could in itself serve as a
warning to delinquent drivers.

Truckers are currently among the most dangerous drivers on Taiwan's
crowded highways. According to the Taiwan Area National Freeway
Bureau, trucks and other large cargo vehicles made up only 22
percent of the traffic flow on highways in 1995 but accounted for
31 percent of accidents.

The figure is alarming but still a distinct improvement on 1994
when trucks accounted for 44 percent of accidents.

Taiwan truckers are also notorious for forcing other vehicles out
of their way by flashing their headlights immediately behind them.

Thailand pins down airwave bandits

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1

by Jaruwan Ngamman

In Bangkok's bustling Mahboonkrong shopping center, if you want to
make an international phone call the price charged is usually a
steal - literally. Illegal cellular phone operators there let you
call using "stolen numbers" and the final bill winds up in the
hands of some unsuspecting subscriber.

After five years of rapid growth Thailand's cellular phone
companies, who claim to provide first world technology in a
developing economy, are now confronting what once used to be a
first world problem - air time theft.

Worried by the way it is wreaking havoc on customers' bills and
siphoning away millions of baht in revenue each year, two of the
country's biggest cellular phone operators, Advanced Info Service
(AIS) and Total Access Communication (TAC), are teaming up to curb
the illegal business.

The companies, which until recently held a duopoly over the
country's lucrative cellular phone market, have launched a campaign
aimed at alerting customers and warning off air time thieves.

Last week Thai police arrested three illegal mobile phone operators
who allegedly coordinated their business with employees of AIS.

"We are determined to send illegal air time operators to jail,"
said AIS vice-president Vuthiporn Chaipayom.

AIS plans to spend more than 200 million baht (US$7.8 million) to
install the Subscriber Identity Security system at its 29 telecom
base stations by year end. The SIS International Gateway Office, an
international air time theft agency based in the Netherlands, will
monitor the system for an annual fee of 12 million baht.

The key to preventing air time theft, said industry executives, was
to safeguard the passwords encrypted in signals emanating from
mobile phones which enable access to the telecom network for making
domestic and international calls.

One way in which thieves - usually cellular phone repair shop
owners - get their hands on the passwords is through handling
handsets given to them for maintenance.

Industry executives also blame the problem on those subscribers who
employ repair shops to tune inexpensive handsets for other family
members who want to use the same mobile phone number. In the
process, they unwittingly give the repair shop access to their
passwords.

Passwords can also be deciphered through the use of special
devices, such as those manufactured by one California-based
company, which intercepts and decodes signals between cellular
phones and base stations.

Each "stolen number" is usually used for only a couple of months
before the original subscribers get wise to the fact that their
bills are being inflated by illicit calls.

The price charged for such pirated cellular phones is often as low
as 10,000 baht, whereas normal subscribers pay twice as much for
the handset, a one-time registration fee of 4,000 baht and a
monthly subscription fee of 500 baht.

"We will need the cooperation of our customers in preventing air
time theft," said TAC vice-president Somyot Woraprechapanich. TAC
executives said the company had set up shop at Mahboonkrong to keep
an eye on illegal phone operators in coordination with the police.

According to Somyot, the company has already spent more than 100
million baht on the installation of a new security system for its
network. TAC also has plans to impose a ceiling on the amount of
international calls next year, after consultations with its
clients.

The crackdown stems in part from the prospect of growing
competition in the sector, which makes maximizing revenues a
priority for cellular operators.

In July this year, a legal advisory body did away with the
monopolies granted to AIS and TAC by state-owned telecom companies
in 1990.

Another theory is that the present campaign is part of the
companies' efforts to push sales of their digital mobile phone
services, said to be less prone to air time theft than analog
systems.

Both companies, after starting out with cellular phones using
analog systems five years ago, have in recent years invested
heavily in digital telecom networks and are finding it difficult to
attract new subscribers, due to a number of reasons including their
higher cost.

It's extortion, claims News Corp

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16

by Yaroslav Trofimov

Rupert Murdoch, probably the most powerful man in the global media
business, would be ill-advised to come to Israel. If he does,
Israeli tax authorities warn, he will be certainly "invited for
questioning" and maybe even arrested.

According to accusations put forward by Israel's Income Tax
Authority (ITA), Murdoch's main concern in the Jewish state, News
Datacom Research, a fully-owned subsidiary of Sydney-based News
Corp, has "swindled" Israel's Treasury out of tens of millions of
dollars.

In what is being described by the Israeli media as "the biggest tax
fraud in Israeli history", the ITA claims that News Datacom did not
report as much as US$150 million of income between 1989 and 1996.
The company's executives, accountants and attorneys have already
been interrogated by ITA investigators.

Murdoch has vehemently denied the accusations, blaming disgruntled
former employees for instigating the scandal.

"The company has filed all required tax returns and paid all
applicable taxes... statements to the media appear to be a result
of a continued extortion campaign by former employees who have been
sued in the United Kingdom by News Datacom for defrauding it of
millions of dollars," News Datacom said.

The company employs 250 people at its research laboratory in
Jerusalem and manufacturing facility in Haifa. It produces the
so-called "smart cards" used by Murdoch-owned satellite ventures
such as Hong Kong-based StarTV and London-based British Sky
Broadcasting, which ensure that only paid-up subscribers can access
the encrypted programming.

The technology for the cards is based on an invention by Israeli
mathematician Adi Shamir, who until recently served as a News
Datacom director. Shamir has already been questioned by the ITA.
News Datacom allegedly reported only a fraction of payments
received for the technology and software that it developed in
Israel and "smuggled" abroad.

The bulk of the income it had earned was allegedly paid to
Murdoch-owned companies in Hong Kong, where the tax rate is much
lower.

Daewoo scoffs at white knight talk

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16

by Claude Albert and Philip Golub, Asia Times

The chairman of South Korea's Daewoo Electronics on Tuesday
dismissed reports of a counter-offer for France's Thomson
Multimedia as a "joke", but sought to mollify French critics of the
deal with his firm.

"We have been working very seriously on the bid for the past six
months and I don't see any new global offer being presented at this
late stage," Bae Soon-hoon told a news conference.

Thomson Multimedia is the consumer electronics arm of Thomson,
which is due to be privatized by the end of the year. The French
government announced last week it had selected an offer from
France's Lagardere and Daewoo for Thomson over a competing bid by
Alcatel Alsthom.

Daewoo Electronics is to take over 85 percent or more of Thomson
Multimedia, a world leader in digital technologies and the world's
fourth largest television maker. The partnership will create the
world's largest television producer.

The French business press suggested this week that a rival French
bidder for Thomson Multimedia was about to be found. The Liberation
daily on Tuesday said Sagem, which fell out of the race earlier,
was preparing such a bid. Sagem denied any bid and Bae dismissed
the idea.

Daewoo's purchase has provoked intense criticism from an array of
business interests, trade unions and political parties, all of whom
denounced the sell off of one of France's leading high-tech
companies to a foreign group.

Discord spread within the government, with senior officials close
to National Assembly President Philippe Seguin voicing strong
opposition to the deal.

"The government failed for years to recapitalize Thomson
Multimedia, forcing the company to pay exorbitant interest on its
outstanding debt," said Elie Cohen of the French National Center
for Scientific Research, one of the more articulate critics of the
sale.

As a result, said Cohen, it is being sold just when it is heading
towards profitability. "France would not sell Thomson Multimedia to
a foreign company at this time if it still had an industrial
ambition of its own," he said.

The critics are unlikely to deter the French government from its
chosen course. La Tribune on Tuesday quoted sources close to the
finance minister as saying that even if the government received a
new bid it could not consider it since Thomson as a whole and not
any particular part was being privatized.

Asked about one of the more contentious issues of the takeover -
the amount of debt which Daewoo will assume - Bae said "we are not
allowed to make it public". Out of a total debt of FF14 billion
(US$2.69 billion), Daewoo Electronics is thought to have agreed to
pay FF4.8 billion. But, when asked whether his group would be
willing or able to take on the total debt, Bae said: "I think so,
yes."

Bae reiterated that Daewoo Electronics would stick to its
commitment to create 5,000 jobs at Thomson Multimedia in five
years. He said the firm's independence would be maintained by
keeping its headquarters in Paris.

The statement is unlikely to mollify critics who have expressed
concern that Daewoo could radically revamp the management
structure.

Bae did not allay this concern but did say that most of the top
management would remain French, adding: "It is hard to imagine that
Koreans would come to live in Paris though they love to visit it as
tourists."

Though it is unlikely to upset the deal, the political pressure has
already pushed Lagardere and Daewoo to alter some prior agreements.
Last week Jean-Luc Lagardere said the two groups would create a
common subsidiary for next-generation consumer electronic products,
rather than simply ceding Thomson Multimedia's high-tech digital
activities to Daewoo.

French interests will thus retain a say in the more sensitive
high-tech sectors.

Hyundai defends plant in Poland

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16

by Andrea Thalemann, Asia TImes

The Polish government is expected to announce on Wednesday whether
South Korea's largest chaebol, Hyundai, had illegally established
a car assembly plant in Poland only days before a new decree on
import duty waivers took effect.

The Polish Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Foreign
Economic Cooperation have questioned the legality of an official
licence which permitted Hyundai and its Polish partner Universal in
August to import car parts without paying 35 percent import duty.
The licence was issued by the Ministry for Foreign Economic
Cooperation and then suspended after a sudden change in import
regulations for car parts.

Hyundai and Universal said they were victims of intentionally
untransparent government regulations.

Last July, the companies agreed to assemble 15,000 models in the
first year, taking into account Polish law which grants companies
that assemble more than 1,000 cars a year in Poland, duty-free
imports of parts.

The two companies received official permission for their venture on
August 8, when Universal heard of an imminent change to the
existing regulations whereby duty waivers would be granted only to
car manufacturers already in operation.

That sent the infant venture scrambling for proof of its existence.
In a matter of days, Hyundai brought in assembly kits and a Korean
technician to an unused factory north of Warsaw. By August 24, they
had assembled the first batch of cars.

Two days later, the new regulation was published in the Legal
Gazette. It required every foreign car maker to apply for new
import permits effective on August 24 - the day Hyundai had
invoiced its first cars.

There was, however, no official announcement before or on the day
the decree went into effect.

Hyundai said without a duty waiver, its cars would be effectively
priced out of the Polish car market.

Copper trader faces long, slow procedure

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 16

by Richard Hanson

Yasuo Hamanaka, the 48-year-old former Sumitomo Corp copper trader
at the heart of one of history's most spectacular financial losses,
was sent through the gates of the cream-colored Tokyo Detention
House on Tuesday, a journey made by some of Japan's most famous
politicians and criminals.

Prosecutors arrested the mild-mannered Hamanaka, after criminal
charges were filed by his former employer alleging that he had,
over the past three years, forged hundreds of order forms and other
documents to cover up huge losses while he was in charge of
Sumitomo's multibillion dollar global copper trading operations.

Breach of trust charges are being prepared.

In June, Hamanaka was fired when the company revealed copper trade
losses of US$1.8 billion. Last month, Sumitomo said the loss was as
large as US$2.6 billion.

In size, the loss eclipses that of Baring's US$1.3 billion stock
index futures debacle in Singapore two years ago, and Daiwa Bank's
US$1.1 billion New York bond trading loss in September 1995.

In all three cases, the seemingly loyal, profit-making employee was
given freedom to operate with loose management controls and each
one had hidden his losses for extended periods from both management
and the regulatory authorities.

Sumitomo said Hamanaka's first losses in copper trading occurred
about 10 years ago on the London Metal Exchange. He had extensive
dealings with companies in the United States and was able to borrow
large amounts of funds from many of the top banks in the world,
based on the supposed backing of the giant Sumitomo trading house.

At the height of his fame, Hamanaka was dubbed within the market as
Mr Copper or Mr Five Percent - the share of the world copper market
that Sumitomo controlled at one time.

It was said that he accounted for half of the copper trades on the
London Metal Exchange at one point.

The Sumitomo copper scandal has prompted what is now described as
close cooperation among criminal-justice authorities in Britain,
the US and Japan.

In the US, where Sumitomo has closed its metals trading business,
six lawsuits have been filed against the trading house by
customers. A lawyer in Tokyo is preparing to file a suit on behalf
of a group of Japanese shareholders against Sumitomo's management.

Hamanaka has the distinction of being the first and, so far, the
only person to be charged in the copper scandal by the Tokyo
Prosecutors Office.

The office raided his house in a suburb of Tokyo on early Tuesday
morning. Neither Sumitomo nor the prosecutors disclosed exactly
where Hamanaka was arrested, although he was seen being taken by
car into the Tokyo Detention House at around 3.30pm.

The wheels of criminal justice grind slowly and deliberately in
Japan, as prosecutors build their case. Initially, suspects can be
detained for questioning in the sparsely-furnished cells of the
detention house for up to a month, and even longer if further
charges are filed.

The late former prime minister Kakuei Tanaka was so detained over
two decades, and later convicted, in the famous Lockheed aircraft
bribery scandal of the mid-1970s. A more recent example was Shoko
Asahara, leader of the now-disbanded Aum Supreme Truth religious
group, who is on trial for masterminding a deadly 1995 poison gas
attack on the Tokyo subway system.

Hamanaka's alleged crimes involved no claims of personal gain, and
were certainly not heinous, but they were still surrounded by
riddles over who else might have been involved and the role of
Sumitomo's own management.

At a news conference on Tuesday, a Sumitomo executive would not
comment on either the names of the clients that Hamanaka had traded
with outside of Japan, or even the names of the countries in which
they lived.

Sakuo Nanba, general manager of Sumitomo's legal department, was
also reported to have said that the company's internal
investigation so far had not found evidence that Hamanaka was
manipulating the world copper market - a key point in the
investigation.

Hamanaka's alleged forgery involved two types of documents, which
were drawn up in the hundreds over the past three years while
trying to conceal losses from management. One used falsified
signatures of two senior Sumitomo officials between January and
March 1994 to place orders with customers. Another used in
September that year said Hamanaka had sole authority over the use
of funds obtained overseas.

The details over how Hamanaka managed to run up US$2.6 billion in
losses have not been disclosed. The scam was only unraveled earlier
this year when Hamanaka was about to be promoted and posted to
Indonesia.

Caught in a minefield

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 11

by Karen Back, for Asia Times

Lieutenant-Colonel Garth Barrett used to plant land mines as a
soldier. Now he makes a living destroying them. An expert in mine
detection and destruction, he has worked for the past several years
as a consultant to defense contractors. He has also helped United
Nations forces carry out peace-keeping operations in Mozambi que
and Bosnia where he's helmed "nonmilitary operations to
rehabilitate countries" - clearing land mines, restoring power
lines and reopening roads.

"After a war is over, the mines are still in the ground and don't
care who the enemy is," said Barrett. "They detonate whenever
somebody stands on them or runs over them with a vehicle. There's
no limitation on who they maim."

If you step on a land mine, what should you do? "Once you step on
them, they go bang. You're going to lose part of a limb," he said.
"The Western mines don't do as much damage as the old Soviet-bloc
mines. The Western anti-personnel mines have far less explosives in
them - they will quite often take a foot off only up to your ankle.
But with a Soviet anti-personnel mine, you'll quite often lose your
leg below the knee." He has seen colleagues die after stepping on
mines because "you can't get medical aid to them quick enough. They
lose blood too quickly to be saved."

Barrett works on contracts for companies such as Science
Applications International Corporation. A mine clearance job could
run from three weeks to three years. His longest stint so far was
two-and-a-half years in Mozambique, where he and his crew de-mined
approximately 4,000km of road. Mine clearance is not cheap. A
project can cost from US$2 million to US$50 million. A typical
2,000km of road costs from US$5 million to US$10 million to clear,
takes from four to six months and utilizes four mine-protected
vehicles. The mine-clearing contingent of 50 people live in either
tents or caravans using mobile showers, eating cooked breakfasts,
cold lunch and a barbecued dinner. Nightly recreation on-site
includes Rambo-type videos and books. Barrett likes to read authors
John Clancy and Darryl Brown.

The mine detection system he uses, Checkmate, is unique, he said,
because it only looked for the explosive vapor which every mine
has. Other systems use metal detection and ground-penetrating
radar. Samples of air are taken either manually or by
remote-controlled miniature aircraft, about the size of model
planes, which fly over suspected mine fields. The air vapor, a kind
of a fingerprint, is captured on to an absorbent compound in a
small tube which is presented to a trained dog kept in a sterile
environment who determines from the scent whether there's evidence
of a mine there. If the dog makes a positive ID, a specific area is
searched.

Born in Rhodesia, Barrett, who moved to southern California in the
United States in 1994, learned his trade "purely by accident". He
said: "In Africa we had a land mine war engaged by the guerrillas,
freedom fighters, whatever you want to call them, over the past
25-odd years, so we developed a lot of techniques to protect
vehicles transporting soldiers. After taking an advanced
demolitions course, I started to learn about mines."

Explosives training was a requirement for Special Forces troops in
Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. Barrett commanded a Special Forces
regiment, leading counter-terrorist/ counter-insurgency oper
ations. "We killed guerrillas, terrorists outside our country," he
said. He twice received Rhodesia's Legion of Merit for combating
terrorism. At the conclusion of the war in Rhodesia and "after
consultation with Robert Mugabe, the new leader of Zimbabwe",
Barrett and his contingent of the Special Air Service immigrated en
masse to South Africa and were inducted into the South African
defense forces in 1980.

He led that unit for a year, retired from the military in 1981 and
began working in "bomb inhibition", eventually running Suppression
Technology Systems in Johannesburg, South Africa. Described by a
colleague as a "steely-eyed man with a hair-trigger temper", for
the past several years he has also specialized in explosive
detection and land mine clearance.

"If there are anti-personnel mines, we tramp them out using a 10
tonne mine-protected armored vehicle which has a long bomb arm with
a special steel wheel with disc rollers on it which digs the mine
out of the ground," said Barrett. "We just drive over the mines,
which explodes them."

Driving over an exploding land mine sounds dangerous. "It's just a
cloud of dust," said Barrett. "You just carry on driving." It
doesn't inflict damage on the vehicle because it can withstand 30
pounds of explosives, and the mine only has a couple of ounces of
explosives in it. Does he feel like Rambo driving over a mine in a
10 tonne tank? "It's not fun," said Barrett. "Too much dirt and
dust coming in."

Barrett also told a story about men collecting mines in Kuwait. "As
they extracted the mines, the men kept throwing them in their
truck. They threw one too many in there and detonated the whole
truck. About 19 men were killed. But I've been very lucky. I've had
friends blown up behind me and in front of me. But I've never hit
one myself."

Sometimes he puts mines in a holding place until he decides how to
deal with them. "You don't want to blow a mine next to a road
otherwise you'll cause even more damage," he said. "Often, you'll
move it out of a vulnerable place, put it somewhere nearby and
possibly burn it up using thermit. But you have to be careful you
don't start a fire because thermit burns extremely hot." If there
are anti-tank mines that aren't blast-protected, they blow up.
"Modern mines have blast protection built into them which means a
time-pressure impulse is required on the mine's detonation system,"
he explained. "That doesn't exist on an older mine, so you put a
light plastic bag inflated with special gas over it which then
sends a blast of pressure into the mine and detonates it. With
blast-protected mines, you've got to put an explosive charge
directly over the mine and blow it."

There are two different kinds of mines: Anti-personnel and
anti-vehicle. Each has 20 different derivatives. The mines causing
most of the world's problems today are anti-personnel mines,
according to Barrett. "When undergrowth regrows it makes it
extremely difficult to get to them and deal with them," he said.
"The biggest problem with anti-personnel mines is because they were
indiscriminately laid on unmarked mine fields. They were designed
to affect the population as well as the forces that were fighting."

Barrett doesn't wear any protective gear when doing land mine
clearance - just khakis and a button-down shirt - and doesn't
consider himself a risk-taker. "I'm a bit adventurous is about
all," he said. As a colonel in both the Rhodesian and South African
armies, Barrett always regarded mines "as a double-edged sword...
In Rhodesia, we were forced to put up a cordon sanitaire [a
screened off area] which included mines. We used mines sparingly
elsewhere but we did use them against our enemy [the guerrilla
army]." Does Barrett feel differently about mines today? "Land
mines will always be a double-edged sword," he said. "They're as
bad for the user as they are for the enemy they're supposed to
deter."

The US government has led the way in trying to get modern mines to
have mechanical or electronic means of being deactivated, or to
destroy themselves after a limited period of time to prevent this
debacle in the future. A large portion of NATO has joined a
moratorium on the sale and export of mines, but it is not worldwide
yet. Indeed, the US has not agreed to completely cease mine use,
citing its involvement on the Korean peninsula.

Over the past 20 years land mines have killed more civilians than
military personnel, and at one point in Cambodia they were killing
600 people a month.

The high toll mines take on civilians was one of the reasons
Barrett moved into mine clearance. "It was an area I knew
intimately and it gave me enormous satisfaction to be able to try
to remove a serious menace. To be able to help civilian populations
was something I thought should be done. I believe sincerely that
unless countries, and they're mainly in the Third World, rid
themselves of mines, they will never get off financial aid. The
wealthy countries in the world cannot continue feeding them
financial aid and it's an essential element for those countries to
get back on their feet, get their own economy, their own
agriculture re-established. Without clearing mines, you're not
going to do that."

Unless he steps on a land mine himself, Barrett will not be out of
a job any time soon. The US State Department estimates that there
are 85 million mines in the ground in 68 countries and that nearly
3,000 people are killed by unexploded land mines each year.

While he enjoys cleaning mines, what he really likes, he said, is
"playing golf".

Isn't golf a little tame compared to the rest of his life? "You're
playing against yourself, so it's not tame," he said. "And you've
got to control your own temper and frustration." He laughed.
"That's why golf is so good. It teaches you to do that."

US, Taiwan take stock of the future

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1

by Gene Koprowski

The United States and Taiwan may be nearing a futures market war as
officials in both countries approach a point-of-no-return in a
long-running dispute.

Taiwanese stock market officials have rejected an offer from the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) that would have ended the growing
controversy over the CME's proposed futures contract based on the
Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) index.

Accordingly, trading of the instrument may commence "before the end
of the year", executives at the CME said in a document obtained by
Asia Times.

Industry insiders said Taiex and Taiwan's Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) would prefer to pass a futures regulation law for
the country, and have their own futures market up and running,
before they started working with the CME - the world's largest
financial futures exchange.

The rejection of the offer to share market data and delay the
launch of the contract came in a letter from Taiex dated October 11
and delivered to CME chairman Jack Sander and president Bill
Brodsky only last week.

Shau-Dai Lin, who heads Taiex, expressed "continued concerns" about
the CME's plans to begin offering the futures, fearing they would
increase the volatility of the Taipei market, the sixth largest
stock market in the world. Taiex also sent the letter about CME to
the US futures regulatory authority, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC), headed by Brooksley Born. CME officials said
they expected a similar letter to be delivered by the Taiwan SEC
very shortly.

The letter followed a visit in late September by Daung-Yen Lu,
chairman of the Taiwan SEC, H W Chien, chairman of the Taipei
Securities Dealers Association, and officials from Taiex who flew
to Chicago to ask the CME to postpone the launch of the futures
contract for a year.

Sander and Brodsky tried to address the concerns one week later in
a memorandum to all the parties, which indicated that futures would
not increase volatility on the Taipei market. Sander and Brodsky
also said that they were quite willing to delay the launch of the
contract until the middle of January 1997 - not until next October,
as the Taiwanese wished - but only if Taipei would share data on
trends in the market on demand with CME.

"The only written response we've gotten is from the Taiwan Stock
Exchange, and it doesn't look like they're going to cooperate with
an information-sharing agreement," said Ellen Resnick, a
spokeswoman for the Chicago bourse.

"They expressed continued concerns. They did say that they
recognized the importance of an information-sharing agreement, but
it was worded in such a way that it did not seem like it was
something they wanted to do. We expect to receive a letter from the
[Taiwan] SEC as well. That's where things stand," she said.

Sander and Brodsky last Friday sent a reply to the Taiwanese
indicating that if the proposal to share information was not
accepted by the government, the CME would launch the contract as
early as the end of the year.

"If our latest proposal is not accepted by the Taiwan SEC, we are
prepared to launch these contracts upon approval of US
authorities," Sander and Brodsky wrote in a letter dated October
18, obtained by Asia Times. "As far as the CME's application for
the contracts is concerned, the CFTC public comment period ended on
October 10. The comment letters were overwhelmingly in favor of the
CME's application. We expect the US authorities to make a decision
regarding our application within the next two months."

Late last week, another bourse in the US, the Pacific Stock
Exchange (PSE) - a regional market in San Francisco - announced
that it too was considering launching its own options, based on the
Taiex, with or without Taiwanese partners, officials said.

"When we launched the Mexican Stock Exchange index, we launched
futures and the Chicago Board of Trade launched options. The
Pacific Stock Exchange deal is similar in that way. We see this as
a positive thing," Resnick said. "They did talk to us ahead of
time."

The futures and options contract would be derived from the Dow
Jones Taiwan Stock Index, a capitalization weighted, broad-based
index of 113 Taiwanese stocks, representing more than 80 percent of
Taiwan's market capitalization.

Last year, Taiwan traded 267 billion shares and handled more trades
than the New York Stock Exchange.

CME officials earlier this month held a meeting in Taipei with 300
futures and securities industry representatives who indicated they
were interested in working with the Chicago bourse.

The PSE had also been courting Taiwanese securities industry
representatives, and the PSE "plans to work closely" with Taiex
officials, Robert Greber, chairman and chief executive officer of
the PSE, said. "By trading options on the index now, we'll generate
additional interest and credibility for the Taiwan market," Greber
said. "We'll also offer the Taiwanese financial community the
opportunity to gain invaluable experience before the market opens."

Themes from the heart

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 10

by Priya Tuli, for Asia Times

Take a balmy Jakarta evening, the haunting strains of the sitar,
air fragrance mingling with incense and you have October 10 - the
opening night of an exhibition of paintings by Parvathi Nayar
Narayan at the Koi Gallery. Titled The Art of a Woman, this was the
Indian-born artist's debut show in Jakarta since moving to
Indonesia a year ago.

Represented at the exhibition were three distinctly different
styles, providing an insight into the varied scope and range of
Parvathi's work. The majority contained her experimental trademark
in mixed media - an exuberance of color and technique. These large
expanses of expressive form and color are executed in ink, dye and
acrylic, and employ a combination of techniques - pouring and
texturing to produce visual images that are complex and
multilayered.

Most of these depict Rajasthani women from northwest India. They
walk tall and stand proud; their beauty transcends mere features
and form, and is evident in every step and every gesture. These are
women who brave the fierce desert heat and walk kilometers each day
to the nearest water source. These are women who raise children and
work just as hard as their menfolk. And these are women who dance
with abandon at festival time in a spontaneous celebration of life.

In a defiant response to the brazen desert sun and the drab desert
sands, the clothes they wear are vibrant and blazing yellows,
brilliant reds, dazzling greens and deep blues - sheer inspiration
for an artist. "The colors I've used are vivid, but never primary.
You'll notice they have greater depth and variation than primaries.
That's because I never use a color in its pure form. These are
colors I'm comfortable with right now."

Part of the same group in terms of technique, the series titled
Woman and her Emotions focuses on one dominant color to establish
and enhance the depth of each emotion.

"It's true that color has emotional connections. Woman in Pain just
had to be in blue. I didn't even think about it, it just came so
spontaneously. Amusement is in green - a young, frivolous, bright
green. If I had done one on jealousy, it would have been green too,
but a darker, heavier green.

Lust had to be earthy brown, with hints of yellow and blue... You
know, this series was completed in one continuous, intensely
creative spurt that lasted around three or four months. I didn't
feel that I had come to the end of the series then. But for now, I
do. I might get back to it at a later stage. The strange thing is
that everybody thought they'd be slow to sell, but six of the seven
have gone already. That just tells me to go on painting from the
heart."

The next series contained black-and-white, pen-and-ink drawings,
where the faces of the women are left blank. This is an interesting
device that draws upon the viewer to interpret the women's
personalities subjectively. The last style on view was the more
academic use of oils. One painting was, Noon Watch, in which a
little girl rocks the makeshift crib where her younger sibling
sleeps - a common sight in India.

As an artist who rejoices in exploring and experimenting,
Parvathi's involvement with technique and texture is amply evident
in the content of this exhibition. As she pointed out: "I spend
more time looking at a painting than actually doing it. I look for
the rhythms, identify what I need to pull out and develop - what I
need to suppress. I guess that's where the skill counts, in
deciding.

"The effects I get are sometimes planned, sometimes accidental. But
I use the accidents as part of the process, so that carefully
planned areas combine with the unplanned." That, in a nutshell, is
really what art is all about to Parvathi, a celebration of "being,
exploring and becoming". Well traveled, she has lived and painted
in India, London and Singapore. But while her addresses might
change, Parvathi's distinctive styles simply evolve as this
exhibition clearly demonstrates.

The Art of a Woman exhibition at the the Koi Gallery in Jakarta
runs until November 4, 1996.

In Japan, if you build it they will vote for you

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 9

by Bradley Martin

There is one message Japan's voters sent loud and clear in Sunday's
election: "Rev up the concrete mixers!"

The pork barrel is the heart and soul of the politics that the
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Sunday's big winner, practises in
election districts across the land.

Critics may complain the result is the rapid despoliation of what
was once a lovely countryside, as politicians and bureaucrats
devise ever more useless projects with which they can return to
local communities some of the taxpayers' money filtered, of course,
through construction companies, their suppliers and employees.

Or foreign environmentalists may ad-vise that the concrete
embankments being installed on once-scenic riverbanks, for example,
will only have to be removed as the predictably dire effects of
this destruction of nature become evident. Do voters care? App-
arently not. With depressing ease, they are swayed to ignore the
wider public interest and cast their ballots for the force they see
as most likely to keep the public works pipeline full. That usually
is the LDP.

Take Shimane prefecture's first district. More than three decades
ago, the Agriculture Ministry began planning a massive project to
fill in big parts of a large, beautiful lagoon, called Nakaumi,
adjoining the Japan Sea coast. The reason: To provide additional
farmland for the crowded country.

It was not long before the government, to deal with excess rice
production, started paying farmers to stop farming existing
farmland. At that point, naturally the project was dropped, right?
Wrong. The Nakaumi project has proved to have a life of its own.
The prefectural governor ardently supports its continuation, and so
does Hiroyuki Hosoda, a politician who ran on the LDP ticket to
represent the district in the Lower House.

The national and Shimane prefecture governments each year split the
cost of some yen220 billion (US$1.96 billion) worth of public works
projects. That makes the pork barrel a very major element in the
local economy. A construction company owner told Asahi Shimbun
before the election he expected a 40 percent loss in earnings if a
non-LDP government should come to power. Hosoda faced nominees of
the newly-formed Democratic Party and the Communist Party. Both
opposed the Nakaumi project, making it the big local issue in the
race. But all the votes cast for those two other candidates put
together did not equal the tally for the LDP man, who was handily
elected.

The people spoke on Nakaumi, and what they said was: "Fill it in."

To some extent this represents official and popular trust in the
Keynesian notion that a "supplementary budget" of public works
funds - such as the proposed yen5 trillion package the LDP
announced just before election day - can prime the pump and bring
the economy out of a slump. But some economists say this remedy has
proved less effective, to the point where any resulting positive
bounce in the economy is over almost as soon as it has begun.

The ill effects live on - notably an ever larger budget deficit for
succeeding generations to shoulder. Deregulation and cutting
budgets and taxes to leave more money in the hands of consumers
would have far more positive effects.

There are plenty more districts like Shimane's first district,
where the LDP's construction mania carried the day with voters on
Sunday. For example, construction companies squarely backed the
LDP's candidate in Saitama prefecture's 10th, a mixed
bedroom-suburban and rural district that was the focus of an Asia
Times front-page article last Friday. The LDP man squashed the
candidate of the newly-formed Democratic Party.

In Toyama prefecture, the emcee at Tamisuke Watanuki's victory
celebration, before leading three cheers of "Banzai" (long life),
enthused that the victory of the former LDP secretary-general meant
the central government would now give serious thought to building
the Hokuriku bullet train line. The area's pet scheme would be a
dreadfully expensive project whose costs, under the current
share-the-misery policy, would force an increase in fares on
profitable bullet-train routes like Tokyo-Osaka.

Construction's domination of politics could be seen in the raw in
Ibaraki prefecture, where former construction minister Kishiro
Nakamura, awaiting a court ruling on a suspected yen10 million
bribe to put the quietus on a Fair Trade Commission investigation
of construction industry collusion, was re-elected. Nakamura had
formally left the LDP after the allegation came to light, and was
running as an independent. He told voters he had accepted the money
but it had been merely a campaign contribution. He boasted his
presence in office provided an important conduit from the central
government to the district.

At first glance, Kumamoto prefecture's second district may appear
to be an exception to the general rule. There, a loudly
pro-construction LDP candidate - a former Construction Ministry
bureaucrat who vowed to snare central government funds for such
expensive projects as a bullet-train line - went down to defeat at
the hands of a candidate who had attacked that traditional sort of
pork-barrel campaigning. So, were the Kumamoto voters finally
wising up? Guess again. The winning candidate himself had served a
stint as construction minister. And in his brochure, where he
attacked the pork barrel, he also included photos of a bridge, a
train station and other public works projects he took credit for
having landed.

All the parties in the election were talking about "administrative
reform" and about cutting the bureaucracy down to size. Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashi-moto, president of the LDP, even told voters
he knew his place in history would be determined by his success or
failure in carrying out such reforms.

But don't bet the farm that an LDP-led coalition government will
seriously disrupt the comfortable partnership of bureaucrats with
the construction companies and the LDP lawmakers of the
"construction tribe", who protect the ministries' public works
programs in exchange for political funds and get-out-the-vote
backing.

US public responds to Clinton-Riady scandal with a yawn

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 9

by Doug Tsuruoka

With two weeks to go before the United States presidential
election, conservative critics are hoping that a disclosure of
financial donations made to the White House by a prominent
Indonesian family and South Korean business interests will throw a
last-minute glitch into US President Bill Clinton's re-election
campaign.

Yet one puzzling question in the wake of a decision by the
Democratic National Committee (DNC) to suspend a top Asian-American
aide pending a probe of his fund-raising activities with Asian
businessmen is why the issue, so far, has generated only mild
public attention in the 1996 US presidential race. In past
campaigns, the taint of "foreign money" would have been enough to
derail the aspirations of any candidate for the Oval Office.

Many recall the press fallout on then-president Jimmy Carter when
it was divulged in the late 1970s that his brother, Billy, had
close ties with Libyan diplomats and businessmen. But despite the
best efforts of leading US newspapers like the New York Times and
the Los Angeles Times, the Riady scandal is drawing only muted
outrage from a bored US electorate.

The DNC, the national organization of the Democratic Party which is
backing Clinton's re-election bid, announced last week that John
Huang, a vice-chairman of its fund-raising arm, will step aside
following reports that he sought an illegal US$250,000 political
contribution for the Clinton campaign from a South Korean
industrial conglomerate. The contribution - from the South Korean
electronics company, Cheong Am - was returned after it was
uncovered by a local newspaper.

Huang, a former employee of the Riadys and a Democratic fund-raiser
in the key electoral state of California, is also under the
spotlight for his ties to the Riadys - a family of Indonesian
industrialists who control the Lippo Group of companies and who
made a series of apparently legal campaign contributions to Clinton
during his 1992 and 1996 presidential campaigns. Huang is also said
to have secured a top appointment to the US Commerce Department
because of his relationship with the Riadys and US Democrats.

The donations by the Riadys and suggestions of favoritism by the
White House emerged against the backdrop of Clinton's efforts to
arrange a billion-dollar sale of US F-16 fighter jets to Indonesia,
a red-carpet reception for Indonesia's President Suharto in
Washington last year and reports the Riadys once tried to enter the
banking industry in Clinton's home state of Arkansas.

But US voters are so apathetic to the issue of foreign money in
this year's election that not one of the "typical" Americans
selected to question Clinton and his Republican opponent Robert
Dole at a presidential debate in California on October 16 bothered
to bring it up.

Participants were so indifferent, in fact, that Dole, frustrated at
the lack of focus on foreign policy matters at the debate last
week, was forced to volunteer a pointed reference to "rich people"
in Indonesia and other foreign countries in a jibe at Clinton's
campaign ethics - though the question posed had nothing to do with
the Riadys or their alleged influence at the White House.

Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich vowed to open a
Congressional inquiry into the affair - which is laced with reports
that James Riady, a scion of the Indonesian family, used his
financing clout with the Democrats to arrange a special audience
with Clinton while the president was attending a meeting of top
Southeast Asian leaders in Jakarta in late 1995.

But most Democratic and Republican analysts in Washington have
already concluded the scandal will not do irreparable harm to
Clinton's re-election bid. White House aides, moreover, appear to
have parried the bad publicity by insisting that all contributions
from the Riadys were "legal".

How to explain this absence of interest on the part of the US
electorate? There are three factors which appear to have
contributed to the scandal's non-effect on Clinton.

The first is simply that the flap over the Riadys pales before a
host of other scandals which have hit the White House over the last
four years.

With the president and First Lady Hillary Clinton still under
scrutiny in the so-called Whitewater banking and influence scandal
and its possible link to the still-mysterious suicide of a White
House counsel - the Indonesian-South Korean donations are hardly
the stuff which tabloid headlines are made of.

The Riady affair hardly compares in entertainment value to the
confessions of alleged Clinton mistress Gennifer Flowers in the
1992 presidential race and this year's far juicier reports that top
Clinton tactician Dick Morris, the architect of the president's
"family values" campaign pitch, allowed a call girl to listen from
a hotel room to his telephone conversations with the president.

A second factor is the Riady affair is not the first time big Asian
money has been involved in a Washington influence-peddling scheme.

Interestingly, the Riadys appear to have offended far fewer
Americans in the economic growth-obsessed US of the 1990s than was
the case nearly 20 years ago.

In January 1978, a Washington-based South Korean lobbyist, Park
Tong-sun, admitted in Seoul that he had dispensed US$850,000 to a
number of US Congressmen in an affair laced with allegations of
sexual favors which came to be known as the Koreagate scandal.

Former California congressman Rich-ard T Hanna was sentenced to a
prison term for his role in the scandal, while five other house
Democrats were reprimanded in the influence-peddling scheme which
was intended to tilt US politicians in favor of Seoul following an
abrupt US pullout from South Vietnam.

The Koreagate affair stirred anti-foreign sentiment in the US at a
time when the media was rife with reports of Saudi Arabian
businessmen buying up US properties.

But a change seems to have taken place in the US mentality in the
last two decades. A seemingly endless eruption of successor
scandals to the famed Watergate scandal of the early 1970s has
imbued most US voters with a sense of cynical worldliness.

Coupled with the globalization of the US economy since the 1980s
and a renewed search for overseas profits following the recent US
recession, news that a US president cultivated allies and received
legal donations from a Southeast Asian country where the US is
seeking to sell high-tech fighter planes, leaves most Americans
yawning. The Riady affair just does not sound so bad at a time when
the fate of many US firms depends on markets like China and the US
Commerce Department scours the globe searching for contracts for US
companies.

The third factor tempering US political reaction to the Riady
scandal is the rising clout of the Asian-American community.

Whereas two decades ago, Asian-Americans were still viewed as an
invisible minority in US elections, this is no longer the case.
Surging birth rates, disposable incomes, voter registration levels
and improved political organization have made Asian-Americans a
force to be reckoned with on the US political scene - as
illustrated by Huang's elevation to the key Democratic fund-raising
post.

Dole and other Republican critics of the Riady affair have also
meticulously avoided alluding to the scandal in ethnic terms
fearful of alienating potent Asian-American constituencies in
California - a state which Dole must wrest from Clinton if he is to
have any chance of winning the White House in November.

Said Kim Young-kun, a professor of political science at the
Graduate School of the City University of New York: "They cannot
make blanket attacks on Asians anymore with impunity."

Another reason is that the issue of campaign contributions from
foreign sources is a Pandora's box for more than a few Republicans.

"The New York Times pointed out that the Republicans have been
getting money from many foreign companies," Kim noted.

Democratic spokesmen, on the other hand, have played on the
sentiment of minority voters in the US by explaining James Riady's
ties to the Democrats in terms of his interest in civil rights as
a member of Indonesia's ethnic-Chinese minority.

With Asian-Americans assuming a critical role as swing voters in a
fragmented US electorate, it may well be that both Dole and Clinton
want to avoid biting the hand which holds crucial votes in this and
future elections.

According to US analysts, a number of key swing states in the
upcoming presidential election already have sizable numbers of
potential Asian-American voters.

There are 600,000 Asian-Americans in Texas and another 200,000 in
Florida. Asian-Americans also constitute at least one-tenth of the
overall population of California and are growing in numbers in
states like New York, Massachusetts and Illinois.

Julian Weiss, a spokesman for the non-partisan Heritage Foundation
in Washington, said: "In the aftermath of this election, there will
be a far more vigorous attempt by both major parties to mobilize
the Asian-American vote."

Peace prizes and troublemakers

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

On Sunday, Philippine President Fidel Ramos ordered the country's
Bureau of Immigration and Deportation to ban the entry of
individuals suspected of wishing to disrupt the APEC Summit,
scheduled to be held in Manila next month.

Although no direct reference was made, it was believed that the
president's directive included the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize awardee
Jose Ramos Horta. Horta was invited to participate in an
alternative APEC meeting to be held by human rights activists in
the country.

The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs has also been ordered
not to issue a visa to anyone who might embarrass the Philippines
as APEC host.

On Monday, Indonesia welcomed Ramos' announcement, saying it would
contribute to the successful outcome of the APEC Summit.

A spokesman said Jakarta did not want any elements of the summit
which might create an embarrassment for the Philippine government.

China hopes to clear the theater

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

In an address to the 51st session of the United Nations General
Assembly last Friday, Chinese Disarmament ambassador Sha Zukang
urged countries concerned to cease immediately the research,
development and deployment of Theater Missile Defense systems
(TMD).

Sha gave two reasons for such an appeal. First, "The so-called TMD
which certain countries are going all-out to develop will in fact
possess the capacity to intercept strategic missiles, thus breaking
the limits imposed by the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and
rendering the treaty virtually meaningless", he said.

The second reason is that the TMD will lead to the proliferation of
advanced missile systems and the related technologies, thus posing
a threat to regional and even global security and stability.

"In a word, there is nothing to gain but everything to lose from
the development of the TMD system," he said.

TMDs in the region are mainly being produced by the United States
for use by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

What if we threw a party?

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

It was supposed to be a gala party. On the occasion of the fifth
anniversary of the Paris Peace Accords, which technically ended the
country's civil war, the Cambodian government hoped to attract
ministers or senior officials from all 19 of the accords'
signatories to a massive celebration outside the royal palace.

The festivities, which were to be held on Wednesday in Phnom Penh,
were likely intended to confirm the legitimacy of the government
that arose from the 1993 United Nations-sponsored elections, head-
ed by royalist First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, who had led the Vietnamese-backed
Phnom Penh government at the time of the signing.

But alas, it was not to be. For some reason, nobody seems to be all
that interested in Cambodia these days. Of the signatories, only
Malaysia and Laos are sending ministers to the celebration. Six
other countries are offering lower-ranking or retired officials.
The other countries are content to be represented by their
ambassadors to Phnom Penh or not at all.

The United Nations, which presided over the Cambodian elections in
a high-profile mission led by Japan, does not seem particularly
prepared to crow to the world about its success. The organization
will have a presence at the celebrations, but only in the form of
its special representative in Cambodia.

King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia was originally slated to preside
over the festivities, but because of the disappointing turnout, he
has apparently decided to defer that responsibility to the
country's parliamentary chairman, Chea Sim, who usually acts as the
king's regent in his absence from Cambodia.

Japan's father and son acts

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

Rare is the Japanese politician who does not want to build a
dynasty. It has been commonplace for sons of lawmakers to inherit
their fathers' support organizations and as a result, in many
cases, their seats in the parliament. (Where no adult sons are
available, wives are the next choice.)

One dramatic example occurred during the recent campaign in Kobe,
where former health and welfare minister Saburo Toida died just one
week before the election - but five days after he had filed as a
candidate. His son Tooru was chosen as the Liberal Democratic Party
candidate, and went on to win against a strong campaigner from the
opposition Shinshin-to.

But in a macabre twist, the late minister's promotional video,
which he had recorded before his death, was repeatedly broadcast
over NHK Television during the campaign. The reason: Official
campaign regulations prohibit the substitution of a candidate's
film footage after his party has submitted it to the authorities.
All NHK could do was attach an announcement that the senior Toida
had died.

Hard time for ex-bureaucrats

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

Only 14 out of the 41 first-time candidates in this past Sunday's
Japanese parliamentary elections who were formerly bureaucrats
could claim the right to put the much-coveted gold pins on their
jackets when the votes were tallied.

Only one out of eight ex-Finance Ministry officials running for the
first time won in this year's race and no former Health and Welfare
Ministry worker was able to succeed in a maiden campaign.

In a general campaign atmosphere of bureaucrat-bashing, with most
parties pledging to make administrative reform an important
priority, many such candidates were unable to take full advantage
of their illustrious career backgrounds in drumming up support,
even from related private sector organizations, according to Nihon
Keizai Shimbun.

In the past few years, it had become a pattern for at least 60
percent of such ex-bureaucrat candidates to win their debut races.
This year's reversals can be directly traced to the various
recently-unveiled scandals involving a number of previously
sacrosanct government ministries.

The Finance Ministry's solid reputation has been shattered by last
year's financial scandals - specifically the collapse of the seven
jusen housing loan companies and the coverup of US$1.1 billion in
losses resulting from improper bond deals by a Daiwa Bank trader in
New York.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health and Welfare has come under harsh
criticism for allegedly approving the sale of blood products that
ministry officials knew might be contaminated with HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS.

It's time for Britain to rethink its military trade-offs in Asia

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

by Damon Bristow, for Asia Times

Behind the pomp and circumstance of British monarch Queen Elizabeth
II's visit to Thailand at the end of this month is a more
down-to-earth business proposition.

The centerpiece of her stay will be a banquet to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the accession to the throne by His Majesty King
Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand. And Prince Philip will also become
the first senior member of the British royal family to go to the
site of the infamous "death railway", where 13,000 prisoners of
war, many of them British and Commonwealth citizens, were interned
by the Japanese during World War II.

Behind the scenes, however, the British royals will also be working
hard to promote British trade relations with Thailand. For a start,
the queen will attend a lunch at the Bank of Thailand. After that
she will visit a major exhibition on commercial links between
Britain and Thailand.

The queen's newfound role as roving ambassador for "United Kingdom
plc" is indicative of the broader change that has occurred in
relations between the United Kingdom and Asia since she last
visited Thailand way back in 1972. At that time, Britain had
effectively withdrawn from the region.

And although the country retained political, economic and military
ties with the region - largely through the Commonwealth - these
were pretty much symbolic.

It's obviously a very different story today. After 25 years of
average economic growth across the region topping six percent a
year, a somewhat previously dormant Europe has finally woken up to
Asia.

In the meantime, many Asian countries are starting to make their
voices heard in the international arena, particularly in the United
Nations and the World Trade Organization.

Add to that the sprouting of regional political and economic
architecture in the years since the end of the Cold War: The ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF), which looks at security matters, and its
trade-related sidekick, the Asia- Pacific Economic Co-operation
(APEC) forum.

Britain has not been able to ignore these developments. In an
acknowledgement of this fact, British Prime Minister John Major
announced in 1994 that every effort would be made to reinvigorate
the country's long-standing relations with the region.

This year a stream of senior British politicians have been doing
the rounds in Asia, talking about trade, politics and security
ties.

British exports to the Asia-Pacific region, as a percentage of
those outside Europe rose from 11.7 percent in 1991 to a little
over 25 percent in 1993. The following year they increased by over
27 percent to a little over &pound;14 billion (US$22.3 billion).
Britain is also the largest European Union investor in the region.
The economic benefits, however, have not only been one way: 41
percent of all Japanese and 47 percent of all South Korean
investments in Europe are in the United Kingdom.

Britain has also moved to underpin this growing economic
relationship by improving political ties. At an institutional
level, for example, every effort is being made to exploit links
with its partners in the Commonwealth and its membership of the EU,
which has had relations with the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations since the 1970s.

Bilateral relations, too, have been strengthened. To its credit,
London has been successful in building links with all the most
influential countries in Asia. Group of Seven member Japan has been
the major recipient of Britain's attentions.

The relationship with Tokyo is now so strong that last month,
British Foreign Secretary Malcom Rifkind visited Japan and signed
a groundbreaking Action Agenda for a Special Partnership with his
Japanese counterparts.

The document committed both countries to unprecedented levels of
cooperation in world affairs, economic issues and in fostering
closer links between the UK and Europe.

Relations with South Korea are progressing down a similar track.
And, as the deadline for the handover of Hong Kong approaches, ties
with China have also improved markedly, even though Britain has
made clear its intention to stand up for the territory for a
further 50 years after that.

And although the British government doesn't like to flaunt it,
relations with Indonesia are also pretty close.

With the Hong Kong withdrawal just around the corner, Britain has
stepped up its efforts to convince its partners in the region that
the British armed forces will continue to take an active interest
in Asia's security - unlike its competitors in the EU, Britain has
security links with the region through the Five Power Defense
Arrangement (FPDA), which brings Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand,
Singapore and the United Kingdom together for exercises twice a
year. The country also has historical links due to its
participation in the Korean War.

Recently, British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo announced that
the biggest task force to leave the United Kingdom since the
Falklands War would take part in an upgraded FPDA exercise off the
coast of Malaysia in April next year with the Aircraft carrier
Illustrious at its head. This was followed by a speech in Australia
during which Portillo expressed his belief that

the UK should be made a member of ARF independent of the EU.

Furthermore, when South Korean President Kim Young-sam was in
London, Britain made clear its support of the 1994 October
Declaration between the United States and North Korea, which was
designed to freeze Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. It even
agreed to contribute money to the Korean Peninsula Economic
Development Organization (KEDO) and provided the North with
&pound;150,000 in disaster aid after last year's devastating
floods.

Britain usually justifies its desire to continue playing a security
role in Asia by referring to the fact that the country has large
investments and "long-standing ties" in the region.

In a slightly more roundabout way, it is hoped that showing the
flag might also help the United Kingdom to carve out a larger piece
of Asia's growing markets. The question of whether or not Britain
actually has the ability to deal with a crisis in Asia - say in the
South China Sea or the Korean peninsula - is, however, a moot
point.

According to current British military thinking, after Hong Kong
reverts back to Chinese sovereignty, any military emergency in the
region would be met by the using of the newly-established Joint
Rapid Deployment Force (JRDF), which is specifically designed to
deal with distant regional contingencies. At the core of this force
will be the 3 Commando and 5 Airborne brigades. They, in turn,
would be able to draw on resources from the rest of the armed
forces if required.

The problem is that the British Armed Services are stretched to the
limit at the moment. The total strength of the military has been
reduced steadily from 292,000 in 1992/93, to 250,000 last year. On
top of this, existing commitments mean that Britain has around
17,000 troops in Northern Ireland and just short of 10,500 in
Bosnia. That's not to mention long-standing commitments to security
in the Gulf.

Bearing in mind these constraints, the physical distance between
Asia and the UK and the cost of sending and sustaining a force a
long way from British shores, the chances are that Britain would
not only find it pretty difficult to send a few navy vessels to
patrol the South China Sea, let alone commit ground troops to a
major conflict on the Korean peninsula, but would think twice
before it made such a commitment. Even if they did get there, at
current levels, the chances are any force would be little more than
symbolic.

To the current generation of policy makers in the region that does
not seem to matter: For them, the country's continued security
commitment to the region is essential to justify its position as a
major power with an international reach and global interests as
well as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

That's fine in the short term. In the next few years, however,
Britain will have to decide whether or not it makes sense to retain
its military commitment to the region, even in its current, anemic
form.

To this end, the country might do well to take a leaf out of the
book of its European partners, who have been almost as successful
in securing business in Asia and exercising their influence as
Britain has without making halfhearted commit-ments that they would
be hard pressed to keep. Perhaps the time has finally come for
Britain to follow them down the same route.

Japan: That empty feeling

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 8

A senior Japanese journalist posted a note to an Internet
discussion group on Monday which constituted the most poignant
commentary on Sunday's election and is worth summarizing.

He was watching the television election programs on Sunday night,
he wrote, and was struck by the historically low voter turnout. It
was beyond his comprehension, given that Japan in the past couple
of years had experienced everything unprecedented, from the near
collapse of its banking system to a major earthquake to a religious
cult's terrorist attack on the Tokyo subway.

The biggest question for him was not how the coalition was going to
be formed, but simply the voters' attitude, which he would not even
call apathy, as that still connoted the existence of individual
decision-making. They just don't care about anything, he suggested,
be it about Ijime in public school systems or about Rodong missiles
that North Korea was reportedly about to launch. How had Japan
gotten this empty, precisely as described in Yukio Mishima's often
cited predictions?

We don't know if the journalist wrote a similar commentary for his
own - one of Japan's biggest - newspapers. If he didn't, he should
have.

It is important not to misunderstand his reference to the novelist
Mishima, the man whose desperate nationalism drove him to publicly
disembowel himself with his samurai sword to rouse his nation. The
reference was surely not intended as an endorsement of Mishima's
eccentric existentialist nationalism. But as C P Snow once wrote,
"Mishima's characters are observed with the sharpest of eyes...
clear, eloquent, visual". His characterization of an "empty Japan"
had that same element of precision.

Just consider some of today's lead news stories out of Tokyo:

l A Japanese finance company filed for liquidation with massive
debt liabilities of more than US$8.8 billion, spurring worries
about the health of other finance companies. The liability figure
makes Nichiei Finance the largest such insolvency case in post-war
Japan.

l United States Central Intelligence Agency director John Deutch
has discussed with Japanese leaders North Korea's reported move to
test-launch the Rodong-1 missile. The missile has a target range of
1,000km, is capable of reaching Japan, and can be fitted with
nuclear or chemical warheads.

l The Japanese government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said its
index of economic indicators for August fell below the "boom or
bust" mark for the first time in five months.

l The Liberal Democratic Party said Japan's government would likely
be on hold for at least two weeks until a coalition is stitched
together.

How, in light of such acute and simmering problems, could more than
40 percent of Japanese voters have chosen to spend election day
with such favorite pastimes as autumn leaf viewing or watching a
baseball game, rather than participate in the election of a
political leadership capable of addressing the country's woes.

The unnamed journalist's commentary on his fellow Japanese's state
of mindlessness and his pessimism about the future appear
well-justified.

The Finance Ministry will now roll out the fire brigade and douse
the Nichiei problem, likely at the voters' - or non-voters' -
expense. Japan's Defense Agency chief told reporters he was closely
watching the Rodong test situation, but that none of the
information obtained was "solid". And whatever coalition ends up
being stitched together will likely respond to the bad economic
data with yet another supplementary pork-barrel budget.

On this last issue, one man not re-elected, outgoing EPA
director-general Shusei Tanaka, urged that Japan must press ahead
with economic reform and avoid the easy option of trying to spend
its way out of trouble. But as we said, he was defeated.

One last bit of news: After a year of intense lobbying against
rival India, Japan on Tuesday was given a nonpermanent seat at the
UN Security Council. One wonders what, if anything, the Japanese
representative filling that seat might have to say to the world.

Hyundai wins vote of confidence in Israel

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 7

by Yaroslav Trofimov

South Korea's Hyundai Group is poised to become a major supplier in
the Israeli telecommunications market in the wake of its US$12.5
million deal with the Jewish state's telephone monopoly Bezeq.

Bezeq, whose 1996 annual purchasing budget is roughly US$1 billion,
has ordered from Hyundai 130,000 kilometers of optic fiber for its
cable network modernization program.

The deal was finalized at a meeting between Bezeq's president Isaac
Kaul and Hyundai's manager of planning and electronics departments,
Park Hyeong-sun.

The Korean fiber, which is scheduled to be produced within two
weeks, will be tested on Bezeq's request by the US-based Bellcore
Corporation. Bezeq said that, should these tests be satisfactory,
the company will sign by late 1998 an additional contract for an
undisclosed sum that industry analysts estimated could reach over
US$100 million annually.

Currently, Bezeq buys most of its cable from two Israeli companies,
Cvalim and Kavlei Zion. Only about 15 percent of Bezeq supplies
come from foreign manufacturers, such as Alcatel, Motorola and
Northern Telecom. Hyundai is the first Asian company to make
significant sales to Bezeq.

After opening an office in Tel Aviv in 1994, the Korean giant
racked up more than US$100 million in sales last year to the Jewish
state. The bulk of these exports were Accent and Lantra passenger
cars.

Bezeq's spokesman, Roni Mandelbaum, explained that considerations
of both quality and price prompted his company to turn to Hyundai.
"We have no advantage buying outside of Israel if the product is
not better. Korea is a very long distance away, and if we decided
to go for it, this means that there is an advantage for us there,"
Mandelbaum said.

He added that Hyundai's optic fiber will be used for Bezeq
operations inside Israel and not in its foreign ventures, such as
the troubled Himachal Futuristic Communications Limited
(HFCL)-Bezeq consortium in India.

As Bezeq officials explained, the Hyundai deal is part of the
company's new overall strategy of searching for more cost-effective
suppliers in nontraditional markets, such as Asia.

In accordance with Israel's deregulation program, Bezeq is expected
to lose as early as next year its lucrative monopoly on
long-distance telephone services - which means that it has to
undergo immediate cost-cutting in order to survive the new
competition.

"In the framework of Bezeq's preparation to deal with the
competition, the company must become more efficient in all
sectors," said Kaul.

"One of the central items in company expenses is purchasing costs.
Bezeq will do everything possible to reduce purchasing costs and
tariffs while, of course, preserving the high standard of product
quality," Kaul added.

Several international consortiums, including one led by Korea
Telecom, are bidding for the two licences to run Israel's
alternative long-distance networks.

Asian investors buying into South American bread basket

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 6

by Andrea Mandel-Campbell

After years of neglect, Argentina's agricultural sector is
beginning to grow and Asian countries are among those setting their
sights on the South American country as a potential source of food
for their growing populations.

A handful of Asian countries have quietly begun making tentative
land purchases in Argentina's agriculturally rich interior,
according to Argentine government sources.

Since direct foreign investment is not officially registered in
Argentina it is almost impossible to track the investments, but
sources said Taiwanese investors had acquired farmland near the
capital of Buenos Aires while South Korean interests had chosen the
nearby province of Entre Rios to launch large-scale grain
production.

South Korean conglomerates, including the Daewoo Group and Hyundai
Group, were also taking a serious look at adding farming to their
Argentine investment portfolio, said South Korean sources.

But perhaps the greatest interest is coming from China, where
present direct investment in Argentina is estimated at only US$20
million. About 10 Chinese corporations, including grain
import-export concern Ceroil Foods, were looking at investment
between US$10 million and US$15 million each in farmland, said
Ernesto Fernandez Taboada, executive director of the Argentine
Chamber of Commerce for Southeast Asia.

The Chinese were studying Argentine agricultural regulations and
technology with the aim of harvesting and processing crops in
Argentina for later export to China, said Taboada. To date, they
have acquired "experimental" plots ranging from 300 to 600 hectares
in three provinces to grow grain and cotton Argentina's leading
exports to China along with vegetable and animal-based oils.

"China has decided to make investment in Latin America a priority.
The Chinese know that in the future Latin America is going to be
one of the great food providers while China is going to need a lot
more foodstuffs," said Taboada.

"The living standards of China's growing middle class are rising
every year and with that increase they want to eat more
sophisticated things and a greater variety of them. So the demand
for more and better food is continually increasing and that
obligates China to look outside its borders for reliable providers
of food, among which is Latin America."

The Chinese were also interested in agro-industry, with several
companies looking to establish grain processing plants and
vegetable oil plants, he said.

It is a move the Taiwanese, importers of Argentine grain, soya,
corn and cotton, have already made. Taipei's Winluck Industries,
owned by entrepreneur Sheng Hsiung Ho, is getting set to build a
second processing plant in Argentina for US$35 million that will
process corn, soya and peanuts. And the Chaintech Group recently
said it signed an accord with the Argentine province of Tucuman to
build a US$50 million fruit plant.

"A lot of Taiwanese see the potential of the food industry here and
a lot of people are looking for investment opportunities," said
Alfonso Yio-Yih Tao, director of the economic division of the
Taipei commercial and cultural office.

Grain and other foodstuffs are also high on the list of Argentina's
largest Asian trading partner, Japan. Also, Argentina's most
important Asian investor, the Japanese, who have so far focused on
car plants, are beginning to turn their attention to agriculture.

During the last meeting of the business-based Argentine-Japanese
Mixed Committee, the Japanese concluded that Argentina "was a
reliable provider of high-quality products, had become a
particularly attractive site for agricultural and agro-industry
investment, especially in view of Mercosur [Southern Common
Market]".

Being the largest grain supplier to Mercosur, the customs zone made
up of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, Argentina held a
major attraction as well for investment mogul George Soros.

In 1994 Soros' Quantum Industrial Partners bought a 40 percent
share in Cresud, a commodities producer based in Argentina.

Since then, Cresud has increased its holdings from 20,000 to
346,000 hectares of croplands and forests, and more than doubled
its livestock to become the country's leading commodities producer.

The influx of market capital and investment in technology has
helped trigger a rebirth of the long-neglected industry which has
suffered from years of over taxation and hyper-inflation.

"Last year Argentine GDP fell 4.4 percent whereas agriculture grew
more than nine percent - it's a sector in full expansion. We're
seeing 100 percent growth in all areas, from fertilizers and
irrigation systems to tractor sales," said Cresud director
Alejandro Elsztain.

"We had many bad years and for many years we have been behind, but
now we are beginning to see a turnaround. We are rediscovering what
we have."

And what Argentina has is a distinct comparative advantage,
according to Elsztain, when it comes to land. The country still
possesses vast tracts of undeveloped land at cheap prices, selling
for half to one-fifth the price of equivalent quality land in North
America and Europe. And with few countries in a position to
increase production levels as global consumption rises, Elsztain
predicts Argentina will once again become a leading global exporter
of grains and milk.

"Asia, along with Russia, are going to be the markets that will
make us into major exporters and will become very rich markets for
us," said Elsztain.

Innovation the key to sporting goods empire

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 6

by M Shankar

Jagdev Singh was distraught on the day he opened his first shop in
Singapore. By early afternoon, not a single thing had been sold.

"I was a dead man," he said.

Not quite. That store was the first of 218 outlets that, 17 years
later, sprawl across Southeast Asia and are part of a S$300 million
(US$210 million) sporting goods empire.

Singh, or J S Gill as he prefers to be called, introduced a number
of innovations to Singapore retailers, including the concept of
fixed pricing instead of bargaining individually with each
customer.

He reckons half of the sporting goods now sold on the island come
from his Royal Sporting House outlets.

The family-owned business of this 42-year-old, who dreamed as a boy
of owning a pair of Adidas shoes, is the exclusive distributor for
Reebok products in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines
and Brunei, and retails 27 other top-of-the-line brands, ranging
from Wilson and Spalding to Speedo and Lacoste.

The Indian entrepreneur left home at the age of 24, with plans to
become an engineer. His family did not approve.

"My father thought that I would come back," he said.

Indeed, Gill's career plans did not work out, and he fell back on
the only thing he knew well - sporting goods, in which he had
worked for his father.

But rather than return to the family business, he struck out on his
own.

He was aided early on by the reputation of his father, whose
Indonesia-based business bought sporting goods in Singapore.

Gill had no money to stock his first store, but wholesalers and
distributors who knew his father agreed to accept checks post-dated
by 30 days.

So he opened a checking account with S$100 and bought about
S$60,000 in sporting goods to stock his 30 square meter shop at
Lucky Plaza, on Singapore's fashionable Orchard Road.

"I had the best merchandise," said Gill. "The shop was beautifully
done. On November 23, 1979, I opened the business thinking I would
do the sales and deposit the money and the thing would start
rolling."

But by 1.00pm on the first day of business he had not sold a thing.

"I said: 'Bloody hell, I am dead now. What am I going to do? The
checks will not be honored'." He added: "Anyhow, when you are at
that stage, you've got nothing to lose. The guy can't hang you -
basically he would have taken back the goods."

At any rate, it was not a problem, the moribund morning was
followed by a robust afternoon with sales totaling S$3,500.

"That was my first day collection. I said to myself: 'Now, there is
no looking back'."

Over the next nine years he gradually expanded his business into 15
outlets.

"He spearheaded a lot of retail concepts that were new to the
industry [in Singapore], like fixed prices and visually-appealing
in-store merchandising," said Jeffrey Bose, president of Sing-
apore's Sports Goods Dealers Association and managing director of
Hwa Kay Thai, a regional group that licenses the Puma brand in
seven countries.

"That was groundbreaking. Today 75 percent of sports good retailers
sell on fixed price and a lot of people have a lot to thank Gill
for."

But big-time success came in 1988, when Gill was granted the
regional distributorship for Reebok.

Gill was up against such heavyweights as Britain's Inchcape,
Malaysia-based Sime Darby and others. But he was resolute. "I was
chasing them, especially during the big trade shows held every
year," Gill said.

He also had the dream, harking back to his childhood love for their
shoes, of acquiring the Adidas franchise.

Gill drew up a business plan in 1987. He made one copy for Adidas
and another for Reebok. He then went with a member of his staff to
Germany to attend the Ispo trade fair, near Munich.

He saw a long queue of people eager to meet Reebok executives.

"Reebok then was the hottest thing going. Adidas was a 50-year-old
company - stable but sliding down," said Gill.

When his turn came, Gill went into a room with the Reebok export
director.

"He saw my face, he said: 'Okay this is your plan? Fine, put it
here, we will contact you'. He took my plan, there was a big box,
and he just dumped it there," said Gill.

Next he visited Adidas.

Gill, who was already doing some business with the German-based
sporting goods maker, said the company gave him a patient hearing
and told him they were not happy with their franchise arrangements
in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Three months later, Adidas told Gill they would like to talk with
him further, at the upcoming trade fair in Atlanta, about a
proposal to grant him the distributorship for the region.

As about the same time the letter from Adidas arrived in Singapore,
so did Reebok president Joe Foster.

Royal Sporting House was already a key player in Singapore's
upscale sporting goods market. Walking through the city's retail
district, Foster was impressed with the displays and merchandise in
Gill's stores, and telephoned him.

"He was staying at the Raffles Hotel, I still remember. He called
me and I went running to see him," said Gill with a laugh.

Foster had not even seen the plan Gill had submitted at the Ispo
fair, but having seen his stores, he asked if Gill was interested
in becoming Reebok's distributor, and they agreed to discuss it
further in Atlanta.

Arriving in the United States, Gill met an Adidas representative in
Atlanta's Mariott Hotel the day before the trade show was to begin,
and was offered a distributorship.

Walking back across the street to his own room in the Hilton,
Adidas' letter of intent in hand, he ran into Reebok's president.

Foster told Gill he wanted to meet him the following morning. "
'But more or less I have made up my mind. We want to go with you',"
Gill recalled Foster saying.

"When I was putting the two plans [together], my staff member had
warned me: 'Mr Gill... what happens if both of them come back to
you?' I said: 'That will never be possible. We are so small, they
are giants'."

Back in Singapore with two letters of intent, Gill called for a
vote among his staff to decide which franchise to accept. They
voted for the more established company - Adidas.

But Gill's heart was in Reebok: "I said, this is hot, it will grow
and it will help us to grow faster."

Two months later, he was still in a quandary. Finally, he wrote the
names of the companies on two pieces of paper and told his
six-year-old daughter to pick one.

"I told her, whatever is your luck, let it be so. So she picked up;
it was Reebok. I said, okay we go with Reebok. That is a decision
made, and it was destiny."

And the business took off. Spreading across Southeast Asia, Royal
Sporting House now has 153 outlets outside Singapore, as well as
manufacturing facilities making swimwear and other sports apparel
in Banting in the Malaysian state of Selangor.

Two years ago, he launched his own footwear brand, Ogaan, in
Indonesia.

Along the way, Gill won the Singapore Enterprise of the Year Award
in 1993, the International Sports Retailer of the Year Award in
1994 and the Speciality Store of the Year Award in 1995.

Gill still does not have any partners or shareholders. He manages
the business with his wife and a team of professionals and never
involves himself in joint ventures in which he does not have a
controlling stake. Even in a sporting-good distribution joint
venture with Indonesia's multibillion dollar Gajahtunggal group, he
owns a majority stake.

"J S Gill has a general feel and gut instinct about the sporting
goods industry and his entrepreneurial instincts are very strong,"
said Bill Sweeney, vice-president for Reebok Inter- national.

Sweeney explained that there was no conflict in the fact that Gill
sells brands made by Reebok's competitors.

"There is a difference between a retail stockist and a distributor.
It is also a challenge for us [Reebok] to make our brand more
attractive vis-a-vis other brands displayed in a selling
environment.

Gill added: "I cannot distribute any other brand except Reebok, but
I can stock all the other brands, including Nike [Reebok's main
competitor], in my retail stores."

But Gill has also suffered setbacks. About seven years ago he
opened a specialty 12-outlet chain called Big Foot Little Foot,
selling fashionable and trendy footwear for Singaporeans and
Indonesians of all ages. It closed two years later.

"I think you have to take failure in life and move on," said Gill.

Indeed, in the past two years he has begun diversifying into the
fashion industry once again.

Other innovations may not be paying off now, but Gill said he was
taking a long-term view and did not cling to demands for immediate
commercial viability.

One such venture is his Golf House mobile workshop, which will
polish and repair golf clubs right on the golf course.

"One of his strengths is he is not afraid to try something new,"
said Sweeney. "And if a concept does not work, he is also quick to
take corrective action and address his mistakes. Like when he went
on a retail expansion spree in Singapore, he quickly realized that
he was making a mistake and refocused on smaller volumes but better
quality."

Bose of the Sports Goods Dealers Association added: "That he is not
afraid of trying does not go against him."

Gill plans to expand to other markets when the timing is right.

"I will be ready to go into India, when India takes off," he said,
though he said he thought China, with its many shopping malls, had
a better retail setup for the time being, adding that an offer was
on the table for him to start a joint venture there.

Although Gill's father, who died last March, had not approved of
him striking out on his own, he ultimately approved of his son's
undertakings.

"My father was very proud of me," said Gill. As for not supporting
him at first, he said: "I don't blame him... the world is changing
and I don't think my children will necessarily listen to me.

"Maybe the world was changing at that time, and my father was not
ready to accept that. I always wanted to be a free, young man and
independent, and do something on my own. It was not that it was the
reason to break up from the family, but it was the idea to do your
own thing."

He said he had enough of taking direction from others. "I went
through that. So, I told myself - get out!"

Another reason for his leaving home, he said, was that, at that
age, you have nothing to fear because you have nothing to lose.

As for the future, Bose said he saw competition on Gill's home turf
growing stronger.

"The closest competitor to Royal Sporting House would be World of
Sports, belonging to the Ossia Group, which started just four to
five years back but is one of the fastest growing companies," Bose
said.

Gill does not express concern, however. With a growing legion of
people in Asia interested in sports, he hopes his recipe of local
expertise and strong entrepreneurial skills will keep his cash
registers ringing.

US Fed explores scandal avoidance measures

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 5

by Gene Koprowski

United States officials are examining new measures aimed at
averting trading scandals such as the Daiwa Bank losses and the
collapse of Barings.

Failure to comply with the measures would result in institutions
facing censure through public disclosure - and corresponding
implications in credit ratings and raising capital - rather than
straightforward financial penalties.

Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago were finalizing
a study for December release which examined whether the Federal
Reserve should impose public disclosure requirements on banks that
traded derivatives and futures, government officials said.

The study was undertaken because of the Fed's concern that a
trading scandal, similar to the Barings and Daiwa Bank crises or
the Sumitomo copper losses, could undermine US financial markets.

As talks proceed, former copper trading king Yasuo Hamanaka was
arrested on Tuesday on charges that he forged documents to create
secret trading accounts. The arrest came after Sumitomo Corp filed
a legal complaint against Hamanaka, its former chief copper trader,
who it blamed for a US$2.6 billion loss from unauthorized copper
deals.

Douglas Evanoff, a senior economist and assistant vice-president at
the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said the completed report on
improving public disclosure would be discussed as the basis for
possible regulation with the other member banks of the Federal
Reserve System. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as
well as the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory
Practices - an organization of the world's central bankers - will
also be consulted.

The idea was first floated internally earlier this year at the Fed
by economists Paul Kubiak and Jim O'Brien in Washington. Staff at
the Chicago branch of the Fed, one of 12 regional banks in the
Federal Reserve System, picked up the idea and developed it
further.

By midyear they convinced Michael Moskow, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Chicago, to discuss the idea in a speech about
derivatives, and in subsequent remarks, Evanoff said.

"We think it is something that can influence their behavior when
institutions realize their name has been made public," he said.
"We're trying to develop the optimal penalty structure."

The central bankers, simultaneously, are eyeing a pilot program,
launched last month by the New York Clearing House Association -
the international organization of banks which clear trades in the
US. The program serves as an experiment with the idea of
disclosure.

Evanoff said the pilot program was starting to collect data, which
would be useful in determining the efficacy of the plan. The first
phase of the plan would run through the fourth quarter. "All of
this sounds great conceptually, but we want to see if the idea is
viable in implementation," he said. The pilot program was first
mentioned in June.

Moskow said: "Bank capital, and ultimately the Bank Insurance Fund,
is at risk if the value of a bank's trading book falls rapidly due
to a sudden change in market prices. Fears of a bank collapse
triggered by such changes have been exacerbated by the increased
use of derivatives.

"Consider the collapse of Barings last year, which was the result
of a high-stakes bet on the direction of Japanese stocks using
derivatives traded on the SIMEX [Singapore International Monetary
Exchange] and the Osaka exchange... If improperly used, derivatives
make it easier for an imprudent institution to damage itself, the
Bank Insurance Fund and the safety and soundness of the financial
services sector," he said.

Evanoff said the pilot program was helping the participants several
unnamed financial institutions - examine their present exposure to
risk from derivatives and just how much they should allocate to
cover that risk. Insiders said the first phase ran through this
quarter and it was likely to be extended for more than a year
beyond that.

What are the reporting requirements of the pilot program? According
to David Marshall, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Chicago, banks involved in the New York pilot program pre-commit to
a certain level of risk for each quarter of the year.

For example, if the bank thinks the worst loss it can have in
derivatives trading during the forthcoming quarter is US$10
million, it informs regulators of that risk level. Then, at the end
of the quarter, regulators and bank officials meet to determine how
well the bank met its projections.

During the pilot program, reporting would be done on a quarterly
basis. But reporting requirements had not been finalized, Marshall
said. "The frequency of the reporting has not been worked out yet.
Some regulators want daily reporting requirements. But that may be
too onerous for banks."

The risk-based capital requirements adopted by the Basel Committee
in 1989 did not apply to off-balance sheet items, or trading book
assets. However, off-balance sheet items present a potentially
substantial risk. In the Barings case, market prices of derivatives
moved rapidly and devastated the net worth of that bank. "Clearly
there should be capital charges made to protect the system as a
whole against declines in the value of these securities," Marshall
said.

Banks would use computer programs to determine their level of risk
based upon their outstanding level of securities. "This is known as
the internal models approach," Marshall said. "Basically, the
regulator asks the bank: 'How risky is your portfolio? You tell us,
using the best tools you have.' Basically, they give us a value of
risk number."

The idea is that regulators will let the banks tell them what is
the maximum loss their portfolio will take over a threemonth
period. "What is the worst they can do over three months? That's
what we would want to know," Marshall said. "Then they take that
dollar amount, say US$10 million. They pre-commit not to lose any
more than that amount. Make that their capital charge. They have to
have enough capital set aside so that capital completely absorbs
their loss.

"Then, if the loss from derivatives exceeds that pre-committed
loss, the disclosure penalty is put into place.

"They're simultaneously choosing the risk of their portfolio and
the capital to set aside against that risk. And if we set that
penalty function correctly, then we should get them to do that in
a way which meets safety and stability requirements of regulators
and risks to the bank insurance fund," Marshall said.

US regulators are currently limited in the actions they can take on
derivatives risks and they want to try out measures to mitigate the
risks for the US financial system. Immediately following Sumitomo's
announced loss in September, the Fed took steps to determine the
size and nature of US bank exposures to the trading company and to
the copper market.

Several banks had trading or financing transactions with Sumitomo
relating to its copper trading and were owed payments by Sumitomo
in connection with those transactions. In the future, the
government would like to regulate that kind of credit risk as well.

Evanoff said although the proposed disclosure requirements were not
going to be placed on trading companies themselves, public
disclosure of risks at banks which lend to them hopefully would
continue to strengthen their internal auditing and information
systems.

"The well-publicized losses at Barings, Daiwa, Sumitomo and others
have all derived from violations of fundamental, managerial
principles of control, such as those dealing with the recording of
all positions and the adequate separation of duties. Managements
must build and maintain adequate systems for controlling risks,
whether they operate bank or non-bank institutions," said Fed board
member Susan Phillips, in Congressional testimony three weeks ago.

Dmitrius Papadimitriou, executive director of the Jerome Levy
Economics Institute, a regulatory issues think tank in Ithaca, New
York, said the proposal provided a level of "transparency" that had
been sorely lacking in the derivatives world. "It actually
encourages banks to improve their risk-assessment and
risk-management technologies," he said.

"What's more, there is no need for the regulators to impose a model
of portfolio risk in setting regulatory capital." Regulators need
only to verify initially that the bank has an adequate
risk-management structure in place, to review the bank's
profit-and-loss information.

Another benefit was that the proposal did not impose a "top-down"
regulatory structure from the federal govern- ment, but a
market-oriented approach, he said.

Financing of commodity and derivatives deals is not a new activity
for US banks. They have been involved in financing commodity
activities through their agriculture lending programs directed at
the production and sale of agricultural products, both domestically
and abroad.

More than one-quarter of all US banks have farm loans in excess of
25 percent of their total loans.

Unlike the banks' more traditional functions, their trading of
commodity derivatives, such as copper, gold and silver, has
increased in recent years, largely for the same reasons trading
activities, in general, have grown - expanded international trade,
increased demand for hedging instruments and improved methods for
managing and controlling risk and advances in computerization and
communications technology.

What impact will the study on derivatives regulation likely have
when it is released in six weeks?

Evanoff believes "this is the best way to regulate, on an
incentive-compatible basis." Marshall said: "This is a radical
departure from the command-and-control regulation structure where
we say: Hold this amount of capital and that's it. Banks tell us
how much of a capital loss they can pre-commit to."

US$8.8 billion bubble bursts

from ASIA TIMES, October 23, 1996, p. 1

by Richard Hanson

More than half a decade after Japan's property market began to
collapse, the bubbles are still bursting.

But the latest collapse - that of Nichiei Finance under the weight
of yen1 trillion (US$8.8 billion) in debt - serves to illustrate a
huge gap in how Japan reacts to an ordinary bursting bubble and a
bubble with strong political interest involved.

Just about everyone in Japan knows the story of the liquidation
earlier this year of a group of seven jusen housing loan companies.
They collapsed with trillions of yen in bad loans, a messy process
that ended up requiring an infusion of taxpayer money by elected
politicians.

Then there is the story of Nichiei Finance. Nichiei Finance, a
subsidiary of Nichiei Co, was established in 1972 and listed its
stock on the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1991.

On Tuesday, Nichiei Finance, a long-troubled medium-sized financing
company, earned its place in the record books of bankruptcy by
declaring itself broke with the largest bubble of potential bad
debt in Japan's history, showing how long it is taking for Japan to
shake off its bubbled past.

The possible bad debt is larger than the previous biggest
bankruptcy - yen590 billion left by Muramoto Construction in 1993
- and even larger than the yen685 billion ponied up by parliament
earlier this year to help liquidate the jusen, although
collectively the jusen debts were larger.

Nichiei Finance was bad news for its main creditors and
shareholders, including three of Japan's largest bank's and its
well-known (solvent) parent company, Nichiei Co, which is also in
the loan business.

They had tried to rescue the company since 1993, but the continued
fall in Japan's property prices thwarted their efforts. The debts
were just too large.

Financial institutions have loaned yen170.9 billion - about half by
Dai-Ichi Kangyo (DKB), Asahi Bank and the Bank of Yokohama - to
Nichiei Finance, which has applied for court protection under the
bankruptcy laws. The parent company will post a loss of yen12.3
billion as a result.

Dai-Ichi had yen56.9 billion in loans to Nichiei Finance, while
Asahi had yen32.2 billion and the Bank of Yokohama yen20.3 billion,
bank officials said.

"DKB, Asahi and Bank of Yokohama have manageable exposures as their
write-offs in conjunction with this fiasco will only reach about 20
percent of their expected total asset disposal amount this year,"
ING Barings Securities said.

The real "bubbles" in Nichiei Finance are the yen820 billion in
loan guarantees it extended mostly to real estate customers, the
value of whose collateral has also crashed. About yen100 billion is
a total loss, while much of the rest is dubious.

So where is the political angle?

There is none. Bar a few knock-on bankruptcies in what is known as
the non-banking sector of financing firms, there is little chance
that Nichiei Finance, the biggest financial bankruptcy in Japan's
history, will produce more than a loud drop in the black hole of
Japan's property market. There are no depositors at risk.

So why were the jusen such a big deal?

They too were just housing loan companies gone wild in the era of
property speculation, with no depositors.

The difference was that the biggest lenders to the jusen, it turned
out, were a large number of agricultural cooperatives, who blithely
lent trillions of yen to the jusen, most of which was going to be
lost, threatening their solvency.

Agricultural cooperatives did have depositors, mostly farmers, who
had the political clout to mobilize the support of the Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), which depends heavily on the farm vote.

The LDP fixed it so that the agricultural cooperatives would not
lose any of the money that they loaned to the jusen, and would get
off with a token payment to help with the liquidation of those
companies.

The farmers were grateful, of course. In Japan's general election
on Sunday, they helped return the LDP to a more secure position as
the largest party in the Lower House of parliament.

Nichiei Finance should have such friends as friends of its lenders.

Nissho Iwai to develop coal mines in Australia+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Nissho Iwai Corp., a major trading house, said Monday it will
develop a group of coal mines in Australia's New South Wales state,
with total output estimated to reach 10 million tons after the year
2000.
     Nissho Iwai has established a joint venture company with South
Korea's state-run electric power corporation, its largest steelmaker
Pohang Iron and Steel Co., and nine other South Korean firms as well
as with Coal Operations Australia Ltd. (COAL), a Sydney-based mining
company.
     The joint firm is 48% owned by the South Korean group, 42% by
COAL and 10% by Nissho Iwai.
     The joint company has obtained from the state government of New
South Wales the right to explore coal deposits at the Wyong coal
mine -- made up of a 190-square-kilometer northwestern area and a
60-sq.-km eastern area, Nissho Iwai said.  Total deposits are
estimated at 1.6 billion tons.
     It will also double annual coal production capacity at a group
of mines in Wallarah adjacent to the Wyong mine to 3 million tons by
1998 at a cost of 67 million Australian dollars, or about 5.1 billion
yen, it said.
     The joint firm will conduct a feasibility study for the Wyong
mine next year at a cost of 18 million Australian dollars, or about
1.4 billion yen, and intends to launch commercial production as early
as 1999, Nissho Iwai said.  Output is expected to top 6 million tons
after the year 2000.

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Casio Computer Co. will set up a joint venture in India next
February with Japanese trading firm Mitsui and Co. and India's
Bharti Telecom Ltd. to manufacture and sell pagers in the country, a
Casio official said Monday.
     Casio Bharti Mobile Communications Ltd. will be established in

     In fiscal 1996, the company hopes to sell around 26,000 pagers
valued at some 3 billion yen.  By fiscal 1996, production is targeted
at around 600,000 pagers a year, the official said.
     The paging service that began in India in May this year has
proved highly popular and the market there is expected to grow to
about 1.5 million pagers a year by fiscal 1996, he said.
     Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands and Motorola Inc. of
the United States have already begun local production in India, he
added.

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Dentifrice and synthetic detergent maker Lion Corp. will launch
a feasibility study in the Vietnamese market early next year, a

Japan to provide food aid to N. Korea+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan plans to provide food aid to North Korea after consulting
with the United Nations and South Korea, a top government spokesman
said Monday.
     ''We cannot overlook a neighboring country's trouble,'' Chief
Cabinet Secretary Koken Nosaka told a press conference.
     He referred to a prediction recently released by a South Korean
government think tank that says North Korea will face its worst food
crisis ever around June or July next year.
     North Korea will see a grain supply shortfall of some 3.5
million tons, and there even is a possibility of people being
displaced and fleeing to neighboring countries, according to the
report.
     A U.N. report recently said that people in many parts of North
Korea are facing starvation.
     Floods this year devastated much of the country's farmland,
causing a serious food shortage.

     Shin Dai-Ichi Vinyl Corp. is planning to offer technology on
the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to Indonesia-based P.T.
Siam Maspion Polymers, a company official said Monday.
     The Japanese company was chosen from eight polyvinyl chloride
makers which bid to give technology to the firm, set up jointly by
Thai company Siam TPC Singapore and Indonesian firm P.T. Maspion, the

     Siam Maspion Polymers plans to construct a plant under the

million dollars, the plant will have an annual production capacity of
120,000 tons.
     Shin Dai-Ichi Vinyl is considering building a polyvinyl chloride
factory in Indonesia in the future, the company official said.
     The company was established in July from the integration of the
polyvinyl chloride departments of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Nippon Zeon
Co. and Tokuyama Corp.
     The Indonesian polyvivyl chloride market is predicted to expand
to 282,000 tons in 1995 and 422,000 tons in 2000 from 260,000 tons in
1994.

Star TV plans to enter the Japanese market+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Hong Kong's Satellite Television Asian Region Ltd. (Star TV)
plans to enter the Japanese market in April, industry sources said
Monday.
     The move comes after Japan's Posts and Telecommunications

in English and other languages on five channels reaching more than 50
countries.

Marubeni signs multimillion dlr power deal in Vietnam+

HANOI, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     An international consortium including Japan's Marubeni Corp.
has entered into a contract with the Vietnam Power Corp. to build a
286-megawatt gas turbine power plant in a southern province,
official media reported Monday.
     The daily Vietnam News said the contract for the 101 million
dollar turnkey project, to be funded by the World Bank, was signed on
Saturday.
     The consortium formed between Marubeni and the Swedish power
company ABB Generation beat eight other competitors, including
Mitsubishi Corp. with Itochu Corp., Mitsui and Co. with the Britain's
John Brown and Sumitomo Corp. with General Electric of the United
States.
     The project calls for construction of the Phu My 2 power plant
in Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province, 60 kilometers southeast of Ho Chi Minh
City.
     The plant, to be powered by natural gas tapped and transported
from fields off the Ba Ria-Vung Tau coast, will have two gas turbine
generators in the first phase, which are scheduled to become
operational by early 1997.
     In the second stage of the project, generating capacity will be
increased to 600 megawatts.
     The report said electricity demand in Vietnam is projected to
rise around 15% a year from now through the next 10 or 20 years.  It
said Vietnam plans to meet this demand by boosting generation to as
much as 26-29 billion kilowatt hours by 2010.

Seikosha to make time clocks in Thailand+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Seikosha Co. plans to begin making time clocks in Thailand next
summer to respond to strong demand in Southeast Asia, a company
spokesman said Tuesday.
     The company's subsidiary in Thailand, Seikosha (Thailand) Co.,

Chiyoda to offer plan to develop Myanmar's 2nd city+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Chiyoda Corp. will propose a development plan for the city of
Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, a company official said
Tuesday.
     Under the plan, the plant engineering company will propose
about 60 projects with priority orders as well as infrastructure
improvement projects in a 150-page report submitted to city
authorities, the official said.
     The plan aims to develop Mandalay into a larger city with a
population of 3.5 million by 2020, almost three times its current
population, he said.
     The proposal includes construction of oil pipelines from the
Bay of Bengal to the central Myanmar city and improvement in the
network of roads between Mandalay and the neighboring Yunnan
Province of China, the official said.
     Chiyoda sent three experts to Mandalay for a preparatory study
in September and began to make the plan voluntarily, the official
said.
     Since then, Chiyoda has submitted to the city authorities
several interim reports on how to develop Mandalay according to the
authorities' requests, the official said.
     Chiyoda hopes to receive orders from the city government for the
pipeline and other related projects proposed in the plan, he said.

Foreign investment in Vietnam tops 18 bil. dlr mark+

HANOI, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Cumulative foreign direct investment in Vietnam up to 1995 has
exceeded the 18 billion dollar mark, a Vietnamese business daily
reported Tuesday.
     The Saigon Times Daily attributed the information to Ministry of
Planning and Investment sources.
     It said the 18 billion dollar mark was surpassed after a record
6.08 billion dollars was invested in Vietnam from the beginning of
the year up to Dec. 20.
     That 1995 figure is almost double the 3.5 billion dollars
invested in 1994.
     The report said the cumulative total, which includes a legal
capital of 9 billion dollars, has been invested since Jan. 1988, when
Vietnam first opened its economy to foreign investors.
     The report said Taiwan retained its lead with 3.01 billion
dollars worth of investments, while Japan rose up the ladder to
secure second place with 1.78 billion dollars.
     Closely trailing Japan were Hong Kong with 1.74 billion dollars
and Singapore with 1.73 billion dollars.
     Filling out the top 10 list were South Korea (1.48 billion
dollars), the British Virgin Islands (1.14 billion dollars), Malaysia
(840 million dollars), Australia (760 million dollars), the United
States (690 million dollars) and France (600 million dollars).

Suntory to expand beer, soft drink sales in China+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Japan's top whiskey maker Suntory Ltd. said Tuesday it will
expand beer and soft drink sales in China through new joint ventures
with Chinese partners.
     The Osaka-based company said it has signed an agreement with
Shanghai Sugar Cigarette and Wine (Group) Co. to launch a joint
venture, Shanghai Suntory Brewery Co., in January to produce and
market beer in Shanghai.
     The Chinese partner is a leading state-run enterprise
established in 1950 to distribute alcoholic beverages and food
products, the company said.
     Under the agreement, the partner's subsidiary, Shanghai Jiangnan
Brewery, will expand its existing plant and equipment for the
production of new beer for sale under a local brand name, the company
said.
     The plant's annual capacity will be raised to 100,000 kiloliters
by 1998 and to 200,000 kl by 2005 from the present 30,000 kl, the
company said.
     The agreement also calls for the joint venture to upgrade
production technology to produce beer for sale under the Suntory
label in the future, the company said.
     Total investment is estimated at 5 billion yen, it said.
     Suntory entered China's beer market in 1984 by setting up a
joint venture in Jiangsu Province.  The project, China Jiangsu
Suntory Food Co., has already emerged as the top beer company in the
province, the company said.
     The company said Shanghai Suntory Brewery will give Suntory an
overwhelming share of the beer market in the Shanghai area.
     The company said it has also agreed with Shanghai Maling Food
Co. to establish a joint soft drink venture.
     The new firm, Shanghai Suntory-Maling Foods Co., will start
producing Suntory-brand soft drinks in the fall of 1996.
     Initially, the new company will produce oolong tea and an orange
drink both in cans and heat-resistant PET bottles.
     It will mark the first appearance of heat-resistant PET bottled

     Annual sales are forecast at one million cases in fiscal 1997,
rising to 3.8 million cases by 2001, it said.

Japan unlikely to resume Iran yen loans by end of '96+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Japan is unlikely to lift a freeze on official loans to Iran
before the U.S. presidential election is over in November next year,
a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday.
     The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Japan
cannot resume extension of its low-interest official credits unless
Iran tries more seriously to improve its relations with other
countries, especially the United States.
     The Japanese stance is apparently intended to ward off possible
criticism from abroad of its policy on Iran, which the U.S. and many
other countries view as a major backer of international terrorism.
     It is feared that Japan's resumption of yen-denominated lending
to Iran now would make U.S. policy toward Japan a major issue in the
presidential campaign and strain ties between Tokyo and Washington.
     At stake is the second installment of 48.5 billion yen in
Japan's yen credit package for the construction of a hydroelectric
power plant on the River Karun in southern Iran.
     Tokyo has suspended its provision of yen loans to Tehran since
May 1993, when it supplied 38.6 billion yen in the first installment
of finance for the project.

Philippines to cut tariffs on 155 products in '96+

MANILA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Philippines will lower import tariffs on some 155 products
next year as part of an accelerated program to create a free trade
market in Southeast Asia by 2003, Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) documents said Tuesday.
     According to the documents, the 155 items are among 717 products
in Manila's temporary exclusion list to be included in the Common
Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme over the next five years.
     The CEPT is the vehicle for creating a free trade area within
the ASEAN region, home of the world's fastest growing economies.
     ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
     Throughout ASEAN, about 687 tariff lines will be lowered in
1996 and 2,496 others in the next four years.  Average tariff rates
will subsequently be brought down from 7.73% in 1996 to 4.03% by
2000 and 2.90% by 2003.
     ASEAN member economies vowed at the end of the fifth leaders'
summit in Bangkok on Dec. 15 to speed up the realization of an ASEAN
Free Trade Area even before the target date year of 2003 by
maximizing the number of items whose tariffs can be reduced to 0-5%
by the year 2000, as well as expanding the number of products whose
tariffs can be reduced to zero percent by the same year.

Beijing public transport facing 300% fare hike+

BEIJING, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Beijing subway riders will see a 300% rise in ticket prices
Jan. 1 as the municipal government aims to reduce rising public
transport subsidies and a heavily overburdened subway system, state
press reported Tuesday.
     Ticket prices will rise to 2 yuan (0.24 dollars) from the
present 0.5 yuan (0.06 dollars), while monthly passes will rise 120%
from the present 18 yuan (2.16 dollars) to 40 yuan (4.80 dollars),
the China Economic Times reported.
     The fare hikes are expected to help offset growing government
subsidies which amounted to 250 million yuan (30 million dollars) in
1994 and are expected to top 400 million yuan (48 million dollars)
for the current year, the paper said.
     Beijing's two-line 42-kilometer subway system has become
increasingly overcrowded as rapid urbanization has increased the
number of commuters and the growth in automobile traffic has snarled
the streets of the capital and rendered the once dependable public
bus system increasingly hit-and-miss.
     Bus tickets are expected to rise from an average 0.2 yuan to 0.5
yuan, it said.
     Last year, Beijing commuters made 530 million subway trips, and
the system's 180-people subway carriages were strained to as much as
50% beyond nominal capacity during peak hours, making travel
uncomfortable and dangerous.
     The Beijing government, fearful of worsening inflation, has
previously refused to approve the subway price hikes, leaving subway
managers no choice but to limit monthly passes and control ticket
sales during peak hours.

2 Toyota affiliates set up joint ventures in China+

NAGOYA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Two major affiliates of Toyota Motor Corp. announced Tuesday
the establishment of joint ventures with the affiliates of a major
Chinese carmaker to manufacture auto parts in Tianjin, southeast of
Beijing.
     The Chinese carmaker is Tianjin Automotive Industrial (Group)
Co., with which Toyota Motor is now negotiating to set up a joint
venture to produce passenger cars.
     Nippondenso Co., a major maker of electronic car parts, said it
has set up Tianjin Denso Engine Electrical Products Co., in
conjunction with Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Generator and
Starter Factory.
     The joint venture, capitalized at 1.66 billion yen, will be
owned 55% by Tianjin Internal Combustion and the remainder by
Nippondenso and the Toyota group's trading house, Toyota Tsusho
Corp., the company said.
     The new joint venture will produce starters and alternators for
use in automobiles to be made by Tianjin Automotive Industrial, it
said.
     In a related development, Toyoda Gosei Co. established Tianjin
Toyoda Gosei Automobile Hose Co. in conjunction with a Chinese
business partner that also belongs to the group of companies led by
Tianjin Automotive Industrial, the company said.
     The joint venture, capitalized at 384 million yen, is owned
64.4% by Toyoda Gosei, 5% by Toyota Tsusho and the remainder by the
Chinese partner.
     The joint venture will produce brake hoses for use in
automobiles to be built by Tianjin Automotive Industrial.
     If the Chinese government approves a Toyota application to set
up a joint venture with Tianjing Automotive Industrial, the two
Toyota affiliates want to supply parts to be made by their new joint
ventures to Toyota's own joint venture with Tianjin Automotive too,
the pair said.
     Toyota is offering to produce passenger car engines with Tianjin
Automotive Industrial in view of the possible Chinese partner's plan
to introduce a new car model, Toyota officials said.

IHI gets order to build 3 blast furnaces in Taiwan+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. (IHI) announced
Thursday it has signed a deal with a major Taiwanese steelmaker to
construct three blast furnaces in Taiwan for about 40 billion yen.
     The steelmaker, Taiwan Steel Co., plans to build the furnaces at
a new plant near the city of Tainan, southwestern Taiwan, which will
start up in the year 2000 with an annual steel production capacity of
7.5 million tons, the Japanese comprehensive heavy machinery maker
said.
     The construction of the first blast furnace will be completed by
the end of 1999, and the Taiwanese firm plans to start operations in
June 2000, IHI said.
     The other furnaces will begin working by June 2002, IHI said.
     Each of the three furnaces has an internal volume of 3,800 cubic
meters, it said.
     With the new plant, Taiwan Steel intends to increase its share
of the domestic market where imports, mostly from Japan and South
Korea, currently account for about half the market, an IHI official
said.

Sumitomo to take stake in Indonesian chemical maker+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Sumitomo Corp. said Thursday it will purchase 25 million
dollars worth of convertible bonds to be issued in January by an
Indonesian chemical maker belonging to the Salim group, the largest
financial group in Indonesia.
     The Japanese general trading house will convert the bonds into
stocks after the redemption term matures in four years, meaning it
will take some stake in the equity of the chemical maker, PT Sulfindo
Ajiusaha, a Sumitomo official said.
     Sumitomo will also buy the chemical maker's debentures of the
same amount in January, the official said.
     The Indonesian maker plans to issue in January 100 million
dollars worth of bonds, half of which are convertible bonds, in order
to double its chlorine production for polyvinyl chloride resin, he
said.
     The remaining half of the bonds will be purchased by the Salim
group, he said.
     Sumitomo and the Salim group earlier set up two joint ventures
in Indonesia to produce polyvinyl chloride resin, and chlorine to be
made at the facilities will be used in the resin production, the
official said.

     South Korea's Hyundai business group named Chung Mong Koo, the
second-eldest son of its honorary chairman and founder Chung Ju
Yung, as its new chairman on Thursday.
     In the largest shake-up since its founding, Hyundai replaced 404
top-level managers of its affiliated companies.
     Chung Mong Koo, 58, was chairman of Hyundai Precision and Ind.

Nissan to expand ties with S. Korea's Samsung Motor+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Nissan Motor Co. plans to exand its strategical ties with
Samsung Motor Inc. of South Korea to cover business cooperation in
the Asian market, officials of Japan's No. 2 automaker said Thursday.
     The proposed expansion calls for the partners to produce and
market passenger cars in each other's country, they said.
     Details of the business cooperation will be ironed out by the two
companies, they said.
     ''Cooperative relations will be strengthened to help Samsung
develop into a powerful friend,'' an executive of Nissan said.
     Possible capital cooperation is under study, said the
high-ranking official, who declined to be named.
     Under plans reviewed by Nissan, Pusan-headquartered Samsung will
market Nissan cars in South Korea under its own brand names while
Nissan will sell Samsung cars under the Nissan brand.
     Both partners will strengthen cooperation to produce cars
competitive in the respective countries, the officials said.
     The two companies will produce cars in Southeast Asia under a
burden-sharing scheme and cooperate in developing vehicles to boost
their productivity, they said.
     They also plan to standardize components and parts to be used
in their vehicles.
     Nissan has been providing technological assistance to Samsung
Motor in plant construction and production of components since April
last year.
     More than 100 Nissan officials now are assigned to assist the
South Korean automaker, which plans to start producing passenger cars
at a newly completed assembly plant in Pusan in January 1998, the
officials said.

foreign automakers has intensified in the fast-growing auto markets
in Southeast Asian countries.
     ''South Korean cars have great growth potential in Southeast
Asia as they are sold at prices nearly 20% below those of
their Japanese counterparts,'' an industry official said.
     Japanese automakers have taken a dominant share of the Asian
auto market but their hegemony has shown signs of declining in recent
years in the face of the strong yen and a powerful sales drive by
South Korean competitors, industry sources said.
     For instance, they said, the market share held by Japanese
makers in Thailand dropped from 90% to 68% in 1994 in
the face of rising competition from U.S., European and South Korean
rivals.
     Nissan lagged behind the forerunners there because the company
focused on expanding its markets in North America and Europe, they
said.
     Nissan will strengthen its partnership with Samsung in Southeast
Asia to catch up with its rivals there, a company official said.

4.3 mil. tourists visit Indonesia in '95+

JAKARTA, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     About 4.3 million foreign tourists visited Indonesia in 1995,
bringing in estimated revenues of 5.21 billion dollars, local
newspapers reported Thursday.
     ''The total number of foreign tourists entering Indonesia
through seven main gates as of December 1995 is estimated to have
reached 4.3 million,'' Tourism, Post and Telecommunications Minister
Joop Ave was quoted as saying Wednesday.
     Joop said the projected revenues represent an increase of 10.8%
from 4.7 billion dollars in 1994, though the number of tourist
arrivals rose only 7.3% from last year's level of slightly above
four million.
     According to a five-year development plan, the government
expected 4.5 million foreign tourists to visit Indonesia this year,
bringing revenues of at least 6 billion dollars.
     The number of tourist arrivals is projected to rise to between
five million and 5.4 million in 1996, bringing revenues of 6.91
billion dollars.
     Indonesia is targeting the tourist industry as a major foreign
exchange earner by 2005, when it expects to attract 11.1 million
visitors who will spend a total of 15 billion dollars in the country.
     The promotion of the country's tourist industry was hampered
early this year when the Japanese press reported that dozens of
Japanese tourists had become ill with cholera after returning from
the resort island of Bali.
     Japan, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan and Germany are major
sources of tourists for Indonesia.  In 1994 more than half of all
tourists, 56.83%, came from these five countries.

China aims to attract foreign investment in real estate+

BEIJING, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     China is trying to make its real estate sector more attractive
to foreigners, mainly in the area of low-cost, mass-market housing.
     There has been a boom in construction of office blocks, luxury
condominiums, villas and hotels in the past few years, mainly funded
by foreign investors seeking high profits through leasing or selling.
     But the government has now applied the brakes with a mixture of
the carrot and the stick to force foreign funds into sectors of
perceived greater need.
     It has issued new regulations lifting the previous exemption on
import duties and other taxes for materials and equipment brought in
from overseas for the construction of virtually any type of real
estate project.
     Currently, there are restrictions on the approval of land
available for such projects as well as a value-added tax for real
estate.
     A Circular on Strict Control of the Development of Luxury Real
Estate Projects was also introduced in late 1995 and the regulation
speaks for itself in indicating government determination to control
what it reckoned was the main reason the construction sector
overheated in the early 1990s, leading to runaway inflation.
     At the same time, foreign companies willing to cooperate with
the government in a massive urban renewal plan scheduled for the next
decade -- razing entire low-rise residential districts in many cities
and replacing them with high-rise apartment blocks -- will be given
preferential treatment as well as a guaranteed rate of return on
their investments.
     According to Minister of Construction Hou Jie, the government's
efforts to bring the real estate sector under tighter control are
beginning to pay off.
     In 1992, for example, investment in building construction
projects rose 117% over the previous year.  By 1994, growth had been
reduced to a 41.3%, and Hou anticipated an even lower increase this
year.
     ''There are four million urban families facing severe housing
problems.  The per capita urban housing space in at least half the
country is below the national average and 40 million square meters of
urban housing are dangerous and in urgent need of repair or
replacement,'' he said.
     Hou is trying to persuade potential foreign investors that the
development of low-cost housing, while yielding lower profits,
actually involves less risk and will represent the chief investment
trend in Chinese real estate in the foreseeable future.
     According to the minister, it takes one year to organize a
contract for a major hotel and at least three years to build it.  It
then takes eight or nine years to recover investments and reap
profits.
     On the other hand, the construction of an ordinary housing
project requires only six months for the entire cycle.  Two cycles
per year can be completed in south China but only one in north China
due to the inclement weather.
     ''The great demand for housing continues to offer foreign
investors excellent prospects for earning good returns.  Foreign
businesses investing in real estate can earn higher profits than the
current international level in developed countries,'' Hou said.
     ''Internationally, average profits for real estate range from 6
to 8%, with the rate in some countries dropping to 2%. In China,
average profit seldom falls below 30%,'' he said.
     Taking the lead in this area is the Shanghai municipal
government, which is counting on new preferential policies to help
overcome the resistance of foreign construction companies to becoming
involved in the city's ambitious urban housing redevelopment program.
     Guaranteed after-tax returns on investment will be limited to
15%, but the main sweetener is new policies designed to reduce the
risks and red tape involved in building cheap apartments for
residents forced out by urban projects.
     According to Huang Yuejing, deputy general secretary of the
Shanghai municipal government, regulations allowing foreign
investment in domestic housing projects were actually issued at the
end of 1993 but did not find any takers.
     ''Potential investors were discouraged by the huge outlays for
demolition of old buildings, relocation of residents and the
provision of utilities, all of which took a huge bite out of
prospective profits,'' he said.
     Foreign developers also had to team up with local parties to buy
a plot of land for redevelopment, and also pay a transfer fee for the
rights to the land, adding to the costs and risks.
     To overcome resistance, Huang said, ''We have come up with new
policies which we estimate will save overseas investors much of their
expense if they put their money into housing projects for domestic
sale rather than for overseas buyers.''
     The new approach, which applies to all foreign-invested projects
in areas with high concentrations of shabby or dangerous houses,
calls for the local authority to allocate the land to the Chinese
partner in a joint venture, with the foreign side providing the
financing.
     The Shanghai municipal government has pledged to buy the entire
housing project when completed and be responsible for its eventual
sale.  The profits reaped by the foreign investor can be remitted
overseas free of the normal restrictions on foreign exchange.
     The Shanghai approach is likely to be copied by other municipal
authorities.  Beijing, for example, is reported to be considering a
similar package of financial incentives with a guaranteed return of
18%.

Cambodia counts on foreign funds for 45% of revenue+

PHNOM PENH, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Cambodia still depends on foreign aid and borrowings from
multilateral aid institutions for 45.1% of its budgeted revenue for
fiscal 1996 which begins April, according to the state budget
approved Thursday by the National Assembly.
     The parliament endorsed the government's overall budget proposal
totaling 1.45 trillion riels (5.66 million dollars) for fiscal 1996.
     The budget size represented an increase of 13.2% over a year
earlier.
     Although the budgetary dependency on foreign money declined
from the preceding year's 45.9%, the rate is still alarmingly high,
analysts say.
     In breaking down the budgeted expenditures in percentage terms,
defense accounted for the biggest chunk at 34.9%, down from the
preceding year's 38.9%.
     The budget for the Interior Ministry ranked second at 15.2%,
down from the preceding year's 16.8%.
     These defense and security expenditures shrank somewhat as the
security threat from the Khmer Rouge guerrillas eased.
     The Cambodian government budgeted a 111% increase in
tourism-related expenditures, a 65% increase in welfare outlays and
a 36% raise for royal family-related outlays.

Daiichi Pharmaceutical opens development unit in China+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. has established a wholly owned
clinical drug development subsidiary in Beijing, a Daiichi spokesman
said Friday.
     The subsidiary will conduct clinical tests of new, promising
drugs concurrently in both Japan and China.
     The subsidiary will enable Daiichi to move quickly in new areas,
giving it an advantage over its competitors, the spokesman said.
     He said the new subsidiary, Daiichi Pharmaceutical (China) Co.,
is capitalized at 5 million dollars.
     It will start clinical tests of the synthetic antibacterial drug
Cravit and the cerebral neurotransmission improvement drug Translon
at a Beijing hospital from March, the spokesman said.  Tests of other
drugs will begin gradually.
     Daiichi expects to obtain Chinese government approval for Cravit
and Translon in 1998, he said.
     The subsidiary will then establish a joint production and sales
company for the drugs with a local pharmaceutical firm, and Daiichi
will invest some 3 billion yen on facility construction, the
spokesman said.
     Daiichi aims to raise its annual sales in China to 10 billion
yen by 2000, he said.

     The government is moving toward ratifying the international
ocean treaty and creating a 200-mile exclusive economic zone that
will likely inflame territorial disputes with China and South Korea,
the Tokyo Shimbun reported Friday.
     The daily said in a front-page article that the government hopes
to ratify the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea during the
upcoming regular Diet session and establish the exclusive economic
zone.
     The convention, which went into force in November last year,
obliges all signatories to recognize an exclusive 200-mile economic
zone off a nation's coasts.
     Within their zones, states have the exclusive right to fish or
to exploit natural resources such as oil, reclaim land or construct
artificial islands.
     In question will be Japan's dispute with China over the Senkaku
Islands, known in Chinese as the Diaoyutai Islands, in the East China
Sea.
     Tokyo also disputes South Korea's claim to Takeshima Island,
known as Tokto in Korea, in the Sea of Japan.
     The Senkaku Islands, located some 150 kilometers northeast of
the northern tip of Taiwan, are also claimed by Taipei.
     China has said it plans to ratify the sea convention next
summer.  South Korea has already ratified the treaty.
     Some Foreign Ministry officials said earlier this month Japan
should delineate a 200-mile zone with the Senkaku Islands as a
base of reference, arguing that refraining from doing so could be
interpreted by the Chinese as a lack of interest in the territory.

Japanese help Indonesian village improve iron casting+

URAWA, Japan, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The Japanese city of Kawaguchi in Saitama Prefecture, bordering
Tokyo, famous for its cast-iron pots and pans, is helping an
Indonesian village bring its metal-casting technology up to date by
introducing modern cupola furnaces.
     Six makers of cast-iron products in Kawaguchi have founded the
Kasia metal-casting technology exchange cooperative hoping to help
realize a model factory in Ceper, a village on Java, by the middle of
next year, said Kenichi Masuda, head of the cooperative.
     Because of the strong yen, the Kawaguchi makers have suffered
from sluggish demand, even for products made from new materials such
as ceramics.  They have embarked on the project in a bid to overcome
the mood of the recession, he said.
     The name ''Kasia'' is a contraction of Kawaguchi and Asia.
Ceper has some 300 metal casters who make their products in
hand-shaped sand molds.
     ''Their technological level equals that of Japan in the Edo
period (1615-1868), with rejects sometimes amounting to almost 80%
of production,'' Masuda said.
     The idea for the project was born when the head of a
metal-casting cooperative from Ceper requested technological
assistance after inspecting Masuda's factory during a visit to Japan
in 1991.
     The village is providing the site and the factory free of
charge.  Kawaguchi workers skilled in the latest metal-casting
techniques will serve as instructors at the Ceber model factory and
bring the know-how of some 20 local metalworkers up to date.
     Also planned are a library and a metal-casting contest.
     Indonesia relies heavily on imports for cast-iron products,
particularly machine parts.
     Japanese makers producing in Indonesia are not able to keep up
with demand.  Masuda, though, said he does not expect the model
factory to make profits right from the start.
     ''We are ready to live with a deficit in the first few years.
For us, the project is significant in giving new impetus to Japan's
metal-casting industry which is in a fix.''

Steelmakers face price-cut pressure for exports to Asia+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Japanese steelmakers are under growing pressure to cut prices
of Asia-bound steel products due to a glut in the market, steel
companies officials said Friday.
     They said China's restraint on economic expansion, including a
switch to a tight credit policy, is primarily responsible for the
glut.
     The Chinese government has ordered domestic steelmakers to limit
their production to reduce large inventories resulting from
overproduction in 1994, they said.
     China's crude steel output was estimated at 90 million tons in
1994.
     Japanese steel producers recently bowed to a Chinese demand for
a price cut of about 8.0% for their steel shipments in the
February-July period.
     The officials said Japanese steel companies already face growing
calls for price cuts from Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia.
     Prices of steel products bound for India and the Middle East
have also declined by about 10% from the July-September level of
this year.
     Trading houses said some Japanese steelmakers have offered
price cuts of up to 15% to secure export volume.

Thailand's population to reach 60 mil. next June+

BANGKOK, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Thailand' population will reach 60 million by June 1996 and
will rise to 70.48 million by 2012, Mahidol University's Institute
for Population and Social Research said Friday.
     Thailand will have 59.71 million -- 29.84 million males and
29.87 million females -- as of Jan. 1, 1996, according to the
quarterly Mahidol Population Gazette released by the institute.
     It said the urban and rural populations are now 18.86 million
and 40.85 million respectively.  Bangkok has 7.85 million people.
     The gazette said life expectancy at birth is 66.6 years for men
and 71.7 years for women.

China to cut tariffs, spell out new rules+

BEIJING, Dec 29 Kyodo

     China will cut import tariffs on 4,000 items by an average 35%
beginning April 1, 1996, while preferential policies for foreign
investment projects already approved will enjoy a transition period,
state press reported Friday.
     In a bid to level the playing field among China's backward
inland regions and its booming special economic zones, and to offer
foreign enterprises the same treatment as domestic one, the State
Council has issued a circular calling for the reduction of the
general tariff rate to 23%.
     It also called for an end to the duty-free benefits enjoyed by
the special economic zones, the Economic Daily said.
     The circular conforms with the tariff cuts promised by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin at the Osaka informal summit meeting of
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in October and is seen
as a significant step toward China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
     No information was provided on the precise size of reductions or
which products would have their import duties cut.
     However, regulations were set out regarding a transition period
for preferential tax policies and duty-free benefits for foreign
investment projects legally approved before the publication of the
circular.
     Foreign investment projects worth more than 30 million dollars
and approved before Dec. 28 would continue to enjoy their reduced and
duty-free tariffs and preferential import taxes on imported equipment
and raw materials until Dec. 31, 1997, it said, while such projects
valued under 30 million dollars could extend the previous policy
until Dec. 31, 1996.
     Equipment for technological transformation approved for import
before the issuance of the circular would also continue to enjoy
previous preferential import policies during the transition period,
it said.
     If equipment and resources are not imported within the specified
transition periods, enterprises could ask the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation or the State Economic and Trade
Commission for an extension from the State Council, it said.

China breaks another grain output record in '95+

BEIJING, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Chinese farmers harvested a record 466 million tons of grain in
1995, up 21 million tons over last year and nearly 10 million tons
over the previous record harvest in 1993, Xinhua News Agency
reported Friday.
     The record output came, though several grain growing areas were
plagued by natural disaster during the year and rising costs for
fertilizer and pesticides threatened to keep farmers off the land.
     ''With the rise in grain prices mainly blamed for last year's
high inflation rate, the 1995 increase in output is a great help in
the nation's efforts at curbing inflation and easing the strained
grain market,'' analysts said, according to Xinhua.
     Government officials have set a grain production target of 500
million tons for the year 2000, as China's rising living standard is
expected to increase grain consumption, especially of feed grains.
     According to the Hong Kong-based China Agribusiness Review 1995,
following trends in the first half of the year, China is expected to
become a net grain importer this year after being a significant
exporter over the last two years.

Ramos signs 394.8 bil. peso budget for '96+

MANILA, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     President Fidel Ramos signed into law Friday a 394.8 billion
peso (about 15 billion U.S. dollar) budget for 1996, with education
getting the biggest chunk of the funds, presidential palace and
Congress officials announced.
     The budget also earmarked large outlays to public works,
defense and assistance to local governments, House Speaker Jose de
Venecia said.
     It also reflects a doubled budget for agriculture to help the
sector cope with the immediate effects of tariff and subsidy cuts
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and includes a 4
billion peso (about 15 million dollar) fund for poverty alleviation,
de Venecia said.
     The budget department said that while general appropriations
come to 394.8 billion pesos, the total obligatory budget approved by
Congress was 415.6 billion pesos (about 16 billion dollars),
including 25.3 billion pesos (97 million dollars) for automatic debt
service payments.
     Congress initially wanted to include debt-service funds in the
general appropriations, but Ramos vetoed the move, noting that the
Supreme Court has already ruled that funds for debt servicing are
automatically appropriated and need not be included in the yearly
budget.

Remitted funds from Asian contract workers top ODA+

MANILA, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The aggregate sum of remittances to home countries from
overseas contract workers from nine Asian countries has shot up to
dwarf the annual total of official development assistance (ODA) to
the nine, an Asian Development Bank investigation shows.
     Remittances from such workers to the nine countries totaled 75
billion dollars in 1993, exceeding their aggregate ODA of 54 billion
dollars from industrialized countries, including Japan, the survey
shows.
     The survey covered the Philippines, Thailand, India, Bangladesh,
Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, China and South Korea.
     In the Philippines and Indonesia, the ratio of contract workers'
annual remittances to the nations' gross domestic product (GDP) is on
the rise, according to figures collated by the Manila-based regional
lending institution.
     In a period from 1987 to 1993, the aggregate of remittances home
from Indonesian contract workers abroad quadrupled from 86 million
dollars to 346 million dollars, while that of Filipino workers showed
a 2.4-fold jump from 1.02 billion dollars to 2.54 million dollars,
the survey showed.
     In contrast, the aggregate home remittances from Thai and South
Korean workers saw much slower growth ratios over similar periods.
     Aggregate remittances from South Korean workers increased
nearly 50% from 418 million dollars to 605 million dollars from 1987
to 1993, while those from Thai workers grew 40% from 784 million
dollars to 1.13 billion dollars in a period from 1987 to 1992,
according to the bank figures.
     This could imply that a nation's dependence on such remittance
eases as its economy prospers, alleviating the need for contract
workers to go abroad and send money home, analysts said.

ASIA CHASES THE 1996 'INFRABUCK'

China faces, 'strong competition from the rest of Asia in attracting
development capital,' Trevor Bush, NatWest Markets managing director
for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, told a conference in Beijing recently.
He explained that China risks losing out to other Asian countries which
are introducing legal and regulatory reforms at a faster rate to
attract international financing for infrastructure projects.

The statement reflects comments made recently by Ted Rule, executive
director of Asian Infrastructure Fund Advisors. Talking about build-
operate-transfer projects in China, and in particular road schemes, he
said international banks are not usually prepared to finance building
highways where the return comes only from the project itself. He says
that to attract the money, China must allow substantially higher road
tolls, like Indonesia where tolls are 50 to 75 per cent higher.

It is true that China has its problems attracting the infrabuck. Its
system of law routinely causes clashes between the central and state
governments. It has no binding BOT legislation, local governments have
no right to sell land to foreigners (although in plenty of cases they
do), and, at times it seems that the central government is trying to
put the brakes on the process of attracting the international
infrabuck. In an attempt to harness its foreign debt it has banned
provincial governments from proceeding on projects without central
government approval, and has cut the sectors which are open to foreign
investment. Against this background, competition from other Asian
nations should be rife, each one offering the international infrabuck a
substantially better deal than it gets in China.

But where exactly is the 'strong competition'? Which countries are
winning the infrabucks?

Ted Rule cites Indonesian toll roads, but all the road contracts have
gone to the state-run toll road operator Jasa Marga, or consortia made
up of Indonesian companies, including Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada,
controlled by president Suharto's eldest daughter. There has been
interest from international companies in Indonesia's road projects but
so far no private projects have been awarded to these companies - and
thus no international infrabucks.

Indonesia has been persistently criticised for its lack of transparent
bidding for projects, particularly by the World Bank, and its group of
donor countries. Politically Indonesia is 'stable', even if it lacks a
common democracy, and certainly foreign investment through the stock
market is strong. But analysts' judgements on stocks tend to be based
on how they view the political clout of the companies, not on the
companies' efficiency or management. Indonesia seems no better than
China at attracting the infrabuck.

Earlier this year the Philippines seemed the ideal place for the
international infrabuck. President Ramos had privatised electricity
generation with tremendous success, and private generating companies
were guaranteed minimum sales through the state grid. The country has a
sophisticated BOT law, a dedicated department to deal with BOT projects
which reports directly to Ramos, and transparent bidding procedures.
Now the president has pushed through executive powers to be able to
handle the water supply crisis in the same way as the power shortages,
and has invited the IFC to advise on the best means of privatising
water.

But cracks are beginning to appear that will worry international
investors. There has been a huge upsurge of the 'Filipino-First'
attitude. In October the Supreme Court placed a temporary ban on the
government sale of the Manila Hotel to Malaysia's Renong when the
losing Philippine-based Manila Prince Hotel lodged a petition citing
'Filipino-First'. This will deter international investors if a losing
national firm insists on preferential treatment on the basis of
nationality.

Fuelling the Filipino-First sentiments is Representative Ramon
Bagatsing, who has introduced a House Bill which stipulates that the
hiring of consultants for infrastructure projects should be limited to
Filipinos. The only exceptions are where the hiring of foreign
consultants is a condition of a loan, where the local consultants do
not have the necessary experience or where bilateral agreements exist.
Cost is not cited as a reason to appoint foreign consultants.

President Ramos has given two airport contracts to a group of six
Chinese-Filipinos who have formed the Asian Emerging Dragon Consortium.
Despite interest from foreign companies, AEDC has been promised the
contract as long as it matches the lowest tender. Not surprisingly,
there are not many bids to match. International companies who are
interested in the projects would rather tie up with AEDC than present a
bid themselves against such obvious bias.

Another reason that the Philippines may lose out on the infrabuck is
because of new regulations that are being discussed. At present foreign
exchange-denominated profits can be repatriated. The government is now
looking at compelling contractors to accept peso payments and to
require them to make regular remittance reports to the central bank.
The department of finance has also recommended an overhaul of the
government guarantee scheme for BOT projects by imposing fees on such
guarantees, requiring contractors to share the risks of the projects
and reducing any future guarantees. In only six months the Philippines
has lost its edge as a strong competitor for the international
infrabuck.

In the last few years India has pledged itself fully to privately-
funded infrastructure projects. The ministry of surface transport
produced a glossy brochure advertising areas for private port
development, management and operation. International companies have
been invited to do free feasibility studies for sections of a planned
13,000km of national toll roads. The promised pay-off was the contract
to build and operate the roads and to develop the land around the
route, as long as they could match the lowest bidder (which was to be
evaluated according to its proposed toll levy) for each section. The
IFC are advising on water privatisation in some states and plans are
afoot to bring in a dedicated BOT law which bypasses the morass of
central and local laws that currently have to be negotiated.

The prospects looked good, but in reality almost nothing has happened.
Plans have been bogged down by local elections and a central government
that is desperately trying to curry favour for the elections this year
(1996). Privatisation is rarely popular with the electorate.

In November, the finance ministry refused to approve the national toll
road project. It objected to the fact that each contract was almost
guaranteed to go to the company undertaking the feasibility studies,
and the fact that those companies would not have to pre-qualify to
tender. Twenty-two firms had already started studies at their own
expense.

Disputes over Dabhol, the supposedly fast-track private power project
which Enron was awarded in Maharastra, have also concerned
international investors. Local newspapers pounced on the story once the
deal was announced, claiming that Enron's profits and the price of the
electricity were not justifiable. The project has since been dropped
and resurrected like a yo-yo, although there are some signs that a
compromise is likely to be reached soon.

As for the port privatisations, the ministry of surface transport has
just turned down a proposal to privatise the management and operation
of the existing berths at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust near Bombay.
The construction of two new berths at the port are apparently being
offered to the private sector and details are on page 14. The question
remains, though, whether it will always be 'future' projects on the
basis that 'tomorrow never comes'? Despite its much-publicised
welcoming of the private sector into infrastructure, India may not yet
be a serious contender for the international infrabuck.

Thailand is faring no better in nurturing the climate that attracts the
infrabuck. It is host to an array of political scandals, particularly
in the appointment of contractors for infrastructure projects. Its
record for rewarding those that provide the international infrabuck has
been poor. Government pledges to hand over land or to ascertain rights
of way on inner-city route clashes have been ignored. And, to add to
Thailand's problems, the government changes frequently, the leading
party has not had a majority for years, and each new government selects
different projects for its 'infrastructure priority'.

Vietnam, on the other hand, will be desperate to compete with China -
although its estimated $6bn needed by the year 2000 is nothing compared
to China's requirements. But Vietnam is simply too poor to get the
money. 'There aren't that many projects on which you could recoup your
money because the market isn't there,' a lawyer was quoted as saying
(AIM/June issue/p2).

Malaysia is probably the most advanced country in Asia in terms of its
private sector infrastructure facilities. Even here political
requirements conflict with the conditions which attract international
investors. Worried about its inflation rate, the government has stepped
in to dissuade PLUS from raising its toll rates on the North-South
highway. This is despite a contract which guarantees minimum rates of
return and orders the state to pay compensation if it interferes with
the toll rates levied to reach that return.

Malaysia's record is on the whole good for privately-run infrastructure
facilities. It is a tested market, and one that is likely to remain
attractive to the international infrabuck. Analysts are worried,
however, that its high rate of growth makes it unstable, and its own
building projects (such as the new airport and the planned new
administrative capital) will overstretch its resources. Indeed much of
its growth comes from construction projects which are due to be
completed by the Asian Games in 1998, and some observers doubt whether
it can pay for the private services once the boom is over. There is
concern that private companies are going to face both a shrinking
demand and a public outcry over tariff rates once the games are over
and the economy slows down.

Whatever doubts there are about China, it is competing in an arena
where every false move is publicly known and the scale of the projects
causes inevitable problems. The whimsy of its officials certainly
renders China less attractive but all its competitors have a job to do
in wooing 1996's infrabucks. Co-operation between the public and the
private sectors require all parties to be competent, consistent,
flexible, full of integrity and re-elected without problems every time.
However, in the real world, some things will go wrong. What is also
evident is that Asia's need is so great and the region is expanding so
fast that private infrabucks must find sensible employment. Then it is
only a matter of returning to the question 'where?'.

CHINA: RAILWAY MINISTRY IS LOOKING TO 'MAKE CONTACTS'

China plans to widen the opportunities for foreign funding in railway
construction in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000). At the
forthcoming Third International Modern Railway Equipment Exhibition in
Beijing in March, the ministry of railways has said it plans to make
wide contacts with foreign companies for purchasing major technology
and rail equipment, especially in the construction of high-speed
railways which is to be a key focus of the new five-year plan. Between
1980 and 1994, the country used $4bn in foreign loans from governments
and international organisations and $1.15bn from the World Bank in its
key railway projects.

CHINA-INDIA RAIL LINK IS PROPOSED

Discussions are under way between China and India on a potentially huge
rail co-operation scheme which could form the backbone of a more
ambitious project to build a trans-Asia railway. According to a recent
report in the Asia Times, both Chinese and Indian officials are
exploring the idea of building a high-speed freight railway which would
connect India and China through Burma.

It is understood that the railway scheme was conceived by a consortium
led by China-based Upleader International. The consortium is also
believed to include China Railway Engineering and Construction
Corporation, Techrail Engineering (Malaysia), TFA (USA), and Canadian
transport specialists.

Talks between the two countries are said to have started six months
ago. 'China's government is said to support the project, hoping to
develop the country's interior provinces and to take a more dominant
role in global trade,' the newspaper said. It added that a railway
connecting India and China would 'theoretically' tie into China's
national railway in Yunnan province - which faces Burma's north-eastern
border - and run through North Korea and Russia. A southern branch of
the India-China railway could use existing tracks which run from
Singapore to Thailand through Malaysia.

One of the biggest problems if such a project were to go beyond the
feasibility stage would be gauges. China, for example, has no standard
gauge and its national rail system uses many different gauges. Thailand
and Malaysia uses narrow gauges rather than the standard-gauge tracks
that have been adopted by many countries.

SHANGHAI PLANS INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING CENTRE

Shanghai, which houses China's biggest port, has mapped out a three-
stage strategy to develop an international shipping centre over the
next two decades. Vice-mayor, Sha Lin, recently said that between 1996
and the year 2000, the city would start building the centre, initially
with a project to deepen channels at the mouth of the Yangtze River to
8.5m.

When the first stage ends, the first port will be able to handle 220m
tonnes of cargo - up from 170m tonnes last year - and move 2.5m-3m TEU
containers. Mr Sha, speaking at the Marintec China 95 symposium, said
the next stage would see the port capacity enlarged and the channel
deepened to 12.5m to accommodate container ships of over 50,000 tonnes
by 2010.

By 2020, he added, Shanghai would be able to handle super Panamax
container vessels. Shanghai would also develop new shipping and
shipbuilding industries to achieve its objective.

SHANGHAI UNVEILS NEW POLICY FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

The Shanghai municipal government is counting on new preferential
policies to help overcome the resistance of foreign construction
companies to become involved in the city's ambitious urban housing
redevelopment programme. Guaranteed after-tax returns on investment
will be limited to 15 per cent, but the main sweetener is new policies
designed to reduce the risks and red tape involved in building cheap
flats for residents.

According to Huang Yuejing, deputy general secretary of the Shanghai
municipal government, regulations allowing foreign investment in
domestic housing projects were actually issued at the end of 1993, but
did not find any takers. 'Potential investors were discouraged by the
huge outlays for demolition of old buildings, relocation of residents
and the provision of utilities, all of which took a huge bite out of
prospective profits,' he said. Foreign developers also had to team up
with local parties to buy a plot of land for re-development, and pay a
transfer fee for the rights to the land, adding to the costs and risks.

What investment there has been has tended to concentrate on luxury
housing, most of which is being snapped up by overseas buyers. The
central government is now clamping down on this type of construction in
major cities throughout the country and insisting the local authorities
switch the emphasis to low-cost mass housing. To overcome resistance,
Huang said, 'we have come up with new policies which we estimate will
save overseas investors much of their expense if they put their money
into housing projects for domestic sale rather than for overseas
buyers.'

The new approach, which applies to all foreign-investment projects in
areas with high concentrations of shabby or dangerous houses, calls for
the local authority to allocate the land to the Chinese partner in a
Sino-foreign joint venture, with the foreign side providing the
financing. Financial assistance will also be provided for the
demolition of the old homes and rehousing of residents - with the
investors only having to pay a maximum 30 per cent contribution to the
removal costs. Help is also promised for the construction of utilities,
although the exact nature and scope of the assistance has not yet been
spelt out.

The Shanghai municipal government is pledged to buy the entire housing
project when completed, and be responsible for its eventual sale. There
will be a guaranteed 15 per cent after-tax return on the investment,
which, as one developer suggested, 'effectively means the authorities
are borrowing the money from the foreign side and promising to pay 15
per cent interest.' This profit can be remitted overseas free of any of
the normal restrictions on foreign exchange.

Some 3.1m sq m of land in 114 lots has been identified by the
authorities as available for low-cost housing development with foreign
involvement. Huang is convinced there should be plenty of takers
because, 'market demand is very high as the government is determined to
increase per capita living space.' The goal is to raise this from the
present 7.5 to 10 sq m by the end of the century. Some 3.65m sq m of
dilapidated housing has to be renovated in order to meet this target.

But Shanghai does not have the capacity to raise enough financing on
its own, he stressed. Real estate analysts in the city agree the scheme
should be attractive to investors. They point out that the housing
involved will be low rise and low cost, so that companies could develop
a 'supermarket approach' in which units could be quickly assembled from
prefabricated parts. With the authorities paying on completion, the
developers can then have money available for further construction,
making projects basically self-financing once the first has been
completed.

The Shanghai approach is likely to be copied by other municipal
authorities. Beijing, for example, is reported to be considering a
similar package of financial incentives with a reported guaranteed
return of 18 per cent.

STUDY LOOKS AT DIVERTING WATER TO SUPPLY BEIJING

A feasibility study is due to be presented to the Chinese government
this month (January 1996) on a plan to channel water from the Yangtse
River basin to the drought-stricken, heavily-populated northern parts
of the country, including the capital Beijing and adjacent areas of
Hebei Province. Some 200 experts are working on the study which
involves three different channel routes.

Officials in Beijing say construction could start within the next
couple of years depending on the decision of an appraisal committee set
up under the minister of water resources, Niu Maosheng. Although there
are a number of technical problems to be overcome, analysts say the
main concerns are likely to be financial. No figure has yet been
revealed as to the possible cost.

At a recent seminar in Beijing, experts exchanged views on the
project's three different proposed routes for carrying water from the
Yangtse basin over several thousand kilometres to the northern cities
that are chronically short of water for industrial and domestic use. An
estimated 70bn cu m a year is scheduled to be siphoned off from the
Yangtse.

The so-called 'East China' route entails linking the river with the
Grand Canal. This would be the easiest option both technically and
financially, because it would utilise existing facilities. But the main
concern of experts is the environmental risk as all the region's
waterways have pollution levels far in excess of state-set limits. The
project, however, could be tied in with a current programme to persuade
foreign investors to join up with interested Chinese parties to provide
clean water supplies to the key cities of central and east China.

The "Central China" route would use the existing Danjiankou reservoir
on the Hianjiang River, a tributary of the Yangtse to the north, as the
gathering point, and then siphon off the water through a new channel to
be dug as far as Beijing.

The "West China" route is the most complicated, calling for a system of
canals linking up the headwaters of the Yangtse and the Yellow Rivers
which are quite close. This would be the most technically demanding,
calling for the construction of a 300m dam and at least 100km of
tunnels beneath some of the massive mountain ranges which dominate the
neighbouring provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai.

It is not clear how much foreign involvement there might be in the
project. But a spokesman for the ministry of water resources said it
was highly unlikely that China would have the technical or financial
means to go it alone on whichever route was chosen. The main question
to be settled is probably how to make involvement financially
attractive for foreign investors, the spokesman added.

TUMEN RIVER DEVELOPMENT INCHES FORWARD

In early December, representatives of China, the two Koreas, Russia and
Mongolia signed three agreements at the United Nations that paves the
way for the so-called second phase of development of the Tumen River
Economic Development Area (TREDA).

To be sure, the objectives of the second phase are modest. They include
the introduction of a framework for achieving 'sustainable economic and
social development' and call for the creation of a consultative
commission to promote investment, technical co-operation and
environmental protection. A separate co-ordinating committee will be
set up for trade and investment. Moreover, in an attempt to build an
organisational framework for the economic zone, member countries
consented to the establishment of a permanent secretariat.

UNDP chief, James Speth, who presided over the signing ceremony said
the second phase would benefit the poor and jobless of the region and
marked an important step in the development process. 'These initiatives
have changed the situation into a dynamic investment environment,' he
said, adding that until now the area's borders, 'tended to be barriers
rather than doors'.

Announced in 1991, the project involves ambitious plans to unlock the
resource-rich region, long cut-off from world markets and investors, by
opening up regional borders. The massive project stretches from Yanbian
and Changbaishan Mountains in China, to Nakhodia in Russia in the north
and to Chonjin in North Korea. It is intended to make the region
economically vibrant.

Major infrastructure projects planned for the area include a new port,
11 specialised harbours and a rail hub. The regional zone is to cover
an area of 200 sq km, with a population of some 150 million people. The
estimated project cost is $1bn.

MACAU: STUDY IS FINISHED TO INTEGRATE MACAU'S NEW AIRPORT

Feasibility studies have already been completed to build direct road
and high-speed rail connections costing about $1bn to Guangzhou and
Zhuhai from Macau's airport, officially opened by Portugal's president
Mario Soares at the beginning of December.

Talks are also taking place to develop an integrated transit system to
simplify customs and immigration procedures for passengers and cargo
moving between Macau, China and Hong Kong. Macau Airport company
chairman, Dr Antonio Diogo Pinto, said current plans include a $35m
high-speed ferry pier and a massive expansion of air cargo,
warehousing, office and hotel facilities at the airport.

Dr Pinto said the airport, which has only been operating since early
November, has already exceeded expectations. Twelve airlines were
making regular flights by the end of 1995, compared to the 10 that was
forecast. The Macau government has signed air services agreements with
more than 20 countries including Malaysia, Thailand, China and the US.

MASSIVE RECLAMATION IS PROPOSED FOR MACAU

Macau, Portugal's sleepy enclave on China's Pearl River estuary, will
physically grow by one quarter, if a massive $3bn reclamation project
gets the green light. The scheme, the biggest project in Macau's 500-
year existence, has been proposed by Dr Stanley Ho, a Hong Kong casino
and property magnate.

Dr Ho said the scheme will be jointly developed by his company,
Sociedade de Turismo e Diversoes de Macau and Chyau Fwu Development
Company, a Hong Kong property outfit headed by tycoon George Wong. Dr
Ho also owns Shun Tak, a property company which developed much of
Macau.

Central to Dr Ho's development is the China Macau World Trade Centre
complex of 10 hotels, a 660,000 sq m International Trade Mart and a
multi-theme park covering 700,000 sq m. The development will cover
700ha, formed by infilling the sea between Taipa and Coloane islands,
creating a new 'super-island' dubbed Cotai City by property analysts.
The initial phases of the project are due for completion in 1999 to
coincide with Macau's return to Chinese control.

Blueprints have been lodged with the Sino-Portuguese Land Group and the
Macau government's public works department and their decision is
expected in the next few months.

HONG KONG: IATA PRONOUNCES HK'S NEW AIRPORT A DISASTER

Hong Kong's new $7.7bn airport has been described as a disaster by
Pierre Jeanniot, the director general of the International Air
Transport Association (IATA). At a recent meeting with the Hong Kong
Airport Authority he said it was a 'waste of time' to open the new
airport without a second runway.

The first runway of the new international airport at Chek Lap Kok is
not expected to open for business until 1998. 'We don't see the point
in spending vast sums of money to build an airport which doesn't
increase capacity,' he said, adding that, if anything, the new airport
would constrain capacity while requiring airlines to pay higher landing
fees - landing and parking fees at Kai Tak, already stretched to
capacity, have increased 28 per cent over the last three years making
it one of the most expensive in the world. IATA's views on the second
runway are shared by Hong Kong's main carrier, Cathay Pacific.

Gordon Sui, secretary for economic services, denied the IATA claim.
'The new airport will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, unlike
Kai Tak which is severely restricted by a curfew,' he said recently.
'Even with one runway, existing capacity at the new airport will be
increased from 26 million passengers to 36 million passengers per
year.' Sui also said there had never been any suggestion to build one
runway at Chek Lap Kok. 'The new airport was designed for two runways
and that is exactly what the new airport will have. The opening of a
second runway will be a matter of timing.' He said the government will
be looking at the traffic flow at the new airport before making a final
decision.

Jeanniot said he thought there may be another reason for the
government's reluctance to open the airport with two runways. 'There
seems to be a paralysis in the decision-making process. A feeling that
it is more political than anything else.' The airport project, the
largest single engineering project in the world, has been at the centre
of a fierce political debate between China and Britain since it was
announced in 1989 by the former governor, Sir David Wilson.

That debate has cooled down somewhat and in early December Britain and
China agreed to drop the 'provisional' from the Provisional Airport
Authority. It was seen as a major turning point in the massive project.
Not only is Hong Kong getting a new airport it is also getting the
infrastructure investment that goes with it - a new bridge linking
Kowloon to Lantau Island, massive reclamation to support a highway, and
a rail link to Hong Kong and Kowloon with property developments
springing up around the new stations.

From December 1, 1995 the Airport Authority took over from the
Provisional Airport Authority with pro-China businessman, Wong Po-yan,
at the helm. Recently it went to the market for a massive HK$8.2bn
($1.06bn) syndicated loan and revolving credit. The loan consists of a
HK$6.4bn ($872m) loan and a HK$1.8bn ($233m) revolving facility. The
authority will pay an interest rate of 43 basis points (0.43 percentage
point) above the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate for both tranches of
the loan. The Airport Authority was permitted to borrow an additional
HK$3.4bn ($440m) under Sino-British agreements.

In January the Monetary Authority signed an agreement to act as
arranging agent for the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) for a
HK$10bn ($1.3bn) note-issuance facility. The Airport Authority has said
it would find such a facility attractive if it carried access to the
Monetary Authority's liquidity adjustment facility. The Airport
Authority's issues would be of shorter maturities than the MTRC issues
because it has to pay off the first part of the project by the end of
2001.

Standard Chartered Bank recently described Hong Kong's existing
international airport as 'an indispensable piece of infrastructure
promoting the territory's rapid economic growth.' But Kai Tak has
reached its full capacity. Between now and the opening day of the new
airport, Kai Tak will become more and more congested. 'An efficient
airport is part and parcel of Hong Kong's competitive advantage in
serving as a business centre for the Asia-Pacific region as well as for
China,' the bank said. It has been estimated that any further delays on
the new airport could cost Hong Kong dearly. Failure to meet projected
rising demand for air transport could cost the territory HK$420bn
($54bn) between 1997 and 2010 the bank said.

More than 20 per cent of aircraft movements at Kai Tak either originate
in China or are destined for the mainland. Kai Tak has proved a
lucrative investment for the Hong Kong government, paying after-tax
returns on average net fixed assets in 1991 of 29 percent.

HONG KONG: CONTRACTORS FACE PROBLEMS MEETING CLK'S DEADLINES

Construction of the $1.3bn terminal building at Hong Kong's new airport
at Chek Lap Kok is running more than four months behind schedule even
though the job has been going for just 11 months. The Airport Authority
(AA) said the problems stemmed from earlier delays on the foundations
which were five months late and difficulties faced by the terminal
contractor, BCJ joint venture, mobilising sufficient staff and
equipment. AA corporate development director, Clinton Leeks, said the
Authority is confident the lost time can be clawed back and the airport
'remains on target for substantial completion by mid-1997.' The airport
is due to open in April 1998.

A revised construction schedule has been agreed with BCJ, a consortium
formed by Balfour Beatty and Amec of Britain, Maeda of Japan, Kumagai
Gumi (Hong Kong) and China State Construction Engineering Corporation,
to get the project back on track.

A construction director, Alistair Thomson, said there has also been
mobilisation and ground water problems on the $86m airfield tunnels
contract being undertaken by the UK's Alfred McAlpine, Downer of New
Zealand and Paul Y of Hong Kong. Work was held up for several weeks,
although the contract is back on schedule.

Industry insiders say the difficulties stem from the fast-track nature
of the airport project. 'The AA wants contractors to start as soon as
the contract is agreed on day one. Its just not possible. It takes time
to get staff to Hong Kong and organise the massive amounts of equipment
needed,' commented one construction chief. 'There is also a limit to
how much construction can physically be done. The contract periods are
unrealistic. The foundations are a case in point. Heavy rains probably
held the job up by two months, but the remaining three month delay was
largely caused because the contractor couldn't go any faster,' he
added.

HONG KONG: OPPORTUNITIES ARISE FROM CLK'S PRIVATE FACILITIES

Construction of the privately financed facilities at Chek Lap Kok,
including cargo handling and aircraft maintenance, got off to a flying
start with key awards for design work going mainly to British firms.
One of the biggest schemes is the $1bn construction of the world's
largest air cargo complex by Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals. Work
involves a six-storey main building totalling 274,000 sq m and a 46,000
sq m two-storey express cargo centre.

The lead building consultant is Ove Arup who are working in tandem with
Foster Asia as the architectural sub-consultants. British Steel (Asia)
is to supply 53,550 tonnes of steel piles for foundations specialist
Franki Contractors, owned by Germany's Bilfinger & Berger. The main
construction is being done by Hong Kong's Gammon Construction, which is
jointly owned by Trafalgar House and Jardine Pacific.

Cathay Pacific Catering Services (CPCS) has chosen Scott Wilson
Kirkpatrick as the structural and civil consultants for its $200m in-
flight catering facility, one of three planned at the airport. Other
consultancy awards for the 56,000 sq m three-storey building include US
engineers, Parsons Brinckerhoff Asia who are acting as the mechanical
and electrical consultants and local firms Davis Langdon and Seah who
have been appointed as the quantity surveyors and Wong Tung & Partners
are the architects. The foundations will be undertaken by the local
firm, Shui On.

Six contractors - Dragages (French), Paul Y/Downer, Gammon, Hsin Chong,
Hip Hing and Shui On (all Hong Kong) - are having their bids for the
main building contract evaluated by the CPCS project team which hopes
to award the contract in January.

The facility is one of three in-flight kitchens planned at CLK. Others
will be build by LSG-Lufthansa Sky Chefs and Switzerland's Gate Gourmet
International, although consultants are only just being appointed.

The next key project is a $435m headquarters and hotel development for
Cathay Pacific Airways. The architects are Llewelyn-Davis with Harris
and Sutherland acting as structural consultants and Widnell as the
quantity surveyors. Bids for the foundations will be invited early next
year. The construction work, which has been split into four phases,
includes a 10-storey, 69,000 sq m reinforced concrete frame, glass
curtain wall clad office building and a 25-storey, 23,000 sq m, 500 bed
staff hotel.

Other private facilities include a second air cargo centre which is
planned by Asia Air Freight Terminals - a joint venture comprising
mainly Singaporean companies. The main consultants on the 22,000 sq m
scheme are Jones Lang Wootton Building Consultancy. The Hong Kong firm,
Liang Peddle Thorp are the architects, but the client has refused to
name the other firms involved. Piling contractors have just been asked
to prequalify.

There has been a reluctance by Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering, the
company undertaking aircraft maintenance, to name the professional team
who will advise on a massive hanger capable of handling three jumbo
jets side by side.

Other projects are far less advanced. These include the aviation fuel
system awarded to Aviation Fuel Supply which is led by Cathay Pacific
Airways, aircraft line maintenance which will be undertaken by Pan Asia
Pacific Aviation Services and China Aircraft Services, a 600-bed
airport hotel franchised to Regal Hotels, and a freight forwarding
centre being developed by Sun Hung Kai Properties.

HONG KONG: PLANS SUBMITTED TO EXTEND HK'S RAPID TRANSIT RAIL

Detailed financial and project plans for a $2.5bn extension to the
rapid transit rail system will be submitted to the Hong Kong government
by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation early in 1996. MTRC project
director, Russell Black, said proposals for the first part of the
extension, a 2km tunnel to provide an easier passenger connection
between the Kwun Tong and Island Lines will be lodged in January. Those
for the second section, involving 9km of new track and six stations
from Lam Tin, on the Kwun Tong line, to Tseung Kwan O, will be sent to
the government in March.

The reports will contain construction estimates, projected passenger
revenue and proposed completion dates. Work on both is due to start in
1998. The MTRC has recently invited consultants to prequalify for
design following the completion of the feasibility study by Maunsell
Consultants Asia.

TAIWAN: SMALL PRINT LEADS TO TUNNEL CONTRACT TERMINATION

Accusations between Taiwan Ret-Ser Engineering and France's Spie
Battignolles TP (SB) threaten to further delay the completion of the
31km Taipei-Ilan Expressway. The dispute is a result of the termination
of a tunnelling contract between the two companies.

Touted as the 'key to the success of the project,' by the ministry of
transportation and communication's (MOTC) Taiwan Area National
Expressway Engineering Bureau (TANEEB), the 12.9km Pinglin Tunnel has
yet to be started. In a contract signed in October 1993, Ret-Ser sub-
contracted the building of the tunnel to SB. However, the contract
required Ret-Ser to build a 12.9km pilot tunnel. Although construction
on the pilot tunnel began in July 1991, only 1.5km was completed by the
proposed date of March 25, 1995.

'Poor geological conditions is the reason for the delay,' said Ret-
Ser's department of special projects director, Tsai Hsi-chi. He
explained that the $1m tunnel boring machine (TBM), used by Ret-Ser for
the first time, got stuck on numerous occasions, the most recent
incident halting work for a nine month stretch. In addition, water
inflow to the tunnel was more than triple the maximum safe operating
limit of 35 litres per second which halted work.

TANEEB has already approved a 300-day extension for Ret-Ser to complete
the pilot tunnel, but Ret-Ser is currently preparing more documents to
apply for a further 365 day extension in the near future, said Ret-Ser
executive vice president, Shen Ching-peng.

Despite the non-completion of the pilot tunnel Ret-Ser asked SB to
begin tunnelling on the main tunnel. SB refused claiming the work would
be a safety hazard and could result in unforeseen problems and delays
without all the geological data gleaned from the completion of the
pilot tunnel. SB project manager, Olivier Colin, likened the situation
to the construction of a house - the foundations must be completed
before construction can proceed. 'We proposed a number of alternative
construction methods for the main tunnel without geological data from
the pilot tunnel, but this was rejected by Ret-Ser,' he said.

The French sub-contractor has now filed a civil suit accusing Ret-Ser
of wrongful termination of the $50m contract after failing to re-
negotiate the price on the original contract. SB have asserted that Ret-
Ser's delay on the completion of the pilot tunnel has resulted in
increased cost and time, thus requiring a revised amount in the new
contract. SB claimed that it stated as a pre-condition in the Request
for Proposal three years ago that the quote on the tunnel project was
based on the completion of the pilot tunnel. Ret-Ser maintains that
there were no clauses in the contract that stated the pilot tunnel must
be completed before SB begins boring the main tunnel.

Ret-Ser's Tsai has also asserted that a change in identity of SB is the
main reason for terminating the contract. The original sub-contractor
was the 150-year-old Spie Battignolles that in July became 'Spie
Battignolles TP' after a restructure and recapitalisation in a merger
between Spie Battignolles and its parent company Schneider. 'According
to Taiwan law, the name on the contract cannot be changed. SB is not
the one who entered into the contract,' said Shen.

Ret-Ser further allege that SB provided inadequate documentation on the
'new company.' Ret-Ser says it is unable to ascertain that the new SB
meets the requirements under the Pre-Qualification list, a factor that
first won Spie Battignolles the contract. Further negotiations with
Schneider proved futile as the parent company refused to act as
guarantor for SB, said Shen.

According to Colin, SB is still the same company as the name on the
contract. The 'TP' or 'Civil Works' was added to the name to emphasise
its focus on civil construction, he said. SB's capital was boosted from
about $40m to around $161m after the merger with Schneider. 'SB's
recapitalisation made the company stronger. A change of name was just
an excuse from Ret-Ser to terminate the contract,' he added.

SB's official spokesperson, C. P. Chen, has said that another problem
behind the dispute is that many local companies still operate in the
'Chinese Way'. 'Political and cultural differences stand in the way of
productive co-operation between local and foreign companies,' he said.

An example of the 'Chinese Way' was Ret-Ser's forcible take-over of
SB's construction and office facilities in mid-November. SB
subsequently lodged a criminal complaint to the Ilan district
prosecutor's office which is currently investigating the case. 'It is
true that the three TBMs are the assets of TANEEB and Ret-Ser during
the construction, but checking SB employee's passports and confiscating
the company's accounts, geological data and documents is unreasonable
and illegal according to our lawyer,' said Chen. He agreed that SB was
in for a tough legal battle against the government-owned Ret-Ser,
technically a department under the Executive Yuan (Cabinet)'s
Vocational Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen, rather than a
state-owned enterprise. 'But SB is willing to take on that challenge to
protect its own interest,' Chen added.

Colin sees the cause of the dispute as a simple case of shirking
responsibilities. 'The only reason Ret-Ser terminated the contract is
to hide the fact that they cannot finish the project and to escape
their responsibility. They desperately needed a scapegoat, and as it is
around election time, SB became that ideal scapegoat.'

However, Spie Battignolle has previously acted as the sub-contractor to
Ret-Ser for projects in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Bahrain which have
been successful according to Colin. 'SB had a good working relationship
and worked in total confidence with Ret-Ser - that is why we came over
to Taiwan. SB will work again in Taiwan if a new opportunity arises and
conditions are different. We will be more prudent, since we are not the
only company that have problems with government agencies. The
construction business can be bad and risky but not everything can be
100 per cent covered on paper. A lot of working relationship is based
on trust,' he said.

Meanwhile, Ret-Ser is in discussion with Italy's Torno about completing
the Pinglin Tunnel. The Italian construction company has already won a
bid to work on a 4.8km tunnel, also on the Taipei-Ilan Expressway.
Torno was one of the two companies that expressed interest in the
Pinglin Tunnel out of eight companies that put in a Request for
Proposal. Shen said that Ret-Ser will approach the remaining six
companies individually to find a new sub-contractor to finish the
project.

PHILIPPINES: BARRIERS ARE OVERCOME FOR LRT-3

One of Manila's light rail transit schemes has finally cleared
financial, political and legal barriers. It now seems that the project,
known as LRT-3, can go ahead unimpeded.

Senator Franciso Tatad and other opponents had tried to stop the
project, but the Supreme Court has thrown out their petition.

The concessionaires, led by Fil-Estate and Ayala have raised $150m as
initial paid-up capital. They have appointed JP Morgan as their
financial advisor, and are looking to raise a further $100m and to
float $300m worth of debt instruments on the international capital
markets. Domestic banks (local and foreign) have agreed to provide the
remaining $100m of the total $650m that is required.

The last problem was posed by the so-called 'Save Edsa Movement', led
by columnist Antonio Abaya and supported by the Philippine Motor
Association. Edsa is an acronym for the road along which LRT-3 will
run. The movement objected to the traffic chaos that will be created
when the work is undertaken. It initially proposed an alternative route
for LRT-3, along Circumferential Road No. 5, which runs parallel to
Edsa. However, it has softened its stance and is amendable to the route
along Edsa, as long as alternative routes are provided for vehicles
before construction commences.

INDONESIA: ELABORATE LRT PLANS ARE ANNOUNCED FOR JAKARTA

In the middle of December, 1995, PT Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada (CLGP)
suddenly announced an elaborate extension to its plans for a light rail
system in Jakarta. It has now said it will spend $1.2bn on a three-
level transport artery in Jakarta, comprised of a public road on the
ground, a light rail line above that and a toll road on the top. The
structure is to cover a distance of 16km between Bintaro in south
Jakarta, downtown Kota in north Jakarta, and a further 2km from Bintaro
to Blok M, also in south Jakarta.

Company chief executive, Bambang Soeroso, said that a consortium would
be formed in May 1996 to carry out the project and finance would be
arranged. CLGP spokesman, Fariza Irawadi, said that the light-rail
aspect of the venture was almost certain to require the participation
of one or more foreign partners. 'Up to now we haven't had any
experience in this country with light rail,' he told AIM. He added that
the company's considerable experience in elevated toll road
construction meant that overseas expertise was unlikely to be needed
for the remainder of the project. Fariza would not be drawn on the
composition of the consortium, but confirmed that several foreign
companies have expressed interest.

He said the plan had not yet been completed and that there might still
be further administrative 'input' on the scheme. 'After that the final
engineering design will be prepared. It will be finished in one year,
with construction beginning in 1997,' he said.

Only in November the plan was still known to the public as entailing
the construction of a light-rail simpliciter. At the beginning of
November, director general of highway construction, Soeharsono
Martakim, said that construction of the light rail line, at that time
still known as the Light Rapid Transit (LRT) system, would begin in
April 1996. In mid-November, when the project carried a price tag of
$800m, minister of transportation, Haryanto Dhanutirto, said that the
LRT would be carried out by CLGP in co-operation with Steady Safe, the
owner of a city taxi business.

The project outline has changed extensively, but what has stayed the
same is that it remains in the hands of CLGP which is controlled by the
president's daughter. The company remains the major private-sector
investor in Indonesian toll roads. It has also built tolls roads in
Malaysia and is preparing to undertake two large toll road projects in
the Philippines.

The Jakarta light rail project was awarded to CLGP early this year
without a tender. Commenting on the fact recently, Haryanto said it
followed because the project had been proposed to the government by the
company. In August, Ms Rukmana publicly denied that her company's
success in gaining infrastructure projects was related to her close
relationship with the president. 'My father, who happens to be trusted
by the people to lead the nation, has always reminded me not to use his
name for business purposes,' she told a local newspaper.

On December 16, 1995, CLGP's subsidiary, Citra Bhakti Margatama Persada
(CBMP) broke ground on the Cikunir-Cakung-Cilicing-Tanjung Priok
section of Jakarta's Outer Ring Road. The 1,920km section of toll road
is scheduled to be operational in 1999, at an investment of Rp1,040m
($4.5bn). Company representatives said the project would be financed
with loans from domestic banks. CBMP is a BOT joint venture between
state-owned toll road company Jasa Marga (34.83 per cent) and CLGP,
Tridan Satriaputra Indonesia, Bhaskara Duniajaya and Yayasan Tiara
Indah. Consultants on the project include Pacific Consultant
International and BIEC International.

BATAM AIRPORT IS UPGRADED TO RIVAL SINGAPORE

Indonesia has started construction of an aircraft maintenance facility
and upgraded the international airport on the island of Batam in a bid
to rival Singapore's Changi airport's role as an international flight
hub for the south-east Asian region. Batam island, which lies a few
kilometres south of Singapore, is being developed as an industrial and
tourist centre together with the Singapore government authorities. The
island's airport already serves as a centre for cargo traffic for
industrial estates located there.

Batam's Hang Nadim airport, controlled by the Indonesian government
through the Batam Industrial Development Authority, has had its runway
extended to 4km at a cost of about $217m. It can now accommodate wide-
bodied aircraft such as Boeing 747-400s.

Construction of an aircraft maintenance and services facility has also
started. PT BAM, or Batam Aircraft Maintenance, located adjacent to
Batam's airport, is scheduled to complete a hangar at a cost of Rp18bn
($7.9m) by the end of 1996. It is hoped that BAM's services will help
lure customers away from Singapore's Changi airport. The maintenance
facility is being built to handle different types of aircraft including
Boeing 737 jets, Fokker planes and Indonesian-built CN 235s. BAM is
majority-owned by Indonesian entities including the state-owned
aircraft manufacturing company, IPTN, and Sempati Air, a private
domestic airline controlled by one of President Suharto's sons.

However, Singapore Technologies Aerospace, a unit of the Singapore
government's Singapore Technologies, also has a 25 per cent stake in
BAM. Singapore Technologies Aerospace is originally believed to have
wanted to take a majority stake in the project, a move which was
opposed by Indonesia's minister for research and technology, Mr B.J.
Habibie. As chairman of the Batam Industrial Development Authority, Mr
Habibie is closely involved with the island's progress.

Batam's goal is to become an international aviation hub. Aviation fuel
is about 20 per cent less expensive on Batam than in Singapore.
However, Singapore's Changi airport controls flight information in
parts of Indonesian airspace, including Batam. The latter has been a
point of some friction between Indonesia and Singapore, although the
boundaries of flight information regions were revised in September 1995
when President Suharto made an official visit to Singapore.

Indonesia was given control of air traffic services over an additional
space stretching from south of its islands of Sumatra to the Natuna
islands in the South China Sea but Singapore's Changi airport retains
supervision of aircraft movements from airports in Batam and
neighbouring Bintan.

The Indonesian authorities want Batam's Hang Nadim airport to act as a
transit and connecting point for international flights. However,
Indonesian officials admit this is still a long way off. 'It is still
hard for international air carriers to transit at Hang Nadim, as the
flow of goods and passengers is still low,' the director general of air
transportation, Mr Zainuddin Sikado, was quoted as saying in the
Jakarta Post. 'The most important thing will be how Batam improves the
quality of its services.'

Currently, there are no international flights to Batam, although eleven
domestic flights connect Batam to other airports throughout the
Indonesian archipelago. Local press reports said that by the end of
1999 twelve additional domestic routes are due to be served from Hang
Nadim.

SINGAPORE DECIDES TO LIST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS

Singapore's finance minister, Dr Richard Hu, has just announced the
creation of a foreign board for listing regional infrastructure
projects on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES). The listing criteria
of the foreign board are less stringent than those for the main board.
Infrastructure projects do not require a profit record, they need only
show potential for a reasonable rate of return and good cash flow
'vouched by competent and independent experts.'

For analysts the comparisons with Malaysia are unavoidable. In
September, the Securities Commission there issued a set of
comprehensive guidelines that paved the way for infrastructure projects
to be listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). Unlike
conventional initial public offerings, the guidelines stated that
infrastructure project companies (IPCs), which have long gestation
periods, can offer their shares based on forecast earnings, even if
they do not have a profit record.

Candidates for a listing on the KLSE are likely to include Ekran
Corporation's M$15bn ($5.9bn) Bakun hydroelectric project in Sarawak
and the five independent producers. More recently, Malaysia's finance
minister, Anwar Ibrahim, said Malaysia may allow foreign infrastructure
companies controlled by Malaysians to list their shares on the KLSE.

The Singapore guidelines state that infrastructure companies wishing to
list on the proposed new foreign board must have secured projects worth
at least S$300m ($212m). These projects must have a remaining lifespan
of at least 15 years from the date of listing, though companies with
concessions of at least 10 years will also be considered.

'Companies engaged in infrastructure projects need not show profits in
the financial year before listing, nor any record of prior profits, but
they must demonstrate strong cash-flow and a good rate of return over
the duration of the concession,' the SES said in a statement last week.
By comparison, Singapore-incorporated non-infrastructure companies must
have a paid-up capital of S$15m ($10.6m) and cumulative pre-tax profit
of at least S$7.5m ($5.3m) for the last two years, of which S$3m must
be chalked up in the latest year prior to listing. Alternatively, these
companies can be considered if they show a pre-tax profit of at least
S$10m ($7.1m) for the latest year.

'As companies listed on the foreign board are expected to have shorter
track records, investment in these securities may entail additional
risk,' the SES said. 'Warning about the risks specific to such
companies will be required and such warning must be prominently
displayed on the front cover of the prospectus.'

The shares of these companies will be quoted in a foreign currency and
traded in minimum board lot sizes of $2000 or the equivalent. The SES
has also introduced a moratorium requiring company owners to hold their
shareholding for a year after listing. Although they can sell some of
their stake in the subsequent two years, they must hold at least 51 per
cent of the total shares that they had at the time of the listing.

'At least one promoter holding at least 20 per cent of the pre-
floatation issued capital must have the relevant technical management
expertise to carry out and operate the project successfully and to
fulfil all requirements of the project,' the SES said. Companies listed
on the foreign board can transfer to the main board after one year.
However, they have to meet the latter's more stringent listing
criteria. Analysts have welcomed the establishment of the new board,
the third on the local bourse. They say the new board will help raise
the stature of Singapore as a leading regional financial centre.

One investment banker said, 'the new board could attract to Singapore
many large regional companies which are currently contemplating raising
capital in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sydney,' he said. 'However the shares
of companies listing on the foreign board are expected to be targeted
mainly at institutional buyers'.

THAILAND: BTS MASS TRANSIT OWNERSHIP IS RESTRUCTURED

Tanayong, the concessionaire for Bangkok's elevated rail transit, will
issue $160m worth of secured bonds as part of a shareholder
restructuring, as doubts continue to grow over its financial status.
The listed real estate firm reported in a mandatory stock market filing
that details of the issue price, collateral and launch time would be
released at a later date.

Talks have also opened with Thai-based Siam Commercial Bank on a
planned mobilisation of $562m from local capital markets, which will
form the core of financing for the $1.7bn project. It has already
secured a $50m loan from the International Finance Corporation and
hopes to raise a further $424m from KFW of Germany. 'We understand
contracts for the loans will be signed around the end of the year
(1995) and payment will be made in full to contractors shortly
afterwards,' said a banking executive.

Piling work on the 24km Bangkok Transit System railway began a year ago
but Tanayong has yet to come up with a funding package. Primarily a
developer of low-cost housing estates, it has been heavily affected by
a downturn in the property market and is regarded as having virtually a
zero credit rating. Bangkok Bank resigned as financial adviser earlier
this year after declining to guarantee a loans package. Its
replacement, Siam Commercial Bank, is insisting on a shareholder
restructuring that will bring in equipment suppliers and contractors on
an equity basis.

Italian-Thai Development, the sole construction contractor, has not
been paid since work started, and is expected to hold a 10 to 15 per
cent stake. 'The construction cost of the BTS skytrain is around Bt4m-
Bt5m ($160,000-$200,000) a month. We have received only Bt200m ($8m)
from Tanayong, while the value of work completed is around Bt1.86bn
($74.4m),' said company president, Premchai Karnsauta.

Siemens, the main equipment supplier, and Siam Commercial are expected
to be the other shareholders. Tanayong has agreed to reduce its stake
to 60 per cent, after attempts to push it into a minority role were
thwarted by contractual obligations. This will block efforts to raise
cash by listing the project on the stock exchange, as market rules
require a larger public shareholding. However, another attempt will be
made to diminish Tanayong's stake when its four-year concession
expires.

A Siam Commercial spokesman confirmed that 10 financial institutions
had been approached to join the domestic loans deal, which the bank
will guarantee in the absence of security from Tanayong. The local
package replaced earlier plans for an issue of US Yankee bonds that was
scuttled by bank worries over foreign exchange fluctuations.

Any further delays in putting together a loans package will almost
certainly force a halt in work on the mass transit, which depends
heavily upon the patience of Italian-Thai. About 12 per cent of the
piling work has been finished. 'We will continue to do advance work for
BTS in the next year. That is, we will wait until BTS is ready to pay,'
said Premchai, 'obviously Italian-Thai cannot be expected to continue
on the present basis.' The construction firm is issuing Bt4.9bn ($196m)
worth of bonds to pay for its shares acquisition.

GOVERNMENT RECEIVES OECF LOAN FOR MASS TRANSIT

Japan's Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund (OECF) has approved a $200m
low-interest loan for the Bangkok subway project, providing the first
cash injection for the mass transit. Metropolitan Rapid Transit
Authority (MRTA) director, Theerapong Attajarusit, said a contract
would be signed in the second half of next year for the loan, which
will help pay for civil construction work. It will carry interest of
2.7 per cent with a seven-year grace period.

The government is paying for 80 per cent of the cost of the 21km
railway, with the remaining equity coming from equipment suppliers.
Consultants were due to complete a blueprint for the scheme in December
and formal bids for the construction are expected to be called by
February. A shortlist of eligible contractors, chosen from 28 consortia
that sought pre-qualification status in October, will be released
shortly before bidding starts.

HOPEWELL SEEKS OFFSHORE LOANS TO RAISE FINANCE

Hopewell Holdings will try to raise $2.16bn from offshore loans to
finance its stalled elevated mass transit, after receiving government
assurances that the scheme would not be scrapped - yet.

Project co-ordinator, Anusak Intharapuwasak, confirmed that the group
was holding talks with Hongkong and Shanghai Bank Citibank and Mitsui
Trust and Banking for two-thirds of the funding needed for the $3.2bn
project. The remaining funds will come from Hopewell itself. 'The
negotiations are expected to be concluded early next year (1996). These
talks are still going on because Hopewell has just received the
construction designs, which have to be presented to the creditors,' he
said.

Transport Minister, Wan Muhammad, earlier granted Hopewell another two
months to show definite progress on the scheme, amid speculation that
it would be scrapped. He said that unspecified action would be taken
against the firm if it failed to meet the deadline, citing a two-year
delay in completion of the first phase. 'We will decide at that time
what steps can be taken, including the possible cancellation. But at
present we hope that won't be necessary,' he said.

The project was approved five years ago as a multi-level combination of
expressways and railways built above an old freight train line, but has
since made little progress. The Hong Kong firm blames the government
agencies' delays in handing over land holdings and ironing out design
problems, while the government charges that the contract was poorly
devised.

Originally intended to extend 60km, the route is likely to be reduced
by at least one-third because of obstructions that cannot be cleared.
Anusak said the first stage, from Don Muang airport to Yommarat in
central Bangkok, was due to be completed in early December, but only 7
per cent of the work had been carried out. Hopewell now plans to finish
a tollway covering all three phases in time for the 1988 Asian Games,
and the remaining work two years later.

But a transport ministry adviser, Gun Nagamati, said this deadline
would be almost impossible to meet because detailed designs for the
route were incomplete. 'There are conflict points with four expressway
routes that have to be resolved and no one has decided who will pay for
the additional construction costs from the necessary design changes.
This will take a further 12 months to sort out,' he said. Hopewell is
reported to be seeking a buyer for 25 per cent of the project (AIM,
December 1995/p14).

INDIA IS UNLIKELY TO USE WORLD BANK LOAN FOR ROADS

A $206m World Bank loan for upgrading sections of the Delhi-Calcutta
highway may not be used by the surface transport ministry. This is
because it is unable to provide 25 to 30 per cent of the loan's annual
release from its own resources. For this fiscal year the budget for
roads is just Rs3.66bn ($105m), which is not even sufficient to repair
the existing roads.

The surface transport ministry feels that unless the finance ministry
gives it an additional grant for these counterpart provisions, it will
not be able to draw on the World Bank loan. Once the ministry commits
itself to drawing the loan it has to pay commitment fees, even if it
does not finally draw on the loan. The proposed loan was the third
tranche of the World Bank loan for Indian highways. It was meant for
widening and building bridges along the 1,100km Delhi-Calcutta national
highway. After feasibility studies and the project reports global
tenders are normally called for.

The second tranche of $200m has been partly used for the national
highways projects in six states - Punjab, Haryana, Orissa, West Bengal,
Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Of the $200m, only half the amount has
so far been used mainly because the ministry of surface transport was
unable to get the counterpart funds.

JNPT INVITES BIDS FOR CONTAINER TERMINAL

The latest privatisation plans of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust
(JNPT), across the harbour from Bombay, began with the port authorities
inviting tenders for two container berths. The new berths are expected
to cost between $150m and $180m, and will be tendered for on a build-
operate-transfer (BOT) basis for 20 years.

The tenders will have a technical bid and a financial bid. The
technical bids will include 'concept plans' as spelled out in the bid
documents. The financial bid will have to specify a one-time down
payment as a license fee, the royalty on each container handled and
guarantee a minimum annual throughput of containers. If this is not met
the contract would be in default. Only if the technical bids are
accepted will the financial bids be opened. After 20 years the two
container berths and ancillary facilities will revert back to the JNPT
at a depreciated value defined in the tender document.

The qualifying criteria for bids are as follows:

- companies must have over three year's experience of operating and
managing marine container terminals with an annual throughput of
500,000 TEU or more, using state-of-the-art equipment. Average
productivity of quayside cranes over three years of continuous actual
operations must be over 20 moves per hour;

- the average annual turnover of the bidders over the past three years
should be over $100m and paid-up capital of the company registered by
the bidders should be over $33m;

- the bidders should have adequate experience in the marketing and
development of international seaborne trade and sufficient expertise
available for efficient operation of a port-related container freight
station;

- the bidders need not have an Indian partner but the party finally
selected will have to be registered in India.

The tenders are to be submitted by April 19, 1996, and will be awarded
by the end of 1996. Work should be completed within three years. Mr
Shukla, port planning and development manager at the JNPT, expects the
bids will interest the 15 to 20 companies world-wide which have the
experience.

Opening of technical bids:                   19 April, 3pm
Earnest money deposits on submission of bids:        Rs10m

The scope of the work involves the construction of two berths with a
total length of 450m to the north of the existing three container
terminals, and the development of container yards on 20ha of land to
store 15,000 to 20,000 containers. The two new berths are expected to
have a throughput of 470,000 TEU in the sixth year of operation. In the
last fiscal year (1994-95) the three existing container terminals of
the JNPT handled 240,000 TEU which is expected to go up to 400,000 TEU
by 1996-97. The berths should take third generation container ships of
12m draft. The minimum equipment required will be four cranes for
berths, each costing around $30m to $32m and capable of 70,000 to
80,000 moves a year, 10 cranes in the yard, and two cranes in the
railway yard. Similarly successful bidders must have operated quayside
cranes for three years with an average productivity of not less than 20
moves an hour, whilst the present highest crane productivity at JNPT
has been 12.2 moves an hour.

At present the turnaround time for container ships at JNPT is under 48
hours and containers lie in their yards for an average of one week. The
operating efficiency of the new container berths will have to be
considerably higher if they are to meet the throughput requirements of
JNPT.

Earlier plans for privatising the existing three container berths met
with political opposition and were dropped by the surface transport
ministry which is responsible for ports in the country.

Shukla says that the environmental clearance for five berths at a new
chemical terminal is expected to be passed within a couple of months.
Tenders for building the chemical berths and supporting facilities on a
BOT basis will follow soon after. When approved, this new terminal,
south of the existing bulk terminal at JNPT will boost the port's
capacity considerably. Shukla expects the chemical terminal to be
handling around 18m tonnes of bulk chemicals in another decade, making
it the largest in the country. For the moment, however, action is
centred on the bids for the container berths.

TENDERS ARE INVITED FOR ENNORE PORT PROJECT

Under an Asian Development Bank (ADB)-aided project, the new Ennore
port project of the Madras Port Trust has invited prequalification
tenders. The tenders are open to contractors from eligible member
countries of the ADB. The Ennore port is being built to handle coal,
and the prequalification tenders are preliminary to the actual bidding
for the works. The major works for which tenders have been invited are:

- dredging of the entrance channel and port basin of Ennore;

- construction of a wharf; and

- the construction of two breakwaters totalling 4km.

For the dredging works, approximately 9.7m cu m of sand and clay will
have to be removed from the port basin to a depth of 15.5m and another
3.2m cu m from the entrance channel. The contractors will have to
supply all the dredging, pumping, and earthmoving equipment and will
have to dispose of the dredged material within 5km of the site.

The construction of the wharf for coal unloading will be 550m by 26m in
water depths ranging from 3m to 7m. There will also be the construction
of three small jetties and the building of three approach bridges, one

BIDS CALLED FOR KARACHI'S WORLD TRADE CENTRE

The communications ministry has thrown a spanner in the Karachi Port
Trust's (KPT) ambitious multi-million dollar project to build a World
Trade Centre in the port city of Karachi and has instructed the client,
Karachi Port Foundation (KPF), to invite bids instead of awarding the
$100m contract to Promet Engineering of Singapore. The directive was
issued to KPT and KPF after protests from the US World Trade Centre in
New York, which claimed that it has contractual and legal rights to
construct the centre.

The permanent secretary at the communications ministry, Sher Afghan
Khan, informed the KPT of the government's decision and asked it to
prepare tender documents and have them published in local and
international dailies. He said the lowest bidder who also fulfils the
requisite terms and conditions, and has a solid financial background,
should be given the chance to build the World Trade Centre in a joint
venture with the Karachi Port Foundation. The KPT says that it hopes to
float tenders by the end of December, 1995.

Promet Engineering was so convinced that it had won the contract that a
number of experts from the firm's Singapore office have visited Karachi
on several occasions, inspected the site of the project, and held
numerous meetings with officials of the KPT. A memorandum of agreement
was recently signed between Promet Engineering and the KPT, inter alia
development of a container terminal, entertainment and recreational
facilities, a T-head jetty, transhipment and other port-related
facilities at Karachi port. According to plans prepared by the Karachi
Port Foundation, the trade centre complex will comprise of office
blocks for shipping companies, insurance firms, banks and international
trade institutions.

FINAL AGREEMENT IS DUE TO BE SIGNED FOR MASS TRANSIT

Canada's SNC-Lavalin, in a joint venture with Turkey's STFA and
Pakistan's Adamjee, is to construct the $500m, 15.2km, Corridor I of
the much-delayed Karachi Mass Transit project. They will sign the
agreement with the client, Islamabad-based National Mass Transit
Authority (NMTA), on January 17, 1996, according to sources close to
the joint venture. They said the delay was caused due to the financial
close and minor 'hiccups'.

The consortium was issued with a letter of intent by NMTA in November.
The project will be built on a build-operate-transfer basis and will
take two years to complete. Work is scheduled to start in early 1996.
The NMTA has decided to finance $163m of the scheme from its own
resources after it got 'fed-up' by the World Bank's foot dragging. The
donor agency had promised to provide a loan for the project but found
'too many inconsistencies'. The route alignment has had to be changed
several times in order to avoid densely populated areas along the
route, which runs from Mereweather Tower to Sohrab Goth. Pakistan
Railways has issued a 'no-objection certificate' to NMTA to ward off
criticism from environmentalists.

Meanwhile, bids for Corridor II of the light rail scheme are scheduled
to be opened in January 1996, sources close to the government said. A
number of international companies are reported to have pre-qualified
but were not named.

CONTROVERSIAL WINNER FOR SUKKUR BRIDGE IS ANNOUNCED

Italy's Astaldi has a Rs1.5bn ($60m) contract to build the proposed new
Sukkur Bridge in Sindh province. The contract has upset China National
Overseas Engineering Corporation, a company owned by the Chinese
ministry of foreign trade and co-operation, which submitted the lowest
bid for the project at a bid price of Rs1.134bn ($33.1m).

Moreover, of the nine bids submitted to the National Highways Authority
(NHA), Astaldi's bid was the only one submitted after the deadline of
August 30, 1995. Referring to the late submission of the bid by the
Italian company, the consultants, Denmark's COWI Consult declared that,
'Astaldi's bid was brought to the meeting room (at the NHA head office)
at 11.20 am ... all bidders were asked whether they would accept the
bid from Astaldi. As none of the bidders had any objections, the bid
was accepted as being received in due time'. Industry sources say this
statement appears to be an attempt to obfuscate the real issue, since
it was not the other bidders' responsibility, but NHA's, to reject the
bid because it had been submitted late.

'The "Instructions to Bidders" in this regard were unequivocal and very
clear. But not only was Astaldi's bid opened along with those of the
eight other bidders, NHA has now decided to award the contract to the
Italian company, and that too, at a price that is a staggering Rs366m
($10.7m) more than the price quoted by China National Overseas
Engineering,' it added.

Industry sources say that this suggests that Astaldi must have some
very influential political connections indeed in Islamabad. They say
this perception gains further credence when the NHA comes up with
flimsy excuses to sideline China National's bid. NHA claimed that the
Chinese company did not have enough English-speaking staff and that its
bid was 'too low'.

In a letter to NHA, China National said, 'we are prepared to offer any
guarantees within the realm of internationally accepted construction
norms, and as defined in the contracts documents, to assure the
National Highways Authority of our intention to complete the project in
full compliance with the tender specifications and within the time
period stipulated'.

When the NHA invited pre-qualification applications from interested
firms to bid for the construction of the new Sukkur Bridge earlier in
1995, 35 companies applied. Of these, NHA pre-qualified only 15 to bid
for the project, which is being financed by the Manila-based Asian
Development Bank.

Of the 15 pre-qualified companies, only nine submitted bids. They were:

- China National Overseas Engineering Corporation - Rs1.134bn ($33m);

- Astaldi - Rs1.501bn ($44m);

- China Road and Bridge Corporation - Rs1.744bn ($51m);

- S. Korea's Daewoo Corporation - Rs1.745bn ($51m);

- Dogus Construction and Trading - Rs1.76bn ($51m);

- S. Korea's Daelim Industrial - Rs1.805bn ($53m);

- Turkey's STFA - Rs2.051bn ($60m);

- Chulas Rasool Doojin Nazir of Pakistan and S. Korea - Rs2.1bn ($61m);

- Tekser & Wayss & Freytag of Turkey and Germany - Rs2.491bn ($73m).

COASTAL ROAD CONTRACT GOES TO IRANIAN CONSORTIUM

A consortium of Iranian construction companies led by Mostazafan-o-
Janbazan Foundation (MJF), is poised to win a Rs11.5bn ($440m) contract
to build a 650km coastal road linking Mekran division, Baluchistan
province with Karachi, according to acting communications minister,
Sher Afghan. He said the project will be jointly funded by both Iran
and Pakistan.

Sher Afghan said Islamabad would contribute some 60 per cent of the
money while the rest will be provided by the Iranian government. He
declined to name the donor agency with whom Pakistan was seeking funds
but said negotiations were 'almost complete'. He said the contract with
the Iranian companies will be signed in early January, and the
memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the joint venture project was
signed between the two countries on May 17, 1995. The completion is for
1998-99, he added.

CATHAY PACIFIC WITHDRAWS FROM AIRPORT JV

venture to expand Xiamen airport in Fujian province. The project was
announced in August 1994 and involved expanding the aircraft apron area
and the airport's runway by 760m to 3.4km. However, Cathay's withdrawal
follows a series of setbacks which it claims have rendered the project
commercially unviable. Cathay, which owned 33 per cent of the project,
has said that it could not agree terms with Xiamen International
Airport, its mainland partner which holds the remaining 67 per cent. In
addition the Chinese authorities refused Cathay permission to run
airport security or ticketing sales, and wanted the time frame to be
less than 30 years. Cathay has invested no money in the project and a
spokesman for the company said that it would keep its options open for
other mainland airport investments.

ASIAN TERMINALS TO EXPAND PORT CARGO HANDLING FACILITIES

Port operator Asian Terminals (ATI) is investing 3.933bn peso ($97.2m)
to expand its port cargo handling facilities, it said in a statement
filed with the Board of Investments. ATI is 33 per cent held by P&O
Australia, which recently issued a statement saying that ATI will issue
150m shares to the public or 20 per cent on 25 December, 1995. They
will be issued at 5.10 peso and will raise about A$40m ($29.6m). All
Asia Capital and Trust, which is underwriting the deal, said the
offering price was pegged at 12.5 times the company's projected
earnings per share. P&O's holding will be diluted to about 26 per cent
following the issue. Asian Terminals is the exclusive handler of
international bulk cargo at the Port of Manila. It also expects to open
a $36m grains terminal in January in Mariveles in Bataan province, west
of Manila, which will be the first commercial grains terminal in the
Philippines. The company plans to expand its container and cargo
handling facilities in South Harbour, Manila's largest port, from
12.5ha to 17.7ha, to accommodate 700,000 containers by 1997, up from
the present 500,000. Containerised and non-containerised cargo passing
through South Harbour rose by 35.6 per cent and 12.3 per cent
respectively in 1994, while total trade in the Philippines rose by 20.2
per cent. The company is also interested in the government's port
development projects in other parts of the Philippines such as General
Santos, Cagayan do Oro and Davao in Mindanao in the south, Cebu in
central Philippines and Subic and Batangas on the main island of Luzon.

CENTRAL ASIA DIGEST: Cashing in on Kazakhstan

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The signs are that Kazakhstan - larger than western Europe, but with a
population smaller than Malaysia's - will be back to economic growth in 1997.
A number of major developments signalling a bright resource-rich future have
taken place this year, most of them involving Eastern companies. So this
crossroads-of-Asia market has to be taken seriously now.

"Potentially one of the richest countries in the world" said the London
"Financial Times" in a special review (11 July 1996).

Oil and gas are the keys to future prosperity - the problem has been getting
them to Western markets. On 27 April financing for the Caspian Pipeline (to
Novorossiisk from the huge Tengiz oilfield) was at last agreed; the dollars
should start coming in from the end of the century. These must eventually
fuel a consumer boom in Almaty near the China border (a new central capital
may be under construction by then). Meanwhile the building teams on the 750km
route will create heavy demand for foodstuffs, engineering supplies and many
commercial services.

On 13 May the missing rail link between Iran (leading to Turkey's
Mediterranean ports) and Almaty was completed. The new Trans-Asiatic Line
carries freight via Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Meanwhile upgrading work
proceeds on the recently-plugged Aktogay-Urumchi line which leads to the
Chinese port of Lyanyungan. Access to the old Trans-Siberian is good, and
Kazakhstan's part-electrified, part-dualled lines have substantial surplus
capacity. So access to this landlocked country is going to be less of a
problem.

On 17 June the German subsidiary of Samsung (Korea) acquired on complicated
lease terms a 40 per cent stake in the huge copper mining/smelting facilities
at Zhezkazkantsvetmet, pledging investment of over US$1bn over a 15-year
period. Production has doubled over the last twelve months, and the chaebol
is expected to acquire a majority share shortly.

And on 18 June Indian mega-investor Lakshmi Mittal purchased no less than 15
coal mines to feed the huge integrated Karmet steel complex at Karaganda
which Ispat had earlier acquired (with debts). With the aid of steelmaking
equipment from Samsung Shipbuilding & Heavy Industries Co production has
nearly tripled already this year, and this promises to be one of Asia's key
basic and structural steel sources. Nearly all output used to be kept within
the former Soviet Union. Following the customs union agreement of 1995 with
Russia, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan this trade is reviving already. But the
Kazakhs want more business in non-CIS Asia.

So Kazakhstan really is on the move, and the dreamers are talking of a
breadbasket cum basic-industries heartland in the centre of Asia. The former
Soviet Cosmodrome is thrown in - but so too are vast areas unsuitable for
anything because of nuclear tests conducted in Stalin's era. Not much can be
done about these, but in the metallurgical-industry zones environmental
clean-up technology is badly needed.

China looks to gain most; five per cent of imports came form here last year
(against two-thirds from the CIS, mostly the Russian Federation itself). The
border is notoriously leaky, both for foodstuffs and consumer goods.
One market that enterprising local businessmen seem to have filled already
is in used cars. Dubai on the Persian Gulf is the centre of a thriving trade
in secondhand road vehicles by enthusiastic Kazakhs who have left their Ladas
behind. But good trucks and buses are in short supply.

For the latest information fax the Almaty Chamber of Trade & Industry on +7
3272 620594. Most trade fairs in Almaty are energy related, but an
international consumer goods event will be held from 15-18 April next year
(fax +1 703 406 8543 for details). The annual INTERKAZAKH general-purpose
fair, open to the public, is held at the beginning of September (fax +90 312
417 5253; Imbat/Ankara).

Asian Review plans to cover business developments in Central Asia regularly
in depth. East Europe has taken off - now it's the turn of the member states
of the CIS. These newly-independent countries have enormous resources,and are
eager to do business in East and Southeast Asia.

Has your company started to trade on the Silk Road? Do you have a business
story - good or bad - to tell? The area is poorly covered by the business
news services, and Asian Review would like to hear your reports from this
exciting new frontier. Small-company news will be particularly welcome.

Czech Business & Trade

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The official monthly "Czech Business & Trade" has been promoting the local
electrical engineering industry recently. Two articles have been carried on
the subject this year, revealing that 14 per cent of output comes into the
"heavy" distribution/switching equipment categories. And the March issue
revealed that no less than 13 out of the top 35 Czech companies are
classified within the "power engineering" sector - led by CEZ (number-one
company overall) and Severomoravska Energetika. Details of the "Sdruzeni
Czech Top 100" can be obtained from ING Bank by fax on +42 2 232 0026.
Under onslaughts from suppliers like Halla in Korea power engineering is one
of the last old-era trade bastions to fall; the Czechs want a slice of the
profitable Asian build-operate-transfer market.

CONSTRUCTION DIGEST: A hammer from Singapore

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

NatSteel Engineering Pte Ltd has become one of the major players in the
engineering business in Singapore. Today, it has set its sights on further
diversification. It develops and manufactures its own products, including the
NSE Hydraulic Hammer.

This new product consist of a dropping weight solid ram, rigid hammer
housing, pile helmet with inner cap and cushion, and two lifting cylinders
with hydraulic components.

What makes this NSE product different? The company claims several
characteristics and benefits, including: the short time needed to change
attachments; greater impact and vertical driving capacity; automatic and
manual mode; low noise level; advanced design, and the ability to vary the
energy per blow by varying the height of fall.

Slipform success

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Contractors on the record-breaking Ting Kau Bridge in Hong Kong have opted
to use the specially developed RMD slipform technique for a further four
support piers, in addition to the three main pylons which the company are
currently sliding.

Formwork specialist RMD has already provided purpose-designed forms for the
bridge's three central pylons and will now carry out and deliver slipform
operations for four piers ranging from 46-56m in height.

RMD has developed its basic slipform system to meet the project's specific
requirements for the three main pylons, providing further decks and a
framework to lift and support internal soffits. The adaptations also offer
additional storage space with an extra platform added as required.

The main advantage of RMD equipment is that the heavy duty slipforms produce
greater rigidity leading to more improved accuracy than with conventional
systems. The system also offers tolerances within BS5606, and yet still
allows more weight to be carried with the added attraction of extra storage
space.

Pavseel specified

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

A major new development currently being undertaken for the Port of Singapore
includes extending the container storage area by some 14,000 sq.m. Concrete
block pavers which match existing areas were chosen for the new facilities.
ACM Pavseel was specified for sealing the new installation as well as for
stabilising the existing areas. To date, over 20,000m have been treated with
a further 5,000m of block paving soon to be laid.

The importance of jointing sand stabilisation has gained wide acceptance
amongst experienced paving specifiers in recent years and ACM Pavseel is
acknowledged as a proven system for this purpose.

Trenchless technology

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Tracto-Technik steerable boring systems have been put to good use in Taiwan,
where contractors have been installing gas pipes. In the city of Shin-Chu a
total of 913m of gas HD-PE pipe had to be installed. The contractor decided
to invested in a Grundodrill after initial theoretical training of the new
operators - the first bores were done in March this year.

A total of 20 working days had been allotted for the installation of the
pipes, but due to the skills of the new operators - who had never worked with
Tracto-Technik equipment before - the time required was reduced to less than
12 days.

Using the Grundodrill percussive hammer, up to 1,000 strokes per minute can
be applied onto the drill stems so that steering the bore head even in stony
soils is possible, whether other fluid-assisted boring systems without hammer
would fail.

Compact and powerful, Magnum Diamond's .38 special pavement saw can be used
for joint widening, highway patching and repairing and other tasks. The use
of high quality components in the manufacturing of this well-balanced unit
makes it durable and dependable. The unibody frame, jig-welded reinforced
steel plate, has rolled edges and heavy gauge steel cowling for added
strength.

Civil instrumentation and systems

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Construction of the Estan Dam in China was facilitated by the use of
equipment and services from drilling-parameter recording specialists Jean Lutz
SA of Jurancon (France).

For over ten years this company has been developing and manufacturing
instrumentation for measurement and recording of problems encountered during
drilling, injection, pile construction, tunnelling and specialised work on
foundations. All necessary sensors and software are supplied to client
engineers as part of a package deal.

This company's equipment is intended for use under extreme environmental
conditions, by non-specialised operatives. Training courses are available on
demand, and an in-house data processing service can be used if required.
As an example the CL88/EPF Drilling and Injection Parameter Recorder features
simultaneous graphical and digital recording, the former by means of a
high-definition printer which incorporates headings, scales and ad hoc
observations by operators. The CL88 measures and records from one-ten
parameters, such as depth, instantaneous drilling rate and time,
thrust/restraint/water pressures, vibration by reflected percussion wave,
water/mud/air flow rates, mast inclination etc. Data resulting is stored on
MEMOBLOC and downloaded into a PC using the supplier's EXEPF software.
Instruments such as these have become key tools of foundation construction
specialists worldwide. Their principal areas of application are in soil
investigation, preparation of deep foundations by flight auger piling and
other processes; and jet grouting. These measuring/recording devices
frequently form part of an automatic control process, as in subterranean
pouring of concrete and mast positioning.

Developments in micro-electronics mean that the associated software becomes
more and more a vital part of the package - for a new site a new tailor-made
program is simply slotted in.

The CL88's multi- and compound parameter ability means that programming on
site is possible through the use of scrolling menus, and instantaneous
production of graphs and associated documentation is of great benefit to the
resident engineer. In certain cases the multiple recordings of conditions
immediately ahead of a tunnelling machine (for example) are produced with
simultaneous interpretations available in the field.

Related equipment includes the JTC (recording jet grouting parameters), the
LGH Lugeon tester, and the VIB vibration parameter recorder - all prefixed
CL88 in the Lutz product line-up. Also available are the Taracord CE
continuous flight auger piling recorder, TRANSCARD tunnelling recorder,
MICROPAC automatic controls for mixing plants, and the VOPI and PVCIMENT
systems for measuring grouting conditions.

The company's PPF4 deviated control panel presents at one point all necessary
data for the accurate use of a drilling machine.

By means of Jean Lutz equipment solutions can be found to problems
encountered during drilling, injection, piling and other foundation
operations - all by means of automated measurement and control.

CRANES: Lift off for new era

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The takeover by a Malaysian group of an Australian crane builder points to
a new engineering industry for Southeast Asia. Asian Review projects the way
forward.

Just as Asia - especially China - has become the centre of gravity of the
world cement market, so Hong Kong and Singapore have become the hub of the
crane business. For years more cranes of most types have been changing hands
here than anywhere else. Now with the formation of Favelle Favco Cranes
(Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (a subsidiary of Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd, established
by purchase from an Australian principal in 1995) the region is well on its
way to founding its own crane-building industry. FFC is currently advertising
in the world's specialised heavy-lift press, offering a range of tower,
wharfside and dedicated offshore equipment.

Previous attempts to establish a crane building industry locally have focused
on licensing arrangements, such as Grove's with Daewoo and Gru Comedil's with
Guangdong Comedil Construction Machinery.

So an exciting new era has opened. How long will it be before Asia-built
lifting equipment is heading west (and to Japan) - reversing the direction
of a vigorous trade that has been established over the last 40 years? Already
a considerable amount of high-specification structural steelwork, used for
lattice booms and towers, is incorporated in western fabrications. And other
components are sourced locally too; most of the world's key crane builders
having representative offices at least in one of the two cities.

A key strength of this embryo industry is the sheer number of agents and used
equipment suppliers, such as Continental Equipment (Hong Kong) and Lynne Hunt
(Singapore), who have built up a formidable expertise in the field. This now
rivals the globally-active used crane supply business once dominated by
European groups like HOVAGO (Netherlands). The used-plant market is still the
core of the multi-million dollar local trade.

Asian Review predicts that the way the industry is likely to develop is by
renovation and re-manufacturing of tower cranes. Mobile crane technology is
still too sophisticated, with too many of the patents jealously held by
foreign builders. Dockside portal cranes offer good potential, but the market
is too small and well supplied for local competition to start up
successfully. But with so many mega projects like Chek Lap Kok airport taking
shape the demand for these versatile lifters has never been stronger. And
with a re-manufactured unit costing perhaps half the capital outlay of new
equipment - fully updated and with a brand new serial number (and warranty)
attached - concentrating on this segment of the market makes a lot of sense.

Locally rebuilt cranes are already widely available, both from manufacturers'
agents (though not all western crane builders support this activity), and
from independent suppliers. Typically these have all wearing components like
bearings and motors replaced with reconditioned parts, usually sourced in the
original factory. Standard items like cables are replaced with new. Often the
cab is updated with a contemporary range of electronic controls, and the
unit's lifting capacity may be upgraded while still remaining within strict
local rules too. But the basic structure remains unchanged, and the original
serial number applies. An advantage of this sector of the industry is that
local suppliers know their customers' needs very well, and can thus customise
the crane for the precise conditions in which it will be expected to operate.
This is particularly important for offshore operators. Crane rebuilding is
already a well-established local industry, as is the much simpler repair work
undertaken by most distributors.

The attitude of original suppliers to crane re-manufacturing varies widely;
some support it, with their own specialised facilities such as those owned
by Manitowoc in Arkansas. Others, particularly the Japanese builders, are
less keen, and very few mobile manufacturers want to get involved at all. But
for local engineering firms the market for re-manufacturing of tower cranes
appears to be wide open, as long as necessary principals' support is
obtained.

Suitable units have to be very thoroughly inspected so that there are no
nasty surprises when the equipment is taken (literally) to pieces. Boom
damage in particular has to be precisely assessed and rectified. All
structural steelwork has to be sandblasted back to bare metal, all welds and
other fixings examined carefully, and the unit must be finished according to
the original specifications. All working components have to be replaced with
new in order to obtain a new product designation. A brand-new cab and control
system is normally installed. Obviously it would be impossible to undertake
these tasks without the full co-operation of the original manufacturer. Then,
before the crane can be licensed for local use it has to be inspected by
local officials, with all necessary documentation presented. Rules vary
widely within Southeast Asia, so the ultimate destination has to be known
from the outset of the operation.

The re-manufacturing of very heavy lifters - the sort of cranes used to ship
in turbine and process-plant equipment, for example - seems to be a good
starting point for this proto-industry. These cranes command premium hire
rates, and are often completely unavailable. Being so large they are
relatively easy to both inspect and work on. Many widely-available components
common to smaller cranes are incorporated. And there seems no end to the
growth of demand for their services.

The next stage in the development of the local crane industry must be
indigenous R&D. Several local fabricators already specialise in
single-purpose add-ons, usually oriented to the needs of oil and gas
producers. These are tailored uniquely to the requirements of individual
local users. But there is no reason why markets further afield should not be
tackled too. All the requirements of steel geometry fabrication are available
locally, so building these to locally-developed designs is the obvious next
step. And modular components like motors and winding drums can be purchased
off the shelf. So there is little reason why Southeast Asia's own range of
tower cranes should not be seen on worldwide construction site skylines early
in the next century.

If the frenetic pace of local demand development allows room for such
exports, that is.

CRANES: A new generation

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The HS843 HD Litronic heralds a new generation of high technology hydraulic
crawler cranes from Liebherr. The design and construction concepts behind
this model, say the manufacturer, are clear responses to the many criteria
demanded by crawler crane users, incorporating many innovative ideas and
improved qualities.

Increased output and efficiency, excellent stability combined with low
operating weight, durability and strong construction, high operating safety,
low maintenance costs and extreme versatility are just some of the many
features of Liebherr's technologically advanced hydraulic crawler crane.
The HS843 HD is a 60t class machine and supersedes the HS842 HD. In comparing
the two cranes, the new product has 30 per cent more engine power, with no
change in operating weight. There is a corresponding 27 per cent increase in
the hydraulics performance too.

Link-Belt Construction Equipment Company has introduced its new 150t LS-238H
crawler crane. This all-hydraulic lattice boom model offers contractors lift
capacities equal to the older Link-Belt LS-518, with fast non-assisted
stripdown and lightweight modular components that are easy to transport.

CRANES: A different class

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

With the AC 75 City Class, Mannesman Demag presents a new two-axle telescopic
crane which they claim combines manoeuvrability, compactness, outstanding
performance and functional design.

The overall length of the carrier is only 6.68m, and clearance height is
below 3m. The boom sits next to and slightly below the cab in travelling mode
to give optimal driver visibility.

According to market studies carried out by the manufacturer, transit time to
a job site can take up much of a crane's daily operation time. With its fully
automatic transmission, fuel efficiency is maximised at any speed.

INDUSTRIAL PARKS IN ASIA: Doing business by the bay

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

When Wong Wen Chi flew into the Philippines to work for telecommunications
giant Thomson Consumer Electronics at the burgeoning Subic Bay Freeport, he
was destined to find both business and pleasure.

The Subic Bay Industrial hub, where Thomson relocated 15 per cent of its
world-wide telephone manufacturing operations in 1994, has emerged as one of
the Philippines' leading manufacturing centres as well as a recreational
paradise.

"It's very convenient here," said the 50-year-old Wong, who oversees the
production of 250,000 telephone sets every month at a plant in the freeport,
located in Subic town, Zambales, about 90km northwest of Manila. Outside of
work, he sweats it out on a tennis court, learns golf or makes use of one of
the many sports and amusement facilities inside the 14,600-hectare industrial
area.

Wong's company, attracted by the freeport's infrastructure, availability of
English-speaking production staff and air and sea cargo links to major
capitals, is planning to expand business by transferring its entire telephone
manufacturing operations, now spread across Asia, to Subic.

The transformation of the former U.S. naval base is phenomenal. Just five
years ago, it was partially buried under tons of volcanic ash along with
large areas of the main Luzon island after Mt.Pinatubo erupted. A year after
the eruption, the United States withdrew from the facility.

The Philippine government salvaged US$8bn worth of infrastructure left by the
Americans from under tons of volcanic ash and started transforming the place
into a boom town, envisioning another Hong Kong.

Today, the government agency in charge of the freeport, the Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority (SBMA), has convinced 209 companies, mostly from
neighbouring Taiwan, to move in with about US$1.49bn worth of investments.
Some 137 of the firms, including Thomson, are already in operation,
manufacturing products that include computer motherboards, neck ties, Reebok
rubber shoes, armoured cars and small boats. The rest are preparing for
business.

The man at the centre of Subic's phenomenal rise from the ashes is Richard
Gordon, a charismatic but controversial politician, who heads the SBMA. "We
have survived Mt. Pinatubo's eruption. We have survived the closure of the
American base - and we have made the situation better," said Gordon, a former
mayor of Olongapo town next to Subic. Gordon's effort, backed by a battery
of young, Western-educated executives is paying off, but it's not all plain
sailing. Unable to rely on a national government too preoccupied with
rehabilitating a country from decades of political and economic stagnation,
Gordon set out on his own, travelling around the globe to reach out
personally to potential investors.

He privatised most of the freeport's utilities as a guarantee against the
unstable supply of power, water and other basic services that had driven away
investors elsewhere in the country.

Among Subic's utilities are a power supply of 60MW, water supply of 12m
gallons per day, a base telephone system with 7,000 (expandable to 13,000)
lines, and tank storage for 2.4m barrels of petroleum products.

Last year, the U.S.-based cargo carrier Federal Express made Subic the Asian
base of its world-wide delivery system after its 2,744-metre-long runway was
lengthened and widened to accommodate large aircraft. Fedex's entry also
boosted the freeport's potential as a manufacturing centre.

Subic was also chosen as the venue for the Apec Summit, a crowning glory for
Gordon, who is widely believed to harbour presidential ambitions.

Two years ago, the World Bank approved a US$40m loan to upgrade
infrastructure including a US$12m airport passenger terminal. Some good
fortune, coupled with incentives like a five per cent profits tax, duty-free
imports, full repatriation of capital and profits and land lease of up to 75
years, have lured big-league investors like Taiwan's Acer Computer and the
American-owned Coastal Petroleum, a distributor of petroleum products in
Asia.

Officials are also concentrating on developing Subic's potential as a prime
tourist destination. More than US$279m worth of construction projects -
including a hotel, condominiums, conference facilities, golf courses, marina,
and casinos are planned.

Subic is one of 18 industrial zones the Philippines is developing in its bid
to bounce back as one of Asia's economic tigers after decades of political
and economic stagnation.

The industrial zones were set up under the economic reforms unleashed by
President Fidel Ramos in an effort to liberalise practically all sectors of
business. The the government hopes they will act as investment magnets across
the Philippines.

About 50km north-west of Subic, another former U.S. military base is also
rising from the ashes of Mt. Pinatubo volcano. The Clark Special Economic
Zone, a 33,000-hectare former U.S. air force base is being transformed by the
Manila government into the Philippines' main gateway wit the building of an
international airport complex that will replace Manila's congested Ninoy
Aquino International Airport. Officials plan to construct another runway in
1998 in addition to two 3.2km-long runways at the airfield.

The Clark Development Corporation (CDC), the state agency overseeing
development in the former air force base, is planning to turn large
warehouses, stockyards, depots and residential units into factories that
would operate as an economic zone similar to Subic. Unlike Subic, however,
only a few big-name investors have moved to Clark.

Romeo David, chairman of the CDC, said a total of 71 foreign and local
companies have set up business and 78 others have committed to move into
Clark in the next five years, together bringing 18.9bn pesos (US$600m) of
investment. Among the top investors Clark has attracted are Japan's Yokohama,
one of the world's largest tyre manufacturers; Sampo Technology Corporation,
a leading Taiwanese electronics firm; and Mondragon Leisure and Resorts, a
local apparel distributor and resort developer.

Clark officials are trying to improve utilities and to fast-track
construction of tourist areas comprising hotels, sports complexes and a
27-hole golf course to lure investors.

The existing utilities at Clark include a telephony system for 5,000 lines
that is expandable to 50,000 lines, a road network of 3,000km, a power supply
of 50 MW, and a water supply of 5,000 gallons per minute. Two domestic
chartered flights ply routes from provinces in central and western
Philippines to the area almost daily.

A problem Clark - and to a limited extent Subic - is encountering when it
comes to attracting investors is a fear of further eruptions by Mt. Pinatubo.
Five years after the volcano wrought havoc on a region that used to be known
as the country's rice bowl, huge volcanic mud flows, driven by seasonal
rains, continue to periodically sever road links to Manila around Clark and
Subic.

When roads are totally cut-off as happened a year ago, detours lengthen a
three-hour drive from Manila to Subic to at least eight hours, a
transportation nightmare few investors would want to deal with. Although
government volcanologists predict that Pinatubo's fury is over and that its
small ash emissions are too weak to reach either Clark or Subic, many
investors remain apprehensive.

Such a problem gives an edge to economic zones near the business districts
of Manila, such as the one comprising a belt of provinces called Calabarzon
(for Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) south of the capital. Major
Japanese companies prefer Calabarzon's various industrial parks over Clark
and Subic.

Edgy businessmen concerned about the effects of Subic and Clark's success on
their profitability have also become a problem. Earlier this year, the
government scrapped a US$200 shopping privilege given to patrons of duty-free
shops in both Clark and Subic after local manufacturers complained that
imported products sold in the duty free shops cut their profits and deprived
the government of revenues.

INNOVATIONS: A vital link

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Lindapter International recently showed its full range of fixing systems at
the Offshore Southeast Asia show in Singapore.

Designed to offer significant reductions in installation time and costs, the
Lindapter range includes steelwork fixings, support fixings, steel cavity
fixings, floor fixings and rail fixings.

Lindapter steelwork fixings facilitate connection of structural steelwork
without the need for on-site drilling or welding. Common offshore
applications include suspension of lifting gear, fixing of drilling
equipment, pipe supports and guides, or connection of steelwork used in
accommodation modules.

Floor fixings, such as Floorfast and Gratefast for chequerplate and open
grate flooring are particularly suited to offshore applications. They can be
used without the need for hot work permits or specialist expertise, thus
saving contractors both time and money.

INNOVATIONS: Anti-corrosion

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

A new range of cable cleats featuring an anti-corrosion coating which
provides a cost-effective and proven alternative to using marine-grade
stainless steel has been launched by BICC Components.

The BICC System 5000 range includes aluminium-based claw, hook, two-bolt and
multicleats which are coated with a self-adhesive Kelvar thermoplastic powder
at a thickness of 0.5mm.

Available in two specifications - grey to coat any of the base materials
currently offered and blue-grey to provide a Zero Halogen LSF (Low Smoke and
Fume) coating. BICC say the system gives "outstanding protection in
conditions such as saline and polluted atmospheres, high humidity, and high
ambient temperatures."

INNOVATIONS: Packaging machines

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

A new range of optional technical enhancements, offering increased
productivity, and, claims the manufacturer, superior control, greater
flexibility and easier operation has been added to the Astra series of
inverted, horizontal, form, fill and seal (HFFS) automatic packaging
machines, by Ilapak Ltd.

A key feature of the Astra is its random length, self-measuring facility
which allows continuous heat-seal flow wrapping of irregularly-shaped
products, whatever their length. This makes the product particularly suitable
for a wide range of non-food industries.

Unlike many other inverted machines which make fixed length packs, the
Astra's random length control option allows the machine to automatically
adjust film cut-off lengths from one item to the next, according to the exact
length of the product.

INNOVATIONS: Steel trials

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

British Steel have completed a series of piling trials and demonstrations
over a five day period in the Bangkok Basin area. Key specifiers and end
users were invited to witness first-hand the benefits of switching from the
standard 400mm wide sheetpiles in common use in Asia to British Steel's
stronger and wider LX product.

The trials took the form of a direct comparison between the 400mm and 600mm
sections during repeated driving/extraction cycles. All the sample piles were
measured for pile distortion including twisting, leg splaying, head/toe and
clutch damage.

According to British Steel, the results demonstrated that LX piles could be
driven faster than their narrower counterparts. With smaller capacity hammers
the extra weight and stiffness of the LX piles proved to be of advantage and
permitted accelerated driving times.

British Steel are producers of steel sheet piling with a comprehensive range
of sections and sizes.

INNOVATIONS: Adaptable treatment

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Manufacturers, municipal councils, mining companies and primary producers are
constantly seeking better ways to control the quality of wastewater or
recycled water as well as the possible reuse of purified water. This not only
relates to changing government regulations but also because in many instances
the efficient retrieval of valuable by-products from production is a very
important cost benefit factor. One way to achieve financial advantage is the
elimination of downtime in the removal of waste solids.

Syskill Australia Pty Ltd, a Sydney-based company with 14 years experience
in consulting and commissioning wastewater systems, has developed two system
packages which can be adapted to a range of industrial applications and can
provide any level of treatment (primary, secondary or tertiary). Selection
and development of the correct system for your particular process can ensure
cost efficiencies.

By cutting down on the solid waste volumes, including the thickening of
municipal and industrial sludges, the high cost of removal is greatly reduced
and therefore the transfer of solid waste into the sewerage system can be
eliminated.

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Reading numbered containers and drums to try and track and monitor goods has
posed huge logistical and manpower problems, but a new product from
recognition specialists, Cambridge Neurodynamics, is set to transform the
transport, storage and processing industries.

The new system - the Container Tracking & Identification System (CTIS) - is,
claim the makers, the most accurate and reliable yet developed. CN also say
the product sets a new industry standard for character recognition in
situations where characters are partially obscured or printed on irregular
surfaces. CTIS enables highly automated stock control, tighter billing
procedures, improved security, and does not require the huge amount of
paperwork and manpower involved in conventional tracking and monitoring.

INNOVATIONS: Drives and controls for Anshin Steel

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

When Malaysia's Anshin Steel Ltd needed a drives and controls system for
their hot-rolling bar and rod mill at Shah Alam they consulted the local
Control Techniques' Drive System Centre at Petaling Jaya. The company
manufactures a range of light rod and bar sections from purchased billet.

As a result the main mill motors have for the last three years reliably used
CT's "Mentor" drives which are rated at 1850A (DC)/600V. More than one
thousand of these have been installed in Thailand alone, so it was decided
to build Anshin's control panels in the Ladyao manufacturing Centre near
Bangkok.

Localised control boxes enable the operator to Run/Jog Reverse/Stop the
stands and lock off the power if the stands themselves need attention. The
mill cannot be started from the main pulpit, but cascaded speed control is
carried out from this position.

Menus for the varied products to be rolled are stored in a PC in the pulpit.
When a product is selected for rolling data concerning the dimensions of the
billet and the mean diameter of each roll is downloaded to a PLC. Control is
based on the principle of constant volume rolling and cascaded speed control
whereby the speed of each stand is related to the master finishing stand.
Calculations concerning motor speed for each drive are made continuously in
the PLC and sent to the second processor in the "Mentor" drives as 12-bit
parallel words. All stand speeds are simultaneously updated to avoid
tension/compression during changes of speed.

When the velocity of any section is adjusted the PLC calculated the new speed
of all upstream drives and updates them. Individual speed trims for the
drives are available to the operators from stations mounted near the mill
stands. The speed of the master stand is set using a preset potentiometer.
Anshin's two roughing mills use 1,000hp AC constant-speed motors. The related
conveyor systems use DC motors and "Mentor" controllers. These are controlled
by joysticks and have to accelerate rapidly to guarantee entry of bars into
the roughers. Other related DC drives run at the speed of the bar.

On exit the disc shear cuts the bar to preset lengths - multiples of the cut
length at the cold shear and accommodatable within the cooling bed. Speed and
positioning of the exiting bar is determined by measuring the time elapsed
between passing two detectors.

With this information the bar can be cut precisely. The disc shear is driven
by three DC drives, one for each blade and one to orientate the shear
mechanism. The run-in conveyor to the cooling bed is driven by 32 DC motors
connected in parallel across the controller.

Five 35hp DC motors located along the kick-off shaft drive this, being
controlled by the same number of four-quadrant "Mentors" which load-share.
If necessary the shaft can operate on only three drives. Braking is
regenerative, with the unit operating as a holding brake only.

The 80m cooling bed operates similarly, being driven by five 50hp motors
controlled by similar "Mentors" for accurate slowing and stopping.

Shuffle bars driven by 15hp motors, this time controlled by single-quadrant
"Mentors", carry the bars to the run-out conveyor. This uses three 30hp
drives which are operated manually from the cold shear desk. Three more
conveyor drives carry the cut bars to the packing line. This is driven by
four CT inverter drives and controlled by an Omron PLC. The packing line
itself was built in Malaysia.

In total there are 45 "Mentor" drives and six inverters controlling over one
hundred individual motors in this Malaysian finishing mill.

Control Techniques Asia Pacific have subsequently installed rod mill stands
at four steel plants in Thailand. The mill control system at Albion Steel,
the most recent, differs significantly from earlier projects. The
incorporated PC is much more powerful, enabling the whole mill to operate
using a SCADA Windows package. And the use of a beefier MD29 processor card
enables many tasks to be undertaken within the drive itself.

Current control strategy is to use the PC for product menus and on-line
monitoring, the processor card for closed-loop functions, and the PLC for
sequence control. This means a simpler and more user-friendly PLC can be
used.

Control Techniques' steel activities are not confined to hot rolling. The
company has supplied control panels and motors for slitting and roll forming
machines in both of the countries cited, and has installed cold rolling mills
in India, Indonesia and Thailand.

MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE: A flexible system

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Computer systems providing internal electronic communication facilities have
led to increased productivity and an evolution in working practices for a
major Japanese company.

Nippon Steel Corporation, the largest steel company in the world, is like any
other company constantly seeking ways to increase efficiency and cut costs.
At its biggest facility, the Kimitsu Works in Chiba Prefecture, output has
increased over the last 10 years while the total number of employees has
steadily declined. The size of the white-collar workforce, however, has
remained constant at around 1,400, indicating that management and
administrative processes have changed very little despite increases in
manufacturing efficiency.

Information technologies and process automation have played an integral role
in production processes at the Kimitsu Works since it opened in 1967. Today,
for instance, process control systems operate in blast furnaces and rolling
mills, while video systems record the performance of individual sites and
transmit images electronically to a production control centre. Office
systems, however, have lagged behind, with administrative processes changing
very little. Until recently, white-collar workers relied on inter-office
memos, telephones and fax machines for business communication and information
sharing.

In the early 1990s plant managers decided to boost white-collar productivity
and reduce labour costs by improving business communications and information
sharing within the organisation. They decided to invest in information
systems which would allow them to 're-engineer' essential business processes.
As a consequence, they expected to reduce the white-collar workforce by
around 400 once the systems were fully implemented. Key to their success was
choosing a workgroup computing system that could be easily adapted to both
the corporate culture and the network infrastructure.

In 1994 the company's Computer Systems Department conducted a six-month study
to define the requirements for a system that would best suit the Kimitsu
Works. It sought a flexible client-server system that would allow staff
located in many different parts of the plant to communicate and share
information electronically. It also sought a system that would build on the
company's existing technology and could be expanded incrementally as the need
arose. Key requirements included the ability to run on both MS-DOS and
Windows PCs, as well as compatibility with connections such as LANs, PBXs and
public switched telephone networks.

The department looked at a number of workgroup computing products available
in Japan, including Lotus Notes and MS Mail, before settling on TeamWARE
Office. Fujitsu Limited had adapted the base product to the Japanese market
and also provided the required dedicated support services.

Operation began in January 1995 with a single server configuration supporting
more than 1,000 users. The initial focus was on two essential aspects of
workgroup communications, e-mail and group information sharing, and for these
TeamWARE Mail and Forum software were installed. The total cost for the
server hardware, software and installation support was US$680,000.

Within a few weeks of installation, the system was being widely used by
staff. Users had little trouble learning how to operate the software, and
soon began to use both products in their everyday jobs. More than 1,000 users
at all levels of the corporation are logged onto the system.

People communicate and share information electronically, which has done away
with much of the need for telephone calls, fax messages and inter-office
letter mail. E-mail has spread to all areas of the plant, including the Cold
Mill and General Affairs Divisions, as well as the Production and Technical
Control Division.

E-mail has speeded up the flow of information through the organisation. Memos
and written requests that used to take two or three days to travel from one
department to another are now delivered within seconds. For example, senior
executives can have the minutes of executive meetings distributed throughout
the plant as soon as they are written, so that line managers receive almost
instant notification of important decisions. Moreover, executives and senior
managers can communicate decisions more effectively . They are beginning to
communicate directly with staff, which is leading to changes in the patterns
of office work and the delegation of responsibilities.

TeamWARE Forum promotes on-line discussions and information sharing, and
provides a collection point for opinions on any given topic. Users have
adapted quickly to the process of discussing issues on-line, posting topics
and responses in the same way they would e-mail. More than half the
individual forums are requests for new ideas; for example, a group might
discuss approaches to improving a production process in the rolling mill by
posting comments and replies. Then, when a manager needs to prepare
recommendations and conclusions, he simply reviews the comments made by
members of the group when writing his report. Similarly, when different
people need to contribute to a report, each person posts their sections in
the designated forum for the others to review.

Electronic communications have also had a democratising effect at the Kimitsu
Works. White-collar workers at many different levels of the organisation can
participate in on-line discussions and directly receive electronic
information from senior managers. This serves as an initial step towards
breaking down communications barriers. Younger workers in particular begin
to feel that they are more directly involved in the company's activities and
have a better idea about what they are expected to do. They can receive
direct copies of management memos and production reports, rather than having
the information selected and interpreted by their superiors.

The next stage for the Computer Systems Department is to extend groupware
capabilities by introducing TeamWARE Library and TeamWARE Flow, the system's
document management and workflow modules. Moving to an electronic archive
promises a number of benefits.

Workers will be able to find and share each others documents. They will be
able to search through large collections of documents in many different ways
- by titles, keywords or full-text words and phrases. They will also be able
to maintain a work history of specific projects, collating minutes, memoranda
and project reports, so that activities can be better co-ordinated. To
maintain security for sensitive documents, user access can be managed and a
record kept of each access to a document and any changes made.

TeamWARE Flow will enable the passing of information from one person to
another or from one group to another in a structured manner, reducing the
need to produce reports for general distribution. Initially, the department
plans to use the system for simple processes, such as exchanging requests
between departments internally, but once an electronic gateway to the
company's Tokyo head office is established, it expects to be able to
communicate with workgroups at the corporate level.

The TeamWARE electronic communications and information sharing systems have
proved a sound investment for Nippon Steel, allowing it to introduce
organisational changes at the Kimitsu Works and support new kinds of work
activities as users become accustomed to working with a networked on-line
electronic environment.

RUSSIA/CIS: Heavy engineering for Asian markets

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Two case studies reveal that Russian engineering is rebuilding fast. And the
number of trade fairs taking place throughout the CIS shows that this is a
source, and market, to be taken seriously.

Intriguing accounts of life in the new era for the heavy engineering
industries of the CIS have been appearing this year in the Moscow monthly
"Business in Russia"*. This is the sector that is supposed to be badly
affected by the continuing decline in industrial output. But some big
exporters are making good already.

First, worldscale truck maker Kamaz. Located in the autonomous republic of
Tatarstan on the steppes east of Nizhny Novgorod the ex-Soviet Union's
number-one truck plant entered production in 1978; a major fire subsequently
entailed major updating. Total output could be a massive 1.5m vehicles/year.
Kamaz trucks have a huge trading advantage in the new CIS - their spares and
service requirements are known everywhere. And they are designed for the
toughest road conditions imaginable,which is why non-CIS Asia is being
targetted as a key export sales zone now.

Kamaz was one of the first giant enterprises to be privatised, in 1990. Still
loss making, it receives no state support whatsoever. One of its biggest
problems is outstanding debt - to government agencies, amongst others. To
solve this it has set up a new mega-business partnership called
Kamaz-Sodruzhestvo Association with Gazprom,Russia's biggest company, LUKoil
and other major users, guaranteeing annual sales of 30,000 heavy vehicles and
involving substantial much-welcomed swapping of the debts that plague these
huge (mostly energy) businesses too. The two governments are associate
members, which means yet more "in house" sales.

So the domestic market looks very good. But to keep the massive multi-line
factory running more exports are vital - and if those are to take place
Kamaz's traditional reputation for go-anywhereability has got to be
supplemented with environmental-friendliness too. So last year the company
concluded agrrements with nearly 60 Japanese and European machine-builders
to supply the plant needed to build prime movers that meet the latest
environmental standards worldwide. These come on top of the earlier deal with
Cummins Engine Co (USA) to build a brand-new power unit.

Rockwell (USA) are supplying power trains; ZF (Germany) gearboxes; and DAF
(Netherlands) the technology to build new-style cab units. And the company's
close links with Gazprom, the world's largest supplier of natural gas, mean
it is now able to offer a dual-fuel (diesel/liquefied natural gas) power unit
which will be a trend-setter everywhere oil is becoming too costly to
extract. And in association with automobile manufacturer VAZ production of
over 100,000 passenger cars is planned too.

Kamaz's new Mustang fourwheel-drive truck series put up a good showing in the
Paris-Beijing Rally recently - this vehicle is aimed at defence ministry
purchasers worldwide. The new 43118 high-capacity 4WD truck was built to the
specifications of the Emergency Situations Ministry - and in Russia
"emergency" means just that. And the new 6520 dumper aimed at the energy
industries is designed to take on the best that the world's mining-truck
producers offer anywhere.

Nearly 20 joint ventures and representative trade offices now supply Kamaz
trucks and spares to 22 countries, including several in East Asia. As a
result export revenue nearly doubled year-on-year in 1995.

Financially the company has been reorganised with the aid of US investment
specialists KKR. Divestment took place and operations became more targetted
as a result; the leasing field has been entered to secure more sales at home.
Kamaz director Nikolay Bekh concluded his "Business in Russia" interview by
saying "I am convinced that our best days lie ahead".

Not converted to conversion

To the east in the Urals metallurgy region - one which has been experiencing
very lean times industrially - Uralvagonzavod (UVZ) presents another
engineering success story. But this company has not been privatised - it is
technically known as a state production association. It used to be the East
bloc's main producer of battle tanks. It still is, although the bloc as such
no longer exists. UVZ is a classic representitive of the "military-industrial
complex" for which Russian heavy engineering is famed, and used to be feared.
UVZ ought to be a classic case of "conversion" - swords into ploughshares,-
but isn't. Alongside its main function of building heavy weaponry it provided
the former Soviet Union with railcars (hence the name). But instead of
concentrating on these peaceful pursuits UVZ has kept its highly-skilled
design and production workforce together at Nizhny Tagil by continuing to
develop heavily armoured T-C series tanks - and selling them to governments
worldwide in competition with established US, European and Chinese suppliers.
It sells via the state armaments supplier Rosvooruzhenie. But it has
diversified into construction equipment with a military flavour - tracked and
wheeled excavators, bulldozers and front-end loaders. And it remains the
premier rail wagon builder in the CIS too.

As a state-owned business UVZ labours under a lot of difficulties which Kamaz
managers are delighted to be rid of. It is required to keep resources on
standby ready for transfer to complete military mobilisation at short notice.
It is plagued by debt. And it is required to participate in the operation of
a whole raft of state-provided services - local public transport and social
housing for example - which bleed its management and financial resources
heavily.

But UVZ is not standing still, and has rejected partial privatisation and
commercial diversification in the interests of doing what its workforce do
best at the three in-house design institutes.

These are two case-studies from the sharp end of heavy engineering in the CIS
- the very sharp end in the case of UVZ. They demonstrate that Russians are
refusing to de-skill their huge economy, to become a mere raw materials
supplier. Some of the world's top R&D institutions are located in the CIS;
the aim is to keep these highly skilled workforces intact; and this will be
achieved by recruiting managerial and financial cooperation from non-CIS,
including hopefully east Asian, sources.

RUSSIA/CIS: Buying and selling at trade fairs

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The organising of trade fairs is big business in the CIS. Distances are so
great and the concept of individual international marketing is so new that
attending a specialised exhibition is by far the best way for Eastern
businesses to make new contacts - whether buying or selling.

Moscow is still the centre of gravity with Mezhvystavka's EXPOCENTR in
Krasnopresnenskaya Nab, now firmly established as one of the world's top
trade fair complexes -you can fax them on +7 95 205 6055 for details of
1997's prolific programme. But independent rival centres are springing up
fast, and in terms of sheer numbers of specialised events, in order, the
following cities in the Russian Federation deserve serious consideration as
destinations: St Petersburg; Novosibirsk; Nizhny Novgorod; and Ekaterinburg.
Nizhny Novgorod deserves a special mention - 1996 is the 100th year of formal
operation of Nizhegorodskaya Jarmaka (fax 8312 443404), but the city has a
history of international trade exchange dating much further back than that.

A selection of 1997 events at EXPOCENTR is as follows:

20-24 January  - CONSUMEXPO - consumer goods
19-23 May      - SVIAZ-EXPOCOMM - telecommunications
16-20 June     - INLEGMASH - light industrial equipment, especially
                             textile/footwear machinery
1-5 July       - Byt i Moda - consumer goods
8-12 September - Stroyindustria Arkhitektura - building
20-24 October  - AGROPRODMASH - agricultural equipment

Readers interested in construction should also note the independent
organisation of MOSBUILD at the EXPOCENTR (12-15 March, fax +33 1 47 56 08
18 (Paris - this is an off-shoot of the long-established French BATIMAT
show).

And at the VVC Fairground in Moscow ITE (UK - fax +44 171 286 0177) will be
organising the first Russian International Machine Tool & Metalworking
Exhibition from 9-12 June.

Around the independent republics there is nothing like so much choice - for
Kazakhstan see the special Central Asia Digest at the front of this issue.
Moldova has its own international exhibition centre known as MOLDEXPO in
Chisinau (Kishinev; fax +373 2 62 74 20) with a diverse programme for 1997.
This includes EXPOCONS (consumer goods; 9-13 April); TEXTILES (wares and
equipment; 9-13 April); MOLDCONSTRUCT (11-16 June; construction equipment and
materials); Industry of Moldova (16-20 September; general local
manufacturing); and MOLDAGROTECH (15-20 October; agricultural and food
processing machinery).

In Ukraine there is a big consumer goods fair taking place in Kiev from 18-22
March (fax +49 30 844 0739), while Machine & Tool will be held from 29
September - 3 October (fax +49 40 460 4276). And Uzbekistan's International
Trade Fair will be held at the end of September in Tashkent (fax +49 221
695865). Interestingly, these last three non-Russian events are being
organised by German exhibition specialists who have spotted a good marketing
opportunity in the CIS. You could do so too.

SECURITY SYSTEMS: It pays to be prepared

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Condition monitoring can save money for manufacturers provided careful
forethought is given to projects.

Condition monitoring can prevent unexpected machine breakdowns and provide
early warnings of maintenance needs. It saves damage to plant, cuts wastage
of products due to line stoppages, helps keep production on target and is
acknowledged to save money and improve efficiency for manufacturers. An
approved system can also mean reduced machine insurance premiums.

However, it is not an area to be entered without careful forethought. Each
machine has its own monitoring needs, there are many techniques and types of
instrument, and a manufacturer has first to decide what is required from a
condition monitoring system. It is an area where many installations have not
paid for themselves.

The principle behind all checks on factory plant is to decide objectively
when machines should be taken out of service for maintenance. This saves
production being disrupted and enables maintenance and repairs to be planned
for quiet periods on the factory floor. It should lead to a more efficient
maintenance programme than one which relies on a fixed schedule.

Condition monitoring provides information which is not obvious from human
inspection. Information is collected from sensors on machines and the
analysis of readings taken over a period of time predicts when measurements
will exceed a safe level. This means a regular programme of inspection.

Each time measurements are taken the plant should be working under a similar
load to ensure an accurate comparison with previous data. This enables trends
to be predicted. It is not possible to assess the life left in a component
from a single measurement unless one has analysed data from similar
components. For a given reading one bearing could be close to failure while
another has a long life ahead. A key skill in condition monitoring lies in
calculating the future length of life of components from a trend of previous
readings.

This is where computer programmes are valuable. Software will predict trends
and display the results numerically or graphically. Data can be either fed
directly to the computer from the factory floor through a network, downloaded
at the machine to a portable or hand held computer and then transferred to
the main office machine or measured by hand held equipment and the readings
manually entered into the computer.

Measuring vibration

The most popular method of monitoring plant is to check the frequency and
amplitude of vibration of rotating parts using accelerometers and acoustic
or magnetic sensors. These transmit data to recording equipment which can be
fitted permanently to factory plant. The benefit of fitted instrumentation
is the warnings it can provide of unexpected events. Plant can be shut down
in an orderly sequence, rather than the operator having to hit the emergency
stop after hearing squealing, grinding or other expensive noises.

Recording equipment ranges from low cost meters, where the operator has to
enter readings on to record sheets, to microprocessor-controlled data
analysers which store many readings and display the results as a graph on a
screen or printout. Such equipment can automatically predict when readings
will move to unsafe levels and enable planned maintenance.

Vibration can be measured by laser-based equipment which measures shaft
movement without needing to touch the shaft. Machine condition can also be
reflected in a rise in temperature. A temperature sensor will measure spot
temperatures of bearings, seals and couplings, for example, but thermal
imaging shows exactly where heat is being generated as well as the
temperature.

Such thermographic surveys can pinpoint heat centres whereas engineers may
be mislead by heat being conducted along metal components. One such example
concerned an electric motor running hot. The abnormally high shaft
temperature indicated a worn motor bearing but a thermal imager showed a hot
spot in the motor's gearbox and heat being conducted along the shaft. Without
the thermal imager the motor would have been taken out of service for bearing
replacement and taken out again for gearbox inspection.

Advanced condition monitoring listens to plant and analyses a range of sounds
for frequency and amplitude. This can be displayed as a dynamic envelope, or
fingerprint, and is suitable for machinery with a complex series of
movements. This applies to special production machines with moving arms and
levers, for example, or electrical switchgear.

Condition monitoring also covers lubricating oil analysis, pressure and flow
of coolants, pressure and operation of hydraulic and pneumatic systems. A
drop in performance in any of these areas can lead to early machine failure.
A worn bearing or one about to collapse presents less resistance to flow of
lubricant so system pressure will drop as flow increases and accelerate
bearing failure. If plant is water or air cooled then failure of these
systems can cause overheating and thinning or degradation of lubricant.
Quality of insulation on high voltage equipment can be tested with partial
discharge techniques. Energy can be dissipated through insulation without
complete breakdown and where this results in a corona on insulators, the
radiation frequency and energy can be monitored. Condition monitoring of
insulating oil covers dielectric strength, colour, dissolved gas, and
moisture or detritus content.

Developing skills

For those who wish to develop condition monitoring skills, Schenck offers
training courses on dynamic balancing, vibration analysis and condition
monitoring. The company also offers a full range of equipment. The Series 40
consists of five portable instruments while the 1100 is a low cost
self-contained monitoring unit which attaches to a machine and provides alarm
and shut-down capabilities. The Vibrocam 4000 is PC controlled and can
monitor thousands of points. The trending and analysis software on this
system informs machine operators of potential failures.

SKF, which claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of bearings, has
used its production experience to develop a condition monitoring service.
This can supply equipment from pen-size hand-held instruments to
comprehensive machinery protection systems and analytical software. Its
latest instrument is the Microlog CMVA55, a portable data collector which it
claims has diagnostic capabilities never seen before in a portable
instrument. A liquid crystal screen displays readings in numerical and
graphical form.

At the other end of the scale, the company's M800A system can monitor
continuously a complete factory with data networked back to a central logging
and analysis facility. As part of its service the company has produced a 48
page booklet "How to Understand and Buy Condition Monitoring Equipment".
SKF's Asia Pacific office is in Singapore.

Bently Nevada has some 35 years experience in machine protection and offers
a comprehensive range of monitoring equipment, installation and training
service. It has nine offices throughout Asia.

For those who wish just to use condition monitoring techniques, vibration and
noise measurement specialist Bruel and Kjaer has developed a range of
equipment which can be operated by personnel unskilled in vibration detection
technology. For thermal imaging equipment, Land Infrared is a major
specialist and offers a wide range of temperature sensing equipment.

National Vulcan provides a condition monitoring service for audits and
feasibility studies and engineer surveyors for site visits. Bob Gray,
Technical Sales Manager, highlights the need to plan before installing
condition monitoring and points out the value of using a consultancy such as
National Vulcan to ensure that optimum results are obtained from a monitoring
system. The company is a leader in engineering insurance and says that the
installation of monitoring systems can reduce premiums.

Eagle Star also confirms that improved risk control reduces premiums. The
company is hoping to develop its machinery insurance services onto the Indian
sub continent and is already working in China. Its engineering division
offers technical support with inspections, training and consultancy as well
as machinery insurance.

Condition monitoring may be like insurance - you only wish you had invested
once it is too late. That can prove an expensive policy.

WATER QUALITY: Keep it clean

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The supply of fresh drinking water is a perennial problem, but a crop of
development projects across Asia promises to bring improved facilities to
large numbers of people.

In Hong Kong, for instance, the Ma On Shan water treatment works, due to come
on stream later this year, is designed to provide 227,000 cu m per day of
potable water to meet the ever growing demands of new and proposed
residential developments in Ma On Shan and Shatin.

Designed by US consultant Camp Dresser McKee (CDM) International, in
association with UK engineers Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick & Partners, this
state-of-the-art works consists of triple-tray sedimentation tanks,
flocculators and deep bed filters containing anthracite and sand to remove
DOCs (organic chemicals), and filter presses for dewatering sludge from the
filtration process.

Equipment suppliers include Atlas Copco (air compressors), Bailey Fischer &
Porter Corp, SCADA, UPS and fibre optics, British Transformers Ltd, Edwards
& Jones (filter presses), Hawker Siddeley Switchgear, Rotork Ltd (actuators),
SMC Pneumatics HK Ltd and Weir Pumps.

China, which will inherit Hong Kong's modern water treatment facilities next
year, is also investing heavily in improvements to the nation's facilities
with the aim of bringing them up to international standards.

Degremont UK Ltd is particularly active in China where it has been supplying
equipment since 1975; it also has permanent representation in Beijing and
Guangzhou. Since 1987 the company has entered into contracts to provide water
treatment plants for more than 50 municipalities. Equipment supplied includes
filtration plants, chemical dosing units, chlorinators, flocculators, pumps
and automatic control systems.

Also in China, Dewplan Ltd has recently been awarded a US$3m contract for the
design, supply and commissioning of a multiprocess water treatment works to
serve the new San Miguel Brewery. The plant is designed to treat borehole
water for the removal or iron and suspended material. It will also
incorporate pre-chlorination, de-alkanization and final polishing through GAC
(Granular Activated Carbon) filters.

The Japanese government has offered China a US$435m line of credit over the
next three years for water supply improvements in Liaoning and Gansu
provinces, Guang Xi and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

The UK's Overseas Development Administration (ODA) recently appointed Mott
Macdonald as lead consultant for the Shanghai Water Master Plan (SWAMP),
aimed at assisting the Shanghai Municipal Water Company (SMWC) to respond
more effectively to the rapidly changing demand patterns of its 3,900km long
distribution system.

In the Philippines, a private consortium comprising Kamaman and the Clark
Development Corporation has been commissioned to construct a US$50m water
supply system to serve the Clark Special Economic Zone, formerly a US air
base, in Central Luzon. The first phase comprises repairs to existing
reservoirs, the installation of eight chlorinators, the acquisition of
maintenance and other equipment, and the rehabilitation of five wells and
pumping stations together with 160,000m of distribution pipelines.

Meanwhile, 2m people living in the 20 poorest provinces of the Philippines
are to benefit from an Asian Development Bank US$37m loan to provide simple
low-cost water supply facilities to around 3,000 rural communities under the
government's Social Reform Agenda. Scheduled for completion by August 2001,
the project is designed to reduce waterborne diseases resulting from
contaminated open wells, streams and rivers.

In the same region, The US Filter Corporation recently acquired KBS Pure
Water Pte Ltd based in Singapore and Penang. KBS is a major supplier of water
treatment plant, including deionization equipment for the microelectronics
industry, and has established a 3,000 cu.m facility in Singapore.

Weir Pumps, in addition to supplying pumps to Hong Kong, has won a contract
to equip five stations belonging to the Metropolitan Water Authority in
Bangkok. The units, comprising single-stage, split casing pumps driven by
1200kW motors, are to be installed at Bang Khen, Klong Toey, Lat Phro,
Phahonothin and Samrong.

India, which suffers some of Asia's worst drinking water problems, is shortly
to benefit from a change of tack by the World Bank with the provision of the
country's first Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) schemes. New projects
include a US$70m rural water supply system for Uttar Pradesh, India's largest
state. in which the Bank is keen to involve NGO's, community organisations
and private sector companies.

The World Bank is also the catalyst for a private project designed to supply
Anhdra Pradesh, a southern suburb of Hyderabad, with 1,850ml/day of clean
water.

EXPRESS DELIVERY: UPS moves into Taiwan

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

In March 1996, after long delays, the government of Taiwan finally
granted international air express cargo company UPS (United Parcel
Service) the right to operate an integrated cargo facility at
Taipei's Chiang Kai-Shek (CKS) International Airport. If all goes
well, the move could spur the transformation of Taiwan into a
regional air cargo hub, as outlined under the government's
Asia-Pacific Regional Operations Centre (APROC) Plan.

The air express delivery market has expanded rapidly in recent
years. UPS boasts the largest turnover in the global industry, and
in 1995 realised a 35 per cent growth from the previous year in
overseas shipments from Taiwan. Another key player, DHL, the first
foreign air express company in Taiwan and the local market leader,
enjoyed growth of 27.6 per cent in the same period.

International express carriers are now posing a formidable
challenge to Taiwan's domestic air cargo companies, which are
handicapped by financial limitations and less well developed
operations. Antonio An, general manager of local express carrier
Lita International Express Co, claims that his firm's deliveries
from Taipei to Singapore have dwindled from 500kg to 100kg daily
since foreign carriers entered the market. "The route may not last
out next year," he says.

The war between domestic and foreign express air cargo companies
involves more than competition between carriers. Also caught up in
the fray is a network of air transport service firms, forwarding
agents, customs brokers and inland transportation and warehousing
companies. The question that many in the industry are now asking
is: will Taiwan emerge from this battle with a stronger logistical
base and sharper competitiveness in the industry? Or, in its haste
to achieve its APROC goals, will the government end up giving away
Taiwan's entire air cargo market to foreign companies?

Air express cargo companies were born in response to the commercial
need for fast delivery of original documents essential to the
operation of a wide range of industries, particularly finance and
shipping. Taiwan's document delivery business, however, is near
saturation point and does not hold sufficient profit potential to
satisfy international express carriers, especially latecomers to
the local market such as UPS and FedEx. To tap greater profits,
foreign firms have opened a new service offering express delivery
of consignments weighing over 45kg, which previously were shipped
as ordinary air freight.

Growing enthusiasm for this new service is attributable to a
combination of Taiwan's manufacturing orientation, its geographic
location and the time factor. Taiwan is far more attractive as an
air express cargo hub than many of its Asia-Pacific neighbours.
According to Adam Tsui, marketing manager for UPS in Taiwan, the
economies of both Hong Kong and Singapore are dominated by service
sector industries, meaning that urgent deliveries are mainly in the
form of paperwork, whereas Taiwan's economy is supported primarily
by export-oriented manufacturing industries, particularly in the
high-tech sector. Although South Korea has a strong manufacturing
base, it is largely in heavy industries and this, combined with the
country's geographical location, detracts from its potential as an
air cargo hub. Many of Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) are dynamic, high-tech goods manufacturers and these,
according to Tsui, form the client group with the greatest
possibilities.

Taiwan's largest computer manufacturer, Acer Sertek Inc., for
example, has a manufacturing facility at Subic Bay in the
Philippines that produces 150,000 computer motherboards per month.
If the components for making these motherboards were flown in from
Taiwan via the usual routes, they would have to go first to Manila.
Subic Bay is only about 100 miles from Manila, but delivery of
goods is often seriously delayed when heavy downpours turn poorly
paved roads into impassable rivers of mud. Acer now relies on FedEx
for chartered air cargo services direct to Subic Bay. The company's
deputy general manager Gen Chang lauds the efficiency of air
express services, but admits that costs are 30-50 per cent higher
than for delivery by ordinary air-freight.

The growth of industries for which time is money means a bonanza
for international express carriers. But the capital- and
technology-intensive requirements for the establishment of an air
express operation, combined with the demand for logistical
efficiency in integrated express delivery services, have
discouraged many businesses from trying to get a share of the
express delivery pie.

Currently only four international carriers - UPS, FedEx, DHL and
TNT - offer integrated air cargo services, in contrast to the
cheaper but less time-efficient services available from local
companies, which usually consolidate small consignments before
shipping. The big international players provide door-to-door
services that include pick-up and delivery to the airport, air
transport, customs clearance and freight forwarding facilities that
range from inland transportation to warehousing. This allows them
to control costs, guarantee delivery time and exploit economies of
scale, thus making them far more competitive than airline companies
and forwarding agents. Such considerations clearly explain the
differentials in shipping rates.

CH Lee, chairman of the Airfreight Forwarders' Association (AFA),
admits that the integrated, streamlined operations of international
air express companies have put them on an entirely different
footing from the rest of the air cargo industry. Forwarding agents,
customs brokers and airline companies have all been hit by the
growing popularity of specialised air express delivery companies.
Inland transportation and warehousing services are expected to
suffer as well.

The government's moves to develop Taiwan into a regional operations
centre may benefit international air express companies, but they
have sent a chill down the spine of the local industry. Since a
highly efficient air cargo system is essential to a regional
operations hub, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) has in
short time decided to establish both an air express cargo zone, or
Express Handling Unit (EHU) and an integrated air cargo zone, both
at CKS airport. The emphasis at the moment is on transhipment,
which accounts for 75 per cent of cargo handled, while
import-export accounts for only 25 per cent.

The establishment of the EHU is a positive step towards replacing
the nine-to-five customs operation with a round-the-clock service
allowing goods to receive customs clearance regardless of how late
they arrive. However, even though customs processing in the zone
requires only one quarter of the time previously needed, few
clients have shown interest in this special facility. Contrary to
initial estimates that 1000 cases would be handled per day, only
900 were handled in the facility's first month of operation.
International air express companies have complained of its high
fees, stringent restrictions and the total of 32 approval seals
that still need to be collected for each shipment, despite
allegedly simplified import and export procedures.
Publications and home appliances cannot pass through the facility,
as they have to be inspected by the Government Information Office
(GIO) and Quarantine respectively. As one air cargo terminal
officer puts it, these unreasonable regulations cause "express
delivery" to become "slow delivery".

There are other serious limitations. Says Terence Chuang, general
manager of DHL's Taiwan office: "The problem with the new facility
is that it's only allowed to handle - at least for now - shipments
under 45kg, and with a value below US$740. Shipments that meet
those criteria constitute only five per cent of the total air cargo
market."

In addition to criticisms from international express carriers,
local airfreight forwarders and customs brokers complain that
anyone interested in operating in the EHU must have an electronic
data exchange (EDI) system, which allows shipping documents to be
computerised and thus processed more quickly and efficiently. This
requirement, they say, was instituted without seeking input from
local firms who are unlikely to possess such technology, and
seemingly with only the interests of international companies in
mind.

The second facility, for integrated air cargo operations, is
expected to set the ball rolling for Taiwan's transformation into
a regional operations hub. But among local air cargo companies, it
is regarded as yet another unfair privilege for foreign companies.
Operating rights in this zone give UPS an exclusive service area at
CKS airport, where it will have its own ground crew and warehouses.
Combined with its air transport, forwarding and customs clearance
services, and possibly inland transportation service in the future,
the arrangement gives UPS an advantage over local, as well as other
international, air express cargo companies. "There are plenty of
local companies that understand this business, and understand it
well," says CH Lee of AFA. "We have no problem with competition,
but it has to be fair competition. Foreign operators should not be
offered privileges that give them an unfair competitive advantage."

DHL's Terence Chuang agrees that local companies are being put at
a disadvantage by their exclusion from the integrated cargo
handling zone, and predicts a rough ride ahead. "We need to
recognise that there are too many airfreight forwarders here," he
says. "There are something like 500 in Taipei alone. In the face of
competition from integrated foreign express carriers, the larger
local companies will probably survive, and some may have to merge
their operations. But there's going to be a big shakeout in the
industry, and a lot of small forwarders are going to have to close
down. Local companies that want to survive will have to integrate
their operations, and establish co-operative agreements with other
integrated forwarders in cities around the world and with
commercial airlines."

The government has taken these steps with the broader aim of
sharpening the competitive edge of local industry. Moreover, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development and the Ministry of
Transport and Communications expect the initiative to have a
catalytic effect on the transformation of Taiwan into an air cargo
transhipment centre, while at the same time strengthening the
logistical base for the manufacturing and financial centres called
for under the APROC plan. Adam Tsui of UPS insists that the
regional distribution experience of international express
companies, following the establishment of the transhipment centre,
will spur the development of Taiwan as an exporter of value-added,
semi-finished products assembled on the island.

Not all agree, however. "It's a good idea, but they're going about
it in the wrong way," says CH Lee of AFA. What needs to be changed
for Taiwan to become a regional operations centre is the whole
environment for the air cargo industry, particularly in terms of
upgrading services at its international airports, rather than
through negotiations with selected parties and creating an
environment based on "special privileges" for international
companies. "This is good for neither consumers nor manufacturers,"
says Lee.

Critics view the government's haste to establish an integrated air
cargo zone as a reflection of its desire to quickly put a good face
on its APROC plan, about which most people are not particularly
optimistic. Tsai Ching-yen, director-general of the CAA, however,
insists that as the agency responsible for implementing the
government's policy, there was little the CAA could do to reduce
its impact on the local industry. He maintains that the present
arrangements are only temporary, and that other companies will be
welcome once an additional terminal has been built at CKS airport.

Both academics and industrialists insist that a complete
transformation of the air traffic industry is more important than
making special arrangements for Taiwan to become a regional air
transport centre. Anthony Han, a professor at National Chiao Tung
University's Department of Transport Engineering and Management,
comments in a recent study that the air transport operations
environment, customs clearance and air cargo terminals operations
all need improvement, and that pertinent laws and regulations must
be revised to meet the industry's changing needs. As one example of
what can be achieved, he cites Singapore's Changi International
Airport, which already offers 24-hour customs clearance for all
goods, not just express cargo.

The liberalisation and integration of Taiwan's air cargo operations
has seen international express companies get off to a good start,
while local companies claim they have been left behind. Terence
Chuang of DHL, however, feels it is not too late for them to catch
up. "Until CKS airport becomes an import-export hub, it's not going
to be of any real value. Right now, it's an image thing. At the
same time, I think the present emphasis on transhipment will
actually give local companies some breathing room and allow them to
upgrade their operations to be able to compete with international
firms when Taiwan becomes an import-export hub."

Asiaweek Continuing Special Report on Asian Languages 13/09/96

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Khalid ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Saud (1913-1982) former monarch of
Saudi Arabia and son of Ibn Saud, the founder of the kingdom.
A well-liked moderate, Khalid rose to the throne in 1975 after
the assassination of his half brother Faisal and continued
with the latter's economic and social reforms. Upon his death,
Khalid was succeeded by a half brother, the currently reigning
King Fahd. TRIVIA: Khalid was the first foreign head of state
to pay a visit to France's Elysee Palace after Francois
Mitterrand came to power.

Khalistan literally "Land of the Pure" in PUNJABI. Name for
the (as yet unfulfilled) independent Sikh state demanded by
militant adherents of the religion. In its purest sense, such
an entity would include not only the Indian state of Punjab,
but also the adjacent territories that once belonged to the
realm of the great Sikh leader Ranjit Singh (1780-1839).

Khalkha the dominant Mongol group, making up more than three-
quarters of Mongolia's population. The word also refers to the
language, which is spoken by 1.8 million people in Mongolia
and is the country's official tongue, and the territory
controlled by the Khalkha people in the past (once also known
as Outer Mongolia). Khalkha submitted to Chinese rule in the
late 17th century, but declared independence when the Qing
dynasty collapsed in 1912. It became the Mongolian People's
Republic in 1924. (The "people's republic" was dropped from
the name in 1992.)

Khalsa (FIG.1) from PERSIAN khales, meaning "pure." Religious,
military and social brotherhood established by the last Sikh
guru, Gobind Singh, in 1699. Now the dominant order of
Sikhism. Upon reaching puberty, most Sikh children are
initiated into the Khalsa. After the ceremony (amritsanskar),
they assume the surname "Singh" (Lion) or "Kaur" (Lioness).
Khalsa members (called amritdhari) are required to distinguish
themselves by bearing the Five K's: kesh (uncut hair -
representing spirituality), kangha (comb - spiritual order and
discipline), kara (steel bracelet - unity with God and
allegiance to the Khalsa), kirpan (sword - courage, dignity
and self-sacrifice) and kachha (short trousers - moral
restraint). They must also adhere to a strict code of conduct;
one is prohibited from consuming intoxicants (especially
tobacco), engaging in adultery and dyeing or plucking out
white hair. Sikhs not belonging to the Khalsa are called the
sahajdhari ("slow adopters").

khalwat MALAY in Islam, the offense committed when a man and a
woman, who are not married to each other, are in close
proximity to each other in a secluded area. If you take your
girlfriend into your house in the evening, a nosy neighbor may
well assume you are up to hanky-panky and notify the religious
authorities. (Every once in a while, there is a highly
publicized case where a well-known politician, a prominent
businessman or a film star gets caught in such a situation.)
Being a popular destination for lovers, Kuala Lumpur's scenic
Lake Gardens are a particularly fruitful area for religious
officers after dark. Errant couples looking for a quiet spot
may well find themselves being pounced on by the eagle-eyed
enforcers and ordered to appear in court, where a fine or a
promise to get married is extracted from them. Non-Muslims are
exempt from charges of khalwat.

Khamenei, Ayatollah Seyed Ali (FIG.2) (b. 1940) Iran's
spiritual leader. Once a student under Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, Khamenei was imprisoned six times and exiled during
the rule of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. After the 1979 Islamic
Revolution, he served as Iran's president from 1981 to 1989
and succeeded Khomeini as the supreme religious leader when
the latter died in 1989. He is something of a scholar-figure
who did not shrink from lecturing on Islamic theology when
addressing the United Nations in 1987 (he also did not refrain
from fulminating against the U.S., causing the American
delegates to walk out). He does not have the use of his right
hand - the result of an 1981 assassination attempt in which a
tape recorder with a bomb hidden inside was placed on the
lectern while he was giving a sermon.

khamsin hot, dry and dusty southerly wind that occurs in North
Africa and the Arabian peninsula. Reaches temperatures of up
to 40 C. The name is derived from an ARABIC word meaning
"fifty" (referring to the approximate number of days the wind
lasts each year).

Khamtay Siphandone (b. 1924) prime minister of Laos. A
postman-turned-revolutionary, Khamtay served as the military
commander of the Pathet Lao movement and was appointed deputy
prime minister and defense minister when the Lao People's
Democratic Republic was established in 1975. Succeeded Kaysone
Phomvihane as PM in 1991 and, upon the latter's death in 1992,
as head of the ruling Lao People's Revolutionary Party.

Khan, Imran (FIG.3) (b. 1952) Pakistani cricket great of
Pathan stock. Making his not-so-auspicious Test debut in 1971
against England, Khan shook off his jittery beginnings to
achieve a reputation as one of the best all-rounders (i.e.,
proficient in both bowling and batting) in the history of the
sport. He captained the Pakistani team from 1982 to 1992 (with
two brief breaks due to injury and a short-lived retirement)
and crowned his illustrious career by leading his country to
its first World Cup title in 1992. As durable as his
reputation on the field was his image as a playboy: the one-
time most eligible bachelor was long known for his string of
high-society girlfriends. He ended up marrying Jemima
Goldsmith, a wealthy British financier's daughter half his
age, raising more than a few eyebrows - and probably breaking
more than a few hearts - in the process. Now retired, he is
presently lavishing his attention on his Shaukat Khanum Cancer
Hospital - named after his mother, who died of cancer in 1985
- and harboring political ambitions (he recently launched
Tehreek-e-Insaf, or Movement for Justice).

Khan, Jahangir (b. 1963) Pakistani squash great of Pathan
stock. Coming from a family of squash champions (father
Roshan, uncles Hashim and Azam, and cousin Mohibullah
dominated the sport in the 1950s and '60s), Khan burst into
the international squash scene in 1979 by becoming the first
unseeded - and, at 15, the youngest - player to win the World
Amateur Championship. In 1981, he embarked on a remarkable
five-year unbeaten streak of more than 500 games; when the run
came to an end, he was still only 22. Towards the end of the
1980s, Khan seemed less invincible but nevertheless won his
sixth World Open title in 1988 and the British Open for an
unprecedented 10th consecutive time in 1991, silencing those
who had dismissed him as over the hill.

Khan, Jansher (b. 1969) another Pakistani squash great of
Pathan stock (no relation to Jahangir). Currently ranked No.1
in the world, Jansher first came to the world's attention when
he beat Jahangir in 1987 (he went on to defeat his older
compatriot in their next 10 encounters). The kind of respect
and adulation showered on Jahangir, however, has been slower
in coming to Jansher, partly because of his somewhat abrasive
personality.

BUSINESS: Stocks To Watch: It"s the Economy, Stupid: Buying bank stocks?
Look at the big picture first 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Assif Shameen

Anyone bottom fishing for cheap stocks in Asia these days is
likely to dredge up a number of big-name bank stocks. Be
selective. "It's not a good time to be in Asian bank stocks,"
warns Robert Zielinski, regional bank analyst at Jardine
Fleming in Singapore. "Banking really is 95% macro-economics."
Powerhouses from Singapore to South Korea are starting to slow
down partly because of a slump in electronics demand but also
because it is simply time for a breather after years of heady
growth. "Banks generally are very sensitive to levels of
economic activity," says Simon Smithson, a regional bank
analyst for Kleinwort Benson Securities. "There is a prima
facie case for more circumspection in investing in banks."

But there are bright spots. Zielinski is enthusiastic about
the Philippines, which surprised analysts last week by
announcing better-than-expected first-half GNP growth of 7%.
"Wow!" he says. "It's a fantastic economic recovery and growth
story. Most bank stocks there are up more than 50% this year."
The Manila stock market may be nearly a year away from its
peak, he says, because "the Philippine economic cycle is about
two years behind Malaysia and about three years behind
Thailand." Raymond Lee, an analyst for Lehman Brothers, is
bullish on Hong Kong: "The economy is picking up not only
there but also in China. People talk about U.S. interest rates
rising but you have to realize that the Hong Kong economy is
now much more closely linked with China, where interest rates
are heading downward."

So which counters look good? John Hobson, a bank analyst at
Morgan Stanley Asia, says his house has a buy on eight bank
stocks worldwide but only one of them is in Asia - that's HSBC
Holdings, which controls Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank. The
counter is a favorite with many industry watchers. "HSBC has
great regional exposure," says Lehman's Lee. "They've targeted
the growing affluent class in Asia, and as a leading bank
group in Hong Kong, they are a key beneficiary of economic
recovery in the territory and China." Smithson likes the fact
that HSBC derives nearly two-thirds of its profits from Asia.
"That proportion will go up rather than down," says the
Kleinwort analyst. "Even as it expands in Europe and the U.S.,
HSBC will remain an Asia-centered bank. It is one bank that is
well-equipped to deal with the changing nature of Asia's
banking marketplace."

Zielinski is not so sure. "HSBC has such a huge exposure in
Britain and the U.S. that bad news there can more than offset
the good news in Asia," he argues. And HSBC and subsidiary
Hang Seng have had a great run this year. "All the good news
for HSBC as well as Hang Seng and some of the other banks in
Hong Kong is already in the price," says Bonnie Lai, a bank
analyst at brokerage Yamaichi International. She favors
laggards like the International Bank of Asia: "It's a small
bank that has underperformed the market and therefore is
likely to fare better in the next few months." But Zielinski
cautions: "There are lots of imponderables in Hong Kong beyond
the July 1, 1997 handover to China. There could be a whole lot
of Chinese banks doing all sorts of things."

If he were to purchase just one Asian bank stock, says the
analyst, "I would buy Philippine National Bank." True, PNB has
disappointed analysts in the past three years with its slower-
than-anticipated recovery, but Zielinski says this time
around, the former government-controlled bank is really going
to surprise people. PNB valuations are just half those of
other comparable lenders in the Philippines. "PNB may have had
lower returns on assets and returns on equity in the past few
years, but you've got to realize this is a turnaround story,"
says Zielinski. "It will have higher earnings growth than most
other banks over the next three years. There's little downside
and lots of upside." Smithson likes Metrobank, which is bigger
than PNB. Lee says he also wants to be in the Philippines, but
worries about high valuations: "You can't pay the moon for
even the best stock."

Zielinski is bullish on big Indonesian banks BDNI, Bank
Internasional Indonesia and Bank Danamon because they are
cheap. "Indonesia, like the Philippines, is an underbanked
market," he says. "This means banks have plenty of room to
grow." One problem: interest rates. "At 20% per annum, they're
higher than what an investor can earn from bank stocks," says
Zielinski. "So over the long term, if you believe rates won't
move too much either way, you must see if the stock you are
looking at can somehow get a return of more than 20%." Lee has
other worries. "In Indonesia, the macro economic picture isn't
that bad, but you have political instability," he says. "And
the central bank is trying to control credit growth and may
increase the required capital adequacy ratio."

What about the slowing economies? Zielinski finds good value
in Korean bank stocks, especially Shinhan Bank, Commercial
Bank of Korea, Korea Long-Term Credit Bank and Kookmin Bank.
"The Korean banking sector is probably the only one in Asia
where stock prices could double or triple in two to three
years," he says. "Now is the time to be accumulating bank
shares. Many are selling at 7 to 8 times this year's earnings.
An average bank in Asia sells over two times its book value.
Korean banks are selling at 70% of book value or a third of
the Asian average." But Morgan Stanley's Hobson has a caveat:
"Unless you believe the Seoul bourse is going to rise
substantially, you should stay away from most Korean banks."
He says banks in Korea are required to make provisions against
only 50% of their stock market losses.

Lee and Smithson like Malayan Banking in Malaysia, though they
concede the stock is expensive. "If you have to pick a bank
stock there, you might as well choose Maybank," says Lee.
Smithson says Maybank is better positioned than any other
lender in Malaysia, where "concerns about overheating are
receding and there is a degree of optimism about the medium-
term macro-economic fundamentals." Zielinski has a different
take. "Malaysian bank stocks are among the most expensive in
the world and the banks are still lending like crazy to
property developers, so they can't be a bargain in the long
run," he argues. What about Singapore? Banks there, says
Zielinski, "are very exposed to the overheated property market
at a time when the government is trying to cool things."
Lenders like Overseas Union Bank do have a reputation for good
management. "But with earnings growing so slowly, I'd give
them a miss," says Smithson.

The outlook in other countries does not look much better.
Economic worries in Thailand may continue to be a drag on bank
stocks, including heavyweights like Bangkok Bank. "Slower
growth will impact on loan growth, interest margins and
possibly bad debts, and thus hurt profitability," says Lee.
"People wonder when might be a good time to start fishing in
Thailand now that the water level is so low. I believe a
further fall will make banks very attractive. But right now,
Thai banks are a high-risk punt." Hobson is worried about a
surge in the level of non-performing loans. Zielinski says
bank credit outstanding as a percentage of GDP in Thailand, as
in Malaysia, is higher than anywhere else in the world. "The
ratio of credit to the size of the economy is about 140% to
150% and that's incredibly high. When Japan was at this level
of development, its ratio of credit to GDP was 70%."

Investors should also realize that things have changed. "In
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong, it's no longer
possible to look at banks as a growth industry," says
Smithson. "The days of 30% to 40% loan growth are gone." You
may get that in India with lenders like the State Bank of
India or in the Philippines. "In the more developed markets,"
says Smithson, "banks have become a mature business." The
industry has also become more competitive, "but not all the
banks will be equally well-placed to prosper in the new
environment." Still, banks will always remain part of any
large regional portfolio. Says Hobson: "If there is no
deterioration in asset quality, you can get a better return
from a bank compared with an industrial company or one that
sells consumer goods." Just be careful about fundamentals,
price and timing.

BUSINESS: Money & Investing: Banqueting With the Bears: As prices decline,
savvy punters get hungrier 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

The apparent economic slowdown in Asia this year has cooled
investor enthusiasm for stocks. But as markets fall, Hugh
Young, 38, managing director of Abtrust Fund Managers
(Singapore) Ltd., says he is becoming more bullish. The trick,
as usual, is to know where to tread. The Exeter University
graduate, who since 1985 has managed Britain's top-performing
Asian unit trust, Abtrust Pacific, spoke with Asiaweek's
Steven K.C. Poh. Excerpts:

Has the Asian growth story changed?

Overall, the longterm economic outlook for Asia is as
promising as ever. With the exception of Japan, which is
undergoing a structural, not cyclical, change and is having to
open its doors to the outside world, the forecasts for GDP
growth over the next 3 to 5 years in Asia are a comfortable
6%-7% per annum.

So, should we worry about the apparent slowdown?

That depends. I regard the slowdown we're seeing in Singapore,
and indeed throughout the region, as fundamentally healthy.
But it's also going to be painful for certain industries,
specific companies and unwary investors. Singapore is a good
example. The boom in the global electronics industry over the
past few years has had a dramatic effect, boosting economic
growth above virtually all forecasts. It surprised me that
first-quarter 1996 growth was so strong at 10.9%. Yet now
everyone is sunk in deep gloom over second-quarter growth of
7.0%. I find it hard to understand this reaction to a cyclical
event, which should have been expected. Cycles are part of
life, and so is development. Development or economic success
brings its problems and I think that is what we are seeing in
Asia today. All the region's economies are starting from a
higher base each year, so sustaining high growth levels is
ever harder. Labor, property and associated costs are all
rising; that puts pressure on margins, and eventually squeezes
certain businesses out.

What are the implications for earnings?

Corporate earnings are coming in much as we expected, but we
have had forecasts well below the consensus. Overall for our
Asian portfolios, we are seeing earnings-per-share growth
slowing to around 12% in 1996. This is a function of
increasing costs and increasing competition. With tariff
barriers coming down across the region, businesses are moving
across borders ever more rapidly. Any inefficient producers
who have traditionally been protected by tariffs will go out
of business and those who survive will have to be forward-
thinking and agile.

It sounds as if you are bearish on Asia.

No, oddly enough I'm getting more bullish as markets slip. I
think the key is knowing what you're doing. It's no longer
sufficient to close your eyes and invest in Asia, relying on
economic growth to carry you through. I think markets will
punish most concept stocks or those that have relied on
financial engineering and aggressive leverage. Conversely, the
rewards will go to stocks that invest in professionally
managed, well-financed companies - providing one is careful
about not overpaying for those earnings. For those investors
who are prepared to do the hard work there's some great value
to be had.

Is there value in sectors?

Obviously there are sectors that we naturally favor. Anything
benefiting from the growing wealth of the consumer should do
well, so we favor areas such as retail, insurance and media.
Similarly with strong economic growth, we like banks and
financial institutions. Also the infrastructure story will
remain a core investment theme in Asia for many years to come.
But at the end of the day, you have to be terribly stock
specific and focus on management because you are going to need
some skilled and visionary people to cope with all the
pressures of success that Asia is facing.

What stocks do you favor?

Among the large-capitalization issues, it is hard to do better
than some of the region's banks. Well-managed and standing on
reasonable ratings, we would buy HSBC, even after its strong
performance, and the Thai banks, such as Bangkok Bank, Siam
Commercial Bank and Thai Farmers Bank (but taking care to
access these either via the local board, if legally
permissible, or via convertible bonds). In Singapore there is
fabulous value to be discovered, but again only if one has the
ability to access the local board. The local board stocks that
look very cheap are again the banks - DBS, OCBC, OUB and UOB.
Singapore Airlines, which can be bought at asset value, and
Singapore Press Holdings are also bargains. Elsewhere among
the region's larger capitalized stocks, we are comfortable
with companies such as Indostat in Indonesia and Philippine
Long Distance Telephone and with some property companies that
are beginning to appear to be good value, such as Sime-UEP in
Malaysia and Sammakorn in Thailand.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: RATING YOUR BANK 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Every year Asiaweek ranks the region's 500 biggest commercial
banks according to assets. We also tell you how they compare
with each other in deposits, loans, net profit and
shareholders' equity. We calculate profit as a percentage of
assets and of equity (the higher the number, the more
efficiently the bank makes money), and equity as a percentage
of assets (the higher the number, the more capital the bank
can tap to deal with financial strains and emergencies). Loans
as a percentage of deposits, meanwhile, says how much a bank
is able to make use of relatively cheap deposit funds in
making lucrative loans.

In the following tables, we classify the banks by country and
indicate their moneymaking abilities, that is, their profit-
to-assets and profit-to-equity ratios, which are important in
picking what bank stocks to buy. For the first time, we also
include a table showing net interest income (NII). This tells
you how much money a bank made from its core business of
making loans plus its earnings from other assets, such as
interbank deposits, bonds, stocks and securities. Compare NII
with total net profit, and you will get an idea of how
diversified a bank is - or how dependent it is on interest
income.

Another tool: a ranking of top banks according to capital
adequacy ratio. You arrive at a lender's CAR by dividing total
capital - equity plus other assets - by the value of loans,
securities and other assets, weighted according to their
riskiness. The Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements,
which acts as a clearing house for the gold and currency
reserves of many countries, recommends a minimum CAR of 8% for
international banks. Those with higher ratios are regarded as
exceptionally stable, since they have more than enough
resources to cover risk assets.

What does this all mean to you as a depositor, borrower and
investor? As they say, forewarned is forearmed. Know thy
banker and thy bank. By all means, look for good service,
attractive deposit rates and cheap loans. But don't forget the
fundamentals. The numbers in these pages are a good starting
point.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: Rapped on the Knuckles: Can Jardine Fleming
regain investor trust? 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Hong Kong's Jardine Fleming Bank, ranked No. 350 in the
Financial 500, might be thankful it focuses on treasury and
foreign-exchange transactions, not on retail services.
Ordinary depositors could have been spooked by news last week
that a Hong Kong sister company, Jardine Fleming Investment
Management, had been censured for lax controls. JFIM's London-
regulated affiliate, Jardine Fleming Asset Management or JFAM,
was fined $625,000 and had its license in Britain withdrawn.
Three other investment firms within Britain's Robert Fleming
Group, half-owner of Hong Kong-based Jardine Fleming Group,
were each penalized $156,000 for failing to make sure that
JFIM had adequate controls before entrusting it with its
clients' money.

British and Hong Kong authorities came down hard on former
JFIM senior fund manager Colin Armstrong for enriching himself
at the expense of three funds, and on former JFIM and JFAM
chief Robert Thomas for failing to adequately supervise
operations and deal with the misconduct. Armstrong, who
resigned in March, and Thomas, who was sidelined to another
part of the group a month later, had their license in Hong
Kong revoked. (Thomas was also banned from working in
Britain's fund-management industry.) Armstrong has returned an
undisclosed amount to JFIM; the company will use the money as
part of a $19.3 million compensation fund for affected
investors. "This has been a painful experience," said Henry
Strutt, managing director of the Jardine Fleming Group. "We're
glad to have been able to put the matter right."

It is not over. Asia's biggest investment manager with $22
billion in funds, Jardine Fleming faces the task of reassuring
institutional and retail clients across the region. Last week,
Robert Fleming disclosed that it had repatriated three funds
under JFIM management, worth a combined $1.1 billion, back to
London, though it insisted the move has no connection with the
investigation. The controversy comes at a bad time. The Hong
Kong government will introduce a mandatory provident fund
scheme next year, which could mean billions of dollars in new
pension money needing managers. Some of JFIM's existing
provident-fund clients are said to be looking at their
options.

JFIM had been housecleaning even before the five-month
British-Hong Kong probe was completed. It had named a new
chief of compliance and hired experts to review procedures.
JFIM says it is banning personal-account dealings and
introducing a centralized system to check when and where all
trades are routed. Because of the loopholes, Armstrong had
allegedly found it easy to delay the booking of a trade. If
the transaction was especially profitable, say the regulators,
it would be credited as a deal made by his personal account or
one particular client account. If not, it would be allocated
to another fund he manages.

Despite the disciplinary action, Armstrong has yet to be shown
to have broken any Hong Kong criminal law. And JFIM? The
challenge is to remain entrepreneurial while making sure no
regulation is breached. JFIM's success has been credited to
its free-wheeling management. "This is the same business style
lauded in the press as more dynamic than half-a-dozen of its
competitors," says an industry source. "But any system is only
as good as the people within it." The regulators - and
investors - are watching.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: A Behemoth Awakes: New Delhi"s biggest bank
reinvents itself 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

In India, a giant is stirring. The State Bank of India
(assets: $36.1 billion) is putting away its musty files and
ledgers the size of billiard tables. Chairman P.G. Kakodkar,
59, aims to computerize 1,000 branches a year. SBI has also
started streamlining management structures and delegating
power to division heads. In August, it announced the formation
of subsidiaries to handle credit cards and securities trading,
and launched a partnership with travel firm Thomas Cook to set
up a tourism development finance company. "Internationally,
the bank is positioning for a dominant presence in the cross-
border loan syndication markets and also in the issue of
Indian paper by blue-chip companies," says Kakodkar.

There is much to do. Ranked No. 63 in the Financial 500,
state-controlled SBI employs 229,000 people and has 8,763
branches in India and 49 overseas. Owned 60% by the state, SBI
is under orders not to fire people, which raises the question
of what it will do with excess staff after computerization and
streamlining. Still, improvements are beginning to show.
Customer complaints are now considered black marks that can
affect an employee's prospects. SBI offices are less often the
dingy affairs that prompted jokes about the bank's expansion
strategy: go to a village, look for a cowshed, drive away the
cattle and set up operations. "The first thing we're doing
with the computerization of branches is to rework their
interior decor," says SBI spokeswoman Ranjana Bharij.

"It's a huge task to make SBI friendlier to the ordinary
customer," says investment analyst Imran Contractor. "They
have been so used to resting on their power." Improving
service to corporations should be easier. A new commercial
accounts division has just opened a Bombay branch to serve
business groups exclusively. SBI has also reduced processing
time for all loans. "These changes will ensure that old
clients will not go away," says Prasanna Someshwar, a banking
analyst for W.I. Carr in Bombay. "This is important because
new private banks are going for big business."

Can SBI compete? Contractor says the bank is still "highly
susceptible to government interference." But Someshwar is
optimistic: "It used to be a giant which did not know where it
was headed. Now it is focused." Four years ago, SBI
commissioned Canadian management consultancy firm Mackenzie
and Co. to study ways of improving its operations. The bank
started implementing the recommendations in January. In
Kakodkar, says Someshwar, SBI has found "an instrument of
reform, not necessarily a visionary." An SBI veteran who once
headed the bank's training college and technology division,
Kakodkar became chairman only two months ago. But he knows
where the bank has been - and where it wants to go.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: Too Many Lenders?: Let the market decide, says
Manila 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Edgardo Reyes has accounts with three financial institutions.
"One bank is more efficient than the others," says the
Filipino entrepreneur, "but I do business with all three
because I can get better terms that way." He is learning to
take advantage of the country's two-year-old banking
liberalization. The money people are getting an education too.
"Times have changed," says Rafael Buenaventura, president of
PCI Bank and the Bankers Association of the Philippines. "It's
no longer unusual for us bankers to wake up in the morning and
discover that changes have occurred overnight. As we scan the
morning papers over breakfast, we find out that one new bank
is about to open, a new product has been introduced, and the
government is thinking about some new means of taxation."

Welcome to the brave and ever- expanding new world of
Philippine banking. In the last few months, Filipino-owned
East-West Banking Corp., Ecology Bank, iBank and Total Savings
Bank opened their doors. Earlier, Banco Santander of Spain,
Dao Heng Bank of Hong Kong and Taiwan's Chinatrust teamed up
with Filipino partners to launch three new ventures. Last
year, 10 foreign banks - among them Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi,
Development Bank of Singapore and Bangkok Bank - started full-
scale operations. The tally so far: 152 institutions. "Our
banking density ratios have significantly declined from more
than 17,000 persons per bank in 1990 to about 12,500 in 1995,"
says Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson. "That is bringing
us closer to the much lower densities seen in Hong Kong and
Japan."

Good or bad? Ask the public. Pre-liberalization, the 137
mostly Filipino-owned banks offered only basic services. These
days, lenders entice clients with phone banking, automated
teller machines that sell airline tickets, high-yield savings
plans - and longer hours. "Various product and market
diversification strategies have been implemented and a host of
electronic banking innovations created to tap yet unserviced
consumer segments," says Antonio Abacan, president of
Filipino-owned Metrobank, the country's best-capitalized
commercial bank. Rates for customers have improved. In 1994,
the spread between the lowest deposit rate and the prime
lending rate was 12.5 percentage points. The gap is now only
half that.

But there are worries. After Indonesia opened up its banking
sector in 1988, hundreds of new banks and deposit-taking
companies set up shop. Some found themselves dangerously
overstretched. One casualty: medium-sized Bank Summa, which
collapsed in 1992 under the weight of $800 million in debts.
"I would like to admonish some sectors not to be too hasty in
pressing for more liberalization," says Buenaventura. "It's
premature to consider the entry of more foreign banks."

Singson insists that safeguards are in place to protect the
banking system. The central bank has increased minimum
capitalization - from $30 million to $48 million for
commercial banks - and tightened its monitoring, especially of
risk management. "Everywhere in the world, government
officials have a poor track record whenever they start
substituting their judgment for that of the market," he says.
"Business decisions are best left to the bankers." And to bank
customers.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: Asian Promises: The WTO hopes to solidify them


from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

The financial services trade deal that took effect Sept. 1 was
a baby step on the road to open markets. Next comes the hard
part: making the tentative promises, agreed to last year in a
pact signed by 44 World Trade Organization members,
permanent. Those promises include things like increasing the
number of foreign banks allowed to operate in a given country
or permitting overseas brokerages to establish joint ventures
with local companies. Beginning Nov. 1, 1997, the signatories
will have 60 days to amend, add or withdraw promises already
made. That is not the only unfinished business. Last year, the
U.S. dropped out at the last minute. The hope is that
Washington will be more willing to deal once presidential
elections are past.

The U.S. has been especially critical of Asian nations for
practicing protectionism. Asian negotiators respond that they
see little to gain from matching the U.S. in opening markets.
How-ever, that didn't stop many from making concessions. By
sector, here are some of key ones:

BANKING

India: Increased to eight from five the number of banking
licenses it awards to foreigners each year. Also agreed not to
count automatic teller machines against the quota, which has
been a sore point between regulators and foreign banks.

Malaysia: No longer requires foreign banks to hold training
programs for Malaysians before bringing in outside
specialists. Also, foreign-owned banks now can accept foreign
currency deposits from local residents.

Philippines: Raised the limit to 49% from 40% on how much
equity in domestic banks a foreigner can buy.

South Korea: Agreed foreign financial institutions could take
minority equity positions in domestic banks for the first time
beginning this year.

Thailand: Promised to sanction two new branches for each
existing foreign bank by 1997.

INSURANCE

Japan: Will allow insurance brokers to operate in Japan,
liberalize cross-border insurance deals for ships and aircraft
of Japanese registration, and ease reserve requirements.

Malaysia: Promised to allow new foreign entities in non-life
reinsurance. Seven new licenses are pledged by June 30, 2005.

Pakistan: Established a new 51% limit for the share foreign
entities can own in new life insurance companies. The same
percentage will apply to banks' portfolio management arms.

Philippines: Liberalized market access for foreign-owned or
controlled insurance and reinsurance companies.

OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES

India: Promised to allow foreigners to incorporate local
stockbroking joint ventures as long as the foreigners didn't
own more than 49%.

Indonesia: Promised to eliminate all market access
restrictions in financial services by 2020. Before, the
promise was for only partial elimination.

Malaysia: Pledged to raise the foreign equity limit in certain
financial firms to 49% from 30% by July 1, 2000.

South Korea: Lowered the operating fund requirements for
foreign securities firms doing business in the country. More
significantly, it raised from 10% to 15% the proportion of
shares that foreigners can own in a Korean company.

NO SPEEDING

Flush with triumph at having brokered a major trade deal
without the involvement of the U.S., European Union members
scoffed at what they thought was Japanese timidity. Tokyo
wanted to give the 44 signers of the financial services treaty
a year to debate and approve the treaty in their home
capitals.

Japanese negotiators prevailed, and today it is their turn to
harrumph. Ten of the original signers missed a June 30, 1996,
deadline for ratification. Today, four EU countries have not
acted to endorse their promises, though all 10 Asian countries
that signed have.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: Bankers on Banking: The buzzwords: change and
service 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Like it or not, all of us have to deal with bankers. So what
makes that experience a boost rather than a bane? A great
institution requires a mixture of profitability,
competitiveness, quality service, innovation, corporate
responsibility and, of course, financial soundness. But it
also demands a dynamic leader to add a dash of inspiration. We
talked to head honchos of top banks about their recipes for
success. Excerpts:

Antonio Abacan, 53, president of Metrobank in the Philippines
(No. 218 in the Financial 500), knows a thing or two about
good service. "Since most products and services in the banking
system are homogenous, with minimal price differentials, many
clients have become indifferent," he says. "But one factor
that spurs customer loyalty is outstanding service." Schooled
in Western and local techniques, Abacan defines Metrobank's
vision as singularly Asian: "The Western way is
straightforward and to the letter. In our way of banking, even
if your customer's financial statement is negative but you
know his business, you will lend to him."

Amirsham Aziz, 46, managing director of Malayan Banking Berhad
(No. 70), has been working for Maybank for 19 years. The
institution has been extending loans and deposit facilities to
its customers since 1960. Amirsham puts commitment to people
first. "Being No. 1 has many responsibilities," he says. "The
public expect excellent services, our staff expect an
excellent working environment, shareholders expect superior
returns. Meanwhile, our competitors try to match every move we
make. All this sums up the need to be a truly efficient
organization which continuously strives for excellent service,
to satisfy the expectations of increasingly sophisticated
customers."

Banthoon Lamsam, 43, president of Thai Farmers Bank (No. 96),
aims to combine Asian conservatism with Western innovation.
"First, extremely careful lending, and second, changing the
way we provide services" are his winning strategies, says the
Harvard- and Princeton-trained billionaire scion of the bank's
controlling family. One of his pet peeves: long lines at
teller windows. He has trimmed them.

David Li Kwok Po, 57, deputy chairman and CEO of the Bank of
East Asia (No. 154), is one of Hong Kong's most prominent
bankers and the industry's representative on the territory's
Legislative Council. Li's family has made BEA one of the major
banking forces in the territory. He once aspired to the
Anglican Church ministry, but chose instead a more secular
career path. His secret for success? "It's confidence," says
Li. You have to convince the client that you are trustworthy
by providing good service, he urges. Do that and loyalty will
come. One strategy: student loans. Li aims to turn them into
loyal clients early.

Okkie A.T. Monterie, 51, deputy president director of Bank
Internasional Indonesia (No. 245), says transparency is one
strong reason for the bank's success. For starters, it makes
raising money offshore far easier and often cheaper.
"Investors know exactly what we're doing," he explains. "We
have a clear-cut image." He compares BII and Bank Central
Asia, the country's largest privately owned institution. "BCA
is not a public company; we are," says Okkie. "There is no
pressure on them to show a good bottom line. A public company
has more visibility, more transparency."

Peter Seah Lim Huat, 50, president and CEO of Overseas Union
Bank (No. 116), joined the Singapore lender after 10 years at
Citibank, widely regarded as one of the few truly global
institutions. That experience gave Seah a taste for thinking
internationally and keeping up with an ever-changing market.
"Consumer banking is going through a radical evolution," he
observes. "We are moving into a highly electronic environment
with a broader range of more complex products. That requires
different skills, a different mentality, retraining and
repositioning. When you have been in a business for over 40
years and are steeped in tradition, these changes are not
simple."

Yoon Byung Chul, 60, president of Hana Bank (No. 115), sees
virtue in both big banks and boutiques. "You're either a niche
bank or a universal bank that provides just about any kind of
financial service," he says. "These days there is nothing in
between." Hana is setting up a stockbroking firm and wants to
offer unit trust, insurance and other services as soon as
Korean regulators will allow them. Plainly, Asia's best banks
are hardly sitting pretty waiting for the interest to pile up.

FINANCIAL 500: The Asiaweek Financial 500: From global giants to nimble
niche players, Asia"s banks tell the secrets of success 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Ricardo Saludo and Matthew Fletcher

In a world of phonebanking, automated teller machines, online
asset switching and smartcards, Antonio Abacan has a secret
weapon. "We serve tea in all our branches," allows the
president and chief operating officer of Metropolitan Bank &
Trust Co., the Philippines' largest financial institution, No.
218 in The Asiaweek Financial 500 ranking of the region's
biggest banks.

The hot cups of Chinese brew are part of Metrobank's Asian
style. "We've developed a niche - Filipino-Chinese
businessmen," Abacan says. One such client, a Mr. Angpin,
appreciates the familiar touch: "They know the Asian way. You
can drop by, give a bag of money to the manager for deposit,
and not bother counting the money." Yes, confirms Abacan, "our
teller will later call him to say, `Your deposit is 1 million
pesos.' Other banks try to imitate our style, but this kind of
trust takes years and years to cultivate."

As competition hots up in the liberalizing world of Asian
banking, the leading players are finding that tried and tested
ways are just as important in staying ahead as the latest high
tech and financial legerdemain. Banker-legislator David Li
Kwok Po, chief executive of Hong Kong's third-ranked Bank of
East Asia (No. 154 in the 500), breaks no news when he
expounds on BEA's success formula: generating confidence,
providing strong service and building relationships. Plus a
maverick streak: the bank's early push into China has made it
probably the most profitable foreign player on the mainland.
"You can't be too aggressive because your customers won't like
that," Li explains. "But you can't be too conservative either.
It's hard to get the mix right."

But mix the top banks must. This special report looks at how
some of the best performers in key Asian markets cope with
rising competition and rapid change. Their moves and those of
the regional industry are major factors in shifts among the
Financial 500 banks. Now in its third year, the annual ranking
(starting on page 60) again chronicles in telling numbers the
surges and strains of Asian banking. Trillion-yen write-offs
in Japan? No wonder the 500's top 20 lossmakers are Japanese.
Roaring economies in Greater China? Indeed: with just 15% of
the 500's assets, banks from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan
generated nearly 40% of all profits.

The world's largest financial institution as of March 31,
1996, the end of the fiscal year covered by the 500, was Dai-
Ichi Kangyo Bank (assets: $536.6 billion). But DKB's return to
first place (it was No. 1 for years during the 1980s) lasted
but a day. The newly merged Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, with
combined assets of $791 billion, dwarfed it on April 1 - and
pointed to the likely future of Japanese banking. Faced with
monstrous dud loans and equally gigantic competition, and
urged by the Finance Ministry, lenders in Japan are seeking
strength in tie-ups and takeovers. Four institutions with
stakes in Taiheiyo (No. 169) are rescuing that lender. Nippon
Trust (No. 131) cut its losses by $1.2 billion after it was
taken over by Mitsubishi Bank (No. 3). The latter's merger
with Bank of Tokyo (No. 12) is just the latest union among
several in recent years, which also created Sakura Bank, No. 1
in the previous Financial 500.

The marriages and write-offs by Japanese institutions
highlight a key plank in the strategies of topnotch Asian
banks: Beef up your capital. Singapore's Overseas Union Bank
(No. 116) plans a big push in both regional and consumer
banking. For that, OUB and its subsidiaries have more than
tripled their capital to over $2 billion since 1992,
polevaulting from 400 to 162 in the ranks of world banking
groups by capital funding, and fifth in ASEAN. "Our much
larger size has enabled us to effectively penetrate [loan]
syndication markets in Thailand, China, Hong Kong and even
Australia," says OUB chief Peter Seah Lim Huat. The heftier
equity base has also helped it acquire Chase Manhattan's
credit-card business in Singapore. With investment banking
ambitions, Japan's Sanwa Bank has augmented its capital by
cashing in some $1.3 billion in stocks. That lifted its
capital adequacy ratio to 9.12%, well above the 8% recommended
for international institutions and despite a $9.2-billion
write-off charged against equity.

The urge to merge is also spurred by intense competition. "You
will see it happening in Hong Kong," says Thomas Koetzsch, a
Hong Kong-based analyst for bank rating agency Capital
Intelligence. "There are too many banks." And more are coming,
from outside and inside Asia. Bank Austria is among the latest
Western institutions following corporate clients to Asia.
Koetzsch reckons Hong Kong could see local tie-ups or
purchases by mainland banks of Hong Kong institutions after
next year's reunification with China. Many large Chinese banks
are eager to widen their presence in Hong Kong, and "the
`easiest' way seems to be to buy a local bank," says Koetzsch.
London-based HSBC Holdings, parent of the Hongkong & Shanghai
Banking Corp. (No. 19), is rumored to be among the suitors for
Australia's state-controlled ANZ, whose strengths in South
Asia, Australasia and the South Pacific would complement
HSBC's reach. The new government in Canberra is believed to be
open to a foreign takeover.

Asian banks revving up for tougher competition also need to
enhance their human and technological resources. Sheltered
domestic markets, steeled by high regulatory walls, once led
to world-beating spreads and profits. But they left homegrown
institutions short on technology, innovation and marketing
savvy. "The prosperity of Asian banks is due not to good
management or innovation, but to protectionism and cartels,"
says Robert Zielinski, research chief of Jardine Fleming
brokerage firm in Singapore. "Banks have become fat and
inefficient." But they're changing, says analyst Phuah Eng
Chye of Kleinwort Benson Research in Kuala Lumpur. "Banks are
focusing on how to reinvent themselves. Once complacent, they
are now more alert and flexible."

At least, that's the goal. For Thai Farmers Bank's billionaire
boss Banthoon Lamsam, it means only one thing: Build a
service-oriented staff. "Our service was terrible - that was
the assumption from the beginning," says the Ivy Leaguer,
whose ethnic Chinese family founded Thai Farmers (No. 96 in
the 500) in 1945. He partly blames entrenched habits in the
domestic industry, where banks tend to be "very bureaucratic
and controlled by a closed group who take advantage of
consumers." Banthoon's solution: new technology and training
people for high performance.

Overcoming employee resistance to change has been the toughest
challenge, he says. To meet it, Banthoon revamped and
revitalized a core group of about 200 managers, imparting to
them his vision of Thai Farmers as a world-class player.
Result: online accounts, phonebanking, automatic bill payments
and credit-card clearance are now standard. Queues at Thai
Farmers are much shorter. And the improvements are getting
noticed. "Thai Farmers is perceived as a bank with vision and
a long-term plan to stay competitive," says Susheel Neruda,
head of research at Seamico Securities in Bangkok.

Metrobank's Abacan has also worked to improve employee morale,
teamwork and drive. He has helped create a spirit of
belonging, which has spurred staff to work long and hard and
be loyal (average length of service among senior executives:
27 years). Bank chairman George Ty himself sets the example,
at 64 still at his desk every day. Another morale boost:
spouses are often invited to bank functions. "They're family,"
says Abacan. Also boasting high productivity, Bank
Internasional Indonesia (No. 245), which has to make the most
of its relatively small headcount - 5,800 - spread among 170
branches. "We're very much lower in operating expenses vis-a-
vis competitors," says senior v.p. Manuel Sia, a Filipino who
joined BII in 1990. That has helped give the bank a 23.6%
return on equity, highest among the top 20 Indonesian banks.

Part of the Sinar Mas wood-based empire, the Jakarta-based
institution has grappled with another issue facing Asian banks
in a changing industry: universal vs. niche banking. Does a
bank offer a full range of services to all comers, or focus on
a narrow stratum of services and customers? But whichever one
chooses, the imperative, as BII has seen, remains the same:
Develop a market position. A bank should resolve the
universal-niche issue based not on theoretical arguments
favoring one or the other, but on what its market demands. And
once chosen, the market position should be developed by
gearing up to service the target clients and publicizing the
kind of bank one aims to be.

"In the beginning we were looking at corporate banking, but it
didn't make sense," recounts BII deputy president-director
Okkie A.T. Monterie. He saw that Indonesia's growing ranks of
affluent consumers wanted bankers that could offer everything
from car loans to credit cards. Three years ago BII shifted
gear. "The right direction for Indonesia is universal or
supermarket banking," says Okkie, who notes that two other
corporate-oriented players, Bank Niaga (No. 324) and Bank Bira
(No. 427), are going the retail banking route. BII seems well-
advanced on that road - literally: to better publicize its
consumer tack, it has bright red ads touring Jakarta on the
bodies of public buses.

Building a market position from scratch is a daunting
challenge, of course. One solution: take over a successful
operation, which will bring with it the hard-to-duplicate
customer relationships that underpin any banking operation.
HSBC bought J.P. Morgan bank's dollar-clearing unit, vaulting
itself into the top five in the global business, handling $80
billion a day for some 700 institutional clients. The quest
for an instant market base on which to build motivates buyouts
of consumer banking businesses like Chase's credit-card
operation in Singapore. That acquisition, says OUB's Seah, has
been "instrumental in energizing the rest of our consumer
business." For its part, Taipei-based Chinatrust Bank (No.
144) stole a march on rivals with a different kind of tie-up:
with auto dealers for its push into car loans. It's the same
tack for BEA, which is linking up with German marque Mercedes
Benz in China. "They have the name," says CEO Li. "We build
the relationship."

Like market position, the issue of technology suffers from
slogan-ridden herd-driven thinking. Everyone is innovating, so
banks feel they have to or else. Asia's smart bankers follow a
hard-nosed, market-led rule of thumb: Use technology to reach
the client. Not to impress other bankers or follow the fad,
but to improve service and boost profits. Old-style banking
required the public to travel across town, line up before
tellers and fill out complicated forms. The high-tech variety
enables customers to avail themselves of the same services and
more from the comfort of their office desk or bedside table.
Financing is arranged when it is needed: as the client buys
something.

Hongkong Bank aims to use that strategy in its drive for the
high-end consumer market. So will its subsidiary Hang Seng
(No. 49), which is targeting a mass market that is only now
becoming comfortable with innovations like phonebanking and
credit cards. Helping HSBC's techno-ambitions is its size: it
can spread the cost over eight major affiliate institutions,
including Midland Bank, one of Britain's top four, and
America's Marine Midland.

For Metrobank, high tech and modern systems helped it reach
out to the thousands of Filipino workers overseas. Its Private
Electronic Remittance and Communication System handles large
volumes of money remittances fast. The service allows cash to
be withdrawn by a worker's family in the Philippines on the
same day he or she deposits the money at one of Metrobank's
online terminals abroad. Technology upgrades being such a
daunting operation - Thai Farmers had to re-engineer 500
branches over three years - they have to pay for themselves
and more. And they can if they bring in customers.

What about going international? Under the World Trade
Organization's financial services deal, banking markets in
many countries are opening up. But Kleinwort Benson's Phuah
believes for most of the region's institutions, "globalization
does not appear feasible because Asian banks are not clear
what objectives can be achieved. How does opening a branch in,
say, New York, London or Tokyo contribute to profitability?"
He expects banks with international ambitions to expand
regionally first. But Amirsham Aziz, head of top-ranked
Malayan Banking (No. 70) goes further back: "To be successful
abroad, you would need to first succeed in your own market.
Then you would need to know the foreign country well and make
sure you can be an important component in its development."

Maybank is itself grappling with the challenges of banking in
the New Asian Economy, where old developmental priorities have
given way to the demands of fast-expanding affluence and
regional business. Its experience mirrors those of other
established Asian lenders, most of which started as conduits
of funds for early industrialization and infrastructure.
"Maybank was established in 1960, when the country had just
achieved independence," recounts Amirsham. "We played our role
as a mobilizer of capital for economic development."

Such institutions were more concerned with bankrolling roads,
bridges and factories than attending to their bottom line. Now
that their nations have achieved economic strength, they
ironically face the prospect of losing the fruits of their
nation-building efforts to newcomers more attuned to such
thrusts as consumer financing and investment management. In
Korea, for instance, while the largest lenders creak under
non-performing business loans built up during the decades of
rapid industrialization, a relative upstart like Shinhan Bank
(est. 1981, No. 61 in the 500) can plot bold moves with its
clean balance sheet.

Can the established lenders of the development years adapt and
profit from the very success they helped create? Maybank,
which serviced mainly companies during the development years,
has been moving to develop its consumer banking business. In
this endeavor, Amirsham points out, "the bank's early
expansion to reach various segments of the people gives us a
strong market presence." He adds that the bank's development
orientation also imbued it with concern for the client.
"Meeting customers' needs has always been at the forefront of
everything we do," stresses the CEO, a 19-year veteran at the
bank. "We've also adopted a philosophy that values long-term
relationships with our customers."

In sum, nation-building lenders may in fact have the same
traits that could win them loyal customers in today's boom
times if - a big one - they can target the new class of
clients. But in doing so, Asian institutions need to maintain
a cautious conservatism in the face of unfamiliar booms that
could so easily go bust, as Japan's bubble-economy bankers
have seen. Kleinwort Benson's Phuah rings out a familiar
warning about Kuala Lumpur, which would apply to many other
Asian cities: "Easy liquidity has fueled asset prices,
especially in property. If there's a severe fallout, bad debts
could rise."

At the same time, years of intimate experience in Asia's
markets give its lenders a unique plus. Says Chinatrust
executive Steve Chou: "Imagine a multinational walking into a
laundry shop to evaluate credit risk. Local banks have lived
with these people so many years, they know." Whether gauging
risk, building relationships or just having tea, the ultimate
tenet in regional finance seems clear: Banks in Asia can win
by being Asian. After all, in a business built on trust, it
helps to be one of the family.

PEOPLE: Now, Enter the Mongolian: Sumo fans would have to wrestle with a
name like Daba Badobayaru 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Sumo fans would have to wrestle with a name like Daba
Badobayaru. So in Japan, he is known as Kyo-kushuzan. But,
whatever his name, fame beckons the 23-year-old Mongolian. He
has become the first wrestler from his country - and only the
sixth foreigner ever - to compete in the top makuuchi level of
the sport. The current three other non-Japanese wrestlers are
all Hawaii-born. "It was painful adjusting to Japan in terms
of language and food," said Kyokushuzan - though his 1.83-
meter, 121-kg frame suggests he has now mastered the cuisine
at least. Kyokushuzan has made giant steps since 1992 when he
launched his Japan career in Osaka. Last week he barged into
the elite 40 of about 800 professional sumo rikishi. "I'm a
happy man," he told journalists. No one in the audience dared
dispute him.

PEOPLE: To Coach or To Be Coached?: "I would like to coach," says former
women"s world table tennis champion... 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

"I would like to coach," says former women's world table
tennis champion Jiao Zhimin. "I have not played at all since I
came to South Korea. I played ping-pong for 18 years in China
and I think that is enough." But, if Jiao's fans have their
way, she is unlikely to hold a ping-pong paddle again. Since
settling in Seoul, the former Chinese athlete has been a TV
and newspaper reporter, a model, and, most recently, an
actress in Daughters-in-Law From Three Countries, a TV mini-
series. Jiao caught the fancy of Koreans when she and Korean
table tennis player Ahn Jae Hyung fell in love during the 1986
Asian Games. They married in December 1989 and now have a
five-year-old son. For all her fame, Jiao, 33, says she still
isn't comfortable acting. "It's very hard, especially since my
Korean isn't that good yet," she says. "When I memorized my
lines, my acting was bad. And when I acted okay, I would
forget the words." Right, maybe coaching would come more
naturally.

PEOPLE: The Mee Pok Girl: Singaporean actress Michelle Goh may be last
year"s movie sensation... 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Singaporean actress Michelle Goh may be last year's movie
sensation, but in a country with a track record of rarely
making more than one film a year, she's still a big deal. Goh
played the female lead character, Bunny, a prostitute, in
director Eric Khoo's drama Mee Pok Man, about a noddle-seller.
About a year (and 22 international film festivals) since the
movie was released, she's still known as the "Mee Pok Girl."
Postcards of Goh (barely) dressed in a bra-top and tight
shorts were a popular giveaway offered to subscribers to an
online magazine. She has also taken part in a Japanese TV
special called Asian Beauties and has cut a couple of songs
for a CD. Goh, 22, who had never acted before last year, will
soon be starring in a soap, My Grandson The Doctor, on
primetime Singapore television. Prior to showbusiness, she had
a different kind of high-flying career - as a Cathay Pacific
flight attendant.

Technology Computers: Tick Tock Goes the Clock: Experts race to head off
the Year 2000 crisis 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Jose Manuel Tesoro

The way the doomsdayers tell it, the world as we know it will
end at midnight, Dec. 31, 1999. The second the next millennium
begins, people will be recorded with negative ages. Phone
calls will be billed in millions of dollars. Instead of paying
interest due on loans, borrowers will receive a percentage of
what they owe - while depositors will be asked to pay banks
part of their savings. Building security systems may fail,
financial markets could be paralyzed.

All this is forecast to happen because computer programmers
decided over 30 years ago to save on data storage space by
designating years with two-digit numbers. They assumed that by
the time the 1990s rolled around, hardware and software would
have been replaced by versions that do not assume all dates
are in the 20th century. The old "legacy" systems think "00"
signifies 1900 - so at the beginning of the next millennium,
they will start calculating current bills, interest-rate
payments, pension disbursements, bond maturities, mortgages
and the like as if they began, ended or spanned the beginning
of the century. The bug will affect both personal computers
and mainframes.

Since business and government have become so dependent on
computers for data processing and analysis, the stroke of
midnight could have an ominous ring to it (see box). Ana-lysts
have likened the so-called Year 2000 problem to a virus -
though it technically is not one - since it is so wide-spread
and so dangerous. U.S.-based market research firm the Gartner
Group estimates that fixing the "millennium bug," which may
require rewriting millions of lines of computer code, will
cost $600 billion. Last April, its research director, Bruce
Hall, told the U.S. Congress that "the Year 2000 virus is the
most devastating ever to infect the world's business systems."

That dire? Maybe not. Many companies - both computer suppliers
and their customers - have long been aware of the bug and have
been working on solutions. In addition, Asia generally has the
advantage of having adopted the latest technologies, which
have benefited from the results of this awareness. So, as with
many things in the region, the Year 2000 crisis could end up
being the Year 2000 moneymaking opportunity.

"It's a business problem - and people really have to take the
bit between their teeth," says Ray Muller, business consulting
manager for CSSL, a Hong Kong-based reseller of IBM mainframes
that will soon launch a consulting division to offer clients
solutions to their Year 2000 problems.

Dozens of U.S. and European companies are already in the
market. Software and services company Compuware, for instance,
offers a package that includes software products as well as
programming professionals to diagnose, test and solve problem
applications. The process, says Andy Lewandowski, Compuware's
manager of international operations, will "take a lot of human
intervention." Though off-the-shelf solutions exist, rewriting
customized code will need people.

That is good news for India, which has a wealth of computer
professionals. Over 50 Indian companies working on ways to
squash the millennium bug have formed a special interest group
to promote their services. "We will offer cheap, quick and
easy solutions to the problem," says industry spokesman Dewan
Mehta. These companies feel that they can grab around $5
billion of the global business.

"The tools to solve this problem are the same everywhere,"
says Raghavendra Rao of Hyderabad-based Satyam Com-puters.
"But it requires extensive manual intervention. And people
costs in India are cheaper - less than half of those in the
U.S." The Gartner Group estimates that farming codework out to
offshore sites such as India will cut costs by 40%.

The Indians think the Gartner estimate of $600 billion is
high. Mehta says the final figure is likely to be between $60
billion and $200 billion. One reason: many companies have
addressed the problem early. Hongkong Bank, for example, began
making its systems "Year 2000-compliant" in the mid-1980s. "We
knew it would be a problem," says Bob Carlson, the bank's
technical services director. So the company simply included
Year 2000 compliance as part of its normal program of up-
grades. The bug "is a real problem," Carlson acknowledges,
"but the situation is being exacerbated by some of the people
who have most to gain from offering services to fix it."

Hongkong Bank has been aided by the relative newness of its
systems. Many U.S. and European companies adopted - and still
use - technologies from the 1970s and early 1980s. Still, says
Compuware's Lewandowski, Asia's slight advantage should not be
an excuse for complacency. "Never assume anything," he warns.
Preparing for the Year 2000 should be every business's
business.

COME MIDNIGHT

Some examples of what might happen:

Computers could subtract birth years from 1900, giving people
negative ages.

Jan. 1, 1990, was a weekday. Jan. 1, 2000, falls on a weekend.
Bank vaults might open automatically.

PC clocks may go back to Jan. 1,  1980, ruining date-based
data. But not those with Mac OS and Windows95, which are Year
2000- compliant.

Entertainment: Borrowed by Bollywood: Indian movies have some very familiar
scenes 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Originality is one thing not expected of the strange and
mongrelized world of the Indian cinema. Given a choice between
creating their own ideas and "borrowing" someone else's,
producers can be counted on to take the easy option. In this
sense, Bollywood, as India's Bombay-based movie industry is
called, is an apt name. It suggests a cut-rate, bloated and
folly-ridden version of Hollywood.

Alert copyright lawyers could make a killing from an industry
that doesn't settle for stealing merely ideas. Some Indian
directors also lift scenes, dialogue, music, posters and
billboards. Try, for instance, to spot the artistic difference
in the posters, right, for Hollywood's Mr. Jones, starring
Richard Gere, and Bolly-wood's Akele Hum Akele Tum (I'm Alone,
You're Alone). Naturally, the Indian movie is also a faithful
copy of the original.

In one of the most celebrated cases of borrowing in recent
years, the famous scene in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables,
when a baby carriage bumps its way down a staircase - itself a
nod to Eisenstein's Battle-ship Potemkin - was reproduced in
its entirety in N. Chandra's Tejaab (Acid).

At the moment, there are three Hindi versions of Sleeping With
the Enemy playing to packed houses in Indian cinemas. Each
puts a new, uniquely subcontinental twist on an already warped
theme. In one, titled Yaarana (Friends), the eternal triangle
is resolved with a macho male-bonding finale. In another, Agni
Sakshi (As Fire Is My Witness), the harassed wife becomes a
vamp, while the stalker is portrayed as the wronged party. And
in Daraar (Fear), the busty and popular Juhi Chawla plays a
gyrating song-and-dance version of the Julia Roberts
character.

Director Mahesh Bhatt's most recent effort, Phir Teri Kahani
Yaad Aagaye (Your Memory Comes Back to Haunt Me), is a copy of
Basic Instinct. Bhatt's daughter, Pooja, plays Sharon Stone.
She also recently made tabloid headlines by appearing on a
magazine cover wearing body paint. Daring stuff, except that
Demi Moore did it better on the front of Vanity Fair - and
without the bulky bikini that Bhatt wore.

A new TV series, From Hollywood to Bollywood, is attracting
big audiences with its formula of juxtaposing scenes from
Western films with their Indian copies. The series has
provided a new understanding of where Bombay's filmmakers pick
up what they call their inspiration.

Books: Hot Buttons: A spy novel that gets behind the headlines 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Derek Parker

The political thriller has never really taken off as an Asian
genre. Perhaps authors think that the field is crowded, with
tomes by Tom Clancy and the more elegant products of John le
Carre. But The Tim-Tim Man (Penfolk, Ashwood, Victoria,
Australia, 567 pages, A$19.95, paperback) is a valiant attempt
at mixing up an Asian brew of political conspiracy against an
historical and factual background. The author, Kerry Collison,
is Australian-born, although he is now an Indonesian citizen.
He once served as a diplomat in Jakarta and has a sound
understanding of the country and its politics.

His protagonist, Stephen Coleman, is  a middle-level
Australian diplomat who also happens to be a spy. Caught up in
the coup that toppled Sukarno, he makes contact with a rising
star of the Indonesian army, Nathan Seda. They form a
lucrative business alliance based on secret arms sales for
Indonesia's armed forces. But Seda has a hidden agenda: East
Timorese by birth, his ultimate aim is independence for his
native island. He secretly steers weapons and money to the
Fretilin resistance fighters.

The book begins in the turbulent mid-1960s, and tracks Seda's
rise through the 1970s and 1980s. Sometime in the near future
he is within sight of the ultimate political prize. Yet the
"Tim-Tim man" (slang for Timor) never forgets his real
mission, independence for East Timor, carefully disguising his
ambition behind a lot of national unity bluster. To achieve
this goal, Seda plans to provoke war between Indonesia and
Australia by planting a bomb in Australia's Parliament.

Meanwhile, the head of the Australian secret service is also
conniving. He  sees some benefit from a nice little war, and
he manipulates Coleman, who has fallen out with his former
friend, into a plot to kill the general. The labyrinth of
deception and counter-deception ends, literally, with a bang,
although not one which any of the protagonists had planned.

The author hits all the hot buttons: corruption, East Timor,
the Suharto succession and sometimes touchy Australian-
Indonesia relations. So it is not surprising that Indonesian
customs officers burned an early consignment of the book,
although the action seemed to to be the result of a lower-
level misunderstanding rather than orders from the top.

Regrettably, Collison cannot resist the temptation to
editorialize about Indonesian politics and sometimes seems to
lose the thread of the narrative as he pursues various
sidetracks. The key to success in a thriller is to keep the
story moving, and he only just manages to avoid getting bogged
down. Perhaps his second novel, to be called Merdeka Square,
will show a defter touch.

IN BRIEF: A spice that heals  Relations between India and the U.S. are
spicing up - literally 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

A spice that heals  Relations between India and the U.S. are
spicing up - literally. The Indian government's Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research is to challenge the patent
for turmeric granted in 1994 to two Americans who argued that
the herb's active ingredients have medicinal qualities as an
antiseptic.

Known to South Asians as haldi and to botanists as Curcuma
longa, turmeric is the yellow powder most commonly found in
curries. In India it is also used as a wound salve, a facial
cleanser and a disinfectant after funeral rites. In addition,
a 1992 study in the Indian Journal of Physiology and
Pharmacology found that a one-week course of the spice lowered
cholesterol levels by 29%.

Turmeric is made up of curcuminoids - anti-bacterial compounds
that also counter inflammation. AIDS patients even report that
they feel better when taking it, but it should be stressed
there is absolutely no evidence it has any effect on the HIV
virus.

So a lot more than fragrant curries are at stake here. Dr.
Ranjit Roy Chaudhury, chairman of India's Advisory Council on
Traditional Medicine, says: "We are moving towards the 21st
century and cannot keep saying we have been using these
substances for centuries as an excuse for not obtaining
patents." Dr. Chaudhury says Asian scientists should protect
their interests by taking out patents on herbal and
traditional treatments.

But while the international debate rages, you can use homemade
turmeric preparations whenever you wish.

Health: Inflationary Pressures: Some timely tips on avoiding intestinal gas


from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Catherine Shepherd

It's an embarrassing topic. But it is a real enough problem
for all that. We all know what it is like to have stomach or
intestinal gas. Overindulging at a family banquet or having
one beer too many can be at best embarrassing, and, at worst,
very uncomfortable. So what causes gas? There are more
villains than you ever thought.

First, leave those candies and chewing gum on the shelf. When
you suck hard candy, the constant swallowing of air causes
bloating and burping. Also, sugar-free gum often contains
sorbitol - a sweetener that the bacteria in our colons gobble
up and break down to produce large amounts of gas. This makes
the muscle walls of the colon contract; you feel the
contractions as cramps. So cut back on the gum or read the
label carefully. Sorbitol and other similar sugar-free
sweeteners are often listed as "sugar alcohol" on ingredient
lists.

Avoid leftover carbohydrates. Corn and whole-grain rice form
gas-producing compounds when refrigerated. Thawing and
reheating refrigerated leftovers increases the bacterial
activity that causes gas. If you must eat leftovers, then try
them cold. If they don't go down well that way, heat only
enough for one sitting.

Fiber is an important cholesterol-lowering and colon-cancer-
preventing nutrient. But too much of it causes intestinal gas.
If you plan to add fiber to your diet, do so slowly. The
recommended intake is 25 g per day, and working up to this
amount gradually will be easier on your gut. In particular, be
wary of beans, cabbage, apples and broccoli.

Lastly, reduce your fats and oil consumption. Lowering fat
intake is sage advice for any healthful diet, but fats are
also the most difficult nutrient to digest. They can stay in
your stomach up to two hours and delay the emptying of your
intestinal tract, causing cramps and bloating. All fats,
whether from cooking oil, meats or desserts, cause the same
reaction, so refusing that third helping of fried noodles or
your second mooncake could go a long way to keeping your
stomach happy.

If you cannot avoid the culprit foods, there are a number of
ways to purge the gas from your gastro-intestinal tract.
Following a meal with a spice such as peppermint, cinnamon or
ginger will prevent vapor formation and aid digestion. Steep-
ing ginger-root or a cinnamon stick in hot water will give you
an aromatic, anti-gas tea.

Fight the tendency to lounge after a meal. Going for a brief
walk will increase the movement of gas from your digestive
system. Never lie down; it will only worsen the symptoms. And
if these drug-free remedies don't work, try an over-the-
counter gas medication, and follow the package directions
carefully.

Art: strokes of brilliance Please: Thai artists brush aside their rivals in
the third ASEAN art competition 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Julian Gearing  Bangkok

No room for the finer things of life in the business-before-
all-else world of Southeast Asia? Think again. A total of
3,624 entries were received for the ASEAN Art Awards 1996, the
third time the prestigious competition has been held.

Judging took place in the National Gallery in Bangkok, where,
to the delight of locals, Thais took the first three places.
Top prize of $10,000 went to Sakchai Uttitho, for his Life
Upcountry No. 6 - a paean to the charms of his home town of
Ubon Ratchathani, in northeastern Thailand. "I am happier
there, more peaceful," says the 28-year-old, who is studying
for a masters in fine art at Bangkok's Silpakorn University.

Life Upcountry drew praise from Sawasdi Tantisuk, 71, one of
Thai-land's leading painters and a judge for the Philip
Morris-sponsored ASEAN competition. "Sakchai has composed a
natural picture of the countryside, with a strong contrast
between light and dark," he said. "It has a lot of energy,
which contributes to its beauty."

Vorakorn Metmanorom, a 28-year-old commercial artist, took
second place - and $8,000 - with Yearning for Return of
Spirituality # 1. Of his work, he says: "It is a reflection of
the fact that you need hope. Take farmers, for example. Even
if the wind is strong, if there are floods, if the crops are
not good, they always have to have determination. There is no
security for them, no guarantee the crops will be good. The
focus is on hope and determination."

In third place, with prize money of $5,000, was Light of Asia,
by Metha Kongsonthi, 25. Like Sakchai's Life Upcountry, this
swirling, colorful work is an evocative tribute to the
spirituality of northeast Thailand. Behind the top-placed
Thais came a Filipino and an Indonesian. Alfredo D. Esquillo
Jr. took fourth spot, and $3,000, with his spiritual conundrum
Daang Ligid-Krus (Cross Roads), and Sugeng Restuadi was fifth
with Life II, 1996. His prize money was $1,500.

Thais have dominated the ASEAN Art Awards since their
inception in 1994. In that year, Santi Thongsook won first
prize with his much-discussed Breath in the Capital City - a
disturbing image of a birth in the crowded streets of Bangkok.
Another Thai, Navin Biadklang, was runner-up last year. Why
this apparent Thai mastery of the Southeast Asian arts scene?

Sansern Milindasuta, chairperson of the department of visual
arts at Bangkok University, says it is partly because of
changing social attitudes. "The number of people visiting
galleries and exhibitions has increased," he says. "Also, the
number of artists has grown. Students are showing more
interest in taking up fine arts. And parents are more
understanding."

Phaptawan Suwannakudt, who runs the Place of Art gallery, says
another factor is a boom in art competitions. "Thais love
competitions," she says. "Young people try their best in them.
They follow the rules and the style and take into account the
taste of the judges."  But that, says Bangkok University's
Sansern, is one of the problems. "There is simply too much
rivalry in competitions," he argues. "There is another way to
be an artist. They can present their work in an exhibition.
That is better than entering a competition." Sansern maintains
that in the past five years or so, it has become easier to
live as a professional artist in Thailand. "There are more
private collectors, institutions and foreign collectors," he
says.

As Thailand's budding art scene continues to grow, second-
placed Vorakorn says one major incentive is missing. "We still
don't have a contemporary art gallery in Bangkok," he
complains. "So there is no place for permanent exhibitions."
Until then, Thais will continue to enter competitions - and
most likely win them.

- Entries  from the ASEAN Art Awards will be on display in the
National Museum in Kuala Lumpur Oct. 6-31.

EYEWITNESS: BOOZING BOVINES: A bottle or two of beer are all part of the
pampered lifestyles of the cows of Matsusaka 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

The irony about Japan's recent food-poisoning outbreak is that
the archipelago's inhabitants are generally the most
fastidious farmers, careful cooks and demanding diners in the
known universe. Every day, some of the finest and freshest
foodstuffs end up on Japanese plates. Among these, few are
produced with as much attention to detail as "Kobe beef" from
the Matsusaka area, southeast of Osaka. Not just any cow can
be a Matsusaka cow. It must be female and virginal - or, at
least, calf-less. "Female beef is sweeter," explains farmer
Nagata Koichi, "and virginal cows are more tender if they
haven't gone through the struggles of labor." What's more, the
heifers are constantly fussed over - especially in terms of
feeding, which is astonishingly precise in its timing,
quantity and content (hay, soy, vitamins, minerals and beer).
The result: meat with the finest of fine threads of fat in
beasts worth up to $18,520 a head. In good Japanese
restaurants, that can translate to about $9 a bite.

Nations: India: The Emperor"s Troubles: The Shiv Sena boss is down, but not
out 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Ajay Singh and Arjuna

Balasaheb Thackeray, leader of the rightist Shiv Sena party,
is called Hindu Hriday Samrat by his followers, which means
"Emperor of the Hindu Heart." The 69-year-old politician has
long been proud of that title. "My power will never wane," he
once said.  But a series of recent crises suffered by
Thackeray seem to belie his boast.

The latest setback to the Hindu radical leader was the death
of one of his henchmen, Amar Naik. A powerful mafia boss in
Bombay, Maharashtra's capital and India's richest city, Naik
was wanted in connection with 28 crimes, including several
murders. In early August, police gunned down the 47-year-old
gangster as he was driving a stolen car.

The Shiv Sena, which rules Maharashtra state with the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was angered by
Naik's death. An editorial in the official Sena daily, Saamna
(Confrontation), called on the police to stop targeting Hindu
mafia dons and go after Muslim gang lords instead. It
suggested that Hindu gangs should be allowed to take over
Bombay's underworld because the city belongs to the Hindu
majority.

Naik was apparently targeted at the behest of state deputy
chief minister Gopinath Munde, who belongs to the BJP and is
in charge of the local police. According to a BJP member, the
party's high command did not take kindly to Naik's enormous
power and the patronage he received from Thackeray. The BJP is
the main opposition party in India and its regional ally's
association with a gang leader was clearly a political
handicap.

Munde is also said to be behind another problem for Thackeray.
In late July, police discovered the body of Ramesh Kini, a 45-
year-old Shiv Sena member, in a cinema in Pune, near Bombay.
Investigations revealed that the tenants in the Bombay
building in which Kini lived had been pressured for years by
their landlord, Laxmichand Shah, to vacate their flats. Shah,
who is a close friend of the Thackeray family, wanted to
demolish the building to make way for a larger apartment
block. Except for Kini, all the other tenants had either
willingly left or were forced out.

Kini's widow, Sheila, has accused Raj Thackeray, the Sena
leader's 33-year-old nephew, of complicity in her husband's
death. She alleges that Raj and Thackeray's son, Jaidev, had
threatened Kini to leave his flat a few days before he died.
Raj was questioned by police but has denied any involvement.
The Maharashtra government, apparently under pressure from
Thackeray, changed the state attorney midway through the
investigations. Sheila has demanded a federal probe into her
husband's death.

The Kini case shot to public prominence after state opposition
leader Chhagan Bhujbal raised the issue in the Maharashtra
assembly. Bhujbal, 49, was a Sena member and a confidant of
Thackeray until his defection to the Congress party four years
ago. The two politicians have been sworn enemies since then.
Says Bhujbal: "There are hundreds of cases against the
Thackeray family that have been hushed up."

Neither Thackeray nor any of his family members hold formal
posts in the government, which allows them to wield power
without being publicly accountable. Anurag Chaturvedi, a
Bombay political columnist, says the string of scandals
surrounding the Thackerays point to a steady decline in the
power and public reputation of the Shiv Sena boss. "Two years
ago, it would have been unthinkable for the police to question
a member of the Thackeray family or touch Amar Naik," he says.
"The myth of Thackeray is being eroded."

Dissent from within the Shiv Sena is also brewing. Several
senior party leaders privately criticize Thackeray for his
high-handedness. Maharashtra Chief Minister Manohar Joshi, who
is a Sena member and owes his position to Thackeray, rarely
goes out of his way now to defend his political mentor. At a
recent press conference, Sena member Madhav Deshpande
criticized Thackeray for not holding party elections. "People
are appointed at his whim," he said. "I do not want to see the
Sena committing sati [self-immolation] for the Thackerays."

But for all his problems, Thackeray is still one of Bombay's
most powerful leaders. On Aug. 20, Prime Minister H.D. Deve
Gowda met with Thackeray in Bombay, reportedly to solicit the
Shiv Sena's support in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh state
assembly elections. The PM wants the Shiv Sena to split from
the BJP, thereby helping his  United Front Alliance win the
state. For now, Thackeray may be down, but he is definitely
not out.

Nations: Indonesia: A Split Within the Ranks: Jakarta is abuzz with talk of
a military shakeup 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Susan Berfield and Keith Loveard Jakarta

Indonesia's military has been flexing its muscles at home and
abroad. Troops patrolled Jakarta's business district with
automatic weapons in the wake of the July 27 rioting, and
security forces have since rounded up leading members of
opposition groups. Last week, the armed forces launched its
largest and most complex war games ever: some 19,000 airborne
troops, 50 warships and 41 aircraft are taking part in a 17-
day drill in the South China Sea. The site of the exercise is
the waters around the gas-rich Natuna Islands, part of which
Beijing covets.

These shows of force, however, have diverted attention from
what appears to be a growing and unusually public rift within
the military, whose political influence is unmatched by any
other national institution. For the past 30 years, the armed
forces have underpinned President Suharto's government. And
Suharto in turn has molded the armed forces to meet his own
ends. Now, the president is faced with reshaping a divided
military at a crucial time.

The army supports the president as always. But that support is
split into emerging factions. "In the old days, the armed
forces commander would go to the president and say, `This is
our position,' " says a senior officer. "Today there is no
such thing as a military position, there are only the opinions
of certain officers."

The talk in Jakarta is that Suharto, as supreme commander, is
planning a major shakeup. The rumors have prompted authorities
to issue formal denials. Nevertheless, says political
scientist Ariwibowo: "Everybody knows that something is
happening within the army."

Suharto's first move came on Aug. 15, when he sacked the Armed
Forces chief of staff Lt.-Gen. Suyono, who has been at odds
with Armed Forces commander Gen. Feisal Tanjung for some time.
Feisal, who ranks second only to the president, may himself be
in trouble. Also in danger is the military socio-political
chief, Lt.-Gen. Syarwan Hamid, who ranks just below Suyono.
All three have been criticized for the heavy-handed way the
army quelled the Jakarta riots.

In the background is the presidential succession. Suharto, who
will almost certainly seek another term in 1998, wants a
military that he can implicitly count on. When he does
eventually step down, he is expected to cede power to someone
selected from within its ranks. That person must be able to
protect the president's family and their business interests.
In the meantime, "the military is being transformed into a
palace guard for a president facing an uncertain future," says
Australian analyst Gerry van Klinken of the Indonesia
Resources and Information Program in Melbourne.

Rival generals are scrambling to secure the high ground. The
tensions center on two pivotal figures: Gen. Feisal and army
commander Gen. Hartono. Each has civilian allies. Feisal is
backed by Research and Technology Minister B.J. Habibie, who
is also chairman of the prominent Muslim group known as ICMI.
Hartono is backed by Suharto's daughter Siti Hardyanti Rukmana
(Tutut), who is a leading official of the ruling Golkar group.
One well-connected ex-intelligence officer told Asiaweek: "The
situation is explosive."

For the moment, neither Feisal's nor Hartono's prospects look
promising. If Feisal is ousted, former Jakarta commander Lt.-
Gen. Wiranto is expected to take over, even though Hartono
outranks him. If Feisal stays, Hartono also loses. Come
November, when his appointment ends, Hartono could find
himself pushed onto the sidelines.

This would be a surprising turnabout for Hartono, given that
some have said Suharto was grooming him to be the next vice-
president, or even president if Suharto decides to step down
during his next term. Influential Muslim leader Abdurrahman
Wahid says Tutut virtually endorsed Hartono as the next
president during a recent talk to ulamas, or religious
leaders, in East Java. Says Wahid: "She told them `If you want
Hartono to be president, by God's will you will have him as
president.' "

Tutut's enthusiasm would seem to bode well for Hartono. But
according to a well-connected civil servant, "The backing of
the president's daughter doesn't necessarily mean that much.
Suharto is believed to be far more wary of Hartono than of
Feisal, who is just doing his job."

The way the armed forces commander has handled that job,
however, has caused friction. The military's violent takeover
of the Democratic Party of Indonesia's headquarters from
supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri on July 27, and its tough
response to the rioting that followed, has alarmed many. "The
armed forces bared their teeth in a way not seen for some
time," says van Klinken. The cost, he says, is an erosion of
the military's legitimacy. Even Suharto is thought to be
displeased.

What the president will do to show his displeasure, however,
is still anybody's guess. Until last week, most believed that
Gen. Feisal and Lt.-Gen. Syarwan would be the next casualties.
The once-whispered rumors of their downfall were spoken so
loudly in Jakarta that top officials have for the first time
issued formal denials. On Aug. 16, State Secretary Murdiono
said that no changes at the top were planned.

To many, that denial only confirmed that there was something
to the speculation. Syarwan later told Asiaweek that high
command had "heard nothing about [a shakeup]." And then added:
"This sort of thing doesn't happen overnight. There is a
process involved."

But when Sudomo, the head of the Supreme Advisory Council and
a Suharto confidante, also called the rumors fiction, some
figured Feisal would survive after all. He might even be
reincarnated as defense minister. Edi Sudrajat, who currently
holds that position, would then take over Sudomo's job. And
Sudomo would go into graceful retirement.

For his part, Lt.-Gen. Syarwan is fighting back. He told a
gathering of officers in Surabaya Aug. 13 that rumors of a
split within the military were "divide-and-conquer" tactics
used by enemies of the government. "Such political deception
is being carried out by irresponsible parties," he said.

So serious are the divisions at the top, however, that some in
the old guard have broken rank and publicly criticized the
current military leadership. Among them are senior retired
military leader Abdul Haris Nasution, one of the founders of
the modern armed forces, and former Home Minister Rudini. When
Rudini oh-so-gently reminded the military that it owed its
allegiance to the people, not the president, Coordinating
Minister for Politics and Security Susilo Sudarman had to
remind the retired officer of the need for unity, at least in
public.

Still, despite the heightened tensions within the ranks, and
the growing calls for a more open political system, the
military remains the dominant power in Indonesia. "It is
highly likely that the armed forces will influence the
political process in Indonesia for several decades," says Ian
MacFarling, lecturer at the Australian Defense Force Academy.

Civilians within Golkar admit that the generals will probably
thwart their plan to push Information Minister Harmoko as
vice-president. "We have to accept that the military is still
too strong," says a member of the Golkar central board. And
all other political institutions are still too weak.

The only one with any control over the generals remains
Suharto. He alone chooses who goes and who stays. The question
now is, how will Suharto shape the military, and to what ends?

Nations: Taiwan: Remaking the Opposition: The DPP"s new leader takes a
moderate tack 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Todd Crowell and Laurence Eyton Taipei

The Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's largest opposition
force, has fallen on hard times. After fighting two bruising
elections within four months, it has little to show for its
efforts. The DPP's momentum stalled in the legislature polls
last December, and its standard bearer in the island's first
popular presidential contest in March finished a very distant
second to the incumbent, Lee Teng-hui of the Kuomintang. And
if morale is low, the party's financial coffers are even
lower: last month, it could not even meet its payrolls.

DPP partisans hope these problems can be solved, given a
little time and fresh leadership. But it won't be easy to re-
animate the issues that had motivated supporters, not a few of
whom went to prison for their beliefs. Their backing made the
party Taiwan's fastest-growing political group during the
heady days of the early 1990s, when democracy was flowering
after the end of four decades of martial law. Inevitably,
perhaps, tensions and divisions have emerged within the ranks,
prompting some former stalwarts to set up their own party.

The DPP, which holds 51 of the Legislative Yuan's 164 seats,
was founded during martial-law days in the 1980s. In the early
1990s, it called boldly for Taiwan's political independence.
Party leaders also demanded more civil rights for the island's
non-mainlander majority and greater democracy for all. Now, of
course, Taiwan is just about fully democratic. An indigenous
politician occupies the presidency. So the party's ritual call
for independence is looking increasingly like something that
will bring Taiwan little benefit - and much trouble from
China.

The task of turning the DPP's fortunes around falls to Hsu
Hsin-liang, who was elected chairman in June. He replaced Shih
Ming-teh, a key member of the party's hardline pro-
independence faction. Though Hsu has a longstanding reputation
as a dissident - he started his political life with the KMT
but quit the ruling party in 1977 - and has endured exile as
well as a year in prison for his political activities, he
hails from the DPP's moderate wing. He wants to reposition the
party as a more liberal, social democratic, "caring"
alternative to the government.

But first, Hsu has to resolve the DPP's financial crisis. He
says he wants to reschedule debt, negotiate more loans and
raise more money from members. But the DPP may in fact be
banking on government funding of political groups. Hsu is
asking that all parties receive an annual subsidy of NT$100
($3.60) for every vote they won in the last election. "Right
now the situation is unfair," he says. "The KMT has all its
corporate wealth. The other parties have nothing."

Given the Kuomintang's majority - albeit a narrow one - in the
Legislative Yuan, the chances of the opposition pushing
through a political funding bill would seem slim. Yet Hsu has
some leverage. The ruling party is seeking bipartisan support
to break the gridlock that has characterized the current
legislative session. KMT secretary-general Wu Poh-hsiung
called on Hsu recently to seek the opposition chief's
cooperation in passing laws. Hsu's precondition: that his
party obtain some relief from its financial problems.

Hsu denies that he is selling DPP support in return for
passage of the political-financing measure. Rather, he says
that more cooperation, rather than confrontation, would be a
good thing at this stage. "What I want to see is something
like the National Government in Britain during World War II,
where all parties worked together in the face of a big
crisis," Hsu explains. "We have many historical problems, such
as threats from China. The KMT itself is immobilized by its
own money politics and links with gangsters. Given this, only
a coalition can carry out reforms Taiwan needs."

But Hsu's call for enhanced cooperation across the benches has
alienated some of the DPP's purists. One is its former
presidential candidate, Peng Ming-min, who has already left to
form his own Nation-Building Party, which is more aggressively
pro-independence. He and other dissenters claim that there is
little difference now between the KMT's position of
"reunification - sometime" and the Hsu-led DPP's call for
"independence - but not yet." Still, by couching the issue in
vague terms, both are probably in tune with the great majority
of Taiwan's people.

Hsu thinks that his opponents within the party may be fighting
yesterday's battles. "We can't consider the KMT a `colonial'
regime anymore after the presidential election in which Lee
Teng-hui got more than 50% of the vote. The whole political
environment has changed fundamentally, and our party has to
adjust." He hints at the prospect of putting on the back
burner the DPP's core issue - independence. If the party were
to gain power, Hsu suggests, it might not proceed with its
long-promised plebiscite on the matter, at least not
immediately.

Still, the DPP faces the difficult challenge of coming back
from the political wilderness to regain a cutting-edge
relevance among voters. In an evolving, increasingly
sophisticated Taiwan, continuing to wave the banner of
independence may not be the way to do that. Hsu is counting on
doing better with his new emphasis on a "caring society."

Nations: Thailand: A Gateway to Vietnam: Thais debate where next to bridge
the Mekong 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Nakhon Phanom is at the end of the road. A sleepy Thai border
town on the banks of the muddy Mekong river, it is a place
where opportunity is mostly elsewhere. When young people
graduate from school, they generally head to dingy employment
offices to sign up for work in Bangkok or West Asia.
Otherwise, things move slowly. On a recent afternoon, a queue
for the ferry to Laos consisted of five vehicles. One driver
had just missed the boat. No matter. He would sleep patiently
in his cab until morning.

But Nakhon Phanom won't remain the stereotypical backwater for
long, at least not if Santi Kowabootr gets his way. Four years
ago, the town's self-appointed savior cottoned on to an
inescapable fact: the city is a potential gateway to Vietnam
and, most crucially, the South China Sea port at Vinh, 338 km
away. Even back then, there was talk of upgrading the mostly
dirt road across Laos. Santi, a liquor store owner and bus
fleet operator, saw a bridge across the Mekong as the missing
link and resolved to get one built.

"Right now we can trade with Laos only," Santi says, as he
drives his car along dusty red roads to the site of the
proposed span. "There are not many people in Laos, with a
population of 4.8 million. But with a connection to north
Vietnam, we have a market of 32 million." Links are already
growing. Trade between Thailand and Vietnam in 1995 reached
about $500 million, or 0.5% of Thailand's world trade, up from
$142 million in 1991.

Fellow residents are skeptical, but Santi has one very
important reason to be optimistic: Chavalit Yongchaiyudh. The
deputy prime minister wants a bridge there too, and as a
possible contender for the top job in the next Thai
government, he may help Santi get his way. Two years ago,
Chavalit gave up his constituency outside Bangkok for Nakhon
Phanom. The populous northeast is a valuable vote bank for a
would-be premier. Since the switch, Chavalit has been currying
favor with the locals, building roads, hospitals and now - he
hopes - a bridge.

Not so fast. A hundred kilometers downstream, the town elders
of Mukdahan are lobbying hard for their own span, and they
have strong political backing too. The interest is
understandable since the stakes - and opportunities - are
huge. The Mekong is the world's 12th-longest and arguably
least developed major waterway. The river's resource-rich
basin is also home to 229 million people, a market that one
day could rival Europe.

Who will pay for the infrastructure needs in the largely
underdeveloped region? That has yet to be worked out, but
there have been some encouraging signs. Under the aegis of the
Asian Development Bank (ADB), plans for some $22 billion worth
of roads, rails, dams and airports have been hatched for the
river basin. And last week, delegates from the six Mekong
nations of China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and
Vietnam met in the southwestern Chinese city of Kunming for
the latest in a string of meetings held since 1992. The
neighbors are trying hard to cooperate. Their challenge is to
find a mutually beneficial strategy to develop a complex and
fragile region that until recently was best-known for jungle
firefights and khaki commerce.

Nakhon Phanom and Mukdahan are competing to be the first
commercial hub of what the ADB calls the East-West Corridor
from Thailand through Laos to Vietnam. Four new routes are
planned along existing (and largely unpaved) roads: Routes 8,
9, 12 and 18 (see map, opposite). Once open, they will provide
major opportunities for trade between Thailand and Vietnam, as
well as give landlocked Laos access to the sea. If the more
starry-eyed planners have their way, new asphalt could one day
run clear through Myanmar, shaving hours or days off the
journey from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean.

It is easy to see why Santi is in love with the idea of a
bridge. "Developing a trade route to Vietnam is not only
important for Nakhon Phanom," he says. "It is also important
for the whole of northeast Thailand." The problem is that
Bangkok-centric politicians and business types have long
ignored Isan, as the impoverished region is known.

With prosperity around the corner, Isan residents rarely talk
about what is good for Laos - and Vientiane's aging socialists
have noticed. Only now emerging from decades of economic
isolation, Laos has been wary of opening up to foreign
influences too quickly. Sandwiched between two powerful
neighbors bent on expanding bilateral trade, the Laotians hold
some good cards, and they are no longer shying away from the
gaming table. Last month, Vientiane announced that before the
end of the year tourists and business people will be able to
obtain visas on arrival. Local residents on both sides of the
Mekong can now move relatively freely across the border. And
in an important breakthrough, Laos indicated at a recent ADB
transport forum that it was considering fully opening its
borders.

Even so, cross-river commerce promises to be complicated, at
least in the short run. Under one scenario, Thai trucks would
have to unload in Laos once they have crossed the Mekong from
Nakhon Phanom. Laotian or Vietnamese carriers would take over
from there. Impractical yes, but in theory all parties
benefit. Such an arrangement would help Laotians believe their
country was not merely a Thai highway.

Eventually, Thai and Laotian goods could be shipped from
Vietnamese ports. This would be an incalculable boon to
traders based in Nakhon Phanom. One wood exporter now sends
Laotian logs to Bangkok, then on to Singapore, where finally
they sail to the U.S. With a new road, says the firm's
expatriate manager, "We would only be faced with a short trip
to a deep-sea port in Vietnam and then we could ship direct to
the States."

The north Vietnam market - and the Laotians' demand for a
short Vientiane-to-Vietnam route - make Nakhon Phanom a strong
contender. With construction on Route 8 expected to finish
within a year, Vietnam-bound Thai goods may soon roll through
Laos. But a bridge at Nakhon Phanom is probably not on the
immediate horizon. Pramaul Khuntri, proprietor of the
optimistically named Windsor Hotel, is candidly pessimistic:
"It could take as much as five years," she says. Or longer.
After the Friendship Bridge linking the northern Thai town of
Nong Khai with Vientiane was completed in 1994, planners
turned to other potential sites, and Mukdahan, not Nakhon
Phanom, was touted as the best place to start.

Politics played a part in making the town the frontrunner. One
local MP is a Democrat and the bridge was greenlighted when
party leader Chuan Leekpai was prime minister. As well, the
Laotian finance minister hails from Savannakhet, on the Lao
side of the river. And ADB officials insist that there are
practical reasons for Mukdahan getting a bridge before its
upstream rival. "They're constantly having to dredge the river
to allow ferries to cross [at Mukdahan]," says Preben Nielsen,
an ADB economist. During the dry season, passage is even more
arduous.

Moreover, Mukdahan is fast emerging as a trading hub. Perhaps
200 trucks cross by ferry each day, and last year the town
exported some $71 million worth of goods to Laos and Vietnam.
By contrast, Nakhon Phanom exports amounted to some $24
million, and most went to Laos. On the agenda at last week's
Kunming meeting was an upgrade of Route 9, which runs through
Laos from Savannakhet (opposite Mukdahan) to link with the
Vietnamese port at Danang. Barring delays, an all-weather
Route 9 will open in 2003; the bridge in 2001.

The boosters of a span for Nakhon Phanom are hardly giving up.
One of their oft-cited arguments is that their town is 154 km
closer by road to Vietnamese ports than is Mukdahan. In
addition to Route 8, there are also plans to upgrade Route 12,
which would provide a direct link to a new Vietnamese port at
Vung Ang, south of Vinh. But the upgrade will take time. Route
12 is still a dirt track, and a hilly one at that.

A bridge at Nakhon Phanom seems inevitable - especially since
the Laotians are eager for Route 8, which would provide
Vientiane's new capitalists quick access to ports at Vinh and
Vung Ang. And Thai officials and ADB planners insist that the
question is not if, but when.

Standing at the site of the planned bridge outside Nakhon
Phanom, Santi gazes across at the verdant, unspoiled hills of
Laos. Even he finds it is hard to imagine a four-lane highway
and bridge cutting through this idyllic spot where water
buffalo currently outnumber cargo trucks. He chuckles: "If
Chavalit becomes prime minister he can build a bridge at
Nakhon Phanom tomorrow or next year. If not, maybe we won't
have a bridge for 10 years." Not surprisingly, the town has a
backup plan: more ferries. Which would mean more trucks. Even
without a bridge, Nakhon Phanom could well vault past its
rival.

Nations: Philippines: "Just and Lasting Peace": What the president wants
for Mindanao 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Fidel Ramos first met MNLF leader Nur Misuari when then-
president Corazon Aquino forged a ceasefire with the Muslim
separatists in Sulu in September 1986. At the time, Ramos was
Aquino's armed forces chief, in charge of crushing the
insurgency. Last week, Misuari signed an accord to bring an
end to the 24-year-long war. President Ramos recently talked
with Senior Correspondent Antonio Lopez about his hopes for
peace in the region. Excerpts:

What is the Southern Philippine Council for Peace and
Development?

The SPCPD is not a regional government. It is not a governing
authority. It has no lawmaking power. It has no power over
local government units. Neither will it have control over the
local police and military. The SPCPD is neither an autonomous
region nor a political subdivision of government. It is simply
a transitory administrative arm under the control and
supervision of the president. Its powers and functions are an
extension of the powers of the president.

What is your vision for Mindanao?

Our vision for Mindanao is three-fold: First, to remove from
the southern Philippines the roots of dissidence, injustice,
and inequity which gave rise to separatist movements,
rebellions and the 25-year-old condition of instability.
Second, we foresee Mindanao as a very progressive social,
economic and political component of the Philippines. Mindanao
has certain advantages in terms of its proximity to the more
progressive countries of ASEAN, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore and Brunei. The third aspect consists of bringing up
all of the people of Mindanao - Christians, Muslims, and
Lumads or indigenous people - to a level of development
already achieved by many, many Filipinos in the Visayas and in
Luzon, so that together, all Filipinos can be truly
competitive in the 21st century.

Why did you negotiate a deal with Misuari?

On day one of my administration, I called on radical
insurgents to give up their armed struggle. Our goal is a
just, comprehensive, peaceful and lasting resolution of the
internal armed conflict that has cost the nation and our
people so dearly.

What do you think of Misuari?

He is not an ordinary revolutionary. He is a man with a
statesmanlike vision to perform his mission for his people. He
has gone through the various stages of armed struggle, but now
I see him turning to a peaceful, legal, constitutional
struggle through elections. I also see him as a very deep-
thinking intellectual who is also pragmatic, in that he can
negotiate and be flexible in order to forge a solution to a
very difficult and complex problem. Lastly, I see him as a
very admirable leader. He has not veered from his cause to
bring Muslims in the Philippines a better life.

What happens to the three other separatist groups, the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, the Islamic Command Council and the
Abu Sayyaf?

We will continue to work with the MILF with regard to a
ceasefire. Talk of a ceasefire has been going on for quite
some time. I am optimistic about these talks. The ICC and the
Abu Sayyaf are different. They first have to forgo violence
and terrorism.

Nations: Philippines: The Anatomy of a Deal: How Ramos"s government and
Muslim rebels made peace in Mindanao 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Tim Healy and Antonio Lopez Manila

Back in 1968, Nur Misuari was not much for niceties. The 27-
year-old student firebrand staged a nine-day protest in front
of Malaca-ang Palace demanding the ouster of then-president
Ferdinand Marcos. Not long after, he barged uninvited into
Marcos's office to seek - successfully, as it turned out - the
release from prison of an ailing Muslim rebel leader.

Last week, Misuari was back in Malaca-ang, but under
substantially different circumstances. The rebel chief of the
Moro National Liberation Front was the star at the dramatic
signing Sept. 2 of a peace accord with President Fidel Ramos's
government, ending a 24-year rebellion on the southern island
of Mindanao.

Some 120,000 people - half from the ranks of the MNLF - have
died in the secessionist struggle. The government has spent at
least $3 billion prosecuting the war. Misuari told Asiaweek:
"The first time I came to Malaca-ang was for the cause of one
man's freedom; the second time is for the cause of peace."
Replied Ramos: "Today we are all victors - triumphant over war
and violence."

Ramos and Misuari, one a West Point military man who rose to
become president, the other a former university professor and
onetime Maoist, could hardly say enough good things about each
other. Ramos's eyes moistened as Misuari asked the 1,500
guests at the signing to rise in the president's honor.
"Without your boldness and heroism, we would not have reached
this far," said the rebel to the president.

Both men have a sizable stake in the accord. Neither of
Ramos's two predecessors, Marcos or Corazon Aquino, were able
to achieve a permanent peace, despite years of effort. Ramos
had to overcome opposition from the Christian majorities in
southern Mindanao, who do not trust the MNLF or Misuari. Ramos
hopes to win them over with his economic development plans for
the region (see interview, p. 22).

For Misuari, who founded the MNLF in 1968, signing meant
settling for something short of his original goal of self-
government. During the negotiations, which began in Jakarta in
October 1993, Misuari frequently came under attack from
compatriots who said he was selling out. "I was tiptoeing on
barbed wire," he recalls.

The treaty creates a Special Zone of Peace and Development
encompassing 14 provinces and nine cities. Overseeing
development in the area will be the Southern Philippine
Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD), to be headed by
Misuari or a hand-picked ally. The five-member council, which
comes under the Office of the President, will not have
lawmaking powers, but will be able to channel much-needed
development funds to the region. After three years, the member
provinces and cities will be asked to vote on a fully
autonomous government.

As part of the deal, Ramos's Lakas-NUCD party is backing
Misuari in the Sept. 9 election for governor of the Autonomous
Region for Muslim Mindanao. The ARMM comprises the four small,
mostly Muslim provinces that chose autonomy in a 1989
plebiscite.

During the three years of formal talks, Manila and the MNLF
clashed over what kind of administrative system should be
installed in southern Mindanao. Misuari originally demanded a
10-year provisional government; Manila's chief negotiator,
retired four-star Gen. Manuel Yan, offered one year. Misuari
compromised on five years and Manila came up to two. The talks
stalled at that point. Then, Libya and Indonesia intervened to
get negotiations back on track. Indonesia was especially
helpful, says Ramos. At the signing ceremony, the president
lauded the Indonesian delegation as "the best negotiators in
the world." Misuari and Yan eventually settled on a three-year
transitional council.

But what form would the council take? In 1994 and 1995, the
two sides agreed on 123 items, including how MNLF forces would
be integrated into the Philippine military. But they could not
settle on a structure for the transitional body. Misuari
objected to a plebiscite, which the Muslims could lose in the
Christian areas, but Manila insisted that the Constitution
required a vote. Talks recessed at the end of 1995.

Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas credits Ramos for the
breakthrough: "It was President Ramos's idea for the Council
for Peace and Development that broke the deadlock." The
proposal, which actually originated with Ramos's chief of
staff, Ruben Torres, was to create a non-elected government
body or regional development council, already authorized by
the Constitution.

Senior Indonesian diplomat Wiryono Sastrohandojo sold the idea
to the MNLF. Barging into a private meeting, he told the
rebels: "The SPCPD will have powers derived from the Office of
the President. It is derivative power, but power just the
same. What is important is you will have money for
development." Eventually, the MNLF agreed.

Now it is up to Misuari to make it work. Not all Muslim groups
have signed on. The foremost holdouts are the 15,000-strong
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the 500-man Abu
Sayyaf terrorist group. Misuari believes he can win over the
first: "I maintain contacts with my brothers in the MILF." And
the other? "The only problem is the Abu Sayyaf. I will try to
reach out to them to convince them to join us in this
experiment." After 24 years of bloodshed, Filipinos can only
hope that he will succeed.

Editorials: JUST DO IT: Japan should cut the excuses and legalize the pill


from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

When oral contraceptives were developed in the 1960s, Japan's
government banned them, saying they had unhealthy side effects
and promoted sexual promiscuity. With the advent of the low-
dosage pill, another pretext was needed - and conveniently
found in the spread of AIDS. Legalizing the pill, of course,
might discourage the use of protective condoms. When that
argument began to wear thin, Japanese health officials
discovered another excuse in a claim by a British medical
journal that oral contraceptives might be slightly conducive
to blood clotting.

One way or another, Japan's guardians of public health and
morals have found reasons to limit the birth-control choices
of its women. As a result, Japan shares the dubious
distinction, with North Korea, of being the only countries to
proscribe the sale of oral contraceptives. Only in recent
months have there been signs that Tokyo might consider
changing course and legalizing the pill. What Japanese
authorities should do, as soon as possible, is to wind up the
endless debate - and just do it.

A key catalyst has been the appointment of a new health and
welfare minister. Unlike his predecessors, Mr. Kan Naoto seems
inclined to listen more to consumers than to special-interest
groups. That suggests change may finally be at hand. Indeed,
an ethos is emerging in Japan that citizens, rather than
bureaucrats, should be their own guardians. However,
formidable opposition remains. Some health officials seem to
have gone out of their way to undercut their minister's
reformist positions. More pertinently, powerful commercial
interests object to legalization.

Chief among them are the country's condom-makers, who
obviously want to forestall competition from the pill. With
Japan the world's top consumer of prophylactics, they ply a
lucrative trade. Aligned with them are the nation's
physicians, who think that the unrestricted sale of the pill
would cut into their highly profitable abortion practices. The
doctors, overwhelmingly male, are organized by the Japan
Medical Association. Longtime supporters of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, they exert considerable influence on the
policymaking process.

Their maneuvers have not been balanced by any strong movement
to legalize the pill by women's organizations or family
planners. In Japan, unwanted pregnancies is hardly a burning
issue. In fact, the nation worries more about its falling
birthrate, which some people think is the real, if unstated,
reason that the government has been reluctant to legalize the
pill. By some estimates, only 10% of women would choose the
pill over other methods if it were made legitimate - though
even that would be a big boost from the 1% now using it under
a legal loophole.

If there is no clamor to legalize the pill, why do it? There
are several good reasons. The unavailability of oral
contraceptives is one factor behind Japan's unusually high
abortion rate. About 350,000 women choose to abort every year,
most of them because of unwanted pregnancies rather than
economic pressures or fear of giving birth to a malformed
child. There are virtually no legal barriers to abortion and,
on the surface at least, few religious or moral strictures
either.

But abortions are cause for deep personal disquiet in Japan,
as they are anywhere else. The evidence lies in the thousands
of tiny statues to "water babies" - memorials to aborted
fetuses - that dot the nation's cemeteries. And though
abortions are performed by licensed practitioners, the surgery
is not entirely without risk. By encouraging more abortions
than would otherwise be performed, the restrictions on the
pill add unnecessarily to the health hazards facing Japanese
women.

Moreover, about 200,000 women use oral contraceptives under a
loophole that allows doctors to prescribe them as a means of
regulating menstrual disorders. Yet the only one permitted is
the old-style high-dosage, high-hormone variety. That means
the women who really are using the pill only to avoid
conception are also subjected to risks unnecessarily. Japan is
a major contributor to family planning organizations around
the world. By banning in its domestic market one of the most
commonly used methods of contraception, Tokyo lays itself open
to charges that it callously dumps pharmaceuticals in
developing countries that it considers "dangerous" at home.

Even so, the most powerful argument is that legalizing the
pill gives women additional control over their own
reproductive lives. In the three decades since the advent of
oral contraceptives, the world has had ample time to
understand that their benefits far outweigh their
disadvantages. The decision on whether to use them should rest
with individual citizens. Japanese authorities have run out of
excuses.

Editorials: JUDGING THE PAST: Nascent democracies must beware the perils of
score-settling 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Mr. Paul Bell, a South African journalist, likes to recall how
he once bumped into Rev. Desmond Tutu in a shopping mall.
Almost without thinking, he thrust his young daughter into the
bishop's arms. "Please bless my child," asked Mr. Bell. Rev.
Tutu readily complied. "I couldn't tell you why I did that,"
says Mr. Bell. "I just wanted my child to have that
beneficence bestowed on her." Actually, his instinctive
response is entirely understandable. Rev. Tutu's ethical
stature makes nearly irresistible the opportunity to receive
his blessing. The Nobel Peace Prizewinner has been chairing
South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which
serves as both confessor to sinners in the nation's past
apartheid brutality as well as therapist to its victims.

Note well the touchstones of Rev. Tutu's organization: truth
and reconciliation. Then consider the recent court verdict in
South Korea, in which two former presidents, tried at the
behest of their onetime political ally, President Kim Young
Sam, were convicted of treason and manslaughter. Mr. Chun Doo
Hwan was sentenced to death, and Mr. Roh Tae Woo to more than
two decades in jail. And think about developments in
Bangladesh, where the government of Sheikh Hasina Wajed has
implicated the slain husband of the prime minister's chief
political rival after a vigorous inquiry into the 1975
assassination of her father, founding PM Mujibur Rahman. It
seems unlikely Mr. Kim or Sheikh Hasina will be asked to bless
babies anytime soon.

With the onset of democratic reform, governments around the
world are faced with the question of how to deal with unsavory
pasts. Take Eastern Europe. Shortly after Romania threw out
communism in 1989, the nation's new leaders tried, convicted
and executed Nicolae Ceausescu for crimes committed during his
24-year reign of terror. Ex-dissident Vaclav Havel chose a
gentler approach when he became president of the Czech
Republic. He advocated that those convicted of past human-
rights abuses be barred from civil service jobs.

The line between justice and vengeance can be fine indeed.
After Mrs. Corazon Aquino became president of the Philippines,
many expected Mrs. Imelda Marcos to be nailed by a probe into
the 1983 assassination of Mr. Benigno ("Ninoy") Aquino. Mrs.
Aquino had long contended that President Ferdinand Marcos and
his wife were behind her husband's dramatic murder at Manila
airport. But the rule of law prevailed. Mrs. Marcos was
cleared for lack of incriminating evidence. By accepting the
court ruling, Mrs. Aquino refuted allegations that she was
bent on a personal vendetta.

It would, of course, have been understandable if Mrs. Aquino
wanted to avenge her husband's murder. Similarly, Sheikh
Hasina's zeal to gain justice for her father - even in the
face of a constitutional provision granting pardon to the
perpetrators - might be excused in different circumstances.
But Mrs. Aquino was bound by a higher standard to allow the
Philippine judicial system to determine Mrs. Marcos's guilt or
innocence. In the same way, the Bangladesh Constitution is not
a document to be changed at the whim of an incumbent prime
minister, however personally wronged.

In the quest to determine how to deal with transgressions from
the past, a society must take the law as its starting point.
And if statutes are found inadequate or outdated, they should
be changed through legally constituted channels - but not
applied retroactively. Above all, legal justice must be
dispensed evenly, not shaped to scoop up specific victims. It
is not a tool to be used by those in power.

This will surely have occurred to President Kim. He is
constitutionally barred from seeking a second term when his
current one expires in 1998. That means he will soon be in a
similar position to Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh, before their arrests
late last year. He might hope that his successor is more than
a friend, for his own friendship with Mr. Roh counted for
little during the latter's travails. Korea may need a new
president who is willing to take on a system that condones
illegal activities such as bribe-taking, rather than simply
gunning for individual bribe-takers and ignoring the
fundamental problem. In short, the country needs someone
unlike Mr. Kim.

What would such an approach mean for the hundreds of
demonstrators killed in Kwangju 16 years ago? Should no one in
power be held accountable? Can the living forgive on behalf of
the dead? The simple answers are yes, there should be
accountability, and no, forgiveness cannot be bestowed in
absentia. If he pardons the two ex-rulers, Mr. Kim is likely
to come in for much criticism. But, for a number of important
reasons, that would be the right thing to do.

Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh have been rightly tagged with serious
wrongdoings - truths recorded for posterity. But blame for
even the worst offenses rarely rests on just one person. Who
were Mr. Chun's accomplices in the Kwangju crackdown, and to
what extent were they involved? And how many, actually, were
killed? The trial failed to shed light on these key aspects,
squandering perhaps a historic opportunity to do so. If the
government had established such truths, it would have done
much more to put the incident to rest than by staging a trial
whose outcome always seemed predetermined.

Then there are practical considerations. Pursuing truth and
justice may mean a chance to lay ghosts to rest through a
public catharsis. But what about the costs? If the United
States had not intervened in 1986 to spirit Mr. Marcos out of
Malaca-ang Palace to Hawaii, civil war could have erupted in
the Philippines. Those who wanted to hold Marcos fully
accountable for abuses under martial-law rule were denied the
opportunity to punish him accordingly. But consider the gains:
large-scale conflict was averted, the strongman was gone for
good - and a popular uprising succeeded, without shedding
blood.

In the wake of the South Korean verdict, Myanmar's ruling
junta must be wondering whether it would ever be smart to cede
power, even incrementally, to democrats without a bloody
fight. Similar thoughts must have occurred to close associates
of Indonesia's Suharto family while contemplating the
consequences if their benefactor ever lost political
authority. Vengeful score-settling only reinforces the natural
reluctance of autocrats to share power or undertake democratic
reform. And while the Kwangju survivors have no real
obligation to consider how their pursuit of justice might
affect others, it is the responsibility of elected leaders,
like Mr. Kim, to do so. Besides, every system of government
has its winners and losers. It would be inimical to a nation's
stability as well as its broader interests if new winners were
constantly to re-evaluate those they replaced, turning their
predecessors into new losers - a vicious cycle.

In the end, governments must always keep their attention
focused more on the present and the future than on the past.
Bangladesh has one of Asia's lowest per-capita GDPs and faces
such monumental challenges as feeding its people, developing
viable industries and raising literacy levels. Can it afford
to have its leaders doggedly pursuing decades-old
assassinations? In South Korea, the rampant corruption that
helped fell Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh highlighted longstanding
malpractices. The Seoul government would more productively
spend its energy and resources tackling their root causes than
pursuing further redress for past wrongs. As Rev. Tutu would
probably agree, once the truth has been established, a nation
should move on to reconciliation. Down that path lies
progress.

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

PILOT PROGRAM Cathay Pacific has flown into the future by

wanted to fly the big birds when she was an engineering
student at Hong Kong University. Says the 24-year-old second
officer: "I don't see any difference between me and a man
pilot." Other Asian airlines have held a similar view for many
years. Chinese, Indian and Philippine carriers all have women
flyers. For now, Wu will be a relief pilot on long-haul
flights. She won't make captain for at least eleven years. By
then, Cathay will probably have more women pilots. Given Hong
Kong's 1997 handover to China, expect mainlanders to number
among them.

NEWSMAKERS: MONEY TALKS: Donald Tsang Yam Kuen"s message to George Soros...


from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

MONEY TALKS Donald Tsang Yam Kuen's message to George Soros
is: back off. Hong Kong's financial secretary has warned the
billionaire investor not to bet against the territory's
dollar. In 1992, Soros helped force the British pound out of
Eu-rope's Exchange Rate Mechanism by successfully speculating
it would be devalued. Tsang, 51, told Bloomberg news agency
Soros's people have been informed that Hong Kong would
vigorously defend its currency's U.S. dollar peg: "We showed
them our bank account." It includes the Exchange Fund, holding
nearly $60 billion. That sort of money even Soros would
respect.

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

PARTY ON Three years ago, maverick MP Hatoyama Yukio, whom
many Japanese regard as a fresh, bold kind of leader, helped
form the Sakigake party to shake up local politics. While it
plays a gadfly role in the ruling coalition, Hatoyama, the
subject of an Asiaweek cover story in May, is not satisfied.
The immaculately pedigreed son of a former foreign minister
and grandson of an ex-PM is setting up a new party - yet to be
named - to re-launch his crusade against business and the
bureaucracy. Ideals - and money - keep Hatoyama, 49, going. A
multimillionaire, he is one of Japan's wealthiest politicians.
Reform may be Hatoyama's catch-cry, but to achieve it, he
cannot do without an old-style war chest.

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

A NEW MODEL After Ford Motor Co. took control of Mazda earlier
this year, big wheels in Detroit named Henry Wallace, 50, as
president, one of the few foreigners to head a major Japanese
outfit. Now he has also become its poster boy. Full-page ads
featuring the slim, moustachioed Scotsman in long-sleeved
shirt and tie are appearing in local papers. He pitches both
the company and its latest car. But with the automaker's
fortunes improving - in the year that ended March 31, Mazda
reported a loss of $111 million, after bleeding $390 million
in fiscal 1995 - it may not need Wallace's modeling services
for too long.

VITAL SIGNS: Balance of Power Hydroelectric power is controversial 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Balance of Power Hydroelectric power is controversial. While
it is renewable and non-polluting, its dams can damage the
environment in other ways. But most countries have decided
that the pluses outweigh the minuses. They are generating
ever-greater amounts of hydroelectricity, as shown below,
measured in gigawatt-hours (1 = 1,000 megawatt-hours). Water
power is clearly driving economies and raising living
standards.

CUTTING EDGE: How to Meet a Shark and Live to Tell 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

For people who do not subscribe to the conviction that the
only good shark is a dead one, here comes the Protective
Oceanic Device (POD). It is the environmentally safe way to
avoid dangerous encounters with sharks without having to kill
them. Developed by South Africa's Natal Sharks Board, the
battery-powered POD costs a little less than $1,000 and
consists of three parts. The main section is strapped to a
diver's aqualung, the pad to one of the fins, and the control
is hand-held. The POD unit functions by generating an ultra-
mild electrical current that works against sensors in a
shark's snout which normally pick up the electrical emissions
of prey. The device creates a sort of force field around the
diver, repelling a shark from a distance of four to seven
meters. Though the POD works well for recreational divers, it
is probably more useful as a tool for researchers who want to
mingle with the beasts. It was successfully tested by two
documentary film makers swimming with sharks in tanks as well
as in the open sea. The Natal Sharks Board is working on
adapting the units for swimmers, surfboards, canoes and even
lifejackets.

Update: Justice Delayed: The year 1984 was one of great upheaval for India


from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

The year 1984 was one of great upheaval for India. The then
prime minister, Indira Gandhi, ordered troops into the Golden
Temple to flush out militants holed up inside Sikhdom's
holiest shrine, sparking outrage among believers worldwide. A
few months later, two of Gandhi's Sikh bodyguards gunned her
down. In retaliation, predominantly Hindu mobs slaughtered
nearly 3,000 Sikhs in Delhi alone. Now, 12 years later, 89 men
- among the last originally held for the bloodletting - have
each been sentenced to five years in jail. The defendants, out
on bail all this time, were convicted of lesser charges of
damaging property and violating curfews because of insufficent
evidence. Judge S.N. Dhingra blamed "a lack of concern by the
administration and the courts" for the long delay.

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

It is often inappropriate to compare prominent personalities
in one country to those in another, not least because
cultures, backgrounds and motivations are usually different.
But that has not stopped Lt.-Gen. Syar-wan Hamid of the
Indonesian army, still rabidly chasing "subversive elements"
for causing Jakarta's July 27 riots. Syarwan says opposition
politician Megawati Sukar-noputri fancies herself as the local
Cory Aquino, while an ally, Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid,
is Jaime Cardinal Sin, referring to two key players of the
1986 Philippine "People Power" revolution. Wahid's rebuttal:
Syarwan should take the parallels further - by naming whom the
Indonesian Marcos would be. The answer is obvious, even if the
question is perhaps unfair. But the general asked for it.

FRONTLINES: Encountering Cyberstatic 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Recent heavy rains in Hanoi have not only caused chaos in the
streets but confusion in cyberspace as well. Subscribers of
Vietnam's only public e-mail service Netnam, managed by the
state-run Institute of Information Technology, have reported
difficulties sending and receiving international messages. The
foul weather has indeed disrupted basic services, but some
users also suspect a sinister hand at work. The alleged
culprit: the state telephone monopoly, Viet-nam Post &
Telecommunications, which has been agitating for an exclusive
license to run Internet services in the country.

Because officials have turned down VNPT's repeated requests,
some users be-lieve it is sending static down lines tapped by
Netnam subscribers. One subscriber claims oscilloscopes
connected to the lines show inexplicable signals whenever Net-
nam is accessed. Suspicions also mounted after the e-mail
provider sent a message to subscribers saying nothing appeared
to be wrong with its equipment. Netnam says it does not know
what is causing the problem, which means Vietnam's
cybercommunity will have to continue weathering the storms.
Both of them.

FRONTLINES: Democratic Bridge to Beijing? 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

As Hong Kong's transition to 1997 quickens, the thaw between
China and its local nemesis, the popular Democratic Party, is
gaining momentum. Both sides are making cautiously
conciliatory statements in public. Early last month, Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in-vited the Democrats to
participate in the Selection Committee, a 400-strong body
whose responsibility is to choose Hong Kong's first post-1997
chief executive and provisional legislature. Though their
reply was no, the Democrats said they were willing to hold a
dialogue with Beijing on other transition issues. Qian said
fine, but stressed that joining the Committee would improve
the atmosphere.

The mood is already much better. Party sources say that
preparations are already under way for two of the group's
stalwarts, chairman Martin Lee Chu Ming (pictured) and vice-
chairman Yeung Sum, to travel to Beijing in the near future.
Apparently, both sides have agreed in principle to such a
trip. Indeed, the buzz in the territory is that a ranking
member of the party has already been to the Chinese capital.

The Democrats have little problem with the Selection Committee
picking Hong Kong's future leader, but the party has long said
it will not participate in the entire process because it
considers the interim lawmaking assembly illegal. Beijing's
latest compromise proposal to the Democrats is: join the
Committee and abstain from voting on the provisional
legislature - so long as you do not openly continue to oppose
its creation. With public opinion in Hong Kong running
strongly in favor of Democratic participation in the selection
body, the party faces a tough - and potentially divisive -
decision.

ASIAWEEK: LETTERS & COMMENTS: 13 September 1996 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

I find your hagiographic article about 20 days in the life of
the bombastic Sri Lanka president, Chandrika Kumaratunga
["Under Seige," Cover Story, Aug. 23] somewhat disingenuous.
Her actions do not reflect her apparent high-mindedness about
human rights and justice. Her peace-through-war strategy has
caused innumerable sufferings to the Tamil civilians of the
north and east of Sri Lanka. Her willingness to gloss over
this human tragedy and to let the Sri Lankan armed forces
prosecute the war with unparalleled brutality and impunity has
only deepened the ethnic chasm in Sri Lanka.

The latest Amnesty International report on Sri Lanka slams her
government for its tolerance of continuing human rights
abuses. Perhaps, president Kumaratunga should reevaluate her
concept of human rights and justice for the sake of
alleviating the misery of thousands and thousands of innocent
Sri Lankans.

E. S. Anton, Ph.D.

New Haven, Conn.

U.S.A.

Ron Gluckman had erroneously failed to record President
Chandrika Kumaratunga's determination to restore civilian life
and rehabilitate the war-ravaged North. In June, the President
unveiled an ambitious plan to raise money from foreign
countries to restore the Jaffna region. The plan envisages the
rebuilding of roads, re-equipping of schools, creation of
farms, restoration of postal and telecommunications services,
and so forth. The plan is expected to cost about $274 million.

But equally determined are the Tamil Tigers to sabotage the
rehabilitation work  as demonstrated when a suicide bomber
killed 23 and injured 60 others including the Minister for
Construction.

P.A. Samaraweera

Darwin, Australia

Prabhakaran, Cont'd

Sachi Sri Kantha's observations [LETTERS, Aug. 16] amused me a
great deal. That Anthony Davis did "a good profile" of
Prabhakaran hinges on what was intended. Reading between the
lines, the aims and goals of transnational "Tiger Inc." are
violence, murder and sudden death. I do not think the article
would have earned the ire of the Sri Lankan government in
particular. They would have welcomed it.

Mr. Sri Kantha latches on to the statement, "Prabhakaran's
acumen is as much that of a CEO as of a military commander."
One is reminded of a GI's comment about General "Blood and
Guts" Patton: "His guts and our blood."

Mr. Sri Kantha must have a very fertile imagination to claim
that the profile of Prabhakaran differs but little from those
of George Washington, Mao, Begin and Arafat. As far as Begin
is concerned, the parallel seems correct. It would be an
insult to the others and to Nelson Mandela to associate them
with Prabhakaran.

Mr. Sri Kantha has failed to mention the true Asian
revolutionary, Ho Chi Minh, whose thesis was to "work the
socialist revolution through the nationalist aspirations" of
the people. And in Ho's lexicon, nationalism was not the
racist dogma that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has in
its lessons of indoctrination to very young students or in the
oath of hate taken at the commencement of daily parades.

How can he compare the military spending of the LTTE with that
of the Sri Lankan government? The government of Sri Lanka is a
legitimately elected government, whereas the LTTE's is, de
facto, a rogue or outlaw organization. If, as Mr. Sri Kantha
maintains, the LTTE embodies the genuine aspirations of the
Sri Lanka Tamils, why is it then that they have dungeons in
which those thought to be opponents, and those who have
refused to contribute in kind or in money under coercion, are
incarcerated and tortured? Amnesty International has
documented evidence of this as have the University Teachers
for Human Rights (Jaffna).

I would like to bring your attention to the fact that former
United Nations Secretary General U Thant of Burma was not a
cabinet minister as you mentioned. ["The Asian Factor in the
U.N. Race," FRONTLINES, Aug. 23]. He was merely a parliament
secretary in the Ministry of Information in the government of
the late U Nu, the last elected civilian prime minister of
Burma. In 1952 U Thant became a Burmese delegate to the U.N.
and five years later became the country's permanent
representative.

You also forgot to mention the most outstanding potential
candidate, one who is capable of doing the job of Secretary
General efficiently, with a proven record of building the
nation to prosperity: PM Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia.

What Comes after Having It All

I refer to "How to Know You Have It All" [NATIONS, Sept. 6].
As a Singapore citizen who had worked his guts out and came
close to karoshi [a Japanese term for sudden death from
overwork] through his 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s, to eventually
attain the 5Cs [Cash or career; Credit cards, Car, Condo,
Country club membership] cleanly (no mortgage or other debt),
I wonder whether young Singaporeans are aware that what comes
after they have made the 5Cs are the 5 Ds: Decay (hair and
teeth), Disability (worsening myopia, arthritis, etc.),
Disease (clogging of arteries, cancer, gout), Depression
(boredom from not working) and finally Death.

There is more. When you have finally attained the last D, you
have a choice of the 3Es: `Eaven (heaven), `Ell (hell) or
Extinction (if you do not believe in the first two Es).

CORRECTION  Our story "The Billionaires' Binge" [BUSINESS,
Aug. 23] mistakenly said that Singapore's Fraser and Neave has
Coca-Cola bottling franchises in Myanmar, among other
Southeast Asian countries. Though F&N Coca-Cola has soft drink
operations in eight Asian countries in all, Myanmar is not one
of them. Furthermore, the company has no current plans to
enter the country. Asiaweek regrets the error.

Toxin law case ends in defeat: Worker pledges to press on with her
three-year battle

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

Thaksina Khaikaew and Chakrit Ridmontri

A woman's three-year battle against a former employer she blames for
aluminium poisoning was thrown out by the Central Labour Court yesterday.

The verdict ended a case that symbolised a fight for justice by an
ordinary worker against a multi-national with government backing.

In 1993, Mayuree Taevivat filed a six-million-baht damages action against
Electro Ceramics (Thailand) Co, a Thai-Japanese venture in Lamphun.

Mrs Mayuree, who started work at the Electro Ceramics plant in the
Lamphun industrial estate, said she had been exposed to aluminium dust
for five years.

Handing down its ruling, the court said Mrs Mayuree had failed to prove
alumina dust was the cause of her illnesses. It ruled the company, which
produces electronic parts and components, was not obliged to compensate
her because it had been entitled to terminate her employment after she
had been absent for more than six months.

Five years after beginning work at the plant, Mrs Mayuree suffered body
pain and headaches. Tests at Chiang Mai's McCormic Hospital established
she had been exposed to chemical poisoning.

Some 13 workers have died of suspected chemical poisoning in Lamphun but
the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand contends they died of Aids.

After the verdict, a tearful Mrs Mayuree said she would appeal. Mr
Praphan, her husband, said the family had accumulated more than 300,000
baht in medical bills.

He said his family was waging a lone battle against a big corporation.
None of their neighbours, who work at the estate, dared lend them support
for fear of losing their jobs.

The authority is cooperating with the SSPA Maritime Consulting Co of
Sweden on an environmental risk assessment in electronics plants at the
Lamphun estate.

The study, funded by Sweden's International Development Cooperation
Agency, aims to identify the risks so appropriate safety measures can be
introduced. Factories will assist the study.

Ingemar Palsson, of SSPA, said the assessment is focusing on factors that
may have adverse effects on workers. After the assessment, he said,
safety measures would be introduced.

Mr Palsson said safety measures must comply with legal standards and must
be acceptable to the workforce.

Environmental risks in the electronics industry mostly concern solder and
cleaning work. Soldering, which involves melting lead to connect
electronic components on circuit boards, produces toxic fumes that are
extremely hazardous to health. Cleaning involves solvents that are also
toxic.

Kasemsri Homchean, director of the authority's Environment and Safety
Control Division, confirmed that the assessments would be carried out
soon but said it was up to factories to decide if they were to adopt
prescribed measures.

Factories that adopt the recommendations would manage their own
environmental management performance, he said. It could be a stepping
stone towards environmental management under ISO 14000, he added.

Help sought in condo scam

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

Over a hundred people in Pathum Thani are in debt to Siam City Bank for
failing to make mortgage payments for condominium units they did not buy.

They sought help yesterday from the Office of Civil Rights Protection and
Legal Aid.

One of them, Arunee Vijitkraisri, 55, said the bank is demanding that she
repay a loan plus 19% annual interest, adding up to 476,107 baht.

Otherwise it will ask the court to confiscate the unit she is alleged to
have bought at Maitreekij Estate Co's MT Condominium in Thanyaburi.

But Mrs Arunee said she did not buy the condo or apply for a mortgage
from the bank.

She said she had been told by a broker, Somchai Kulhiransawat, that she
would be paid 2,000 baht by Maitreekij Estate Co for helping to reserve
a unit of its project.

As her husband makes only 4,500 baht a month to feed six mouths, Mrs
Arunee said she and her four children agreed.

Her family and neighbours went with Mr Somchai to Thanyaburi Land Office.

Officials there asked her to sign some documents. Mrs Arunee, who is
illiterate, said she did not know what the documents were about.

She was then paid 2,000 baht. Her four children also reserved four units
and were also paid 2,000 baht each.

Prosecutor Yuenyad Jaisamut said the people, most of them low-income
workers, demanded about 500,000 baht each from the bank in suits filed
with South Bangkok Civil Court and Thanyaburi Court.

Mr Yuenyad alleged the condo project owner conspired with bank officials
to cheat the people and could be charged with fraud.

The penalty for fraud is not more than five years in prison or a fine not
exceeding 10,000 baht or both.

Mr Somchai, the broker, was among the victims filing complaints with Mr
Yuenyad yesterday.

Mr Yuenyad said he had ordered the agency's lawyers to investigate and
gather evidence.

The agency provides assistance free of charge, but the people must pay
a 1,000 baht court fee by themselves.

He called on the Government to help pay the fees for these poor people.

British royals warmly greeted: Second time here by UK queen since 1972

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

Anjira Assavanonda and Varalee Sinlarat

Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II renewed her acquaintance with Thailand for
the first time in 24 years yesterday.

The British monarch and the Duke of Edinburgh, her consort, who are on
a five-day state visit, were greeted at Don Muang airport by Their
Majesties the King and Queen.

Hundreds of people, Thais and foreigners, watched the greeting before the
King and Queen accompanied their royal guests to motorcade.

From the airport, they went to Maha Jesadabodin Pavilion, where city
officials were in attendance. Thousands of people lined Rajdamnern Avenue
waving the tri-coloured Union Jack and Thai flags.

Silence descended moments before the motorcade arrived at 3.40 p.m.

Queen Elizabeth, in an emerald green dress and hat, stepped out of the
car, drawing expressions of delight and excitement from the crowd.

Chariya Rattakul, wife of Bangkok Governor Bhichit, and Sunantha
Samalapa, wife of City Clerk Prasert, presented garlands to Queen
Elizabeth, Queen Sirikit and Prince Philip.

On behalf of Bangkok, Governor Bhichit welcomed the monarch and presented
her with a key to the city.

The key is gold-plated, eight inches in length engraved with the emblem
of the city showing Indra, keeper of Amarawadi heaven, atop Erawan, the
white elephant.

In response, Queen Elizabeth thanked the people of Bangkok and expressed
pleasure at a welcome that was as friendly as in 1972.

She said she arrived in Bangkok then by river, but this time she entered
the city from the newly-expanded airport. From the short drive, the UK
Queen said Bangkok had changed almost beyond recognition.

She said she was glad the city, despite modernisation, had retained its
rich cultural heritage which would be enjoyed not only by Thais but by
an increasing number of overseas visitors, including Britons.

"I am sure the citizens of Bangkok, in facing up to the demands of modern
living, have lost none of their warmth and humour," she said.

The Queen told Mr Bhichit he had been elected governor of one of the
great cities of Asia and had accepted a responsibility both exciting and
rewarding.

She also wished the governor and the people success in continuing to make
Bangkok a thriving and happy place in which to live in years ahead.

After the ceremony, the King and the Queen accompanied Queen Elizabeth
and Prince Philip to Boromabhiman Mansion, where they will stay.

Most people in the crowd expressed delight for a chance to welcome the
royal visitors even though many of them did not have a clear view.

Porntip Pimcharoen, 57, and her daughter, from Min Buri, had arrived at
Rajdamnern at 5 a.m but missed seeing the Queen because she left her spot
for a few moments just as the motorcade arrived.

She said, however, she was glad to be there. "As a Bangkok citizen, I'm
glad she has come here. It will be a long, long time before she comes
here again. I keep reading about her in the newspapers every day."

Having missed her chance, Mrs Porntip said she would try again.

At Boromabhiman Mansion, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip gave an
audience to Thai and foreign journalists. As the gathering was a social
event, press coverage was not allowed at the request of Buckingham
Palace.

The royal visitors have a busy itinerary. Today's engagements include a
visit to Ayutthaya where they will view ancient temples, floating
lanterns on the Chao Phraya, a light and sound display at the old capital
and a private dinner with the King and Queen.

Scholarship was watershed in boy's life

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

When Queen Elizabeth was taken to Bhumibol Dam on her last visit 24 years
ago, she said she wanted to support the education of some hilltribe
students.

Lee Suk, then 17, said to be the brightest of the H'mong students, was
selected and told Queen Elizabeth he wanted to become a doctor.

He was granted a queen's scholarship for five years, which enabled him
to complete MS5 secondary education, but he did not make it to medical
college.

He said he tried to do too much and his marks fell short of the minimum
requirement for medical college. Instead, he entered the agriculture
college at Chiang Mai University, which was a blessing in disguise.

After MS5, Lee Suk was on his own, but reluctant to give up education,
he borrowed money for university fees and books. He brought his problem
to the attention of representatives of His Majesty the King's hilltribe
programme. As a result, he was granted scholarships from the government
and Australia, which enabled him to finish his BA in agriculture in
Chiang Mai.

Three years ago, he took leave to study for a master's in agricultural
promotion in Chiang Mai, and in January, he graduated.

Born in Pa Wai, Nakhon Thai, Phitsanulok, Lee Suk's childhood was spent
fighting malaria and poverty. He barely knew Thai until 11 when a group
of volunteer teachers set up a school for H'mong children in his remote
village. It was the first time he had learned the Thai language.

Lee Suk excelled over his peers. He picked up the language faster and was
praised by all the teachers. But his studies came to an abrupt end when
communist insurgents raided the village and shot dead the headmen.

His parents and their nine children fled to a temple in Nakhon Thai town
where they took refuge for three months before they settled in Tak, where
Lee Suk resumed his studies at a state school.

Today, Lee Suk, or Lee Suk Rithnettikul, as he is known to his
colleagues, works at the Hilltribe Development and Welfare Centre in
Chiang Mai, where he is using his knowledge for his people.

Plaintiff's lawyer can talk to media

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

The South Bangkok Criminal Court has ruled that the lawyer of a Khon Kaen
businessman, who brought a 695.62 million baht lawsuit against Samitivej
Hospital in the death of his pregnant wife, can speak to the media.

In its ruling last Friday the court said the lawyer has the
constitutional right to speak to the media and his action would not be
interpreted as contempt of court.

The court also set December 16 for the first examination of the
plaintiff's witnesses after the two sides failed to reach an out-of-court
settlement.

In the lawsuit filed April 30, Burin Seriyothin said his wife, Jureerat,
died on September 6 last year after being left unattended in the delivery
room.

Mrs Jureerat died of suffocation after being given an injection. No
doctor was present to help her.

Mr Burin claimed that his wife, who was manager of Khon Kaen Hae Uan Co
at the time of her death, had an annual income of 25 million baht.

Chiang Mai

Five Israelis were seriously injured in a cable car accident at Wat
Phrathat Doi Suthep yesterday.

A car carrying 20 tourists derailed and crashed after the cable snapped
halfway up Doi Suthep at 3 p.m. yesterday.

The Israelis, whose names were not released, suffered serious injuries,
including broken legs.

Temple worker Phrommin Doatraphan said the car derailed because it was
full while another on the way down was empty.

The service has been halted pending investigations in which police are
looking for evidence of negligence.

Samak fumes over defeat in latest poll: Clean sweep for the Democrats
predicted

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Prachakorn Thai leader Samak Sundaravej was enraged by the latest
Matichon opinion poll which says he will lose the November 17 general
election.

The poll predicts a clean sweep for the Democrats in all but two Bangkok
constituencies -- 7 and 12 -- which are Palang Dharma's and Prachakorn
Thai's respective strongholds.

The poll was conducted on 2,550 people in the 13 constituencies of
Bangkok on Saturday. Between 146-205 respondents were selected at random
from each constituency.

Mr Samak questioned the reliability of the poll, saying its results were
misleading since the number of respondents was too small to represent
Bangkok's entire population.

He also doubted all the respondents were eligible voters.

The survey predicts a clean sweep by Democrats Vinai Sompong, Thawatchai
Satchakul and Gen Panlop Pinmanee in the three-seat Constituency 1, with
Mr Samak coming in fourth.

Mr Samak blasted the poll, saying it was aimed at classifying political
parties into good and bad ones in a misleading way.

"Let me ask you this. Will the (pollsters' relatives) at home die or get
sick all of a sudden, or will their office buildings collapse if they go
without the poll?" he said.

The Interior Ministry has instructed its officials to stay neutral in the
lead-up to the election to ensure a fair and clean poll.

Speaking to a meeting of some 966 district chiefs and provincial police
chiefs yesterday, Deputy Interior Minister Arsa Meksawan warned them not
to side with any candidates.

"Some officials have close ties with local politicians who may ask them
to do something to boost their chances of getting elected. As state
officials, we have to ensure fair and clean elections. Don't let
unscrupulous people order you to do something that violates the law," Mr
Arsa said.

The ministry's permanent secretary, Chuwong Chayabutr, who was also
present at the meeting, asked district authorities to warn local
community leaders against helping canvass votes for candidates.

"Every election season, there are complaints that kamnan and phuyaiban
(tambon and village heads) serve as canvassers for some candidates.
Therefore, it is the task of the district chief to warn local leaders in
his or her area of jurisdiction not to become a tool of politicians," Mr
Aree said.

Three-party coalition seen

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Phetchabun

There is a distinct possibility of Democrat, Chart Pattana and Chart Thai
parties forming the next coalition government, former House Speaker Panja
Kaesornthong said yesterday.

Mr Panja, who recently quit Chart Pattana and will contest next month's
election on the Chart Thai ticket, said his party could play a crucial
role in the formation of the new government.

He said Chart Thai leader Banharn Silpa-archa was not angry with the
Democrats, who questioned his nationality and academic qualification
during the censure debate, for deep inside he understands that they were
only performing their duty as an opposition party.

Mr Banharn would not accept any cabinet posts if his party was invited
to join the new coalition, said the veteran politician and former
Phetchabun MP.

In a way the mass defection of former MPs did the party a world of good,
Mr Panja said, because Chart Thai was now left with only quality members.

Mr Panja, who once left Chart Thai to help Gen Chatichai Choonhavan form
Chart Pattana Party, said he returned to Chart Thai because Mr Banharn
wanted him to help salvage the party.

Party policies on army TV

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

The army is to air a programme for parties to explain their policies.

"Last Lap of Election '96" will be televised live on Channel 5 on
November 6 from 8.15 p.m. to 11.15 p.m. from Kittikachorn Hall at army
headquarters.

Lt-Gen Jaturit Phromsakha na Sakon Nakhon, assistant chief-of-staff for
civilian affairs, said parties will use the first segment to outline
policies, after which the audience, mostly military personnel, will raise
questions that have been screened.

"The army will not allow politicians to attack one other. They can only
present their views and visions," Lt-Gen Jaturit said.

Leaders or representatives of 13 parties in the poll will be invited to
the office of the army secretary tomorrow to discuss the programme.

If the programme is too short for all parties to make their policies
known, the army may consider another programme on November 8.

MP accused of forging document: Used against PM at no-confidence debate

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Democrat Chamni Sakdiset was yesterday accused of falsifying an alien
registration paper which he used to attack Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa in last month's no-confidence debate.

The accusation was made by a complaint filed with the Crime Suppression
Division by Somsak Phakhipho, a 58-year-old lawyer.

The lawyer said the copy of an alien registration paper produced by Mr
Chamni during the September 18 censure debate and which the Democrat
claimed to have been issued to Sengkim sae Bay, Mr Banharn's father,
showed that Mr Sengkim arrived in Thailand in B.E. 2480 (1937), while the
genuine document showed the year of his arrival to be 2450 (1907).

Mr Chamni, meanwhile, said in Nakhon Si Thammarat yesterday that doubts
over the legality of Mr Banharn's Thai nationality raised by him during
the September 18 censure debate have been distorted and used by three
political parties with support bases in Bangkok to attack the Democrats
in a bid to maintain their popularity.

He said what he raised during the debate was the suspicion that Mr
Banharn might have obtained his Thai nationality illegally, basing his
arguments on the alien registration paper issued to the premier's father.

However, he said, the Prachakorn Thai, Muan Chon and Palang Dharma
parties have twisted the real issue to accuse the Democrats of racial
discrimination.

Mr Chamni said before the debate he had tried to verify the document with
the police but they refused to cooperate.

The Democrat said he was responsible for what he had done and would not
mind if Muan Chon leader Chalerm Yubamrung filed a complaint with the
police over this matter.

"Pol Capt Chalerm himself should not have stayed on as caretaker justice
minister because he was one of those who had betrayed Mr Banharn by
forcing him to resign after the censure debate," Mr Chamni said.

Democrats go for Islamic votes: Pledge to open a new world for Muslims

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Somchai Meesane

The Democrats are going high-tech to win the hearts of Muslim voters in
the four southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and Satun.

Campaign director Surin Pitsuwan said yesterday a party which could "open
a new world" for Muslim communities stands to win.

The Democrats are relying on video multivision and the print media as
their main weapons in the battle for votes in the four Muslim-dominated
provinces.

Mr Surin used video multivisions in the Yawi and Malay languages for the
first time during his campaign in Pattani's Yaring district on Sunday.
The new technology was warmly welcomed there.

The former deputy foreign minister said the battle between the Democrats
and New Aspiration in the South has boiled down to a race to build up "a
new process of learning" for Muslim communities.

The old strategy of the Wadah Group headed by New Aspiration's Wan
Muhamad Nor Matha, which demands that Muslim people look up to their
religious leaders as the only channel for news and information will not
work this time, Mr Surin said.

The Democrats lost in the past because it had no chance to clear
themselves of accusations made by the Wadah Group, then led by Den
Tohmeena, which rejected learning through reading, listening and
watching, said the former Nakhon Si Thammarat MP.

Mr Surin said attempts by his party to bring "a new way of learning" to
the Muslims in the South through its campaigns helped it win in the four
southernmost provinces in the last election on July 2, 1995.

He said if the Democrats could instill the habit of learning through
reading, watching and listening in them, he believes Muslims all over the
country will vote for the party.

The four provinces were the strongholds of New Aspiration for about a
decade until the July 2 election when the Democrats managed to snatch
eight seats from New Aspiration, which could hold on to only five.

This time it's going to be a fierce contest again between the two parties
vying for the 13 seats at stake -- four each in Pattani and Narathiwat,
three in Yala and two in Satun.

The Democrats aim to capture 12 seats this time, leaving only one seat
in Yala to deputy New Aspiration leader Wan Muhamad Nor Matha.

New Aspiration, meanwhile, hopes to not only keep its five seats but also
to win three more from Den Tohmeena in Pattani's Constituency 1, Parinya
Jetapivat in Narathiwat's Constituency 2 and Horsaree Mahrem in Satun.

That means Mr Den, a veteran Pattani MP, has to beat Democrat Mareepeng
Pajakiya, while Mr Parinya and Mr Horsaree must defeat Ramree Mama and
Thanin Jaisamut, respectively.

Muslims, who form 70 percent of the total population of the four
southernmost provinces, are therefore the deciding factor.

Apart from video multivisions, Mr Surin will also issue a party journal
featuring Democrat achievements in the South under the theme "Recovering
the Thai Economy and Building the Darussalam (land of peace)."

The journal covers Democrat policies on Muslim communities, the Growth
Triangle, promotion of hadji affairs, Malay language studies.

Some 200,000 copied will be distributed to Muslims all over the country.

The wind of change has been so strong Mr Wan Nor, who now leads the Wadah
Group, admitted he could no longer rely on Muslim religious leaders to
help canvass votes for New Aspiration.

Mr Wan Nor has ordered former Mass Communications Organisation of
Thailand director Rachan Husen to prepare multivision media for the
party's election campaign.

He will also issue leaflets in Thai and Yawi to publicise the Wadah
Group's work in the South.

The group has also stepped up its campaign among young eligible voters
-- those between 18-20 years old -- by promoting sport competitions and
recruiting them to help with the party's work.

Mr Surin claimed young voters who were against the "old process of
learning" were a major force behind the defeat of the Wadah Group in the
last election.

There are about 20,000 young eligible voters in each of the four
southernmost provinces.

Mr Wan Nor admitted the "Chuan Fever" is very strong in the South and
that New Aspiration leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh could not match the
Democrat leader in terms of popularity in this region.

The Wadah Group has already dropped the "Chavalit for prime minister"
slogan here and switched to "Southerners for NAP ministers" instead.

PollWatch sets eyes on cash transactions: Big sums changing hands in
provinces

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Wut Nontarit

Khon Kaen

Pollwatch is keeping a close watch on unusual cash transactions in this
province, where there has been an upsurge in demand for 100 and 50-baht
banknotes.

Preeda Thumthiang, chairman of the PollWatch committee in the Northeast,
said many banks in the province came across clients asking to have
millions of baht in cash changed into the 100 and 50-baht notes.

Such practices were rare outside the election period, he said, adding
that a PollWatch investigation had found that people who carry large
amounts of cash work for a big political party with a large support base
in the region.

But so far, no one has been caught violating the election law. PollWatch
will continue to keep an eye on activities that may lead to vote-buying.

Mr Preeda said he expected fierce competition in all four constituencies
of Khon Kaen.

The various parties have begun selecting canvassers to work for them in
the different localities.

The parties have spent a lot of money devising election strategies to be
deployed in rounding up support from potential voters.

He explained that canvassers are usually chosen from respected figures
in the community. They will tour the villages recommending their
candidates to the people.

The local people were told the candidates would fulfil their promises if
they were elected.

The canvassers often threatened to withdraw support for the villagers if
they did not vote for their candidates. "Now is just about the time to
find the canvassers," said Mr Preecha.

He said PollWatch volunteers would closely monitor the canvassers' moves.
Legal action would be taken against them immediately if there was
evidence to suggest they had committed wrongdoing.

Mr Preeda opposed New Aspiration's bid to woo local voters by supporting
its leader as prime minister for the Northeastern people, saying this
would only divide people of the different regions.

He said the party's effort to draw votes from the teachers may eventually
prove futile because election victory depended on many other factors.
Vote-buying, for example, looked likely to change the voting pattern.

Starting from November 5, PollWatch would despatch its officials to
educate locals about democracy and the adverse effects of vote-buying.
The campaign is expected to be joined by more than 120,000 residents.

Vote-buying is likely to be particularly heavy during the week preceding
the election.

So far, PollWatch has received reports that some parties have distributed
coupons which can be redeemed for cash to attract people to their
campaign rallies. The coupons have a value of between 20 and 50 baht.

Sukit Wattanasuk, head of Khon Kane's PollWatch Development Office, said
about 1,300 volunteers, mostly Khon Kane University students, were sent
to monitor the pre-election situation in the villages.

PollWatch has also asked the provincial governor that its officials be
allowed to man election units on election day so as to prevent
malpractice.

He said it was found the voters were handed ballot papers which had
already been marked, adding that vote-buyers and officials often worked
as a team.

Election snippets: Party canvassers use lotto-strategy

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

The competitive atmosphere in Phuket is heating up, with many canvassers
using a new strategy to seek votes for some candidates by selling
underground lottery tickets to local people.

Some candidates' supporters reportedly sell the so-called "MP lotteries"
to people in Phuket for ten baht each and promise to pay 1,000-5,000 baht
to those buying lottos with the name of the winner.

Many villagers have complained to to Phuket PollWatch chairman Kittipong
Thieng Khunatham, requesting that the agency take action.

Two-time Democrat MP for Phuket Anchalee Vanich Thepbutr and New
Aspiration candidate Revuth Chindapol are fighting a political battle to
capture the single seat in this southern province.

Police officers in the North will face immediate reshuffle if they
support certain political parties, according to the head of Police
Regional Bureau 5, Pol Lt-Gen Prasarn Wongyai.

Pol Lt-Gen Prasarn said he had authorised every provincial police chief
in the North to transfer every officer acting against election laws out
of the area urgently.

"Policemen of every level will be transferred to other remote areas to
prevent more malpractice if they use their authority to benefit some
parties or candidates. I myself will be ready to face the same penalty
if found guilty of any allegations," he said.

Police under the Regional Bureau 5 have also been ordered to ensure
safety for every candidate and canvasser, and keep a close watch on
gunmen who may cause trouble at the election.

A Palang Dharma candidate contesting the poll in Samut Prakan's
Constituency 1 has asked for more PollWatch officials to ensure a fair
election.

Dr Wallop Youngtrong said Constituency 1 was notorious for rigging. He
cited the January 8 election last year when hundreds of voters turned up
but could not cast their ballots because others had already voted for
them.

Several election officials were arrested and charged in court but were
eventually acquitted, said the PDP candidate who expressed concern that
vote-rigging was likely to be repeated here.

He said a shortage of PollWatch officials to man election booths could
cause problems. Worse still, he said some parties had refused to send
their representatives to monitor the ballot casting.

Planned port site a threat to sea-turtles: Pollution would limit chances of
survival

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

Kanittha Inchukul

A proposed site for a deep-sea port under the Southern Seaboard
Development Project in Phang-nga is a potential threat to the habitat of
endangered sea turtles.

Its proposed location at Ban Thap Lamu in Thai Muang district, about 20
kilometres north of Khao Lampee-Had Thai Muang Marine National Park, is
a well-known breeding-ground for sea turtles in the Andaman Sea.

The Southern Seaboard Committee chaired by Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa approved the idea last week and is to submit the proposal for
cabinet approval next week.

A recent report on a study by Ecolas, a Belgian consultancy, notes that
oil pollution from the deep-sea port and its activities coupled with
changes in coastal morphology would certainly threaten the survival of
this endangered species.

However, it said that the environmental impact would be lower than that
expected at the original site in Krabi. Based on this assessment, the
Southern Seaboard Committee decided to relocate the port to Phangnga.

Environmental officials agree that any negative impact on the sea turtle
population, if it occurs, would likely occur as a result of many
different activities at the port both during and after its construction,
especially oil spills from large tankers.

The high frequency of transportation would possibly disturb the migratory
route of the sea turtles heading to nest at the peaceful Thai Muang beach
in the national park.

Ecolas suggested that the Phra Thong Island in Ranong province could be
created into a new nesting ground for the migrating sea turtles. However,
environmental officials argued that turtles always lay their eggs on the
same grounds where they are born.

An average of 77 nests with 100 eggs of leatherback and olive ridley
turtles can be found on the current nesting ground each year but the
number is said to be declining, according to the record books of the
Phuket Marine Biological Centre.

Four different species of sea turtles found in Thai waters, apart from
eight other species found worldwide, include the green, hawkbill, olive
ridley and leatherback. The leatherback is found in the Andaman Sea but
not in the Gulf of Thailand.

Suraphol Sudara, a marine biologist from Chulalongkorn University is
disappointed with the decision. He said the Southern Seaboard Committee
has ignored the proposal to study other sites proposed by the Science,
Technology and Environment Ministry.

The ministry favours the site between Trang on the Andaman coast and
Songkhla or Pattani provinces on the east coast because the project will
not have a serious impact on the environment.

He said an impact assessment study carried out by Ecolas concentrates
only on the planned construction of the sea port in Phangnga.

Flags to be posted beside roads in 'dust-free zones': Trucks entering the
zones must cover up

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

Poona Antaseeda

Signboards and flags are to be posted along roads designated "dust-free
zones", a senior city official said yesterday. Deputy City Clerk
Kriangsak Lohachala said the move is an attempt to inform motorists of
the programme beguan in August with Sathorn as the first dust-free road.

A month later, each of 40 districts had designated at least one road as
part of the programme.

Trucks entering dust-free roads are required to cover what they are
transporting if it is construction materials or materials that may litter
the roads. Their wheels and bodies must be free of dirt.

Mr Kriangsak said the city's attempt to install the signs came after it
received complaints from people who said they had no way of knowing which
road has been designated dust-free.

It was one of the reasons why motorists unintentionally broke the rules,
he said.

He said the project had so far proved successful, although truck drivers
spurning the rules were still to be found.

Some drivers avoided police checkpoints by using other roads because they
knew the time and place where police usually set up their checkpoints,
Mr Kriangsak said.

The authorities have since suggested to the police that they periodically
change the time and location of their checkpoints or apply a random
system to deter violators.

An American was arrested yesterday on charges of having 350 grammes of
heroin in his possession.

Lee Roy Frank, 55, was stopped at Chiang Rai airport at about 12.30 p.m.
as he was about to board a flight to Bangkok.

Police allegedly found 350 grammes of heroin hidden in a compartment of
his luggage.

Mr Frank had travelled to Thailand 12 times and visited Chiang Rai twice
before his arrest.

Meanwhile, police held two suspected drug traffickers in a separate raid.

Police stopped to search a pick-up believed to have smuggled illicit
drugs on the Chiang Saen-Chiang Khong road.

Driver Wirat Chanthawan, 33, of Chiang Rai's Wiang Pa Pao district, and
Monkasem Chainit, 42, of Nakhon Pathom, were caught after police found
5,000 amphetamine pills and 70 grammes of marijuana hidden in the

New chief for Port Authority

Amornrat Mahitirook

Thavorn Chunnanond has been nominated as the new Port Authority of
Thailand director, replacing Anuparb Sunananta who is to be transferred
to an inactive post, a source in the PAT board said yesterday.

Mr Thavorn was the agency's deputy director before the nomination made
in a meeting on Thursday of the PAT board headed by Navy chief Adm Vichit
Chamnankarn, its new chairman.

The nomination will be forwarded for cabinet endorsement today.

The source said Mr Anuparb will be made a water transport specialist at
the Transport and Communications Ministry as recommended by Deputy
Minister Chaipak Siriwat who oversees the PAT.

Learning of the upcoming change, Mr Anuparb initially planned to quit PAT
on September 30, but changed his mind after Mr Chaipak urged him to leave
even earlier than that, the source said.

That was why the change had to be effected through the board last week,
the source said.

Mr Anuparb was the deputy secretary-general of the National Economic and
Social Development Board before his appointment to head the PAT in
January last year.

Camp to be cleared by November: About 600 boatpeople to face repatriation

Thailand plans to complete the repatriation of an estimated 600
Vietnamese boat people still at Sikhiu camp by mid-November, officials
said yesterday.

The remaining Vietnamese are to be sent back in groups at the rate of two
flights a week, they added.

Amid varying degrees of protest, Thai authorities have sent back a total
of 1,824 Vietnamese in 12 separate batches since the operation began on
July 1, after United Nations funding support ended.

A Vietnamese who was due to go back with the latest group on October 24
was rushed to hospital and narrowly escaped a suicide bid by swallowing
insecticide. Ninety-nine others made the journey back without him.

The Vietnamese, who have failed to be accepted for resettlement in third
countries, are being reintegrated into Vietnamese society with initial
support of US$240 each from the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees.

Car kills man tailing panicky jumbo

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

A man was killed while running after an elephant panicked by firecrackers
in Klong Toey late on Sunday night.

Butda Saendee was hit by a car outside Queen Sirikit Convention Centre
on Ratchadapisek Road as he ran after the elephant which the mahout could
not control.

Butda had been following the 30-year old elephant and mahout towards
Klong Toey when the animal ran in panic across the road.

Unaware a Mercedes Benz heading towards Klong Toey from Asoke-Sukhumvit
was approaching, he was run over and dragged 20m before the car came to
a halt.

The driver was charged with manslaughter.

Karen rebels to hold ceasefire talks with Slorc

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

Supamart Kasem

Tak

The anti-Rangoon Karen National Union is to enter into ceasefire talks
with the Rangoon junta on November 17, a source said yesterday.

Gen Bo Mya, the KNU president, took up Rangoon's offer after it was
discussed at a three-day meeting of 25 Karen executives at the Htee Ka
Per base, opposite Umphang.

The 25-member panel, chaired by Gen Bo Mya, assigned Lt-Gen Tamalabaw to
lead the talks with the State Law and Order Restoration Council.

It was agreed the KNU guerrillas will keep their arms and propose Slorc
withdraw its forces from around Karen-held areas.

If the parties reached a formal agreement, the KNU will ask the junta to
hold peace talks with all anti-Slorc minorities.

In the meantime, hostilities continue. Karens clashed with 100 troops of
Slorc's Battalion 257 near the border opposite Umphang last week.

Rangoon sent troops to guard a company prospecting for ore in the area
after it claimed to have received a protection demand.

Contract farming overhaul agreed: Current system puts farmers at great
risk

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

Chakrit Ridmontri

The government has agreed in principle to overhaul contract farming
whereby private firms will be required to share risks with farmers,
Agriculture Minister Suvit Khunkitti said yesterday.

Under the existing system firms submit their projects to the ministry,
and if approved, the Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives
(BAAC) extends soft loans to farmers.

This system puts farmers at a disadvantage because they are obliged to
buy all their production tools from the contracted firms. The firms in
turn buy the produce from them at a pre-determined price in the contract.
If, for whatever reasons, the quality of the produce does not meet the
contractual requirement the prices go down.

"The farmers have to be responsible for debts incurred in undertaking the
project while the private firms risk nothing, lose nothing," he said.

Many farmers are driven into bankruptcy as a result of the low quality
of seeds, fertiliser and equipment supplied by the firms.

The government-private sector coordinating committee for agriculture
development has suggested a cost-sharing system which would require
private firms to share risks with farmers.

"Under the new system private firms will provide the means of production
to the farmers who will repay the loans only after they have successfully
harvested the crops and sold the produce to the firms at pre-determined
prices," he said.

Under the current system farmers borrow money from the Bank of
Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, but in the revised system the
private firms will have to borrow money from BAAC or other commercial
banks at 5% interest and transfer the cash to farmers or provide them
with equipment and production material.

Besides, the firms will have to deposit cash with BAAC amounting to 10%
of the value of the produce. This money will be used to assist farmers
if they face crop failure, he added.

If the farmers fail to meet contractual obligations they will be dropped
from the programme and required to repay their debts at the normal
interest rate.

Conversely, if the firms break the contract farmers can file for
compensation.

Mr Suvit said the ministry will submit the proposal to the cabinet soon.

Private firms, meanwhile, were not happy with the revised scheme.

A representative of Panchaphol Pulp Industry Co Ltd, which specialises
in fast-growing trees, said the company has decided to withhold its
project in light of the new cost-sharing system.

The project, spanning five years, would require soft loans totalling over
1,600 million baht to grow trees in the central region.

"The existing system is good enough. Private companies have no intention
to manipulate farmers," he said.

Move to probe NHA deal

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

The Interior Ministry may order a probe into a land deal in which the
National Housing Authority (NHA) allegedly bought a 832-rai plot in
Pathum Thani province at highly inflated prices.

Deputy Interior Minister Sornchai Montriwat who oversees the NHA said
Interior Permanent Secretary Chuwongse Chayabutr will soon decide whether
the deal should be investigated.

The NHA signed a contract on October 4 to buy a 832-rai plot in Lam Luk
Ka district at the rate of 1.8 million baht a rai, which is double the
official rate of 900,000 baht per rai.

Maj Sornchai later put the deal on hold after complaints of
irregularities in the deal.

The previous NHA board, headed by Interior Permanent Secretary Aree
Wong-araya who retired at the end of last month, approved the purchase
and the subsequent contract was signed on the day the cabinet ordered
dissolution of the board.

A new board was appointed with Mr Chuwongse as its chairman.

Maj-Gen Sornchai said he is waiting to hear from NHA Governor Preedi
Buranasiri why the agency paid so high a price for the land.

Land scam probe being speeded up

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

The prosecution team handling the Phuket Sor Por Kor 4-01 cases is
working round-the-clock to conclude examination of police investigation
into the land scandal.

"Once the examination of police reports is completed we will immediately
proceed with the cases," said Supreme Attorney-General Kanit na Nakhon.

Mr Kanit has been criticised by Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa for
proceeding too slow with the cases despite being handed the police
reports six months ago.

Mr Kanit sent a letter to Mr Banharn last Friday assuring him that his
agency was going slow on the cases. A similar letter was sent to Prime
Minister's Office Minsiter Pokin Polakul yesterday.

Meanwhile Direk Sunthornket, the deputy supreme attorney-general who
heads the prosecution team, said only the cases involving three land
reform officials, including Seri Thongruen, were still to be examined.

A retired army officer was crushed to death in a lift at Phra Mongkut
hospital yesterday.

Sub-Lt Poonsin Thongyoo, 64, was killed instantly when the doors closed
as he was stepping out and the lift started moving up.

Six people had stepped out on to the second flood before Sub-Lt Poonsin,
whose head and chest stuck out of the doors.

The former officer, who had worked at the hospital, had just seen a

Import of costly medical tools needless: Researcher says local supplies
plentiful

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 05

Increasing quantities of expensive medical equipment are being imported
needlessly, according to the Health Systems Research Institute.

Thailand has plenty of equipment that is not being put to full use, said
Dr Viroj Tangcharoensathien, a researcher at the institute.

Tax exemptions on imports under the free trade policy should be reviewed,
he said, to avoid over-consumption and inefficient use of equipment.

Dr Viroj said the medical equipment market expands at 20 percent a year,
rising from six billion baht in 1984 to 7.2 billion baht in 1995.

While the United States is a free market economy, it controls technology
used in its 52 states and avoids unethical market promotion.

"To bring an extra CT scanner (computer x-ray) into California, a
hospital needs a certificate of need and must prove full use is made of
existing equipment," he said. "In this case, it means it is used in 2,500
cases."

America also limits the number of disease centres, for instance there is
only one heart disease centre per city. "We have sufficient expensive
modern technology but it is under-used and has very low productivity,"
said Dr Viroj.

"To maximise use, it should be distributed to the provinces. Much of it
is in private hospitals in Bangkok."

A survey in May 1995 found there were 205 CT scanners (each costing 10-20
million baht), 20 Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) computerised x-ray
machines (70-80 million baht), 37 extra corporeal shock wave lithotripter
(ESWL) used for stones of less than 3cm (8-39 million baht), 114 lasers
(cost varies) and 594 ultrasonograms (1-5 million baht).

The survey found that 59 CT scanners are used in public hospitals and 146
in private hospitals. Of those, 43 percent are in Bangkok.

MRIs: eight in public and 12 in private hospitals; 75 percent in Bangkok.
ESWLs: 19 in public and 18 in private hospitals; 38 percent in the
capital. Lasers: 36 in public and 66 in private hospitals; 88 percent in
Bangkok. Ultrasonograms: 259 in public and 309 in private hospitals; 36
percent in Bangkok.

Most of the equipment has a high health care cost impact on patients but
there have been no systematic evaluations of clinical outcome.

Dr Viroj said there is a probability of the needless application of
medical equipment, for which patients pick up the bill. The probability
of abuse involving ultrasonograms is high of lasers and MRI possible and
there is no definite information on CT scanner abuses.

Though there has been lesser abuse of ESWLs, they are only used on 50
percent of patients with stone disease.

Though most patients are from the lower income group, 38 percent have to
pay for treatment out of their own pockets. Since 30 percent come for
treatment when the stone is big -- more than 3cm -- they have operations
rather than ESWL treatment, he said.

Developed countries treat 80 percent of patients with ESWL because they
are treated when the stone is smaller than 3cm, he added.

New operation plan for city bus agency: Private sector to be assigned more
routes

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 05

Amornrat Mahitirook

The director of the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority, Arun Chirachavala,
has prepared an operational plan to help the debt-ridden bus agency
before announcing his resignation at the end of the month.

His resignation will follow the reshuffle of the BMTA board endorsed by
the cabinet earlier this month at the urging of Deputy Transport Minister
Chaipak Siriwat, who has been assigned to supervise the agency.

Mr Arun said the operational plan designed to be used in the next five
years will focus on improving three major areas of the bus agency so that
it can begin generating profit from 1998 onwards.

Under the first area of the plan, the BMTA will improve passenger bus
routes, the fare collection system, and bus conditions, and award more
routes to private operators.

Secondly, the agency will reduce the size of its own organisation by
reducing the number of its buses from 4,624 currently to 4,000 and cut
the number of staff from 23,346 currently to 17,573 within 2001.

The third area of the plan focuses on the BMTA's finances. The agency
will ask the government to subsidise the loss-ridden operation of
ordinary buses, the fares of which have been frozen in the public
interest.

The authority will also ask for approval to introduce a single fare rate
for air-conditioned buses.

The rate will be 12 baht per trip instead of the current one which ranges
from six to 16 baht depending on traveling distances.

The BMTA will also raise capital of 7,698.12 million baht to clear its
old losses.

If the plan is implemented, the agency will have a net profit of 447
million baht in 1998, Mr Arun said.

He described his operational plan as a "masterpiece".

BECL's guided bus project passes technical evaluation: Construction work
to begin next year

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 05

Supoj Wancharoen

The Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority (ETA) has passed the guided
bus project of the Bangkok Expressway Co Ltd (BECL) through its technical
evaluation.

ETA deputy governor Somchai Charukasemratana said an ETA sub-committee
selecting the guided bus operator met yesterday to consider the technical
aspects of the BECL's project, and agreed that the details complied with
the ETA's terms of reference.

The ETA will consider the financial proposal of the BECL next week and
expects that the construction of the system could start next year, he
said.

The BECL is the only contender vying for the contract of the project,
which will be built under the second-stage expressway system for a
distance of 16 kilometres from Chaeng Wattana to Victory Monument. The
firm is now operating the second-stage expressway.

Mr Somchai said the BECL proposed a guided bus system which could serve
5,000 passengers per hour per direction as the ETA required.

The firm also intended to use gas-fuelled buses from Germany with
diesel-fuelled buses as an option, he said.

The service proposed to charge 18 baht per trip, but the ETA would try
to cut it down, he said.

The ETA allows the guided bus operator to develop areas along the bus
route for commercial purposes, but the BECL has said that the areas are
not sufficient for commercial development.

The firm wants to develop the areas into parking lots for motorists to
leave their cars and catch guided buses, Mr Somchai said.

Arrest of saboteurs still to be verified: Army in touch with Malaysian
officials

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 05

The Army has been unable to verify a report that Pattani United
Liberation Organisation's military commander Haji Sama-ae Thanam and the
movement's three other leading members had been arrested by Malaysian
police with a large quantity of explosives, an Army source said.

According to the report Ma Pelis, the PULO secretary, Poh Sube, the
leader of its political wing, and Yama Sateng, chief of its sabotage
unit, were arrested along with Haji Sama-ae Thanam with a huge quantity
of C4 detonators while on their way from Kelentan to Kedah, some 40
kilometres south of Narathiwat's Su-ngai Kolok district.

Yama Sateng is believed to be the mastermind of the bomb blast at the Hat
Yai Railway Station early last year in which many people were killed and
wounded.

PULO is one of the Muslim separatist movements whose bandit groups
operate in southern border provinces.

The source said Army chief Gen Chestha Thanajaro had ordered military
intelligence units to check the report by coordinating with Malaysian
authorities. So far there had been no reply from Malaysia.

If the report is true, problems could arise in seeking their extradition
because it was still uncertain whether Haji Sama-ae held both Thai and
Malaysian nationalities, the source said.

The military is seeking confirmation of the arrests from the
Thai-Malaysian Coordination Office in Songkhla.

"The matter is a delicate one because it concerns political relations
between the two countries," the source said.

UN urged to oust regime

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 08

Asian advocates of democracy in Burma plan to call on the United Nations
to expel the country's military junta from the UN general assembly.

The UN should "take immediate steps to eject the Slorc [State Law and
Order Restoration Council] from the assembly on the grounds that the
Slorc is not the legitimate government of Burma", the activists said in
the draft of a declaration expected to be released tomorrow.

The "Alternative Asean Declaration on Burma" is being finalised at a
two-day meeting opening in Bangkok today that has drawn human rights
activists, trade unionists and academics within and outside Asean, as
well as members of Burma's pro-democracy movement.

An independent source noted that as the UN comprised sovereign states
only countries, not regimes, could be expelled from its assembly, which
meets yearly. Yugoslavia was the last UN member to be expelled from the
assembly, after South Africa.

The draft declaration also urges Asean to review its position on Burma,
saying Asean membership would provide the Slorc with a "de facto licence"
to continue its "attacks" on Burmese people.

Asean gave observer status to Burma in July, but remains undecided and
divided on when to integrate it into the organisation. The Slorc stepped
up pressure on pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters
after applying for full membership of the grouping in August.

The activists' draft declaration also calls on the international
community to ban promotion of the Slorc's Visit Myanmar Year "until the
human rights situation improves in that country".

Spearheaded by the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (Forum
Asia), the activists also plan to launch an "Alternative Asean Network"
to mobilise regional support for democracy in Burma.

EU on offensive in Asem talks: Saroj: Move seen as ploy to raise touchy
subjects

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 08

Nussara Sawatsawang

The European Union has proposed that the 25 Asian and European countries
involved in the Asia-Europe Meeting (Asem) engage in "comprehensive"
political discussions, a senior Thai official said yesterday.

Permanent secretary for foreign affairs Saroj Chavanaviraj did not reveal
details of the proposal put forward at an informal meeting of senior
officials in Japan last week.

But another official said the EU proposed that the Asem discuss United
Nations reform, nuclear proliferation, regional issues, as well as
unspecified "values".

Launched in Bangkok in March, Asem so far has touched on general
questions, but made no provision for concrete discussion of political
issues.

According to Mr Saroj, Asian participants reacted cautiously to the EU
proposal, which was seen as an "offensive" by Europeans to raise
controversial issues like human rights, democratisation, and labour
standards.

The meeting on October 24 brought together senior officials of the Asem
members, including the 15 members of the EU, and 10 Asian countries:
Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

"[The European Union] wants to launch an offensive in matters in which
there are still differences [between Asia and Europe]," Mr Saroj said.

"We [Asia and Europe] have our own [values]. They do not have to be the
same," he added.

Mr Saroj said political issues were already being discussed at other
forums, for instance the regular dialogue of foreign ministers of the EU
and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).

The Asian side agreed to study the European proposal and discuss it
further at the next meeting of Asem officials in Dublin in December,
before their foreign ministers meet in Singapore in February, Mr Saroj
said.

East Timor and Burma are two controversial issues where Asia and Europe
have distinctly different approaches.

The EU did not indicate the format for the political discussions, or the
level of the would-be participants, said the official who asked not to
be named.

The official went on to say that Thailand feels that the discussions
should be informal, pragmatic and flexible, as was the approach of the
first Asem meeting here.

At the same meeting, Japan showed interest in taking part in development
cooperation in Indochina, the official added.

And although Japan was not invited to a meeting in Malaysia in June which
discussed development of the sub-region, Malaysia pointed out that Japan
would "eventually" join the programme, Mr Saroj said.

Thailand and Japan will host separate meetings of Asem finance and
economic ministers in September next year. Stabilising the monetary
system is on the tentative agenda of the finance ministers' meeting in
Thailand.

Based on consensus reached at the recent Asia-Europe business forum in
France, the senior officials agreed to exchange information on
investment, and to finalise discussions on policy and regulations by the
end of this year, the official said.

Vietnam elephant killer jailed for 20 years

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 08

Hanoi -- A Vietnamese man who killed a domesticated elephant for its
tusks has been jailed for 20 years and ordered to pay more than US$10,000
(200,000 baht) in damages, a report said yesterday.

The Supreme People's Court in Danang jailed Ho Van An for 20 years and
also imprisoned three accomplices for between five and 10 years for
killing the elephant in the central highlands province of Daklak, the
Saigon Times Daily said.

Mr An, 60, had several previous convictions for killing elephants, which
are a protected species in Vietnam. Most are killed for their tusks and
skins which can fetch thousands of dollars.

FEATURE / PHILIPPINES: The slums make way for Apec

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 14

CECILIA QUIAMBAO

Manila

They live beneath bridges, on unused lots and soap boxes precariously
propped up by stilts on the banks of rivers and open sewers. They push
shoddy wooden carts on daily prowls through the metropolis, rooting at
garbage cans for food and scraps. Their only contact with the rest of the
city is when they rap at car windows to beg, hawk cigarettes by the stick
or snatch a purse or a wristwatch from pedestrians.

Now, as the Philippines steps on to the world stage with the coming out
party of its once-ailing economy, the great unwashed of the Philippine
capital are under siege as the government lays on a giant snow job to put
a silver lining to its imperfections.

Three people have been killed and several hundred others have so far been
injured, a rights monitor here says, as giant squatter colonies which
blight this city of eight million are torn down by government demolition
crews armed with crowbars and court orders ahead of the November 25
summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum.

President Fidel Ramos denies any connection between the slum campaign and
Apec, and last week controversially stopped the demolition of a colony
of 4,000 squatter shanties clogging a waterway in the central Manila
district of Paco.

Mr Ramos, who at that time had been holding a dialogue with a church
support group calling for an end to violent demolitions, said that "if
what happened is intentional, this is subverting the government".

The Department of Interior and Local Government said it has relocated
22,320 squatters so far to government-built relocation sites in the
nearby provinces of Bulacan and Cavite, and that about 300,000 remain to
be removed.

Some analysts say the latter figure is grossly understated.

Manila and its satellite cities and towns hold about 12 percent of the
population of 68 million, and a World Bank study shows a third of the
eight million residents do not hold a title or contract allowing them to
stay in their current abode.

The big numbers of these squatters are routinely blamed for causing
crime, flooding, pollution, disease and other ills which how afflict this
city. Last month, Health Department investigators traced the cause of a
cholera outbreak which killed five people to an illegal tap in the water
system, possibly contaminated by human faeces from a squatter colony
which had been stealing the water.

"There is a certain Hobbesian element that sets Manila apart," said
University of the Philippines political science professor Alex Magno.

He described Manila as a "cruel city" where "the air is bad, traffic is
terrible, sewage does not work, a third of the population live in slums,
housing is expensive".

The vice mayor of the city of Manila, Lito Atienza, said the Paco
squatters at the centre of the Apec flap had been notified to vacate the
area two years ago, with them "fully aware that they are occupying a
danger zone".

"With or without Apec, we are using our mandate which maintains the good
living conditions of our constituents," said Mr Atienza.

The congestion of Manila is blamed by the government on the lack of
employment opportunities in provincial areas. Most of the squatters
regularly run over by speeding trains are migrants from provinces south
of Manila which arrived by rail in search of jobs and proceeded to build
their shacks beside the tracks.

"One has to be glad that the Apec meeting has been scheduled here," said
Horacio Paredes, a cabinet member in the previous administration of
Corazon Aquino.

"If the holding of such a meeting clears the city of squatters, at least
along the roads and waterways that the rest of us need to maintain
resident-free for the metropolis to have some breathing space, then well
and good," he said.

"Imagine how much urine, human excrement and garbage those 4,000 families
dump into that canal daily," he said of the Paco squatters.

Some politicians say squatter colonies are coddled by some local
officials, who find in them a big reservoir of swing votes to keep them
in power in the next local election.

"Their presence there is symptomatic of the failure of government to
govern properly," said Mr Paredes.

Complicating the resettlement problem is a law that states that slum
abodes cannot be demolished unless a relocation site has been prepared
for the residents ahead of time. Critics say this gives the act of
squatting an attractive incentive.

The law does not cover those who obstruct roads and waterways and those
who live in zones that are considered dangerous to human habitation, such
as river banks or beside railroad tracks.

Opinion on the whole issue however is divided.

Manila Times newspaper concedes that while "the cost of keeping blighted
communities now exacts a toll on nearly everyone, from questions of
sanitation and health to matters of peace and order", it argued that
"there must be a more dignified way of cleaning up the metropolis other
than chasing people down with truncheons and water hoses".

Looking to the longer term, the government has initiated moves to try to
decongest the city. It is now granting tax incentives to companies which
set up industrial enclaves in other regions and to the factories which
set up there.

Many of the new industrial projects are now being set up in the so-called
Calabarzon growth area, comprising the provinces of Cavite, Laguna,
Batangas, Rizal and Quezon, south of Manila.

President Ramos has also created a government task force to study other
means of dispersing economic growth, which serves as a magnet for
migrants, to other regions.

Parties turn up the heat in the battle for Bangkok

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 14

BANYAT TASANEEYAVEJ

The heat is rising in the lead up to the election two weeks from now, and
the 37 seats in Bangkok will be the determining factor in whether Chuan
Leekpai or Chavalit Yongchaiyudh becomes the country's 22nd prime
minister.

As the centre of information with the largest educated population,
Bangkok has always acted as somewhat of a barometer in measuring the
political climate around the country.

And since the people of the capital are closest to the seat of power,
they follow the moves of politicians and their parties more closely than
their rural cousins and can be turned off or on by the slightest thing.
It is for this reason that no single party has ever been able to dominate
the city for any length of time before falling out of favour.

The Democrats once held the hearts and minds of city people in the years
when they fought the military dictatorship. Prachakorn Thai captured
nearly every seat in Bangkok in the mid-1970s when the country swung to
political right, and Palang Dharma swept aside all challengers in the
late 1980s and early 1990s when the public became fed up with corruption
and opted for a party promising them honesty.

The political wind seems to be blowing again in the Democrat Party's
favour for the November 17 election. The Democrats know their immediate
political future rests with taking the capital since they cannot hope to
beat New Aspiration in the Northeast where vote-buying is the determining
factor.

The Democrat team chosen to contest the city have been selected based on
their perceived ability to undertake the key issues of political reform
and economic management. Most members of the Democrats' so-called
economic dream team are running in Bangkok; Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda,
Supachai Panitchpakdi, Abhisit Vejjajiva and Savit Bhotiwihok.

Mr Chuan went to pains during his two-hour speech at the party rally at
Royal Plaza Saturday to excite the political consciences of city folk.
He told them his party won only seven seats in Bangkok in the last
election, while the other 30 were won by parties which threw their
support behind Banharn Silpa-archa.

History, he said, might repeat itself if the Democrat candidates are not
elected in great numbers.

Most of the Democrat seats last election came from the South, where the
party expects to win most of the 52 available seats this time. But the
largest number of seats, 137, are concentrated in the 17 provinces of the
Northeast, where Gen Chavalit's New Aspiration Party is expected to do
well since it has recruited the largest number of known politicians from
the region.

In the last general election, the NAP captured 36 seats in the Northeast,
Chart Thai 29, Chart Pattana 27 and the Social Action Party and Democrats
14 each.

With such a short campaign period, vote-buying is expected to be even
worse in the Northeast this year. This means Bangkok represents the only
hope for the Democrats in beating the NAP and returning Mr Chuan as prime
minister.

In the last general election in Bangkok, the Palang Dharma Party won 16
seats, Prachakorn Thai 12, the Democrats seven and Muan Chon two.

The other parties will be ganging up on the Democrats this time. Though
Palang Dharma is not an ally of either Prachakorn Thai or Muan Chon, it
will have to join in on the attack on the Democrats.

Both Prachakorn Thai and Palang Dharma have been attacking the Democrats
for raising the issue of Mr Banharn's and his father's nationality during
the no-confidence debate. The raising of the race issue by the Democrats
was not very well received by the ethnic Chinese community in Bangkok.

In the Thanam Ratchawong Chinese community for example, a large poster
declares: "We don't want politicians who look down on the ethnic origin
of fellow Thais."

The community is in Constituency 2, the former stronghold of the PDP
leader. Even though Thaksin Shinawatra is not running this time, party
candidate Orathai Kanchanachusak hopes to keep the three seats there
under the party's control.

The Democrats are fielding a strong team in the constituency made up of
former House Speaker Marut Bunnag, respected academic M.R. Sukhumbhand
Paribatra and dream team member Supachai Panitchpakdi. If all three can
win a seat, this would shatter the PDP's strongest base in the city.

Mr Chuan is now concentrating his efforts on helping party candidates
campaign in Bangkok using a two-pronged approach: Getting people to vote
for them and building fear among constituents of the possibility of Gen
Chavalit becoming premier.

Dateline Bangkok: Race debate is unhealthy

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15

Destructive criticism seems to be the theme of most campaigns launched
by political parties contesting the coming election. Instead of talking
about the policies of their parties, candidates tend to engage in
mud-slinging that could create political conflict and division among the
people.

In the July 2 general election last year, the Prachakorn Thai and Palang
Dharma parties, the two major political rivals in Bangkok, lost much of
their popularity among voters.

Palang Dharma, in particular, came under much public criticism because
of dramatic changes in its political role and conduct. Both Palang Dharma
and Prachakorn Thai are Bangkok-based parties. They have shown no
interest in expanding party branches outside the capital to make
themselves a truly mass party.

In the September 13, 1992 general election, Palang Dharma lost many of
its seats while Prachakorn Thai won only two seats in Bangkok. The
Democrat Party made considerable gains. In last year's election in
Bangkok, both Palang Dharma and the Democrats suffered a setback, while
Prachakorn Thai made considerable gains. Palang Dharma and Prachakorn
Thai, however, were invited to join the Banharn Government.

The first no-confidence debate in May this year led to a Cabinet
reshuffle. Both Palang Dharma and Prachakorn Thai resigned and then
rejoined the Government in a manner that caused much confusion among the
public. The Democrats, meanwhile, managed to regain its popularity by
explaining its handling of the Sor Por Kor 4-01 land programme to the
public.

Palang Dharma leader Thaksin Shinawatra and his predecessor Chamlong
Srimuang are not contesting the coming election. As the election campaign
hots up in Bangkok, Palang Dharma and Prachakorn Thai are apparently
joining hands to attack the Democrats. Political friendship is a good
thing, but both parties should not bring up the issue of racial prejudice
because it could cause disunity in the country.

Bangkok Post Postbag: Changes at council part of a re-focus

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15

There has been some speculation in your letters column about the British
Council, and I would like to take this opportunity to respond to the
various queries regarding its function, its library and information
service, art gallery, educational counselling service and English
language centre.

The British Council is Britain's principal agency for cultural relations
with other countries and its work in these countries is supported by a
grant from the British Government. It actively promotes educational,
cultural and technical cooperation between Britain and the rest of the
world. In each country the British Council adapts its services to meet
the particular needs of that country.

Consequently the services offered in India, Malaysia, Japan or Singapore
will differ from those offered in Thailand. In Thailand, the British
Council through its offices in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, offers a wide
range of services. First of all, it provides access to information about
contemporary Britain. Furthermore, it initiates and develops projects
between British and Thai government, educational and non-government
organisations, particularly in the fields of English language teaching,
education, science and engineering, health, the environment, governance
and the law, and the arts. In these areas it has a particular track
record of promoting long-term partnerships between British and Thai
universities and other education institutions.

The British Council Library in Bangkok makes available English language
teaching materials (including audio-visual and multimedia programmes) to
all its library members. When the British Council moved to its new
location at 254 Chulalongkorn Soi 64 on the edge of the Chulalongkorn
campus in Siam Square, it decided to use the opportunity to re-focus its
library and information services so as to respond more effectively to the
demands of the majority of its members.

Based on research and data collected from its members' borrowing habits,
it decided to extend those areas where demand was greatest and also
update its technology to provide a more efficient service. Some areas and
books which were less well used were removed. In addition to information
about all aspects of Britain, the British Council library now offers its
members a comprehensive collection of materials on English language
teaching and study, a selection of British newspapers and periodicals as
well as British films, documentaries and popular television programmes
on video and a collection of modern British fiction.

For the use of library members, government and educational institutions
seeking information on the United Kingdom, a reference section with books
and CD ROM is also available. We are continually adding to this material,
but information not immediately available can be obtained from the
British Library in the UK. The opening hours of the library have also
been extended and we are now open six days a week.

The British Council library was never intended as a general library and
reading room, but as a gateway to information on contemporary Britain.
To make space for the specialist areas that have been in heavy demand
from the Thai public, educational institutions and other users of our
services, we either donated the excess books to Thai educational
institutions or sold them to our library users for a small consideration.

If some residents in Bangkok missed the sale that was held in the library
premises over several months, I am sorry that they lost the occasion to
acquire some excellent books. I can only advise them to turn up for the
annual Ploenchit Fair on Nov 23 at the British Embassy when the British
Council will again be running the second hand book stall (if any Bangkok
Post readers have unwanted books in reasonable condition we would be
pleased to take them off your hands -- the proceeds all go to charity).

The British Council continues to have art exhibitions on its premises,
there have been two since we moved. In addition to the forthcoming
exhibition of "Thailand Drawings" by Justin Knowles (Nov 4-23), whose
work was recently acquired by the Tate Gallery in London, and another
exhibition of prints based on nursery rhymes by Paula Rego (Nov 24-Dec
20), we have acquired from the British Council Collection in London
several works by British artists and sculptors for permanent display.

As in a number of our offices around the world, the British Council in
Thailand offers individual and group counselling and information to all
those interested in study and training in Britain. This service is
offered free of charge by our specially-trained Educational Counselling
Service (ECS) staff who guide applicants through the process of choosing
a course at British educational or training institutions to best suit
their particular needs. They can advise them on how to apply for that
course and even provide a follow-up service if required.

The ECS also holds a broad range of reference materials, as well as
prospectuses, CD ROM databases and videos from schools, institutes and
universities. They also provide detailed information on fees, and
scholastic and English language requirements for entrance to secondary,
graduate and post-graduate courses in the UK. In addition, the British
Council will be holding its 10th annual British Education Exhibition at
Imperial Queen's Park Hotel in Bangkok from Nov 22-24, where interested
candidates can meet with representatives from about 100 British schools,
colleges and universities.

The ECS office is located in the main entrance hall of the new British
Council premises in Siam Square and we are sorry that the two visitors
to our office who wrote to your newspaper failed to notice it. The ECS
is now also available in Chiang Mai and the British Education Exhibition
will this year, for the first time, also visit Chiang Mai (Nov 28-29) at
Lotus Hotel, Pang Suan Kaew.

The English Language Centres of the British Council across the world
believe in setting high standards in English language teaching. This
applies to the range of courses we offer in Siam Square where we cater
for beginner, intermediate and advanced levels of study, for younger and
mature learners and as well as to our other teaching operations in Chiang
Mai and New Phetchaburi Road. We therefore recruit well-qualified and
experienced native-speakers of English as teachers. They use up-to-date
materials and facilities matched to the needs of the class and in Siam
Square have available a CALL (Computer Assisted Language Learning) Room
equipped with purpose-designed CD ROM materials.

I hope this letter will satisfy the queries of your letter writers. Our
records indicate that none of your correspondents on this issue are
currently members of the library. However, my colleagues and I are ready
to answer any queries and complaints, and would encourage those with
concerns to discuss them directly with us so we can improve our services
to library members, centre students and other users of the British
Council.

Bangkok Post Postbag: Not every Aussie has racist views

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15

I refer to the recent coverage of the racism debate in Australia. It
concerns me greatly that your readers are getting an impression of
Australia as a racially intolerant society simply because of remarks made
by an ignorant minority. I would like to put the debate into perspective.

Australia is a democracy and the second largest multicultural nation in
the world. As such, it represents a wide variety of different cultures
and views. Recently, a very small minority of elected representatives
have made racially based remarks which the majority of Australians reject
and despise. The fact that nine out of 10 members of Port Lincoln Council
resigned because of the racist remarks of its mayor illustrates this
point clearly.

Racism exists everywhere. As a Caucasian, I have also been the subject
of racism during my travels in Asia, but I do not see everyone in Asia
as racist because of an ignorant few.

We must all fight against racism. The fight is happening in Australia
now.

Australians are proud of their rich multicultural heritage and their
position in Asia. Never doubt that.

Bangkok Post Postbag: Ticky-tackyness of US politics

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15

I was watching the American vice presidential debate recently on Channel
7 and I noticed the similarity between Al Gore and a young Ronald Reagan.
The way Al Gore held his head and looked into the camera reminded me of
how our Ron used to look.

Is Al a secret member of Ron's family or is it a prerequisite for
American politicians to come from the same mould?

It all reminds me of that old song, "Little Boxes", where the chorus
goes: "And they are all made of ticky tacky and they all look just the
same".

Commentary by Paisal Sricharatchanya: Station outside Mater Dei should go

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15

In the weeks and months after the second school semester reopens this
Friday, Bangkok will witness a new struggle of an extraordinary kind.

After a year of quiet and unsuccessful negotiations with the various
parties concerned, the prestigious, all-girl Mater Dei School on
Ploenchit Road will begin mounting a public campaign to get rid of a
planned electric train station right outside its front door that -- if
built -- will almost definitely worsen the children's quality of life and
pose serious hazards to their health and safety.

The campaign is at the centre of what looks like a grossly uneven match.
A well-behaved and deferential Catholic school is finally forced to stand
tall to fight against the financially-powerful and politically
well-connected BTSC, the concessionaire of Bangkok's elevated electric
train project.

But the solidarity movement that has taken shape among the almost 2,000
students, their parents and teachers plus alumnae is determined to fight
to the very end.

The high point of a comprehensive package of campaign strategies calls
for a petition to His Majesty the King, who spent part of his childhood
at this very school. The petition, however, will be a last resort if and
after all else fails.

This is not simply a fight between the school and BTSC. At stake is the
vital question of whether innocent children who will graduate to become
the country's precious human resources should fall victim to greedy and
irresponsible Big Business.

What is also pertinent to this campaign is another crucial question of
whether greater transparency and accountability should be instilled into
the national decision-making process of granting concessions to
large-scale public projects bearing a direct impact on the environment
and citizens' rights.

In the apparent haste with which the electric-train project was approved
during the tenure of former Bangkok Governor Chamlong Srimuang,
fundamental requirements such as a proper environmental impact assessment
study have either been glossed over or imperfectly fulfilled.

Given the fact that construction of the entire project is going ahead at
full steam, it appears there's no turning back in spite of its known and
unknown shortcomings.

But the ghastly structure that is planned to become one of the main
stations right in front of Mater Dei should be shifted elsewhere. And if
shifting it to another adjacent location is not possible, the station
should be scrapped.

Siting a large and crowded train station at the doorstep of an all-girl
school smacks of extreme irresponsibility on the part of the project
managers. The high-pitch noise and polluting particles resulting from
trains arriving at and departing from the station every two minutes will
pose appalling health hazards to the school children. This is not to
mention other threats to their safety.

Alternatively, scrapping of the Mater Dei station should cause little
financial damage to the project operator -- if finances are their main
concern -- since passengers travelling on the route can still be
adequately served by two not-too-distant stations: one in front of the
Mahathun Building and the other just around the corner near the Regent
Hotel.

A dangerous precedent will be set where innocent students at other
educational institutions may also be victimised in the future if this
serious blunder is allowed to go ahead.

All the phu yais at BTSC and Bangkok Metropolitan Administration will do
a great service not only to the Mater Dei students but also the public
at large if they demonstrate the sort of moral conscience and social
responsibility expected of them by ordering the relocation or scrapping
of the planned station.

Sakchay takes on sport's top job

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 16

Suchin Chirakul

In a surprise decision, Dr Sakchay Tapsuwan was yesterday appointed
Governor of the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT), taking over from Dr
Somchai Prasertsiriphant who resigned suddenly last week.

Long serving deputy governor Dr Charoenthat Jinthanaseri had been tipped
to take over the post.

Minister of the Prime Minister's Office Pongpol Adireksarn, who is the
SAT president, announced that the SAT committee endorsed Dr Sakchay to
be governor for the next four years.

The meeting acknowledged the resignation of Dr Somchai, who was governor
for six years and who many thought would stay on much longer until his
retirement.

Although Dr Somchai officially retired to give someone else a chance at
the job, it is generally believed major internal conflicts were the real
reason for his resignation.

Late last year he had been sacked as director of the organising committee
of the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok and there had been some questions
about his administrative ability.

However, Dr Somchai, who has worked for Thai sport for 28 years, is not
totally out of the picture and has been named special councillor where
he will still have a say in decision making.

Dr Sakchay is also vice-president of the International Amateur Boxing
Association and secretary of the Amateur Boxing Association of Thailand.
He is closely involved with the 13th Asian Games.

The new governor is regarded as a good administrator and diplomat, which
is essential for organising big tournaments.

With Dr Somchai's resignation the governorship has now become a four-year
post, but one that can be renewed for two more years.

SAT also announced yesterday its budget for next year would be over 4
million baht, most of which would be used for the Asian Games.

Somprasong chairman faces fraud charges: Prasong evades warrant, employees
try to block search

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01 (Business Section)

Krissana Parnsoonthorn and Busrin Treerapongpichit

Police are hunting for leading property developer Prasong Panitpakdee on
charges of doctoring financial statements, falsifying his company's
reports and destroying evidence.

There were rumours yesterday that Mr Prasong, chairman and managing
director of troubled Somprasong Land Plc, had fled the country. However,
police believe he is still in Thailand.

An arrest warrant was issued after Economic Crime Investigation Division
police received complaints from a group of Somprasong shareholders. A
preliminary investigation found grounds to believe that Mr Prasong was
responsible for wrongdoing.

A search warrant was also issued for the Somprasong headquarters in the
Klong Sarn area of Thon Buri.

Economic Crime Investigation officers arrived at the building at 10 a.m.
but company employees wouldn't let them in. They relented after police
showed them the search warrant -- and threatened to arrest them if they
resisted.

The employees continued to make the officers' job difficult by refusing
to give them keys to certain rooms. Police had to call a locksmith to
open the rooms, which they found filled with destroyed documents and
piles of others awaiting destruction.

Officers also forced open an out-of-service elevator and found it filled
with destroyed documents.

Police said they believed Mr Prasong knew in advance that they were
preparing to move in on him, and that he ordered his employees to start
destroying documents at 3 a.m. yesterday.

Investigators collected documents hat had not been destroyed but a
Somprasong lawyer would not allow them to take the documents out of the
building.

The Economic Crime Investigation officers called local police at Samrae
Police Station for help. They had called Somdej Chaophraya Station
earlier, but were told that Somprasong executives had asked a senior
officer to refuse the station's help to the Economic Crime police.

Reinforced by local police, the economic police eventually took the
documents to Samrae Station.

Police said Mr Prasong is likely to face additional charges of share
manipulation. Officers said they found many share certificates and some
evidence that Mr Prasong may have been involved in manipulating the
prices of certain stocks.

According to the complaints lodged by company shareholders, Somprasong
had falsified its earnings from several property projects in reports to
the Stock Exchange of Thailand. This misled investors to believe that the
company's performance was favourable, they complained.

News could spark realty share selloff: Somprasong lenders can also expect
investor scrutiny

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01 (Business Section)

Cholada Ingsrisawang and Busakorn Pothasuthon

News that leading executives from Somprasong Land are under police
investigation is expected to hurt the entire realty sector, with worried
investors looking to sell property stocks.

That said, although the preliminary news about Somprasong was broken by
local newspapers yesterday, the company's stock price closed at 8.40
baht, up 0.30 baht, with stocks worth 11.23 million baht.

Industry analysts said financial firms acting as creditors for Somprasong
would also be hurt by the news even though most had plans in place to
deal with financial troubles of their clients in the reality sector.

The creditors all reported having sufficient collateral from the troubled
firm, though the auction of land used as collateral might not be enough
to recover the total loans under slow market conditions.

The analysts said Somprasong Land had been hurt by long-running rumours
that it was struggling, with rumour-mongers possibly trying to depress
the price of the company's stock so that they could eventually take over
the struggling firm at the cheapest price possible.

Banterng Tantivit, the chairman of National Finance & Securities Plc,
Somprasong Land's major creditor, said yesterday that his firm would not
be hurt by the news because it had sufficient collateral to back up its
loans to the firm.

Siam City Bank president Som Jatusipitak said his bank had extended about
100 million baht to the Somprasong Group, but the collateral placed
against the loan did not meet the loan's worth.

Dr Som said other banks had also loaned money to the group on collateral
of less than the value of the loans.

He explained that the problem had arisen because at the time the loan
contracts were made, the property sector was booming with Somprasong Land
leading the way.

Meanwhile, Stock Exchange of Thailand president Singh Tangtatsawas said
the SET would study the case and decide whether the current problems were
simply personal in nature.

"If it is a personal issue, then the SET will not suspend Somprasong
Land's stock from trading," Mr Singh said.

Promotion zones in Northeast proceed

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01 (Business Section)

The Board of Investment says it will go ahead with a plan to develop a
special promotion zone in 12 northeastern provinces.

The board said the area was appropriate after calls to establish a
similar zone to the five southernmost provinces.

BoI Deputy Secretary General Chakkramol Pasukvanich said 12 northeastern
provinces were selected for the plan because they were the poorest, with
an average per capita income under the gross national product (GNP).

The income of people in the five southernmost provinces was above GNP and
infrastructure system was better.

BoI feared that to heed private sector calls would create a precedent
which would allow other provinces to also set up a similar zone.

According to World Trade Organisation regulations, average income must
be lower than GNP when offering special privileges to avoid excessive
export advantages over other countries.

Mr Chakkramol said the northeastern plan will be submitted to Cabinet
after the new government is formed, regardless of which political party
is the coalition core.

New tool in money market: Central bank plans more active role in managing
liquidity

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01 (Business Section)

The Bank of Thailand expects to introduce a new tool by the end of the
year to help it manage the money market more effectively.

Known as open market operation, the system will make the central bank an
active player in the money market through bond trading with local
financial institutions selected as direct dealers..

Central bankers say the system will allow them to allocate liquidity
better and minimise liquidity fluctuation.

The Bank of Thailand currently manages money market liquidity through the
bond repurchase market, meaning it must wait for financial firms' call
to buy or sell bonds with a repurchase agreement.

Once the system is in place, the central bank will be able to adjust
liquidity in the market right away by calling its primary dealers.

Those dealers must have a good liquidity management and be able to quote
the bidding and offering rate of their bonds instantly, so the central
bank can inject liquidity into the market by purchasing bonds and absorb
it by selling them.

"Under the new method, the Bank of Thailand will be able to manage
liquidity more efficiently. The method will create confidence in the
market in times when there might be abrupt impact on the market's
liquidity.

"In a way, the central bank will provide direction and avoid the
fluctuation of local interest rates," said Paiboon Kittisrikangwan, chief
analyst in the central bank's banking department.

He ruled out suggestions by some analysts that the bonds circulating in
the system were insufficient for the operation.

Mr Paiboon said private bonds circulating in the banking sector were
worth about 300 billion baht, with state-enterprise bonds worth 250
billion, Bank of Thailand bonds 19 billion baht and Government bonds 22
million baht.

"The amount is enough for the central bank to intervene in the money
market and guide its monetary policy," he said, adding that this system,
together with the central bank's moves to adjust the mechanisms for
quoting interest in the bond repurchase market, would force financial
firms to adjust their liquidity more effectively.

The central bank will trade only bonds with one-month-up maturity,
resulting in market managed liquidity in the longer term.

In the first stage, the central bank expects to choose 15-20 finance
firms as its dealers. Those dealers must be able to trade bonds worth 10
billion baht with the central bank.

A letter has already been sent to all local financial firms inviting them
to apply for the available positions.

Dealers working with the central bank to manage liquidity will benefit
by being allowed to trade bonds after the operational time of the bond
repurchase market.

GM to take over Opel distribution

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

General Motors will take over the distribution of Opel vehicles in
Thailand from its local distributor Phra Nakorn Automobile Ltd (PNA),
starting on January 1.

However PNA, which has distributed Opels since 1991, "is expected to
continue to play a leading role in marketing Opel products here", the US
automaker said in a statement.

General Motors Thailand will have full responsibility for the import,
distribution, sales, marketing and after-sales of the European car brand.

"The change in our distribution strategy is confirmation of our
commitment to grow the GM business in Thailand," GM Thailand president
Ronald Frizzell said.

Citibank has introduced an unsecured revolving-credit account designed
to replace cash with other flexible options.

They include cheques designed for young executives who want liquidity in
the form of a revolving cash fund or capital reserve for operating a
business or other purpose.

A high credit limit allows customers access to funds in an emergency of
up to 3.5 times their monthly income, up to 350,000 baht. No collateral
guarantors are required and the service is not limited to existing
customers, Citibank said in a statement.

Emirates Airlines suspends VN flight

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Emirates Airlines has decided to suspend its twice-weekly flights from
Dubai to Ho Chi Minh City, starting on December 1.

The service, introduced one year ago, was not viable because Vietnamese
authorities would not allow the airline to carry passengers beyond
Vietnam, the Dubai-based carrier said in a statement.

The airline has been operating services to Singapore and other points via
Bangkok, but was never granted rights to take passengers between Ho Chi
Minh City and Singapore or Bangkok.

In a bid to recover more of their loans to the financially-ailing

sales.

National Finance & Securities Plc and Kiatnakin Finance & Securities Plc
jointly extended loans to Vidhyakom, which gave stocks of subsidiary
Pacific Asset Plc as collateral.

Both National Finance and Kiatnakin Finance plan to sell off another 20%
of the Pacific Asset stock.

National Finance, through subsidiary Supannika Co, last week sold off a
10% stake in Pacific Asset worth 146 million baht. However, Vidhyakom
still has outstanding loans with National Finance worth 30 million baht.

Interbank rate climbs slightly

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

The tight money market and the pending US presidential election are
influencing interbank rates.

Last week the interbank rate was quoted around 12%. It was climbing
slightly up investors bought US dollars and sold other currencies.

One analyst, who declined to be named, said the greenback was
appreciating with the approach of the presidential election and would
slip back to a normal level after the poll. The exchange rate yesterday
was about 25.52 baht, while the mid-rate quoted last week was 25.48 baht.

As a result, the retail rate is close to 26 baht if commissions and other
costs are included.

Customs tell traders to get competitive: Tax subsidies can come later

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

The Customs Department has signalled a warning to exporters, urging them
to sharpen their competitive edge before Government tax subsidies are
waived on exports.

A customs source said the tax subsidy was introduced to promote exports.

Under the subsidy system, the Customs Department would calculate a
subsidy rate for exporters, which it prefers to call compensation.

The source said compensation meant exporters would be exempted from
paying import duties on raw materials used for export-oriented
production, and freed from paying value-added tax. Exporters would also
get tax reprieves on the export of some machinery and fuel.

Compensation rates now range between 0.17-8% of the export value, down
from the previous 11%.

The source said the car industry benefits most with a reprieve of 8%.

But the source said exporters will have to prepare themselves by
sharpening their competitive edge to cope with international competition
when the government help stops.

He said the Government could no longer shoulder the tax burden.

An agreement of the World Trade Organisation also says the compensation
will have to be waived to create fairer competition, the source said.

But Customs Department director-general Supachai Panitchpakdi said
Thailand has to retain compensation to stimulate foreign investment.

But he said the measure might later be reviewed.

He said compensation has caused worries among department officials
because it opens the way for unscrupulous people to claim false tax
export figures to claim tax rebates.

Beginning in January next year, the department would counter false export
tax claims by introducing an accounting system to control tax claims for
imported raw materials.

He said it would not be compulsory for exporters to participate in the
new system, but he would like them to take part and capitalise on its
benefits.

An accounting system would facilitate exporters, therefore the department
would not pressure exporters to participate, he said.

Tripods cut exploration costs: Platforms first to be designed locally

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Unocal Thailand is introducing new locally-designed platforms for its
extensive gas production in the Gulf of Thailand.

The new platforms will help the US gas prospector to cut the overall cost
of developing gas reserves in the Gulf of Thailand.

Fabrication of the first two fully automated tripod (three-pile)
well-head platforms is near completion and installation of those
structures in Funan and Pladang fields is planned for early next year.

These tripod platforms, the first to be designed and installed in
Thailand, offer substantial savings on fabrication costs over traditional
four-pile platforms. Unocal's offshore wellhead platforms, currently
totalling 60, have traditionally been of the four-pile type.

Unocal's tripod platform is more compact than a four-pile one. It
requires 755 tons less steel, is insensitive to water depth, and is fully
automated. Most importantly, it is as safe and strong as the conventional
type, and can support the same number of drilled wells.

Unocal Thailand president Brian Marcotte said the new concept formed part
of Unocal's attempt to reduce the overall cost of developing gas reserves
in the Gulf.

"Tripod platforms will have a significant impact on how Unocal operates
its fields in the Gulf and elsewhere around the world. They are the
platforms of our future," the American executive said.

A multi-disciplinary team of Thailand-based technical professionals,
including geologists and engineers, came up with a design to suit the
actual geological conditions and drilling experience in the Gulf of
Thailand. From engineering design to completion, the team took less than
a year.

Drilling of gas wells will be carried out by a jackup rig, which will be
able to move between development well and delineation well activities as
needed, thus eliminating the need to use two different rig types.

The company recently sailed away its last four-pile platform from Thai
Nippon Steel's fabrication yard in Samut Prakan. Thai Nippon Steel has
built most of Unocal's platforms to date. It is also the fabrication
contractor for the tripod platforms.

Operating for co-concessionaires Mitsui Oil Exploration and PTT
Exploration & Production (PTTEP), Unocal has been producing natural gas
from fields in the Gulf of Thailand since 1981.

Unocal gas production from fields in the Gulf in the first nine months
of this year came to an average of 735 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd)
and 26,482 barrels per day (b/d) of condensate.

Industry aims to top Malaysia: Call for leaders who can see potential

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Kornrarath Silsmith

The Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) and the Industrial Finance
Corporation of Thailand (IFCT) are convinced Thailand's electrical
appliances and electronics sectors can overtake those of Malaysia to be
ranked top in the region.

This is possible if the new government has good vision, they said.

Sompong Nakornsri, president of FTI's electrical and electronics group,
told an Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand seminar of the
potential in Thailand's electrical and electronics industry.

Thai industrialists can produce electrical appliances and electronics
themselves because they have cheap labour, raw materials and good
supporting industries.

Thailand can also develop technology itself and improve products to be
in line with worldwide standards. As a developing country, the local
market has a high demand for these products, which could also be
exported.

But Thailand has before lacked leaders with a long-ranging and clear
vision, which meant the industries were not well developed.

High technology electrical products such as electrical fans, motors,
adaptors and compressors are better than those produced in Malaysia.

To help Thailand occupy the top rank in the production of electrical and
electronics goods within the next decade, the new government should have
five-, 10-and 15-year plans to promote investor confidence.

The tax structure and details of the Customs Department should be
improved. The government should also act urgently when imported goods are
dumped and when import tariffs are raised by trading partners.

Taxes for raw materials are higher than those for finished goods. For
example for the optic-fibre industry, plastic pellets are taxed at 30%,
but finished imports are taxed at 5%.

"Thailand is the only country that imposes a tax for unprocessed
materials at a higher rate than for finished products. The procedures of
the Customs Department is more confusing and slower than those in
Malaysia which permits the imported and exported goods to pass the
Customs Department within 24 hours without any difficulties over
documentation," said Mr Sompong.

Sirikul Jongtanasarsombat, assistant vice-president of the IFCT, said
Thailand needed more engineers. Thai education did not produce workers
with appropriate skills for the jobs at hand. There was also a lack of
markets, market information, export testing centres and money needed as
capital by small firms.

Housing projects likely to increase Supalai profit

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Real estate firm Supalai Plc expects 40% growth in sales to more top two
billion baht this year, mainly through three housing projects.

The new projects are Supalai Grand Park at Bang Na-Trat Road, Supalai
Orchid Park 3 and Supalai Ville at Thon Buri-Pakthor Road.

"Encouraged by these projects, Supalai's sales volume this year is
expected to reach 2.65 billion baht, up 42% compared to last year's
result of only 1.9 billion baht," said president Prateep Tangmatitham.

Sales from January to September recorded 42% growth to 2.1 billion baht
over the same period last year.

Mr Prateep said Supalai's 15 projects will earn the company more than
12.6 billion baht in 1997. Under other development schemes, Supalai has
formed a joint venture with local investors in Khon Kaen and Hat Yai to
develop real estate, which it expects to earn more than 1.3 billion baht
in 1997.

The company is trying to bring its liability ratio to lower than 2.5:1
in 1997, and to below 2:1 in the next 2-3 years. To stabilise its
financial structure, Supalai requires revenue from customers as a source
of investment.

Downpayments from its 15 projects are expected to represent cash of about
500 million baht, with the last ownership transfer from 13 projects
accounting for another 1.8 billion baht cash.

Supalai has appointed Siam Commercial Bank and SCB Advisory Co to be
financial adviser and underwriter for the local issue of financial
instruments worth one billion baht.

The move is part of an effort to refinance existing debt and to cover its
additional investment fund, said Mr Prateep.

Environmental services exhibition set for June

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Phusadee Arunmart

Lyon, France

Thailand's largest environmental technology exhibition is scheduled for
June.

Organised by the Thai government and Blenheim Thai Exhibition Co, a
subsidiary of the London-based Blenheim Group, the Entech-Pollutec Asia
'97 show will be held on June 26-29 at the Queen Sirikit National
Convention Centre.

The exhibit will be very similar to Pollutec '96, the twelfth
international exhibition of environmental equipment, technologies, and
services, held in Lyon, France, last week. That exhibition attracted
1,700 exhibitors from 24 countries.

Blenheim Thai Exhibition managing director Steven Seet said the company
decided to host a similar exhibition in Thailand because the country is
a hub within the rapidly-growing Asean group.

"New industrial plants, infrastructure, and property development are
taking place throughout the region. Environmental protection must be
built into those developments now rather than added later," Mr Seet
explained.

He said there were substantial opportunities in Thailand for companies
marketing environmental protection products because the country is in the
midst of adopting the ISO 14000 standard. To receive that standard,
industries must produce their products in a way that is environmentally
friendly.

Thailand relies greatly on the technology and expertise of foreign firms
for its waste-water treatment, air filtering, solid waste disposal, and
hazardous-waste management needs.

terms of market share, has continued its reorganisation with the
appointment of a Thai to a key executive post.

The US oil company said the appointment of Pornchai Sripraphai, who will

He obtained a Master's degree in general administration and a doctor al
degree in administration and sociology research from Miami University in
Ohio state.

An expert in education and research, he was employed as a senior
researcher at the University of Saarland in Germany for 14 years before
joining Robinson Department Store for four years.

COTL has one other Thai director, Mr Suvit Senavatin, who is responsi ble

Call to rethink ETO monopoly: Transport agency's role at port branded
parasitic

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

Wichit Sirithaveeporn

The Express Transport Organisation's monopoly at Bangkok Port needs
reconsideration by the cabinet, according to the Economic Stability and
Security Policy Committee.

It will put the issue to the cabinet, opposing the Transport and
Communications Ministry's endorsement of the ETO's monopoly for another
two years when the contract comes up for renewal in December.

Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan, a member of the committee, said the
cabinet had full authority to review the ministry's decision because the
ETO was under government control.

"The issue is one of revision. The committee earlier made a strong
commitment that the organisation's monopoly at Bangkok Port would not be
extended. The ministry's endorsement was given without the committee's
consent," Dr Amnuay said.

Currently, the ETO is said to account for only 25% of total trucking
transport services at the port, with 75% belonging to its
sub-contractors.

Dr Amnuay described the ETO's action as that of a parasite waiting to
suck blood from its fellow Thais, particularly exporters.

Liberalisation of the transport industry was the best way to prevent
this, he added. "It doesn't mean the government will stop the
organisation's requirement to continue its business. But the government
needs to create more open competition among operators in the field."

The ETO's board had previously agreed transport services at the port
should be opened to competition because of pressure from customers and
other truckers.

But the liberalisation plan has been delayed, with Deputy Transport and
Communications Minister Chaipak Siriwat championing efforts for the ETO
to continue its port services that provide 87.5% of its annual income
currently totalling one billion baht.

The port's long-term plan envisages ending the ETO's privileges and
encouraging more truckers to offer their services and end bribery and
other corruption allegedly fuelled by the monopoly.

Mr Chaipak's policy aims not only for the ETO's monopoly to remain, but
for it to directly handle 50% of truck services at the port.

MBK shrugs off poll worry: Services takes shape in hope of licence

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

MBK Properties & Development Plc plans to set up a commercial bank
despite political uncertainties posed by the general election.

The group was one of the three groups short-listed by the bank selection
committee. Licences require the finance minister's approval.

Company managing director Pakong Leelawong said yesterday her group had
spent one million baht a month on hiring potential staff for the bank.

National Finance & Securities Plc chairman Banterng Tantivit will be its
chairman and Nopporn Ruangsakul, a former Thai Danu Bank executive
vice-president, will be the managing director.

The group forecasts the new bank, focusing on wholesale banking, will
break even in 5-7 years.

Mr Banterng said he was unsure whether or not the new government would
change the policy on awarding new banking licences to his group.

Mrs Pakong said her group had testified to the police about an allegation
that bribes of 750 million baht per licence were paid to the selection
committee. She stressed all three groups had rejected the claims.

Meanwhile, MBK Properties & Development Plc's one-year net profit to
September 30 was 373.14 million baht, or 2.40 baht per share, up from a
net profit of 273.92 million baht, or 1.62 per share, last year.

The firm will pay a dividend of two baht per share this year.

Mrs Prakong said her company's outstanding total assets this year were
worth 18.38 billion baht, up from 8.17 billion baht last year.

The company expects to benefit when the Mass Rapid Transit Authority's
underground railway, with a terminal near its property, is completed. It
expects its net profit to reach 608.67 million baht.

But the company's 383-room Pathum Princess Hotel in the Mah Boon Krong
centre compound is projected to lose 5.7 million baht next year before
breaking even in 1998.

Plastic club wants duty kept: Manufacturers call for help to cut costs

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

Plastic and petrochemical manufacturers have urged the government to
scrap import tariffs cuts scheduled for January.

The Federation of Thai Industries' Plastic Industry Club has also called
for the current tariff structure to be kept for 3-5 years and for the
government to help manufacturers trim their costs so they can compete
with imports.

Club chairman Virat Kleo-patinon recently put its case to Prime Minister
Banharn Silpa-archa.

Plastics and petrochemicals were basic industries that had only just
begun in Thailand and were not strong enough to compete with imports, Mr
Virat said.

Ethylene and propylene, the industry's main feedstocks, were bought from
the National Petrochemical Corp and Thai Olefins Co at prices higher than
those of imports.

The industry also paid more for electricity than counterparts abroad and
chemical tanks and terminal charges were expensive, he said, adding there
was also the burden of high interest on loans, as well as guarantees and
tax.

Neighbours including Malaysia and Indonesia had offered their
manufacturers tax breaks and other incentives.

But Thailand had lifted its protection measures and had made it easier
to import low-priced foreign supplies, causing serious losses for local
manufacturers, Mr Virat claimed. The government had been cool on their
request for help in integrating production to cut costs, he added.

TA cordless phones can share numbers: Handsets will also work well in
vehicles

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

Suphaphan Plengmaneepun

TelecomAsia Corp says its personal cordless telephone (PCT) service to
be introduced in the middle of next year will enable more than one person
to carry handsets with same numbers.

PCT, previously known as the personal handy phone system, can be used in
vehicles travelling at up to 60 km/h, compared with 30km/h in Japan where
the technology was developed.

TA vice-president Vallobh Vimolvanich said TA's cordless service would
enable users to apply for more extended lines or handsets.

If a family has more than two members, they can apply for extended lines
for each of them. These additional handsets will have the same home
numbers.

For incoming calls, owners can set all lines to ring simultaneously or
just a particular handset. PCT also provides call-waiting services or
conference links.

TA will seek Telephone Organisation of Thailand approval to collect the
monthly fee for extended lines. This will be 100 baht/month for the
second handset in addition to 200 baht/month for the first.

The airtime fee will be three baht for the first two minutes and 1.50
baht for each subsequent minute of each call for each handset used.

PCT will cover 1,600 sq km of Bangkok. By end of 1998, the coverage area
will extend to 4,500 sq km to take in outlying areas.

Mr Vallobh said he expected more than one million subscribers within the
first three years.

The service could be used in cars travelling at 60 km/h because the
system's cell sites were close to each other. TA would have to fix cell
sites on all 800,000 power poles of the Metropolitan Electricity
Authority to provide efficient coverage, he said.

Motorists travelling at more than 100 km/h would find cellular phones
more efficient than cordless sets, he noted.

TA and Thai Telephone and Telecommunication (TT&T) will ask the TOT to
allow them to use the same control frequency that would allow a roaming
service between the two cordless networks.

TT&T's subscribers could then use their cordless phones in Bangkok, while
Bangkok subscribers could use their sets in the provinces.

Both TA and TT&T would have to negotiate their sharing of revenue from
the roaming service, Mr Vallobh said.

TA is also negotiating to provide a cordless service for subscribers to
the TOT's 1.7 million phones in Bangkok in addition to TA's 2.6 million
lines.

TOT wants 21% of the revenue but TA considers this to high.

TA's multi-media fibre network for the 2.6 million lines in Bangkok has
the capacity to handle six million lines, Mr Vallobh said. Therefore when
new fixed-line operators wanted to share the network, they could do so
without having to pay for cables. But they would pay TA a share of the
revenue, he added.

Micro-breweries to be franchised: Boon Rawd plans 10 restaurants

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

Boon Rawd Brewery Co is preparing to open the first of what it expects
to be 10 franchise micro-brewery restaurants, according to executive
chairman Viroj Phutrakul.

The Hartmannsdorfer Brauhaus will be located in SCB Park Plaza on
Ratchadaphisek Road, and will be operated by Pomona Trading, a joint
venture between Boon Rawd and a German partner.

"The concept of the micro-brewery is very popular in Europe and America,
and is fast catching on in Asia," said Boon Rawd chairman Piya Bhirom
Bhakdi. "Asian people are switching to drinking beer, encouraging the
micro-brewery business to grow very fast."

The Hartmannsdorfer Brauhaus has a total brewing capacity of 300,000
litres annually. The 1,500-square-metre restaurant seats 400 people.

Boon Rawd is entering the business after seeing the success of the
Paulaner Brauhaus which has two popular outlets in the Sukhumvit area.
Boon Rawd has operated the Singha Beer Haus on Asoke Road for several
years, but it has not expanded to other branches.

Pomona Trading will invest some 80 million baht in the prototype
Hartmannsdorfer outlet, named for a beer produced by a Boon Rawd-owned
brewery in Germany. After it achieves success, the franchise will be sold
under the responsibility of Boon Rawd Asia Co, within a year.

"We plan to give Hartmannsdorfer franchises to 10 franchisees, half of
which will be in Bangkok. We are hopeful of expanding our franchise
within a year after we succeed with this first restaurant," Mr Viroj
said.

The investment outlay for each Hartmannsdorfer Brauhaus will range from
30 million to 80 million baht.

Boon Rawd is also preparing to franchise the products of its German
brewery, Mittweida Lowenbrau, producer of Hartmannsdorfer and Mittweida
beers.

The first Mittweida franchise is expected to be sold to a brewery in
China. Boon Rawd also plans to open its first joint-venture brewery next
year with the Charoen Pokphand Group in China.

"Local demand for beer in Thailand is growing by more than 20% annually.
We do not have enough production capacity, so we need to find some
production bases to produce our beer to be supplied to the European and
US markets," Mr Piya said.

Thailand's total beer market is currently worth about 40 billion baht.
Boon Rawd is the market leader with more than 80% market share.

Insider: A modest beginning

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

Given all the fuss about telecoms, one would think that the
Telecommunication Association of Thailand would have a very high profile.

Not so, says association president Sribhumi Sukhanetr. With all the
public-and private-sector players involved, the possibility of the
association taking a stand that would annoy someone is high.

Tempted as he might be to sound off, Mr Sribhumi prefers the association
to play a neutral but constructive role. If people want to call the TCT
-- the initials chosen to avoid confusion with the TAT -- a paper tiger,
he doesn't mind.

"At the moment we're concentrating on training courses and I have to
remind myself not to be critical on other issues because it would create
a problem later. The association needs cooperation from both the private
and public sectors so we don't want to have problems with any of them."

Starting on Friday, the TCT will hold a three-day seminar at Central
Plaza. The objective? To help educate the public about uses, trends and
developments in the field.

Registration is 2,200 baht for non-members and 2,000 baht for members.
Proceeds will be donated to the Royal Projects.

Insider: Tried and true

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

For 100 years the New York Times has proclaimed itself the home of "All
the News That's Fit to Print". When it went on the World Wide Web, it
looked for a new slogan.

The newspaper held a contest that drew some 8,000 entries, including the
likes of "All the News That's Fit to Click", and "All the News That's Fit
to Print Out".

So what did the judges finally settle on? "All the News That's Fit to
Print". It has a certain ring to it.

Insider: Air scare

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

This month's Bad Taste Award goes to Ryanair, an Irish discount airline.

The offending advertisement showed a picture of a hijacked Sudan Airways
Airbus-130 on the tarmac of London's Stansted Airport, with the door open
and boarding stairs nearby, but without a passenger in sight.

"It's amazing what lengths people will go to, to fly cheaper than
Ryanair," the copy proclaimed.

The Irish Airline Pilots' Association -- and consumers -- didn't think
there was anything funny about hijacking. The ad was dropped.

CHINA-TOURISM: Shanghai Welcomes First Theme Park

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Chinese tourists will be able to feel and act like a cowboy in
the wild, wooly west, stare down a bad guy in a "gun fight,"
explore an old haunted castle, play with life-sized cartoon
figures, or race along in thrilling high-speed chases. They can
even roam on ``Miami beaches.'' And that's just a taste of the
playful fun awaiting visitors to the first US Dream Park in
China.

Newly opened in August, the US Dream Park in Huangdu, Jiading,
will provide tourists with outstanding, and colorful amusement.
This park fills the gap in China's amusement trade and will
further brighten up Shanghai's tourist industry. Covering an area
of 33.3 hectares, the park is divided into five special theme
districts. One makes world famous films come to life. With one
ticket, tourists can experience China's largest scale thrilling
recreations, as well as film stunts, music, dance, magic and
sports.

The U.S. Dream Park in Guangzhou is expected to open this
October, others in Chengdu, Beijing and Wuhan are in the planning
stage.

CHINA-TOURISM: News in Brief: --Ancient Bells Chime for Museum Visitors

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

--Ancient Bells Chime for Museum Visitors.  The Han Dynasty
Emperor Wudi Maoling Museum has recently added an Ancient Bell
Exhibition and Concert Hall to perform Chinese music dating more
than 2,400 years.

The Maoling Museum, 40 km northwest of Xian, is famous at home
and abroad for a number of large Han Dynasty stone inscriptions.
In the concert hall, a set of 64 bronze chime of bells are
exhibited. A chime of bells is a set of bells whose tones span
one octave. Simple and unsophisticated in shape and fine in
workmanship, they hang from bronze frames in three layers and
eight groups. The original pieces were discovered in Zeng Houyi's
tomb of the early Warring States Period (475-221 BC) in Suizhou,
Hubei Province in 1978. Although they sat underground for more
than 2,400 years, they still have a wide range of sounds and can
play ancient and modern music. This collection is the oldest
large musical instrument with 12 and chromatic scales in the
world.

--The Japanese-Chinese Friends Association Silk Road Exploration
Commenced on August 2: The 26-member group traversed over 6,000
km by car to Lanzhou, Jiayuguan Pass, Dunhuang, Urumqi, Kashi,
ancient city of Miran and Xining, and will return to Xian after
28 days.

CHINA-TOURISM: New Xian-Lhasa Airline

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Upon approval from the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC), Southwest Airlines opened the Xian-Lhasa Airline on July
1, this year, completing an air bridge from northwest China to
the roof of the world.

The Xian-Lhasa Airline links Kathmandu's International Airline
with a return flight stopping in Xian and continuing to Beijing,
an air distance of 1,900 km, flying 2 hours and 40 minutes by
Boeing 757 each Monday and Thursday. People in tourist circles
estimate the opening of the new airline will link the capital,
Beijing, with the ancient cities of Xian, Lhasa and Kathmandu.

Since the first successful flight from Sichuan's Chengdu to Lhasa
in 1956, the CAAC has opened Sichuan's Chongqing, Beijing to
Lhasa and Chengdu to Tibet's Qamdo air routes, which have safely
flown over the plateau for 40 years. The opening of the Xian-
Lhasa Airline will further improve the air transportation network
in the Tibet Autonomous Region.

CHINA-TOURISM: Giant Reclining Buddha at Wutai Mountain: During the 7th
Wutai Mountains International Tourist Month...

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

During the 7th Wutai Mountains International Tourist Month,
tourists will be see a new sight--a 1,000-meter-long reclining
Buddha.

The giant Buddha reclines with his head lying in the Puhua Temple
and his feet in the Nanshan Temple. The 3,000-meter-meandering
Qingshui River passing his body is a grand Wutai Mt. spectacle.
Just before sunrise is the best time to see the sleeping Buddha,
when the silhouette of the 1,000-meter-long sleeping Buddha is
clearly visible in the sun's first bright rays.

This giant Buddha has been a legend for many years, the subject
of stories and fascination, but its existence was not verified
until recently. In 1995, the Buddha was finally discovered by
some artists from the Taiyuan Art Academy in Shanxi Province.
Climbing the Wutai Mt. during several different seasons and times
of day, one morning they at last discovered the 1,000-meter-long
sleeping Buddha, observing it in the first rays of the morning
sun from the upper floor of a government office building in the
Wutai Mountains Scenic Spot.

A terrace especially for viewing the Buddha will be built in the
Wutai Mountain Scenic Spot.

CHINA-TOURISM: Hebei's Special Itineraries

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

CHEN ZHONGLIE

To kick off the Visit China '97 promotion, Hebei Province, with
its original Great Wall Tour, Fitness Tour, and Acrobatics and
Marshal Arts Tours, will again offer another four special
itineraries.

Forest Grassland Tour. North Hebei Province has a verdant expanse
of grassland and a vast sea of forest. The interesting grassland
tents, wooden houses, unique barbecue and special milk tea,
horse-riding, shooting and particularly the grand evening
bonfires and unique Manchu and Mongolian song and dance evening
parties make this tour an explosion of ethnic and cultural
adventure.

Bird-Watching Tour. The Beidaihe coast has attracted migratory
birds for centuries. In addition to wildlife splendor, visitors
can enjoy luxuriant forests, splendid grasslands, and long
stretches of beaches and marshes--a bird's paradise. According to
studies, in Beidaihe and its environs, 405 kinds of birds have
been logged, 68 of which are under state protection. Red-crowned
cranes, large swans, white storks, goshawks, sea vultures,
sparrow hawks and other rare birds can be observed here. The best
times for bird-watching in Beidaihe are April to May and October
to December.

Buddhist Temple Tour. Shijiazhuang, capital city of Hebei
Province, occupies an important position in the history of
Buddhism. As early as the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the Chan Sect
of Buddhism was flourishing, and the Linji, Longxing, Bailin,
Diyin, Pilu and another 17 temples are well known at home and
abroad. The Linji Temple was the birthplace of the Linji Chan
Sect. The Linji Chan style, initiated by Master Yixuan, is
practiced widely in Japan, the Republic of Korea and Southeast
Asian countries. The Bailin Temple is the oldest site for
ceremonial rites to worship the Goddess of Mercy. According to
historic documents, the Tang Dynasty eminent monk Xuan Zang
lectured in the Bailin and Diyin temples and then went
pilgrimaging to the west. The annual Grand Buddhist Doctrine
Summon at Diyin Temple attract numerous Chinese and foreign
Buddhists and tourists.

The Three Kingdoms Cultural Tour. Zhuozhou in Hebei Province is
the birthplace of the Three Kingdoms culture. The famous historic
work, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, was originated from
here. The Lousang Temple, native home of Liu Bei (king of the Shu
State), the Zhongyi Temple, home of Zhang Fei (a Shu State
general), the Zhang Fei Well, the Sanyi Temple where Liu Bei,
Guan Yu (also a Shu State general) and Zhang Fei became sworn
brothers in the Peach Garden, and other ancient historic remains
have been renovated. The Zhuozhou Film and TV City, built for
shooting the grand TV serial The Romance of the Three Kingdoms,
covers an area of 146.7 hectares. It encompasses the Han Dynasty
Imperial Scenic Spot, and four folk residential complexes named
as the Bamboo Garden, the Peach Garden, the Plum Garden and the
Pear Garden. The Bronze Sparrow Terrace, a magnificent
architectural structure in the State of Wei (220-265), is
acclaimed by many as the epitome of perfection.

CHINA-PRESS: Annual Salary System Introduced: ''Zhongguo Qingnian
Bao''

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

(China Youth Daily)

The annual base salary-plus system, which is common abroad,
began to be trial practiced by the Shanghai Fountain Pen Factory
four years ago.

Clearly defined property right relationship and coordinated
reforms provided the precondition for instituting this system.

The system enables appointed officials of state-owned
enterprises to become professional entrepreneurs.

This year, 20 of the 140 pilot enterprises practicing the modern
enterprise system have introduced  the new salary system.

The base annual salaries for directors and managers, ranging
between 20,000 to 50,000 yuan, are determined in accordance with
the size of each enterprise's net assets. Salary supplements, or
what is sometimes known as risk incomes, are determined according
to management achievements, including the growth rate of assets
and profits, with the ceiling level tripling the base salary.

For example, regardless of level of achievements in business
operations, the maximum salary ceiling for the director of a
large enterprise will not exceed 200,000 yuan. This sum is
reasonable under China's current conditions. Introduction of the
base salary-plus system not only inspires enterprise directors
and managers to work harder and restricts abuses of power, but
also takes into account the interest of employees.

Implementing the base salary-plus system in state-owned
enterprises will pave the way for forming an orderly professional
entrepreneur market.

CHINA-PRESS: Changes in Employment Structure

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

YANGZI WANBAO

(Yangtze Evening News)

With the acceleration of reform in China's labor system and the
improvement of labor markets, changes have also occurred in
employment structures.

First, a two-way migration work patterns is taking shape. A
growing number of urbanities now seek jobs in rural areas. Among
the country's 130 million employed by township enterprises, 10
percent are urbanities. For example, many urban skilled workers
in southern Jiangsu Province prefer township enterprises where
they can gain higher incomes and have greater life choices. In
some township enterprises, one-third of workers come from cities.
Even university graduates and qualified technicians prefer to
work at township enterprises. For example, a continuous stream of
university graduates come to the Hongdou Group for employment.
The 6,000-employee firm, located in suburban Wuxi City, Jiangsu
Province, now employs more than 600 university graduates.

Second, the number of employees in the private and individual
businesses has increased rapidly. By the end of 1995 the number
had reached 19.6 million, accounting for more than 10 percent of
the country's total employees.

Third, the number of government employees declined, with the
1995 figure dropping by 210,000 from 1994.

CHINA-PRESS: To each his own: Women's Bookstore

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

A bookstore dedicated to serving women opened in Beijing two

addition, its shelves contain biographies of successful women
from various circles and works related to the accomplishment of
women and personal appearance.

of customers. For example, numerous representatives and scholars
from across the world visited and praised the store during the
Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995.

The store has opened four branches in Beijing, and plans to open
chain stores in numerous other cities.

Zheng Zhihui, proprietor of the Women's Bookshop from Taiwan,

CHINA-PRESS: Skill Training on the Rise

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

GONGREN RIBAO

Workers' Daily

At present, skill training is gaining popularity throughout
China, following the drive to enhance university degrees and
doing business.

The training is oriented to diversified skills beyond the
learners' own professions. Numerous training classes,
continuation classes and advanced classes have been opened in
many cities, where the employed, unemployed or off-job workers
learn driving, accounting, cooking, tailoring and  foreign
languages.

More than 3 million people are registered to receive various
kinds of adult education and training annually in Beijing.
Approximately 30 million persons nationwide have received their
driver's license through training. The Nanjing Vocational
Training Center reports that 91 percent of their students hold
full-time jobs.

This rush toward continuing education is a direct result of the
development of a market economy. If

workers hope to stay competitive and get better jobs, they must
update their skills regularly. The grim situation in China's
labor market requires people to learn what the market needs and
conscientiously seek more skills for their future development.

CHINA-PRESS: Lecture on Peking Opera Makeup

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

RENMIN RIBAO

(People's Daily, Overseas Edition)

This May, Famous Peking Opera makeup master Yan Shaokui lectured
at length on makeup techniques for the famous Peking Opera to a
fascinated group of students from Europe, America, Asia and
Africa. Sponsored by Nanjing University's Department of Foreign
Students, the lecture included a display of hundreds of lively,
colorful Peking Opera makeups made of paper, clay or fiberglass-
reinforced plastic. Makeups ranged in size from one or two meters
to about 10 cm.

Yan introduced to the several dozen foreign students the
development and significance of the cosmetic makeups in the
evolution of the Peking Opera, the relationship between makeups
and Peking Opera, and some basic techniques for drawing. To
demonstrate, Yan applied a black makeup to his face and performed
a related role from the opera highlight.

In response to requests of audience, Yan painted some of their
faces as well. He deftly transformed Nina from Sweden into the
Monkey King after 20 minutes of magic. While doing varied makeups
for five additional women from the Republic of Korea, Japan and
Indonesia, Yan explained various dramatic allusions, the use of
color and drawing skills, which was thoroughly impressed the
audience.

It was a special treat for foreign students to learn from a
master in Peking Opera makeup. They found the makeups vivid and
charming and looked forward to learning more about Peking Opera.
Women whom Yan had made up left their new faces on a second day
to show off the makeups to their friends. They took numerous
photos as a memento of this quintessentially Beijing art form.

CHINA: Libraries Adapt to New Demands

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

by Our Staff Reporter Feng Jing

The excited librarians at the Shanghai Library ignored
this summer's sultry hot weather and busily packed the many books
shelved in the 40-year-old structure for shipment to a new
library complex.

The new library, which covers 3.1 hectares on Huaihai
Road in downtown Shanghai, has a total floor space of 83,000
square meters capable of shelving more than 13 million volumes.

The library's two main buildings--a 55.6-meter-high
structure and a 106-meter-high tower building--symbolize the
accumulation of human culture and pursuit of knowledge. The
compound is landscaped with lawns, flower beds, fountains and two
squares.

The library, scheduled for a limited opening by the end
of this year, offers 5,000 seats in 20-odd reading rooms
featuring books, periodicals, and audio-visual and electronic
packages catalogued in terms of differing disciplines. The
facility's expansive book lending center offers wide-ranging
works published during the last five-eight years.

The library is equipped with computer and
telecommunications technology for the management of purchasing,
cataloguing, circulation, public inquiries and lending systems.
It will also introduce a CD-ROM system and various specialized
databases for items such as classical and rare books and
contemporary photo archives. In addition, the complex will be
equipped with various audio-visual systems, facilities for the
production of audio-visual materials, cataloging and monitoring
systems, and satellite  dishes.

Deputy Director Wu Jianzhong noted that constantly
expanding public access to information requires libraries to
alter the previous practice of stressing book collections, and
instead place priority on improving services for readers. "We
will shift the focus of work from simply collecting books to
upgrading services,'' said Wu.

Library Expansion

Statistics show that the country had 392 scattered
libraries in large cities at the founding of New China in 1949.

By 1994, however, the number had soared to 258,477, with
more than 400,000 employees, housing collections of over 3
billion volumes. They facilities included 2,596 public libraries
above the county level, 1,080 university and college libraries,
more than 8,000 large and medium-sized libraries serving various
scientific research institutes, and a substantial number of
children's libraries and various libraries attached to trade
unions, primary and secondary schools, Party schools and army
units.

Since the 1980s, numerous library buildings featuring
diversified architectural styles have mushroomed in various
localities, with a new facility opening every couple of days.

The new library for the China National Museum, located in
the western suburbs of Beijing, is the pride of Chinese citizens.
The modern facility, which opened in 1987, is the largest library
in Asia and one of the top five libraries in the world, with its
design offering unique national flavor. The complex, with a total
floor space of 140,000 square meters, currently houses 16.7
million volumes, including 280,000 rare books from the
collections of imperial families in various dynasties and famous
private collections.

The Tibet Autonomous Region now has 50 libraries at
various levels. The first public library in the region was built
by the 18th Army Group of the People's Liberation Army in the
early 1950s. Soldiers led yak carrying gunnysacks full of books
to fill the shelves of the facility.

The new Tibet Library, the largest of its type in the
region, opened on July 1 this year. The modern multipurpose
library, which sits at the highest elevation compared to any
library in the world, mainly collects books and materials on
Tibetan studies, and will gradually be transformed into a major
center offering materials to Tibetanologists both at home and
abroad, and a major venue for comprehensive public education.

China currently has 427 libraries in minority nationality
areas.

New Technology

Many of the libraries have introduced new technology
such as computers, microfilm, xerox, audio-visual equipment, CDs,
automatic transmission and fire- and theft-resistant facilities.

Computer technology, the nucleus of modern technology, is
gaining increasing popularity. According to a 1995 study of 3,139
public, university and scientific research institute libraries
nationwide, subject facilities were equipped with 6,521
computers, 2,296 terminals, 1,076 databases for different
categories of information, 3,113 photo copy machines and 1.93
million audio-visual packages.

The National Library in Beijing, Zhongshan Library in
Guangdong Province, and Shenzhen Library are engaged in an
extensive effort to developing software and databases. Notable
progress has also been made in establishing a network linked to
the Zhongguancun Library in Beijing, a Beijing-Shanghai-Wuhan
computer network linking libraries of all institutes under the
China Academy of Sciences in the three localities, and a
satellite network for libraries attached to the People's
Liberation Army.

The National Library, the Beijing Eastern District
Library and various other libraries currently have reading rooms
offering electronic publications. China's first public computer
library--the Zhongnan Computer Library in Guangzhou City--opened
early last year. The facility which occupies 250 square meters in
the Guangzhou Library is equipped with computer operations and
software rooms, computer publications reading rooms, computer
sales halls, and expert reception rooms. The library offers
readers access to more than 100 computers and 200,000 sets of
software free of charge.

Capital Shortages

The public library in the bustling and hot city of
Shenzhen provides residents with a quiet and cool place to relax.
The current situation, however, is much different from only a few
years ago when capital shortages prevented the facility from
installing air-conditioners. A leading local government official
decreed that the library should be air conditioned prior to
occupation of the municipal government office building.

China's library system has developed despite the fact
that financial strain has hindered both construction and
operations. Capital shortages have led to the overuse of numerous
facilities, including the National Library in Beijing. In
addition, constant price hikes for publications in recent years
have resulted in a decline in the availability of new books and
periodicals in most public libraries. Du Ke, director of the
Library Division of the Ministry of Culture, noted that
government capital appropriations to public libraries have, in
fact, increased constantly, with annual funding soaring from less
than 60 million yuan in the 1980s to over 740 million yuan in
1995, a rate far exceeding that for national economic growth and
increases in financial revenue. Nonetheless, the admirable effort
has been unable to fully facilitate the developmental needs of
libraries.

Serving Economic Development

Qu Jiankang, director of the Shaanxian County Library in
Henan Province, was somewhat surprised at a meeting when a farmer
popped in to present him with over a dozen carp. The farmer
thanked Qu profusely, saying that the books Qu had sent on fish
breeding techniques and methods for treating aquatic diseases had
prevented him from losing as much as 100,000 yuan.

"Providing services to spur economic development is one
of our major tasks,'' said Qu. According to statistics for recent
years, despite being handicapped by limited operational funds of
only 280,000 yuan, the Shaanxian Library has provided various
sectors in the county with information and materials which have
helped to create over 6 million yuan in output value. Upon
learning that the county's chemical fertilizer plant planned to
launch an art paper manufacturing project, Qu invited the
factory's technology director to the library and provided him
with all related books and materials. The materials helped the
factory to quickly formulate construction and production plans
for the new facility and in turn saved 450,000 yuan in
construction funds alone.

In recent years, libraries at different levels in various
localities have provided materials and information for major
state and local construction projects, and in so  doing have
played an extremely important role in the country's economic
development. The National Library has contributed information and
materials to key projects involving mineral exploration, water
conservancy, metallurgy and geology. The Shanghai Library
provided invaluable assistance to the Huangpu River tunnel
project. The Gansu Provincial Library provided assistance to
construction of the Tianshui-Lanzhou, Lanzhou-Urumqi and Baotou-
Lanzhou railways, as well as to survey and design projects for
the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station. The Henan Provincial Library
joined in the Yellow River treatment project and the Hangzhou
Library participated in the cross-channel dike project for the
Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant. The Library of the China Academy of
Sciences has provided voluminous materials concerning the
ecological and environmental impact of the Three Gorges Project
on the Yangtze River. Services provided by the libraries have
helped to solve many technical problems, improve design, expedite
the progress of related projects and save construction funds.

Since 1986, libraries nationwide have worked in
cooperation with responsible departments to promote the Spark
Program, a major project the State Science and Technology
Commission introduced to expedite the industrialization and
commercialization of the results of scientific and technological
research. The goal of the program is to accelerate local economic
development. Some 70 libraries in Hunan Province have provided
more than 200 local Spark projects with follow-up services,
including 85 key projects. The libraries have compiled and
printed more than 40 scientific and technological information
pamphlets and 150 catalogs for specialized publications. In
addition, they have sponsored 250 practical technology training
courses which have attracted over 12,500 people.

Special Services

Many libraries now offer special services, with Beijing
libraries in particular recording notable progress in related
activities.

A 1986 survey conducted by the East District Library
revealed that the 25 clothing manufacturing factories in the
district accounting for the majority of both the total output
value and number of employees were in urgent need of adapting
themselves to rapid changes in the clothing market. The library
immediately formed a clothing information group. To facilitate
constantly increasing demand, in 1990 the library established the
clothing information section with a collection of several
thousand books and periodicals, and scores of video tapes on
fashion industries from more than a dozen countries and regions,
including the United States, France, Japan, Switzerland and
Italy. The information section, now known as the capital's
clothing information center, has introduced reading rooms which
attract numerous garment designers and manufacturers.

The West District Library, located in an area with
abundant cultural relics and tourism resources, has established a
tourism materials section which categorizes existing books,
periodicals and materials into tourism trends, scenic wonders in
China, scenic sites and folklore in Beijing, and special services
in the Chinese capital. It has also established cooperative
relations with the Lushan Library in Jiangxi Province, AT&T
(China) Co., and various travel services, with the effort
dedicated to arranging exchanges and sharing tourism information.
Last year, the section served more than 20,000 readers, or 40
percent of the library's total number of visitors. The section
lent more than 90,000 books and periodicals, with the figure
accounting for over 90 percent of the library's total circulation
volume.

In recent years, the Decorative Art Materials Section of
the Haidian District Library has attracted a growing number of
people engaged in arts and crafts, decoration and advertisement
design, and general readers with a strong affinity for the arts.

The Chongwen District Library offers a wide-ranging
collection of books on architecture, while the Xuanwu District
Library is known for its collections of books and materials on
folklore and packaging. The Capital Library is currently
accelerating formation of the Beijing Local Documents Database.

The past closed management style of Chinese libraries was
characterized by each facility pursuing the accumulation of large
quantities of materials and complete volumes of documents. The
approach resulted in duplicated collections and prevented the
full use of limited funds. Experts contend that the current
practice centering on each facility pursuing its own advantages
provides basic material conditions for the establishment of
cooperation networks which will promote share and inter-library
lending. The formation of said networks will also help
rationalize the use of funds.

Knowledge Pool

Two-year-old Yangyang frequently visits her grandparents
on weekends, with her parents seizing the opportunity to visit
the local library.

In recent years, the couple, university graduates who
respectively earned degrees in oceanography and chemistry in the
late 1980s, have regularly visited the local library on Sundays
to update their knowledge and information.

Along with the rapid development of the market economy
and the increasingly fierce competition in the job and
information markets, many people, particularly those in rapidly
growing localities, opt to supplement their knowledge with
information provided by libraries.

The Shenzhen Library's annual practice of issuing new
book cards represents a special occasion in the city. As many as
10,000 people often queue in front of the library from dawn to
dusk, with some even coming on the previous night. According to
statistics, the Shenzhen Library now serves 5,400 readers daily.

Rural township libraries have mushroomed in southern
Jiangsu Province since 1990, with more than 430 townships in
Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou cities opening facilities by 1994.

Each library in the 35 townships in Wuxi County, Wuxi
City, have collections exceeding 10,000 volumes. The libraries,
which have a total of 600,000 volumes, serve 1.2 million rural
readers annually, with their combined circulation surpassing 2
million volumes.

Rural families in southern Jiangsu traditionally hold a
family feast on the evening of the Winter Solstice. On last
year's Winter Solstice, however, many residents of Luoshe Town,
Wuxi County, visited the local library after dinner, filling the
300-square-meter reading room. The visitors refused to leave
despite a power outage. Librarians proceeded to light candles,
and the over 100 avid readers, ignoring the dim light, continued
reading until closing time.

CHINA: High-Tech: A Hope for China's Agriculture

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

by Our Staff Reporter Zhou Xin

Can China solve its agricultural problems? Practice of the Sino-
Israeli Demonstration Farm offers a positive answer. By relying
on advanced agrotechnology, China will create a new miracle in
agricultural production.

The Sino-Israeli Demonstration Farm (SIDF), which is located in
the southeastern suburbs of Beijing, has attracted worldwide
attention since its establishment two years ago. No visitor from
any part of the country hesitates to express admiration for the
high yields brought about by high technology.

The four large white greenhouses, the most eye-catching
structures in the farm, are totally controlled by computers, in
which high-yield and quality crops introduced from Israel are
planted. According to Zhu Hongfeng, head of the farm, the
greenhouses, which were imported from Israel, are fairly
advanced. The two insulating layers on the ceilings keep the
greenhouses warm in winter, and protect plants from the scorching
sun and lower the temperature in summer. These devices can be
moved automatically to ensure the necessary temperature for
different stages of vegetable growth.

The trickle irrigation system, a symbol of Israel's high
agrotechnology, crisscrosses the farm's 75-hectare field. This
water-efficient system ensures the crops  fully absorb moisture
and fertilizer.

Israel and China face common problems in agriculture, namely
infertile land, drought and water shortage. However, the former
has solved its problems by applying high technology.

Chinese agronomists hold that the advanced agrotechnology
displayed by the farm is highly suitable for China, especially
for the arid and water-deficient inland areas in northwest
regions, such as Gansu and Ningxia which were widely considered
as places unworthy of agricultural development.

A bare fact may well explain why Chinese farmers show such a
great interest in Israel's irrigation system. The system enables
the SIDF to create several firsts in vegetable production. For
example, the quarterly output of tomatoes has reached 5,500 kg
per mu (1 mu equals 1/15 hectare), three-four times that produced
by individual farmer households. Green pepper's output hits
15,000 kg per mu, with one pepper weighing 700-800 grams.

The key to the success of the farm lies in the country's longing
for agricultural modernization. In many parts of China, farmers
still sow seeds manually and plough their fields with the aid of
ox. The backward farming techniques lead to low yields and
vulnerability of grain production to natural disasters, typically
annual flood in the south and drought spells in the north.

Due to the underdevelopment of agriculture, China has long been
obsessed by the grain issue and the question of how to fulfill
the growing demand for quality farm produce following the
constant increase of incomes. In addition, the low income from
farming has driven numerous farmers to cities, resulting in the
short supply of raw materials for industrial production, a major
factor restricting the development of the national economy.

Early this year, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
reported that China lags behind Western countries by 15-20 years
in terms of the comprehensive level of agricultural science and
technology. The per-unit yield of many crops is lower than the
average international level. To narrow this gap, China has
introduced from other countries more than 1,000 advanced
agrotechnologies during the past five years. Prior to the year
2000, the country plans to invest US$500 million for importing
another 1,000 advanced, applicable agrotechnologies.

Some people have asked whether the SIDF mode can be popularized
throughout the country. Undoubtedly, fine quality farm produce
would bring about generous profits. However, if unable to be
universalized, such high-tech agriculture featuring high input,
high output and high profits still faces an unpredictable market
in China.

According to Zhu, as the supply of his farm's products currently
falls short of demand, Beijing citizens can hardly get them on
the market. In fact, the farm's products are mostly bought by
luxury hotels because their price is four-five times that of
ordinary vegetables on Beijing market.

The SIDF is now trying to lower cost by combining imported
technology with local farmers' traditional practices. For
instance, the farm has built brick greenhouses and equipped them
with Israeli trickle irrigation and computer control systems.
Saving expenses for importing specially made greenhouses has
enabled the farm to cut the per-mu production cost by several
thousand yuan.

Zhu said that the per-capita productivity of his 170-staff farm
has attained a fairly high level and annually earns a net income
of 50,000 yuan from one mu of vegetable. "If the production scale
further expands, costs will drop further,'' assured an official
from the Ministry of Agriculture.

Expansion of the use of high technology is essential for China to
realize agricultural modernization and intensification. China is
cooperating with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and
other international institutions to explore effective ways for
spreading high agrotechnologies. The SIDF has become a base in
this regard. In spring this year, the farm began to host on-site
training courses for farmers from all over the country. The
farmers were taught the skills to grow the varieties bred by the
farm.

China plans to increase the contributory rate of science and
technology to agriculture from 35 percent to 50 percent by the
end of this century, and gives priority to importing applicable
advanced technology to enable more Chinese farmers to directly
benefit from agrotechnology.

Modern agrotechniques have not only enabled Chinese farmers to
gain direct economic results, but also provided foreign business
people with an opportunity to enter Chinese agricultural market.

Officials of the Israeli embassy in China assess the beneficial
results of the SIDF every month, and recently revealed the plan
of establishing two similar farms in other parts of the country.
An official of Chinese Ministry of Agriculture noted that the
SIDF has produced an advertising effect.

Li Hongyi, head of a Shandong farm, expressed willingness to buy
equipment and seeds as those used by the SIDF. He even intended
to employ one or two Israeli agronomists.

The SIDF, called by the Chinese as a "modernized agricultural
factory'', opens up a bright prospect for China's agriculture. An
economist noted that the time has come for China to create the
second miracle in agriculture by relying on high technology.

The first miracle emerged in the early 1980s following the
abolishment of the people's commune system and introduction of
the system of contracted responsibility for tilling the land. The
farmers' enthusiasm was greatly aroused, and in turn the
country's grain output increased by 80 billion kg in the
subsequent nine years. The effort is commonly regarded as a
system revolution, and now China is envisaging a technological
revolution.

CHINA: Chinese Foreign Ministry News Briefings

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Spokesman Shen Guofang.PI DAWEI

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang told reporters
attending last week's regularly scheduled news briefings that
Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh Sheikh
Hasina will pay an official visit to China between September 12-
16, 1996, at the invitation of Premier Li Peng.

Shen then opened the floor for questions.

Q: Would you comment on the two missile attacks the US military
delivered against Iraq?

A: We deeply regret and are strongly dissatisfied with the fact
that the United States attacked Iraq with missiles, causing
casualties and property damages. The use of force against a
sovereign country not only represents a serious violation of
international norms, but also heightens the already tense
situation in the region and creates the possibility for serious
adverse effects. The Chinese government reiterates that Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected. We
sincerely hope that all parties concerned will immediately cease
military operations to relieve the tense situation in the region,
and will in turn reach a just and reasonable resolution to
problems lingering from the Gulf War through political dialogue
and on the basis of relevant UN resolutions.

Q: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat held their first summit on September 4.
How does China view the meeting?

A: China supports all steps leading to the realization of a just
and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. We believe the summit
between the two leaders will help Israel and Palestine establish
mutual trust and resume peace talks at the earliest possible
date. We sincerely hope that all parties concerned will observe
previous agreements in order to remove all remaining obstacles to
push forward the peace process under the principle of "land for
peace."

Q: The People's Liberation Army Daily recently carried an article
entitled "Losing 1,000 Ounce of Gold is Preferable to Losing One
Inch of Land." Does this mean the Chinese government will assume
an uncompromising attitude on the issue of the Diaoyu Islands at
the risk of losing 400 billion Japanese yen in loans?

A: The issue of Japanese loans is a totally different matter from
safeguarding China's territorial integrity and sovereignty.
Japanese loans to China will benefit bilateral trade and economic
cooperation. Nonetheless, the Chinese government offers no room
for compromise and will take whatever action is necessary to
safeguard China's territorial integrity and sovereignty. We duly
note that China and Japan have disputed control of the Diaoyu
Islands. Therefore, we propose that both sides shelve
disagreements and jointly develop resources in the islands.
Neither side should resort to any action which will heighten
tensions concerning the situation.

Q: According to recent reports, the Dalai Lama is scheduled to
visit Australia. What is China's position?

A: We believe the Dalai Lama is not only a religious figure, but
more importantly a political figure in exile. Therefore, we
maintain that any country maintaining normal diplomatic relations
with China should not host visits by the aforementioned political
figure. We also believe that any country maintaining normal
diplomatic relations with China is blatantly interfering in
China's internal affairs by hosting the Dalai Lama.

Q: According to recent reports, Taiwan's Li Teng-hui informed
Australian reporters that he would like to visit Australia. How
would a visit by Li affect Sino-Australian relations?

A: China and Australia currently maintain normal diplomatic
relations, with political, trade and economic ties developing
rapidly in recent years. Therefore,  Australia should refrain
from meddling in China's internal affairs on the Taiwan issue. We
sincerely hope that Australia will honor its commitments in
accordance with the joint communique for the establishment of
Sino-Australian diplomatic ties by refraining from developing
official relations with Taiwan. Any other course will seriously
affect Sino-Australian relations.

Q: German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will meet Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen at the end of September in New York. He also
hopes to visit China in October to pave the way for a November
visit by the German president. Does this indicate the
normalization of Sino-German relations?

A: China attaches great importance to developing relations with
Germany, with economic and political ties expanding rapidly in
recent years. However, various factors earlier this year created
a strain in Sino-German relations. We hope the meeting between
the German foreign minister and Qian Qichen will be successful
and will in turn return Sino-German relations to a course of
sound development.

CHINA: The world has reason to watch for whither Japan is heading Japan:
Don't Do Anything Foolish

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

by People's Daily Commentator

In the last few weeks Japan has carried out a series of
provocative actions over the Chinese territory, Diaoyu Islands,
situated between Taiwan and southern Japan.

On July 14, the right-wing Japanese Youth Foundation built a
lighthouse on Diaoyu Island, the main island of the islets, and
the Japanese government announced an exclusive economic zone of
200 nautical miles on July 20, taking in the Chinese islands.

Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda then openly claimed that
the Diaoyu Islands belong to Japan and that there is no need to
justify this claim.

On August 18, a right-wing group from Japan's southern Okinawa-
ken put up a board on one of the islands with a drawing of the
Japanese flag.

There are reports that Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
ordered the military to prepare for any contingency and that the
Japanese authorities even went so far as to threaten force if
necessary.

The Chinese people will not stand by violation of their
territorial integrity. The Diaoyu Islands, like Taiwan, are an
inalienable and indisputable part of China since ancient times.

Evidence dating back as early as the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),
when Chinese fishermen conducted activities in this area, prove
the islands are part of China.

Japan seized Taiwan and its surrounding islands, including the
Diaoyu Islands, during the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-1895. In
April 1895, the government of the Qing Dynasty was forced to sign
the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and ceded the islands to Japan.

After World War II, a defeated Japan returned Taiwan to China,
but privately handed the Diaoyu Islands over to the United
States. In 1971, the US government illegally returned the Diaoyu
Islands to Japan, an action the Chinese government strongly
opposed.

When Japan and China normalized relations in 1972 and signed the
Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1978, the two
countries, taking overall relations into account, agreed to
settle the issue of the Diaoyu Islands in the future.

Japan, however, broke its promise and has intensified its efforts
to create instability and stir up trouble. Japan tried to
strengthen the symbolic significance of its occupation of the
Diaoyu Island by playing the shameless card of "if I have
occupation, I have possession."

It is well known that in international relationships, the issue
of ownership of territory is the most crucial. Japan has upset
this sensitive balance many times recently and evidently wants to
take advantage of the changes in the political situation in East
Asia since the end of the Cold War to demonstrate its power to
the outside world and to test China's determination to safeguard
its territory and sovereignty.

China has always handled the issue holistically and cherishes
friendly relations with Japan. China's stand on the Diaoyu
Islands is to put aside their dispute and jointly exploit the
region on the precondition that China has sovereignty.

Over that past 100 years, the Chinese people have never kow-towed
to foreign powers. They won back the independence and sovereignty
of the country with the blood and lives of millions of people.

Today, if anyone thinks China's 1.2 billion people will surrender
even one inch of soil, they are indulging in fantasy; if anyone
holds the illusion that the Chinese people will yield to foreign
forces, they are day dreaming; if anybody wants to take advantage
of the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits,
they are making a grave mistake. The Chinese people are united
and adamant about maintaining their territorial integrity.

Japan's challenge to China's sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands
is not accidental but is an inevitable result of emerging
rightist elements in Japan's internal political situation and
Japan's intention to flex its muscle.

To illustrate this tendency recently, many Japanese have
distorted the country's history, glorified its war of aggression
and imbued its countrymen with a sense of militarism.

Some Japanese politicians are exaggerating the so-called "China
threat," trying their best to sow dissent between China and its
neighboring countries and inventing an excuse for the expansion
of its forces.

The Japanese government has strengthened the Japan-US security
system, expanded the scope of defense beyond Japan's borders and
even talked about "watching for trends of the Chinese military"
in its official defense white paper. Japan has continually
increased its military expenditure, built up its weaponry and
tried its best to send its forces abroad.

Asian countries have long expressed their concern that Japan
would embark on its old road of militarism. These fears are not
groundless as this series of activities seem to prove. Asian
countries should tell those expansionist Japanese not to do
anything foolish. At the same time, Asia must maintain high
vigilance over Japan's actions.

CHINA: Rightist Comeback in Japan: Cause for Vigilance

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

by Da Jun

Diaoyu Islands  Denial of Massacre   Denial of aggression  Balm
Visiting Yasukuni Shrine

This summer, Japanese rightists, with the connivance and and
support of the Japanese government, built a lighthouse and
erected a Japanese flag on the Diaoyu Island, the largest of the
Diaoyu Islands which have been part of China's territory since
ancient times. This provocative act cannot but arouse strong
indignation from the Chinese people as a wanton encroachment upon
China's territory.

Attempts

A review of Sino-Japanese relations suggests that Japan began to
covet China's Diaoyu Islands long ago.

In the late 1960s, large deposits of oil and natural gas were
discovered off the islands. The Japanese unilaterally took a
series of actions attempting to establish claim over the
territory. They first sent  exploration teams and then cruise
boats to the islands, removing the original Chinese marks and
replacing them with Japanese ones. They also renamed eight islets
in Japanese.

In 1978, when China and Japan were negotiating the signing of a
treaty of peace and friendship, some members of the Japanese Diet
(parliament) demanded that China recognize Japan's sovereignty
over the islands. The Japanese government, in answer to the
rightists' calls, dispatched patrol boats and airplanes to
monitor Chinese fishing boats working near the islands.

In May 1979, the Japanese shipped personnel and equipment to
Diaoyu Island and built a helicopter airport there. They also
sent an investigation team and a surveying mission to the area.

In October 1990, when the West was imposing sanctions against
China, Japanese rightists, with an understanding from the
government, built a beacon tower on one of the islets. The
Japanese government sent 12 ships and two helicopters to prevent
Taiwanese fishing boats from moving toward the islands.

These facts indicate that Japan's every move on Diaoyu Islands
was designed not only to attempt to seize the resources in the
vicinity but also to use the issue to plot against China. The
events occuring this summer well illustrate the issue.

Japan unexpectedly announced that it would redesignate July 20 as
Ocean Day and set it aside as a national holiday once again --
July 20 was a national holiday before World War II. The Japanese
royal prince and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto attended the
celebrations. On the same day, Japan officially began to
implement the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and
the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone. By so doing Japan
expanded its waters by more than 10 times -- altogether more than
6 million square kilometers, the sixth largest in the world.

It seems, therefore, that Japan's celebration of the Ocean Day is
not purely incidental. The seizure of Diaoyu Island would add to
Japan's already large waters and resources on its continental
shelf. No wonder the Japanese government connived at the
rightists' activities on Diaoyu Island.

A Rightist Comeback

While the rightists were staging their shows on Diaoyu Island,
the Japanese cabinet adopted the 1996 defense white paper. The
official document contained such statements as "continuing to
watch for trends of the Chinese military," "Russia no longer a
threat to Japan" and "further cementing military cooperation with
the United States." It specifically blamed the military exercises
conducted by the Chinese Liberation Army in March 1996 for
"creating tensions across the Taiwan Straits."

The publication of the white paper is believed to be a result of
closer US-Japanese military cooperation, which occurred after US
President Bill Clinton visited Japan in April this year. While
expanding military cooperation with the United States, Japan put
China on top of its hypothetical enemy list.

There are other signs that indicate a comeback of rightism in
Japan. Some Japanese politicians openly deny the existence of
"comfort women" that the Japanese government recruited during
World War II for its Imperial Army. Prime Minister Hashimoto
openly visited the Yasukuni Shrine which houses the remains of
many top Japanese war criminals for worship. An art show
featuring Japanese atrocities during the Nanjing Massacre of 1937
had to be canceled in Osaka because of rightist threats.

On August 15, the 51st anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War
II, some Japanese staged a farce in Yasukuni Shrine, reopening
the old wound of other Asian nations. On that day, some ex-
Imperial Army soldiers put on their military uniform with a saber
on their belt, parading around the shrine. Some Diet members
joined the farce in shouting slogans such as "the Great East Asia
War was a sacred war" and "Tojo was innocent." Then they paid
homage to the shrine honoring the war criminals.

In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II,
Japan, instead of repenting its war record, intensified its
efforts to justify their acts of war in total defiance of world
opinion. A number of ministers and Diet members denied Japan's
history of aggression and, in an attempt to divert attention from
the government's attitude toward World War II, condemned China's
nuclear testing instead.

The so-called "no-war" resolution that was supposed to assure the
world of Japan's remorse over its past and determination for
peace was adopted by the House of Representative only and failed
to address the fundamental issues.

Japan has sought to become a political and military power. In
addition to whitewashing history, it has also broken the taboos
of limiting its military spending to less than 1 percent of the
gross national product and of not sending forces overseas.
Japan's Self-Defense Forces, armed with the most advanced
offensive weapons and spending US$50 billion annually, have
become a military force to be reckoned with. In 1996, Japan
expanded its range of defense to include the entire Asia-Pacific
region. These developments have aroused suspicion and vigilance
from many of Japan's Asian neighbors, including China.

Roots

After the end of World War II, although some major war criminals
such as Hideki Tojo were condemned to hang by the International
Tribunal, a number of other die-hard militarists who held
unshirkable responsibility for launching that war of aggression
were shielded by the occupying US forces as part of the US Cold
War strategy. Shortly after the war, many war criminals who had
not paid for their military crimes were set free by the United
States or its allies. Aided by rightists in the political and
financial circles, these ex-war criminals made a comeback in the
political arena and assumed major government offices, including
the office of prime minister. The question of whether that war
was a just or an unjust one, therefore, has never been answered
in clear-cut terms in Japan.

In sharp contrast, Germany, which was one of the three Axis
powers during World War II, took a completely different attitude.
In 1970, West German Chancellor Willy Brandt knelt down in front
of the Warsaw Monument in memory of the Jews persecuted by Nazi
Germany during World War II. The world responded with
forgiveness. That act was possible because Germany under joint
occupation by the Allied powers took on a demilitarized approach
to history. In Germany, war criminals and those associated with
Nazism were under strong pressure from the government and the
society. Even to this day, Nazi war criminals at large are still
being hunted down. The Germans have been appraised of the Fascist
crimes and their grave consequences. Attempts to revive Nazism
are getting nowhere in Germany.

Japan's economic success has also lent to the uprise of the
conservative forces in Japan. With rightism and nationalism
running rampant, many Japanese choose not to confront their
history of aggression and disregard national feelings of other
peoples. Some Japanese attempt to cover up aggression in the
textbooks and the media. On the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, they confuse the perpetrators with victims of war.
Propped up by a sense of racial superiority, they increasingly
look down upon other Asian nations. In the eyes of many Japanese,
Japan is fast becoming a major power in the world.

CHINA: Backgrounder: History Proves Diaoyu Islands Are China's Territory

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China  Russia  DPRK  ROK  Japan  Diaoyu Islands  Ryukyu Islands
Taiwan Province

The Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea between China and
Japan, have belonged to China since ancient times. The islands
include some small islands and reefs, with the Diaoyu Island the
largest one covering an area of five square kilometers. Lacking
fresh water, no one can live there.

The islands are 120 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan, 200
nautical miles east of China's mainland and 200 nautical miles
west of Japan's southernmost island Okinawa.

Geologically the islands are attached to Taiwan. The waters
around the islands are 100 to 150 meters deep and there is a
2,000-meter deep oceanic trench between the islands and Japan's
Okinawa islands.

Fishermen from China's Taiwan and Fujian and other provinces have
fished and collected herbs here for centuries.

The islands are recorded in a book published during the rule of
Yong Le (1403 to 1424 AD) in the Ming Dynasty, more than 400
years before Japan claimed discovery of the Diaoyu islands in
1884. Since then many historical documents refer to the islands.

In the 15th century during the Ming Dynasty, China included the
Diaoyu Islands into its coastal defense area. In 1556, General Hu
Zongxian was appointed governor to fight Japanese pirates and
defend the coastal area including the Diaoyu Islands.

A map published in Japan between 1783 and 1785 marking the
boundary of the Ryukyu Kingdom showed the Diaoyu Islands as
belonging to China.

Japan never questioned China's sovereignty over the islands
before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895.

In April 1895, the government of the Qing Dynasty was forced to
sign the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which China ceded the whole
island of Taiwan and its surrounding islands including the Penghu
Islands to Japan.

Only since then has Japan had its own name for the area where the
Diaoyu Islands are located. Before that, Japanese maps marked the
islands by their Chinese names.

Japan was occupied by the United States after it was defeated in
World War II.

In 1951, Japan and the United States illegally signed a treaty in
San Francisco without the presence of China, which was one of the
victor countries in the World War II.

Although Article 2 of the treaty said that Japan surrendered its
claim over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, Article 3 wrongly
assigned the Diaoyu Islands, which Japan had stolen from China,
and other islands, to the Ryukyu zone which was under US control.

The then Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai lodged a strong protest and
said the Chinese government would never recognize the San
Francisco Treaty.

In a statement on territorial waters in 1958, the Chinese
government said that Japan should return all the territory of the
People's Republic of China including Taiwan and the islands
around it to China.

On November 11, 1969, Japan and the United States signed an
agreement to return the Okinawa islands to Japan. In 1971, the
United States, proceeding from its Cold War policy against China,
returned the area under its trusteeship including the Diaoyu
Islands to Japan.

The Japanese government thereby regarded the islands as a part of
its Okinawa-ken prefecture and included them in the "air defense
distinguishing rim" of its Self-Defense Forces.

On this situation, the Chinese government issued a solemn
statement on December 30, 1971, announcing that the Diaoyu
islands are islands attached to Taiwan and they, like Taiwan,
have always been an alienable part of Chinese territory since
ancient times.

Consequently, it is an indisputable fact that the Diaoyu Islands
have historically been a part of China's territory.

The issue of the Diaoyu Islands once served as an obstacle to the
normalization of Sino-Japanese relations and the conclusion of
the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship. Taking into
consideration the overall interest to develop Sino-Japanese
friendship, the then Chinese and Japanese governments agreed to
settle the issue in the future.

However, the Japanese side has broken its promise repeatedly and
provoked incidents one after another in recent years in an
attempt to seize the islands.

CHINA: US Unilateral Action Protested

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China will by no means accept the unilateral action by the United
States of cutting China's 1996 textile export quota, a spokesman
for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said
on September 7.

The United States announced on Friday that it would cut its
import quota of this year's 13 categories of textiles from China
by 195,001 dozen and 134,029 kilograms, alleging that Chinese
textile products had been trans-shipped.

The spokesman described the cut as a severe violation of the
textile agreement reached between China and the United States,
because the US government took the action unilaterally without
presenting sufficient evidence and without full consultations.

After the United States presented a number of illegal textile
trans-shipment cases to China at the end of October 1995,
according to the spokesman, the Chinese side made a careful
investigation. The two sides exchanged views in Beijing between
March 25 and 27 this year, conscientiously checking related
materials of these cases. said the spokesman.

Judging by the materials provided, some cases were engineered
either by persons engaged in trans-shipment or by importers, and
others by individuals engaged in trans-shipment in collaboration
with importers, the spokesman stated and added that the Chinese
enterprises were wholly innocent of the transactions.

To further check the cases, the Chinese side wrote to the US side
on April 26 for more evidence. To date, however, the US side had
not provided any, but instead has made a unilateral assumption,
the spokesman noted. The Chinese government will by no means
accept it, he stressed.

The spokesman pointed out that the US government has continuously
raised obstacles to China's export of textiles to the United
States in recent years, severely hindering the Sino-US textile
trade.

He said that the Chinese government hopes that the Clinton
administration will reconsider its decision, with a stand
conducive to the development of Sino-US trade, and cancel the
import deduction action.

Otherwise, the spokesman said, the Chinese government will have
to respond further and the US side will be responsible for the
consequences.

CHINA: Minority Cities Step Up Opening

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

A number of cities in ethnic minority regions of China have made
satisfying achievements in foreign trade and inter-city economic
cooperation, according to a meeting of mayors from capital cities
of the country's autonomous regions which was held recently in
Hohhot, capital of Inner Mongolia.

Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, completed
370 economic cooperation projects valued at 400 million yuan over
the past five years. During the first two quarters of this year
alone, foreign-funded enterprises in Urumqi exported products
valued at about US$13 million, up 65 percent on the 1995 period,
with major exports centering on machinery, clothing and woolen
products.

Hohhot has established cooperative ventures with some 20-odd
nations and regions in the wool spinning, electronics and leather
processing industries. It is currently home to some 180 foreign-
funded firms which yielded a total output value of 760 million
yuan.

Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, has established
solid relations with 15 foreign and domestic cities. It sponsors
economic and trade talks during the annual Sour Milk Festival
with last year's talks ending with consummation of 17 agreements.

Yanji City in east China's Jilin Province, approved 17 foreign-
funded enterprises during the first six months this year, raising
the number of such ventures in the city to 383, with total
investments reaching US$4.4 billion.

CHINA: Grain Yields Exceed Expectations

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

The Chinese government procured 9.08 million tons of early rice
by the end of August this year, substantially surpassing figures
covered by the purchase contracts signed with farmers last year.

According to its contracts with the farmers, the state had
expected to purchase 7.96 million tons of early rice.

A report released by the State Grain Reserve Administration
attributed the increased purchase to this summer's record-
breaking early rice harvest of 44 million tons -- an increase of
1.79 million tons from last year.

Summer grain generally accounts for 25 percent of the total
annual grain yield.

Although the total rice yield surpassed expectations, not all of
the 10 major early rice producing provinces enjoyed increased
harvests this year. Jiangxi, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Hainan have
increased their early rice production, but Anhui, Hubei and
Sichuan provinces, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, all
of which have experienced heavy floods, were unable to meet last
year's rice yield.

With bumper harvests and high sale prices, each farmer expects to
enjoy a net income of 1,800 yuan this year, an increase of about
5 percent over last year.

However, cotton harvests this year will probably decrease by more
than 1 million tons from the 4.5 million tons harvested last
year, according to agricultural sources.

CHINA: Healthy School Meals

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Students who eat lunch at school can expect safer and more
nutritious meals, following a new regulation on the hygiene of
school meals.

The regulation was introduced by the Ministry of Public Health
recently and is targeted at improving the quality of school
meals, reducing cases of food poisoning and guaranteeing the
healthy physical development of Chinese children.

Under this regulation, all staff preparing and distributing
school meals must receive professional training in nutrition. The
meals must meet national hygiene standards and be properly
packaged to avoid contamination during transportation.

The regulation also encourages each school to assign a special
supervisor to oversee the general quality of the meals.

The ministry has also made public the daily intake of nutrients
recommended for children as reference for meal providers.

Schools are required to order meals only from licensed producers.
They must set up facilities for storing the meals hygienically
and for students to wash their hands and clean utensils.

Meal suppliers and schools who violate the above regulations will
be punished according to the food hygiene legislation. Serious
cases will be brought to court.

In Beijing, about 20 percent of all school children eat school
meals, according to a sample survey of 1,100 schools taken last
year.

About 5 percent of the meals are provided by individual
producers, the rest by school canteens.

School lunches are convenient for both students and their
families, but some meals are inadequate and pose a threat to the
students' health, said Zhu Peifu, a spokesman from the Ministry
of Public Health. He said some meal providers sell unhygienic or
even spoiled food to the students, and this can result in food
poisoning.

CHINA: Rail Opens Linking Beijing and HK

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China's new backbone railway line linking Beijing with Kowloon
officially opened on September 1. The first passenger train left
Beijing West Station the same day and arrived at its destination-
-Shenzhen 38 hours later.

At the opening ceremony in Beijing, Railway Minister Han Zhubin
said that the line will greatly alleviate the country's north-
south transportation pressure and improve China's overall railway
system.

The railway runs 2,553 km through Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong,
Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi and Guangdong before reaching Hong
Kong.

Sources from the ministry say that initially 40 freight trains
and 10 passenger trains will run daily at an average speed of 60
km per hour. The new passenger trains will run between Beijing
and Shenzhen, Beijing and Hefei, Jiujiang and Shenzhen, and
Wuchang and Shantou. Tianjin to Lianyungang services will also
make use of the new line.

The railway bureaus of Beijing, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Shanghai,
Nanchang plus the Guangzhou Railway Corp will share management.

Shenzhen people celebrated, convinced that the line will benefit
the fast growing economic development of Guangdong Province and
improve relations between the province and Hong Kong.

Officials from Shantou, Dongguan, Huizhou and Heyuan cities
located along the new rail line in Guangdong are even more
delighted. Months before the railway opened they had organized
trade fairs in Hong Kong to woo investors.

Heyuan and Huizhou cities are deliberating opening foreign
railway ports to link directly with Hong Kong, which now accounts
for about 70 percent of Guangdong's foreign investment and 80
percent of the province's foreign trade.

"The operation of the railway will also benefit Hong Kong," a
senior Hong Kong railway official said at a press conference in
Shenzhen on September 1.

The Ministry of Railways is ready to open passenger train
services between the Chinese capital and Hong Kong, according to
Sun Yongfu, vice-minister of railways.

The construction of the 40 billion yuan railway project started
in 1993 and was completed last November. Students Guaranteed

CHINA: Archives: Records For Future

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Archives would become increasingly important in the 21st century,
Chinese Premier Li Peng said when addressing the opening ceremony
of the 13th International Congress on Archives in Beijing on
September 2.

People need to draw on the wisdom and experience of their
predecessors to achieve development and prosperity and to deal
with complicated circumstances, Li said.

Over 2,600 delegates from 130 countries and regions attended the
six-day global congress -- the first held in a developing country
since the International Council of Archives (ICA) was set up in
1950. It was also the last grand gathering of top world
archivists for this century.

The theme of the congress is ''archives at the end of the
century, taking stock and looking ahead.''

Archives are the authentic recordings of the social activities of
human beings, stepping stones of the progress of human
civilization and an important component of the world cultural
heritage, the Chinese Premier said.

He called upon the international archive community to further
preserve and enhance the world's valuable heritage and provide
authentic historical records for future generations.

China has a long history and is a nation with a brilliant
culture, Li said, adding that thanks to the fine tradition of a
long-standing commitment to archives, the Chinese culture has
been carried forward from generation to generation and the
Chinese civilization maintains its strong cohesive force.

He said the Chinese government always looks upon the archives as
a major undertaking for preserving the original features of a
nation and as an important resource for the administration and
development of a country.

Governments at all levels attach importance to strengthening
guidance and supervision over archival work and have brought such
work in line with the agenda of various administrations and
social-development programs to ensure continuous and healthy
progress.

"Archives have played an important role in the Chinese reform and
opening policy and in its socialist modernization drive,'' Li
said.

The congress discussed the history and future of archival work in
various countries, global trends in legislation on archives, the
development strategy of international archival circles and other
important issues.

CHINA: Forum on Asia: A Commitment to Peace

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China's destiny is closely linked with that of other countries in
Asia, Chinese Premier Li Peng said while addressing the 21st
Century Forum.

"China's development needs a stable and prosperous Asia; and
Asia's development needs a stable and prosperous China," Li added
in his keynote speech entitled "The Impact of China's Development
and the Rise of Asia on the World".

The premier stated that China will always be committed to world
peace. "The Chinese government and the Chinese people care
greatly about the future of Asia, and we stand ready to work with
other Asian countries for the stability and development of this
region," Li added.

The forum, sponsored by the country's top political advisory
body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(CPPCC), was closed on September 6 after three days of
discussions. Over 500 statesmen and scholars from across the
globe, including former US President George Bush, former US
Secretary of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger and former
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, attended the forum.

The participants discussed China's role in the next century and
future political and economic trends for Asia's development.

The forum concluded that Asia has a promising 21st century and
that it should contribute even more to world peace and
development.

According to Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, one of the
participants at the forum, the next century will see Asia recover
its place in the world.

"For East Asia to maintain its rapid growth, peace and stability
must be secured. East and West together are responsible for the
future," Lee remarked while addressing the forum.

He also suggested that various nations learn to accommodate and
adjust to each other, even when they cannot agree.

He said that although most Western analysts view the rise of
China as a de-stabilizing influence on the present world order,
China has the power to demonstrate that, in the year 2020, a
huge, prosperous nation of 1.3 billion people, with a per-capita
GDP about one-fourth of that in the United States, can only be
better for the world than an impoverished and unstable nation of
the same population.

Lee emphasized that growth in China and the rest of East Asia
will provide opportunities for the West, and will also produce a
steadier global balance, both economic and strategic.

Talking about relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits, Lee said that he considered it impossible for Taiwan to
be independent against the will of a united and an economically
powerful China.

In his opinion, the two sides of the Straits should not get into
military competition, and neither the United States nor Europe
should look for excuses to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan.

Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in his remarks
at the forum that the United States and China have a common stake
in Asia's progress and stability and must work together to make a
"decisive contribution to work order".

"Some in America are calling for a containment policy toward
China as they watch her rise to industrial strength. But this is
an illusion," Kissinger stated emphatically, adding, "Such a
policy would have exactly the opposite effect and will have no
takers."

CHINA-CULTURE: The Sci & Ed Program Behind Olympic Golds

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

ZHANG YANHUI

Xu Yiming, chief coach of the Chinese Diving Team, is training Fu
Mingxia with a kind of special apparatus.

While people acclaim the combatant spirit and superb skills of
the Chinese athletes at the 26th Olympic Games, few know that
behind the athletes and coaches embracing each other for the
victories, there is a cause that helps the moulding of gold
medalists--the Science and Education Program of the State
Physical Culture and Sports Commission (SPCSC).

Athletics has evolved from the first stages of running, jumping,
throwing and pushing to the high level of today. In human
challenge to the limit of physical potential, it is not enough to
merely rely on the arduous training of athletes. They should know
at what time and under what condition can each muscle of the body
give forth the greatest strength, and be good at using it, just
as they should do in relation to a precision instrument. This is
what the sports scientific research studies.

According to Lu Xiaojie, deputy head of the Science and
Technology Division under the Department of Science and Education
of the SPCSC, the domestic sports scientific research focuses on
four fields of sports psychology, fatigue elimination, skill
appraisal and skill examination. The commission has allocated
special money since 1985 for scientific research and technical
service. It put in 2 million yuan in 1994 and organized 200
experts from 20 scientific research institutions into groups to
apply research results in practice. Among the 56 scientific
research subjects, major events, such as gymnastics, swimming and
weightlifting, involve excellent athletes Wang Junxia, Gao
Hongmiao and Cheng Xiaoyan who have special subject groups to
help monitor and instruct their training.

Li Furong, director of the SPCSC Training Bureau, noted that an
important experience of the Chinese Table-Tennis Team in
maintaining their dominance in the world for over three decades
is placing priority on theory. In effect, the remarkable progress
made in many other sports events is inseparable from sports
scientific research. The experts of the Chinese Swimming Team
examine and monitor the physiological and biochemical indexes of
each athlete every day. It often happens that the detailed data
of the morning training have already been delivered to the
coaches before the start of afternoon training, thus effectively
supporting the scientific sports training.

It's a long-term task for sports scientific research to enhance
the scientific training to a higher level. According to Lu, the
applied basic research in China mainly relies on the over 40
institutions and some universities throughout the country. A
relatively stable scientific research team has been formed. Every
year, a group of graduates from Tsinghua, Peking and Beijing
Medical Science universities will continue their advanced studies
at the sports institutions and will become the reserve force of
China's sports scientific research.

"The competition of athletes on the arena is actually a test of
the level of the coaches' scientific training. The athletes with
excellent coaches have grasped the initiative of winning.'' said
Yuan Weimin, vice-minister the SPCSC and the world-famous coach
who had led the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team to marvelous
achievements.

In 1982, the SPCSC set up a special office of cultural education
in charge of the training of coaches. As briefed by Li Quanqiang,
deputy head of the office, the current coaches' training system
consists of four parts including academic education, professional
training, short-term training and information service. According
to a survey at 29 provinces and cities in 1995, 61 percent of the
25,000 full-time coaches have received an education at or above
college level, 16 percent of whom have the same level of
education as undergraduates.

During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), the SPCSC
will carry out a wider professional training plan for coaches
throughout the country in order to provide basic training for
over 90 percent coaches, accelerating the construction of
teaching materials and a teachers' contingent and finally form a
training network with several training centers at the core,
covering more areas nationwide. Beginning from the year 2000,
those coaches who haven't got a qualified certificate of
professional training will not be allowed to apply for position
or promotion.

Analysed by SPCSC officials, competition on the arena in the next
15 years will be manifest more and more as the competition for
science and technology and the Science and Education Program will
help prepare China's athletics for future competitions.

CHINA-CULTURE: Female Orchestra Graces Beijing Stage

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

The Women's Philharmonic Orchestra (WPO), consisting of 80 female
members led by the renown conductor Zheng Xiaoying, presented a
mid-August concert in the Beijing Concert Hall.

The audience was delighted with the repertoire which included the
overture for The Marriage of Figaro and various selections by the
orchestra's string section. They  also heard superb renditions of
Zhang Lida's first violin concerto entitled Indistinct Harmony,
Xu Zhenmin's symphonic fantasy Snow-Covered Plum Garden, and
Symphony No.9 by Shostakovich.

The event represented the orchestra's second performance since
its debut during the Fourth World Conference on Women. The latest
performance brought back memories of the WPO's September debut to
mark the opening of the FWCW, an event which won acclaim from the
thousands of female deputies from across the world.

The Women's Philharmonic Orchestra grew from a chamber orchestra
founded six years ago by more than 30 professional musicians from
different Beijing art troupes and conservatories of music.

The chamber orchestra focused on introducing Chinese, foreign
classics and modern music to the widest possible Chinese
audience, especially young people, with members raising funds to
present more than 200 performances.

In 1993, leaders of the orchestra began selecting and training
female musicians proficient in wind instruments, and in turn
formed the existing female symphony orchestra.

In addition to established professional performers, the orchestra
also includes students from the Central Conservatory of Music and
various middle schools. All musicians, ranging from teenagers to
the elderly, are required to fulfill designated standards.

According to violinist Situ Zhiwen, one of the founders, the
Women's Philharmonic Orchestra provides an excellent opportunity
for nurturing young female musicians.

CHINA-CULTURE: Sino-US Archeological Cooperation

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

A Sino-US archeological team, consisting of representatives from
the Henan Institute of Archeology and the Anthropology Department
from the University of Missouri, proceeded under the auspices of
the State Bureau of Cultural Relics to conduct a highly fruitful
survey between June-August this year. The survey, which covered
an area of 100 km in the upper reaches of the Yinghe River
Valley, focused on village ruins dating from the late Longshan to
the Erlitou cultures. The team used the global satellite
positioning and geographic information systems for the research
project.

The team defined the range, period and cultural significance of
all sites, and precisely determined the geographic location,
longitude, latitude and elevation. The data obtained was then
entered into the database of the geographic information system,
which in turn yielded computerized color relief maps for each and
every ruins site. The team's accomplishments provided accurate
positioning for future surveys, as well as laid a solid base for
trial excavations and further studies scheduled for next year.

The new approaches adopted by the joint team were of great
academic value with regard to research into the disintegration of
the primitive society, the emergence of private ownership and
countries, formation of the slave system and the origin of
Chinese civilization.

CHINA-CULTURE: New Trade Emerges From Culture

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Along with the newly emerging industrialists, creators, planners,
advertisers and designers, culture has entered the market and
social lives in the form of industrialization in recent years.

Engaging a large group of experts, scholars, artists, writers,
journalists and cultural agents as their consultants, the planner
companies have suddenly emerged as a new force early in the
1990s. They have become one of main strengths in the cultural
sector in a short time, because they start from a high point,
cover a wide-ranging area and are good at grasping the
characteristics of metropolitan culture. With the continuous
extension of cultural planner management, the market is expanding
increasingly, and cartoon companies, subject selection publishing
agencies and other sectors are constantly merging.

Generally speaking, people engaged in dress designing must have
their own factories and outlets. However, a fashion company,
which opened business not long ago in Beijing, is neither
producing ready-made clothes nor selling them, but engages in
selling designs. According to reports, over the past two months
the company has sold more than 40 designs to over 10  clothing
companies.

In Shanghai, watching TV has been regarded as a profession, a new
fashion trend of media investigation. In step with Shanghai being
an open international market, advertising has developed rapidly.
Those enterprises, clients and advertising agents who spend huge
amounts of money for advertising in TV naturally care that their
advertisements are broadcast correctly and on schedule. So,
spending just a little sum of money each month, they can have
their advertisements done by so-called ``watching TV company''
and can obtain an accurate broadcast record, thus making this
really a necessary matter.

The supplying of this data is only part of the companies'
business. Their main business is to offer more materials of
competitive brand-name products. Relying on their materials,
producers make appropriate readjustment for their ad. planning
when a new product brand is put on the market.

Some experts hold information and knowledge, creation and
designing, culture and art, appearing as new industries, have
become a new point of economic growth in today's China. The
management of culture with the viewpoint of creating and selling
it has become a general trend and opened a realm for an ever-
fiercer competitive market. At the same time, the economic
infiltration has injected vigor into the prospering culture.

CHINA-BUSINESS: Petroleum Exploration Welcomed

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

China has recently abandoned the practice of prioritizing oil
exploration by administrative divisions.

To better manage the resource and attract foreign oil firms to
make exploration in China, responsible department has divided the
country's potential oil fields into four categories: areas for
foreign cooperation and bidding; areas inviting bids for risk
exploration by domestic oil-gas enterprises; exploring areas for
state-owned companies and exploring areas managed by oil gas
fields.

A spokesman of the China National Oil and Gas Exploration and
Development Corp. (CNOGEDC) said this new mechanism will help
expand the range of oil exploration, particularly in oil-abundant
basins in west China which have lied idle for a long time.

Thus far, China has opened to the outside world 2.50 million
square km of oil exploration areas, and signed more than 30
contracts and agreements for risk oil explorations with foreign
oil companies. Foreign business people, in line with these
contracts, have started exploration in areas covering 150,000
square km.

Domestic oil-gas firms have also exhibited great enthusiasm in
the bidding of western oil exploration areas. Not long ago,
Daqing, Shengli and North China oilfields won the bidding for
exploring blocks covering 117,000 square km in the northwest,
southwest and east sections of the Tarim Basin.

The CNOGEDC will provide both domestic and overseas explorers
with information on oil bearing regions in the country, in the
hopes of enhancing the success rate.

The corporation predicted that under the new mechanism, four or
five oil fields will be discovered this year with combined
exploitable capacities exceeding 120 million tons.

CHINA-BUSINESS: Ing Barings Offers Chinese Stocks

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Sources from Barings Shanghai revealed that Ing Barings
successfully helped two Chinese enterprises issue stocks valued
at US$140 million between July 15-19.

Barings itself purchased stocks valued at US$100 million outright
from the China Overseas Land Investment Corp., a Hong Kong listed
company under the Ministry of Construction. Said corporation, one
of the major construction companies in Hong Kong, had market
capital valued at US$1.1 billion prior to the new stock issue.

The corporation decided to float new stocks valued at US$100
million in order to expand investments in infrastructure
facilities and meet the need for capital funding. Barings sold
its outright stock purchase within only one day, with 40 percent
of the stocks going to Asia, 39 percent to Europe, and 21 percent
to the United States.

The Barings also floated B-shares in Shenzhen for the Wuxi
Little Swan Co. Ltd., a company engaged in the design,
development and manufacture of automatic washing machines. The
goal of the B-share issue valued at US$40.4 million was to expand
the company's production capacity and provide capital needed for
investments in a joint venture operated by companies from
Matsushita of Japan and Siemens A. G. of Germany. Barings
successfully sold the shares to investors in Asia (88 percent,
Europe (7 percent), and the United States (5 percent). Investors
were introduced to the stock issues during meetings held in Hong
Kong, Singapore, London and Edinburgh.

CHINA-BUSINESS: Beijing International Auto Show

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

Beijing plans to host an annual International Automobile Industry
Exhibition in either June or July beginning in 1997. The
exhibition will be held in the China International Exhibition
Center.

The decision to hold the annual event is designed to solve
problems resulting from the fact that frequent exhibitions
previously held in Beijing placed a heavy burden on exhibitors.

The first international automobile exhibition was held in 1993.
The two exhibitions held last June attracted several hundred
domestic and foreign auto manufacturers and well over 700,000
people.

Public opinion indicates that the comprehensive annual
international auto industrial exhibition will ensure authority
needed to promote exchanges and cooperation between the domestic
and international automobile industries.

The annual exhibition will be jointly sponsored by the Ministry
of Machine-Building Industry, the China National Automotive
Industry Corp., the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade, and the China Automotive Industry
Association.

Latest statistics indicate that the country's current annual
demand for motor vehicles stands at 11.5 million units. China
imported almost 2.13 million motor vehicles valued at US$21.8
billion between 1980-95, including nearly 1.05 million buses
valued at US$7.48 billion. The figures exclude units imported
through informal channels.

CHINA-BUSINESS: CITIC Expands Transnational Trade

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

A joint bid group consisting of two New Zealand companies and
CITIFOR Inc., an overseas subsidiary of the China International
Trust and Investment Corp., won timbering rights to large tract
of forest offered by the New Zealand government.  The group won
the rights on August 20, 1996, with a bid of US$1.34 billion. The
corporation's effort represents an important strategy adopted to
consolidate overseas affairs, expand its transnational
businesses, and eliminate shortages of resources on both the
domestic and international markets.

The 188,000 hectares of forest land is expected to yield between
3.1-3.6 million cubic meters of timber.  CITIFOR Inc. holds 37.5
percent of the stock in the project, with the other two
companies--the Lion Group and Brierley--respectively holding 37.5
percent and 25 percent shares. Funding was obtained in accordance
with the common international practice of a non-recourse loan.

The establishment of CITIFOR Inc. in the United  States was
designed to solve resource shortages on Chinese markets and
expand overseas markets. Over the past 10-odd years, the company
has accumulated vast experience in international market
competition. In recent years, CITIFOR has attempted to expand
forest land development by opening markets in Chile, Canada,
Japan, and the Republic of Korea. The related operations
undertake intensive processing activities in the forest industry,
and seek opportunities to develop high value-added forest
products.

The New Zealand investment will create new opportunities for the
company's further development.

CHINA-BUSINESS: Guangzhou Fair to Attract HK Firms

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

The '96 China International Children's Commodities Fair,
sponsored by the Guangzhou city government and the China Council
for the Promotion of International Trade, will be held in the
China Foreign Trade Center in Guangzhou between December 6-10.

The Hong Kong Trade and Development Council (HKTDC) plans to
organize a large delegation of firms to participate in the fair.
The fair's Hong Kong Hall will provide the region's firms with an
opportunity to tap the vast market potential for domestic
children's commodities.

China's 300 million children under 14 years old account for one-
fourth of the nation's total population. The vast market
potential cannot be neglected, said Yin Shuzhen, deputy manager
of the HKTDC Promotion Section.

"Traditionally, the Chinese pay great attention to  the
upbringing of future generations. The quality of life for
children is rising continually along with the development of the
domestic economy. China's one-child policy allowed parents to
allocate additional funds needed for rearing children. The
advantageous conditions have helped to form a sizeable market for
children's goods." said Yin.

"The fair, the first of its kind to be held in Guangzhou, will
provide children's goods manufacturers in Hong Kong with
opportunities to engage in trade talks and discuss cooperative
ventures with buyers and traders from all over China. Yin added,
"the fair will also help to expand markets."

 Participants will offer various types of children's clothing,
adornments, stationery, toys, electronic games, health foods,
commodities for infants, educational materials and musical
instruments.

CHINA-BUSINESS: VISA Introduces VSAT Technology

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

The Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) system now enables
China's VISA member banks to enjoy the great convenience of
international credit card transactions, with successful tests of
VSAT recently carried out in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Application
of the VSAT technology has provided China's member banks with
"wireless" links to VisaNet, VISA's global authorization,
clearance and settlement network.

The VSAT system makes it possible to link various local
authorized transactions without leasing telephone networks. Users
across China can now carry out credit card settlement procedures
with maximum ease and security. The VSAT system enables banks to
relay and receive settlement information from data processing
centers in the United States and Japan within seconds. But
currently, direct telephone links with VISA data processing
centers are necessary.

Application of the reliable VSAT system eliminates former
geographical barriers, and more importantly overcomes the
insufficient capacity of telephone networks in some countries.
China's credit card industry can now enter the stage of rapid
international business development. In addition, installing the
VSAT system requires only one-third of the time previously needed
to install traditional or digital telephone lines.

According to Raymond Chan, VISA executive vice-president and
general manager for North Asia, China is the first country in
North Asia to use VSAT for international credit card
transactions. The advanced technology effectively overrides the
inadequacies of the previous network and provides immediate
possibilities for the internationalization of China's credit card
industry.

CHINA-BUSINESS: New Measure for Foreign Exchange

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

On July 1 this year, the People's Bank of China introduced a
measure of allowing foreign-funded enterprises to deal directly
with banks when settling or selling foreign exchange.
Implementation of the new measure represents a major step leading
to the eventual convertibility of the renminbi under current
accounts, and has helped to link China more closely with the
international economic system. In addition, it has enabled
foreign-funded enterprises to promote efficiency when settling or
selling foreign exchange, and has strengthened the confidence of
overseas investors in the mainland market.

Implementation of the new measure has narrowed the gap between
China's existing exchange control system and stipulations in
Article 8 of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund.
The effort has also demonstrated China's determination to further
its opening policy. At the same time, ongoing implementation
effort has created favorable conditions for ensuring the future
free convertibility of the renminbi.

Application of the new measure has provided a favorable
environment for promoting the economic development of inland
China, and has exerted major influence in the following areas. It
has enabled foreign-funded enterprises to promote efficiency in
settling and selling foreign exchange, with said enterprises now
enjoying the same rights as domestic enterprises to buy foreign
exchange under current accounts. In addition, they can settle and
sell foreign exchange by presenting appropriate documentation to
banks and the foreign exchange control administration has no
need to examine or approve them.

The new measure permits foreign-funded enterprises to complete
all formalities for the settlement and sale of foreign exchange
with banks, or to buy and sell foreign exchange through foreign
exchange regulation centers as before. The measure thus expands
channels available for foreign-funded enterprises to buy and sell
foreign exchange.

Banks can now determine exchange rate quotations in accordance
with market supply and demand. Service charges are waived and
exchange rates for purchases of over US$1 million are subject to
negotiation. Bank calculations for foreign exchange are more
flexible than those at foreign exchange regulation centers.

The new measure has greatly reduced the 3-4-day period foreign-
funded enterprises were previously required to complete all
transaction procedures at foreign exchange regulation centers.
The new measure enables traders to immediately settle accounts in
banks.

In addition, the Chinese government has standardized market
management by tightening supervision and control of the exchange
accounts of foreign-funded enterprises.

China plans to offer various major transnational oil companies
the opportunity to participate in a number of new cooperative
projects in petroleum and gas exploration and development.

Cooperative ventures will involve risk exploration for oil and
gas in west China and the Songliao Plains, with efforts to tap
natural gas reserves focusing on Sichuan Province and the Qaidam
and Tarim basins.

China has launched cooperative land oil exploration projects in
21 provinces and autonomous regions. In addition, the China
National Oil and Natural Gas Corp. is involved in cooperative
ventures with 32 foreign partners which include 28 of the world
top 50 oil producers. Foreign capital so far introduced has
reached US$500 million.

China has also developed considerable oil and natural gas
production capacity in overseas areas, while gaining rights to
prospect, participate in share-holding ventures and tap oil in a
number of countries, including Peru, Russia, Thailand, Canada,
Papua New Guinea and Sudan.

CHINA: China's Agriculture: Hopeful Despite Existing Problems

from BEIJING REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 39, SEPTEMBER 23-29, 1996

by Our Staff Reporter Zhou Xin

Jorgen Delman, a 1982 economics graduate from Peking University,
returned to Denmark and earned a Ph.D. with a doctorate thesis on
the promotion of Chinese agriculture. Delman formerly worked in
the China office of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, and
now serves as director of the China-EU Center for Agricultural
Technology (CECAT) which was established in 1990.

CECAT, a highly successful agricultural technology popularization
center comparable to the Sino-Israeli Demonstration Farm, is
located in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. CECAT has scored
remarkable success over the past five years by playing an
intermediate role in promoting both domestic and overseas
agrotechnological and economic cooperation. The EU Committee has
decided to continue its investments in the center. Thus far,
investments from China and EU have totaled well over 100 million
yuan.

Delman, an eyewitness of China's agricultural development over
the past 10-plus years, provided the following answers to
questions during a recent interview:

Question:  How wide is the gap between Chinese  and modern
European agriculture?

Answer:  China can learn at least two very important things from
Europe. The first and foremost lesson centers on raising
agricultural efficiency, a major issue currently facing China,
and in particular, raising the economic efficiency of individual
farmers. Secondly, China has consistently emphasized increased
gross output, but it should also consider eliminating waste.
China wastes excessive amounts of grain, vegetables, fruit and
meat between the harvest and purchasing cycle. Nonetheless,
technology is readily available to solve the related basic
problems.

The key problem concerns the availability of land, or the scale
of a farm. A small farm makes it difficult to raise efficiency.
The solution rests with private ownership, a previous practice
which seems not to work on Chinese agriculture. Yet another
measure centers on practicing economy of scale by mechanizing
joint production, which has already been introduced in many of
China's major suburban areas. The rural population in some areas
has dropped, with the figure for Chongqing City standing at only
5 percent of the total, or the same level as Denmark. On the
other hand, however, the rural population in Sichuan Province
accounts for between 60-70 percent of the total. Therefore, China
should formulate policies in accordance with the population,
especially in southern areas where there are sharp contradictions
between population and land.

Another problem centers on high prices. China Daily recently
reported that prices for several agricultural products have
surpassed prices on the world market. The problem is most likely
the result of high production costs, excessive waste and poor
circulation efficiency. In terms of the latter, the large number
of intermediate organizations have led to price differences for
farm produce. While similar problems exist in European countries,
but the gaps involved are much less noticeable. For example,
farmers in Denmark and the Netherlands control the entire
circulation process from production to consumption. I recently
learned that China's Ministry of Agriculture will  introduce a
farm produce wholesale market as part of its ``Vegetable Basket''
project to protect the interests of both producers and consumers.
China's high prices and low-level production technology make it
possible to solve all related problems, and the central
government has announced it will raise the level of investment
and technology in agriculture.

Q: Will technology play a major role in China's agricultural
sector?

A:  The market is the key factor, with one of the major roles of
technology being to provide products for the market. Animal
husbandry developed rapidly on China's eastern plains following
an effort by the Ministry of Agriculture to promote the use of
straw as feed. The ensuing success proves it wrong to believe
that the area lacked potential for animal husbandry. The
livestock market on the plains is indeed more promising than
those in the Inner Mongolian and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous
regions due to its close proximity to consumers and low costs.

Raising the efficiency of agriculture depends on a number of
factors, including technology, organization and the type of
economic system. CECAT primarily focuses on providing technology
needed to solve problems, to meet the needs of the market, and to
help farmers raise both their income levels and living standards.

Technological problems demanding prompt solutions center on
specialized feed and searching for grain replacements. In this
regard, China has introduced unconventional feed products to
sustain 20 million head of cattle in developed livestock areas in
Hebei, Henan and Shandong provinces.

Q: What is the scope of Sino-European agrotechnology
cooperation?

A:  China can easily find cooperative partners in European
countries. Earlier this year, CECAT organized a visit by a
delegation of 20-odd North European fishing companies interested
in providing fisheries technology to China. Next year, the
Netherlands will provide a soft loan of US$5 million for the
construction of an animal protein feed plant in Chengdu, capital
of Sichuan Province. CECAT is directly involved in the project
which looks very promising since China faces a shortage of animal
protein feed and related prices continue to rise.

Countries with close cooperative relations with China include
Denmark, the Netherlands, France and Britain. I firmly believe
there is also great potential for cooperative relations with a
number of other countries. Spain faces severe water shortages on
the same scale as China. I visited the former last year and found
extensive Spanish technology which would highly usable to China,
especially northern areas. CECAT is currently extending great
effort to promote agricultural cooperation between China and
Spain.

Q: What are the prospects for Chinese agriculture to attract
foreign investment?

A:  Regardless of certain difficulties, there is still great
potential for some projects to attract foreign investment. Rising
prices for Chinese agricultural products will serve as yet
another magnet for attracting foreign investment. In addition,
demand will continue to increase along with the constantly rising
income levels of Chinese citizens. I regularly tell foreign food-
processing businesses of the vast potential for food markets in
China's major cities over the next 10 years. Some companies,
including breweries, meat and dairy processors, have already
begun operations in China.

The key to attracting investors rests with the transparency of
China's entire system. The level of transparency is, in fact,
much higher than that of only 10 years ago. For example, a few
short years ago prices for farm produce seemed to be regarded as
state secrets. Now, however, prices are regularly carried by
publications such as Farmer's Daily. While investing in China is
much easier than ever before, success and the level of returns
rest with the type of project and one's understanding of the
market. CECAT is working to help raise the level of transparency
by providing foreign firms with timely information concerning the
situation in China.

Q: You have observed Chinese agriculture for the past 10 years.
Can China solve its grain and agricultural issues?

A: China has great prospects for the gradual development of
agricultural development. While China currently imports some
grain, the volume is significantly lower than some foreign
claims. Chinese agriculture can ensure the country's needs, with
the growth rate of grain output outstripping the population
growth rate for the past 10 years. While grain development has
been somewhat sluggish, areas such as meat and animal husbandry
have been growing rapidly, thereby indicating China's vast
resources and potential.

 BRAZIL: CARDOSO DECREES EXPORT INCENTIVES AS REFORMS LANGUISH IN CONGRESS

 Successive defeats in congress for the government's constitutional reform 
programme appear to have convinced the government that stimulating economic 
growth cannot wait for passage of the amendments to the pension, tax and 
administrative systems. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has begun to use 
decrees (medidas provisorias) to implement essential reforms, thereby 
skirting the need to secure a two-thirds congressional majority, and without 
putting at risk the stabilisation achieved through the Plano Real.

 For first of these came on 19 June, when Cardoso announced a series of 
incentives for manufactured exports, which have suffered from the Plano 
Real's high interest rates and over-valued currency.

 These were in part a response to heavy pressure from the Sao Paulo 
employers' organisations, which had warned that they were no longer in a 
position to compete. The government was forced to admit that some industries 
had been made to suffer as a result of the stabilisation policies adopted in 
January 1995, and the time had come to help them out.

 The main element of the export incentives is a US Dollars 1bn credit line, 
to be administered by the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico 
(BNDES). Loans will be made over 15 months at interest rates of 5.5% above 
Libor. That will mean a one-third reduction in financial costs, according to 
the new planning minister, Antonio Kandir.

 Ten sectors are to benefit from the new facilities: footwear, clothing, car 
parts, furniture, ornamental stones, ceramics, domestic appliances, 
electronic goods, tools and plastics.

 The shoe, textile and car parts industries are in dire need of 
restructuring to make them competitive with imports in the newly liberalised 
market. 

 The government hopes the stimulus will add some US Dollars 1bn to the US 
Dollars 46.5bn in exports registered last year. Cardoso has pointed out that 
the impressive expansion in Brazil's foreign trade in recent years has still 
not made much impact on overall world trade: Brazil accounts for less than 
1% of the total.

 The Sao Paulo employers' association, Fiesp, has welcomed the measures as 
the equivalent of a devaluation of the Real -which the government has ruled 
out.

 Kandir's appointment in place of Jose Serra (see Page 7, inside), has also 
been welcomed by the private sector as an indication that the privatisation 
programme will be pushed through more energetically than in the recent past. 
Despite his identification with the Collor Plan, with its confiscation of 
private savings, Kandir is a repected technocrat who is expected to get 
things done.

 BRAZIL: LAND: CARDOSO THREATENS TO HALT INVASIONS: BUT AT SAME TIME RHYTHM 
OF EXPROPRIATIONS IS PICKING UP

 The strains that continuing conflict in the countryside is putting on 
government policy were demonstrated in mid-June by two apparently 
contradictory developments: President Cardoso warned that land occupations 
would in future be treated as a national security issue, with the army being 
used to evict invaders; and the estate where such an eviction led to a 
massacre in April was expropriated by the agrarian reform ministry.

 Maranhao incident. Cardoso's tougher line with the Movimento dos Sem-Terra 
(MST) was partly explained by an incident in the forests of Maranhao state, 
where three security guards and one landless labourer were killed on 13 June 
when the guards tried to prevent MST members from re-occupying a logging 
estate from which they had previously been expelled.

 Fears that MST tactics would lead to growing violence in the countryside 
have led landowners to recruit private security guards to protect their 
estates, and the government is concerned that local militants may be out of 
the control of the MST leadership.

 These fears appeared to be confirmed on 21 June, when a Para landowner, 
Carlos Alberto Oliveira Neto, blamed the MST for the violent occupation of 
his property near Conceica de Araguaia, in which a foreman was wounded and 
13 workers kidnapped. But the MST said the attack was the work of gumnen 
trying to take advantage of the turbulence caused by pressure for land 
reform.

 MST defiant. The MST gave its answer to Cardoso when, on 20 June, 200 
activists occupied the local government building in Vitoria, state capital 
of Espirito Santo state. They had earlier staged several invasions of 
agrarian reform ministry installations, to the annoyance of minister Raul 
Jungmann.

 He had already announced that the Macaxeira estate in Para, where 19 MST 
members were killed by military police on 17 April, would be taken over and 
distributed among about 600 people. The agrarian reform institute, Incra, 
had earlier declined to expropriate the 6,000 hectare estate, after its 
owners claimed it was properly and productively run. Another Incra 
inspection subsequently established that this was not true.

 On 24 June, President Cardoso ordered the expropriation of 21 properties 
totalling 31,600ha for distribution to 1,239 families belonging to the MST 
and the moderate small farmers' association, Contag, in Para, Bahia and 
Minas Gerais.

 This operation brought the total area of land taken over (with payment to 
the owners) since Jungmann took over at the end of April up to 427,937ha, 
for distribution to 11,340 families.

 Contag leader Francisco Urbano said, however, that he did not believe the 
government would meet its target of 180,000 families settled on their own 
land over the next three years.

 ARAGUAIA BODIES SEARCH

 A team of Argentine forensic anthropologists has joined the search for 10-
15 bodies of the so-called 'Araguaia guerrillas', allegedly tortured and 
killed during the 1972-76 campaign in Para (see RB-96-05). Operations began 
in the Maraba area on 29 June.

 BRAZIL: EMPLOYMENT: TWO MILLION JOBS LOST IN SEVEN YEARS: BUT GOVERNMENT 
INSISTS SITUATION IS IMPROVING

 The news that manufacturing industry in Sao Paulo state had created 503 new 
jobs in the second week of June (see Pages 4-5) was of scant comfort to the 
unions that have been counting the cost of recession and restructuring in 
Brazil's industrial heartland. It was certainly not enough to persuade the 
trade unions that called the first general strike for five years on 21 June 
to drop plans for another such day of action.

 IBGE figures. Figures from the national statistical institute, IBGE, in 
late May, indicated that unemployment had increased by 38.62% over the 
previous year, and by 6.03% in April alone. That at least was lower than the 
6.38% registered in March, but well up on the 4.35% in April 1995. More than 
half of all lay-offs over the past year were in Sao Paulo.

 The unions' own statistical department, Dieese, calculated in mid-June that 
more than 2m people were unemployed in April in five of the main cities: Sao 
Paulo, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba and Brasilia. Unemployment in 
Sao Paulo was a record 15.9% in that month, Dieese reported.

 This figure was disputed, however, by presidential spokesman Sergio Amaral, 
who preferred to lump Sao Paulo in with five other big cities. The overall 
unemployment figure for those was 5.7% in February and 6.38% in March, he 
said. Since then unemployment had begun to fall, he added, as government 
job-creation programmes began to work.

 The ministry of labour reports that 2.1m jobs have been lost over the past 
seven years. It attributes the phenomenon to a combination of economic 
stabilisation, technological change and the high cost to employers of taking 
on workers.

 These job losses took place during a period in which the economically 
active population increased from 64m to 71m, the ministry noted.

 BRAZIL: HEALTH & POLITICS: DEATH TOLL MOUNTS IN HOSPITALS CRISIS: GERIATRIC 
CLINIC SCANDALS FOCUS SOCIAL POLICY CONCERNS

 Growing unease among government supporters about its social policies -or 
lack of them- has found a focus in a series of scandals and disasters in the 
health service. Health minister Adib Jatene, a leading heart surgeon, 
threatened to resign when it was rumoured that incoming planning minister 
Antonio Kandir would veto his pet scheme for funding public hospitals with 
an earmarked tax on financial transactions. This tax, known as the CPMF, 
could raise up to US Dollars 6bn a year.

 Clinic closed. The scale of the problems was underlined at the beginning of 
June when Jatene was forced to order the closure of a Rio geriatric 
hospital, Santa Genoveva, where 93 old people had died since April as the 
result of bacterial infections caused by contaminated water, decomposing 
food and out-of-date medicines. They were also found to be suffering from 
malnutrition. One patient told O Globo that they were sometimes given meals 
containing dog food.

 Jatene also ordered the transfer of 300 other patients considered to be at 
risk, and promised to begin civil and criminal proceedings against the 
owners of the clinic, which he described as in a disastrous state after a 
personal visit. The proprietors of Santa Genoveva, two wealthy businessmen 
with interests in 10 other geriatric and psychiatric clinics in Rio de 
Janeiro, were subsequently arrested in late June.

 The health ministry and local authorities ordered an immediate inspection 
of 37 other geriatric hospitals in Rio state -suggesting that such 
supervision has been absent in the past.

 The use of substandard and unsupervised private hospitals is one of the 
many widespread problems in the over-stretched and under-funded Brazilian 
health system. 

 Contaminated water was also found to be the underlying cause of a disaster 
at a renal dialysis clinic in Pernambuco, where 55 people had died by the 
beginning of June.

 An investigation by Veja magazine revealed that the Instituto de Doencas 
Renais (IDR) in Caruaru, in the arid outback of the state, had been using 
water contaminated with blue algae supplied by tanker lorries that cut 
corners in the purification process. It was found that the IDR's internal 
procedures for checking filters were inadequate, and regulation by the 
health authority was non-existent.

 It is clear from the above that not all the health service's problems 
derive from insufficient resources. Further criticism came in a May report 
prepared by two Brazilian consultants for the Inter-American Development 
Bank (IDB), which estimated that the government wasted at least US Dollars 
2bn last year through a combination of poor management and corruption. It 
pointed to a conspiracy by hospital administrators and health ministry 
officials to divert public funding into their own pockets.

 One of the favourite wheezes, according to the report, is for hospitals 
linked to the federal health system, SUS, to claim funding for non-existent 
patients, or for services that are not provided.

 Ageing population. Brazil's problems with geriatric care can only become 
more severe. Old people are the fastest-growing sector of the population 
(53% since 1980, compared with 44% for the population of working age). By 
the year 2000 the country will have 8.6m people over the age of 65 and 18m 
by 2020. As a World Health Organisation report notes, it does not have the 
infrastructure needed to look after them.

 On the contrary: the WHO notes that the number of geriatric hospital beds 
fell from 508,704 in 1994 to 503,461 in the following year.

 Infant mortality down. The Cardoso government's health policies can claim 
some successes, however. At the other end of the age scale, Brazil has 
managed, over the past couple of years, to reduce neo- and peri-natal 
mortality by almost a third. A church children's commission report found 
that the mortality rate in the first year of life had gone down by 28.4% in 
the first quarter of this year, in comparison with the same period last 
year: from 24.8 per 1,000 live births to 17.8. The improvement was most 
striking in the poor north and northeast.

 The church report attributes the improvement mainly to price stability 
under the Plano Real, which has enabled the poor to plan their expenditure 
more effectively.

 An example singled out by the report is that of Jaramataia, a town of 4,700 
inhabitants in the interior of Alagoas. In 1994 its infant mortality rate of 
359 per 1,000 births was one of the highest in the world. Last year it was 
down to 176, and to only 27 in the first three months of this year.

 INDIAN LIVES GROW SHORTER 

 Life expectancy for Brazil's indigenous population has fallen by 5.5 years 
since 1993, reflecting deteriorating living conditions and an increase in 
the incidence of diseases, according to a report by the IMTM tropical 
medicine institute, published in Folha de Sao Paulo in early June.

 Last year the average expectancy for the 329,000 Indians was 42.5, 25 years 
less than for the population as a whole and comparable to that of Sierra 
Leone. In the Javari valley of Amazonas state the average was 24.3 years for 
the Canamaris, Matis and Mayoruma, and only 21 among the Matubo people.

 Many deaths are the result of malaria and hepatitis brought in by illegal 
loggers, gold prospectors (garimpeiros) and settlers. NGOs reported in May 
that 3,000 garimpeiros using 35 landing strips had re-established themselves 
in the 10m hectare territory of the Yanomami, on the Venezuelan frontier, 
since the authorities stopped patrolling the reserve's boundaries in March.

 BRAZIL: FOCUS: INDUSTRY FACES TAKEOVER BOOM: M&A OPERATIONS UP 54% IN THE

 Mid-June brought a small item of encouraging news to Brazil's industrial 
heartland: the regular survey conducted by the Federacao das Industrias do 
Estado de Sao Paulo (Fiesp) showed in the previous fortnight, for the first 
time in thirteen-and-a-half months, a net job-creation figure.

 It was indeed small (503) and industry is still a very long way from 
mopping up the huge numbers of dismissals (98,133 over the past 12 months).

 However, Fiesp experts say that it shows how little an upturn is needed for 
industry to start hiring again. The turnaround is attributed chiefly to the 
steady fall in interest rates; they now average about 15% in real terms, 
compared with twice that much a year ago.

 Takeover threat. The encouragement derived from the employment figures has 
not managed to offset a new round of concern about the effects trade 
liberalisation and 'globalisation' are having on Brazilian industry. Rather, 
this has been heightened by a report from Price Waterhouse which shows that 
in the first five months of this year there were 154 mergers and 
acquisitions, 54% more than in the same period of 1995. In 44% of the cases, 
the operations involved outright buyouts or acquisitions of controlling 
stakes.

 Because not all such transactions are reported, it is estimated that the 
true total of mergers and acquisitions may be up to three times higher.

 Brazilian industry is changing hands, and in an increasing number of cases, 
the buyers are foreigners. In January-May last year, foreigners accounted 
for just over a third of the takeovers; this year their share has risen to 
48%.

 [Brazilians have already been served notice that a new buyer of companies 
is to appear on the market. At the recent signing of the association 
agreement between Mercosur and Chile, President Eduardo Frei announced that 
Chilean investors, after having lined up investment projects totalling US 
Dollars 10bn in Argentina, Peru, Paraguay and Uruguay, are beginning to 
target Brazil.]

 The reasons. Industrialists say that two factors have combined to stimulate 
the rise in takeovers. One is that many middle-ranking Brazilian firms 
lacked the capital to operate in a 'globalised' economy.

 With stockmarkets still too small to do the job, and subsidised lending by 
the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social (BNDES) governed 
largely by an inward-looking approach, companies were forced to rely on 
their own funds, when they had them, or borrow on Brazil's financial 
markets. The astronomic interest rates prevailing until recently either 
deterred companies from expanding, or weakened many of those who tried.

 The other factor is the relative stabilisation of the Brazilian economy, 
which has dispelled many of the reservations held by investors in recent 
years and highlighted again the attractiveness of Brazil as a large, complex 
economy with potential for rapid growth.

 Entrepreneurial talent. One fear is that the wave of takeovers is also 
leading to the withdrawal of valuable local entrepreneurial talent. In late 
June a report published in the Jornal do Brasil identified three 
entrepreneurs who had not only sold out recently but had also pulled out of 
business activity:

 Adhemar de Barros Filho, who sold his interest in Lacta to Kraft Suchard 
Brasil, has turned full-time to his political activities as a federal 
deputy.

 Mario Adler, who relinquished control of Estrela to a management buyout, 
has retreated to his activities as a leader of the local Jewish community.

 Jose Mindlin, who sold his interest in Metal Leve to Mahle, of Germany, has 
turned full-time to his cultural pursuits.

 [The case of Metal Leve is particularly poignant, as it was one of the 
early pioneers of the 'internationalisation' of Brazilian industry, with two 
subsidiaries in the US.]

 Past 'internationalisation'. There is an element of irony in the fact that 
a growing segment of Brazilian industry should succumb to 'globalisation' by 
being bought out. Though Brazil arrived relatively late (end-1980s) to the 
wave of trade liberalisation, it was the country which had previously most 
emphasised the export orientation of its industry.

 Back in 1970, exports of manufactured goods totalled US Dollars 367m. By 
1985 they had expanded thirty-fold, to US Dollars 11.2bn. By 1992 they had 
almost doubled again, to US Dollars 20.5bn. In that same time-lapse, the 
share of manufactures in total exports rose from 15% to 52%.

 Where others, like neighbouring Argentina, often appeared to be engaged in 
a zero-sum debate (either develop manufacturing or go for primary products, 
at best processing the latter), Brazil managed to do both. This emerges 
clearly from the composition of Brazil's manufactured exports, where 
foodstuffs appear as the second-largest item, slotted between metal products 
and chemicals.

 The growing importance of manufactured goods in Brazil's export trade 
appears to contrast with the sector's diminishing share of GDP, from 33.2% 
in 1980 to 24.9% in the early 1990s. This partly reflects the expansion of 
other sectors during a particularly bad period for Brazilian industry: after 
growing at an average annual rate of 9% in the 1970s, its output shrank by 
an average 0.2% a year in the 1980s, and the decline got steeper in the 
first three years of the current decade.

 Since then, however, it has registered at least two years of growth at 
rates similar to those seen in the 1970s.

 During the bad years, Brazilian industry did not only expand outwards 
through exports: in the 1980s it also started investing abroad. It got into 
the apparel industry in Portugal and Spain, and into the production of parts 
for motor vehicles in Portugal and the US.

 Nor has it been absent from the more recent wave of outward investment 
fostered by the creation of Mercosur. In 1994 it is reckoned to have 
invested up to US Dollars 800m in Argentina, where there are already some 
300 Brazilian firms (admittedly not all in the manufacturing sector).

 BRAZIL: POLITICS & CRIME: WHO SHOT PC IN HIS ALAGOAS HIDEAWAY?: WAS IT 
CRIME OF PASSION OR DESTRUCTION OF THE EVIDENCE?

 The superstitious think it was the 'curse of the Collors' at work again. 
Those who put more faith in human and supernatural agency detect a political 
conspiracy. And the local police know a crime of passion when they see one. 
But one thing was clear: the murder of Paulo Cesar Farias ('PC') on 23 June 
put an immediate end to 30 pending lawsuits, and removed from the scene the 
key witness in more than 100 other criminal investigations, involving some 
prominent names from the Brazilian social and political elite.

 Man who knew too much. The conspiracy theory is by far the most beguiling, 
and the Brazilian press have gone to town on it. PC was said to have been 
terrified that someone would try to kill him and his family, and had sent 
his two sons to school in Switzerland to keep them out of harm's way.

 He was, after all, a man who knew too much. As the central figure in the 
kick-back and extortion scandals that had finally brought about the downfall 
of President Fernando Collor de Mello in December 1992, Farias knew where 
the bodies were buried and the money was stashed. But he had kept his mouth 
shut.

 Less than three weeks before his death, the federal police had submitted to 
attorney-general Geraldo Brindeiro the results of an exhaustive four-year 
inquiry into the scams and scandals of the Collor era, involving the 
examination of more than a quarter of a million documents. The report came 
up with the names of more than 400 alleged beneficiaries of PC's 
extraordinary fund-raising talents.

 Former ministers named. Among them were some important figures, not least 
Collor himself and his wife, Rosane. Ten of his cabinet ministers were also 
mentioned in the police document, including former finance minister Zelia 
Cardoso de Mello and presidency minister Marcos Coimbra (Collor's former 
brother-in-law).

 On the strength of this evidence, Brindeiro was reported to be preparing 
106 further indictments. The authorities had high hopes of pinning something 
at last on Collor, who had been acquitted of all charges by the supreme 
court in December 1994 (see RB-95-01).

 To stand any chance of securing convictions, the prosecution needed to put 
Farias in the witness box, as they had found no smoking gun in Collor's hand 
in all the thousands of documents. PC and Jorge Bandeira de Mello, a pilot 
he had used to ferry cash out of the country, were the only two participants 
in the so-called 'PC Scheme' to be convicted and jailed in 1994. Surely, 
once the new evidence started coming out in court, PC would want to set the 
record straight.

 He could throw light, among other things, on the favours that big 
contracting companies might have received in return for the millions of 
dollars they poured into PC's bewildering network of front companies and 
phoney bank accounts (see Zelia box).

 So his death could be regarded as highly convenient for a large number of 
prominent people who might have something to hide. The elimination of a key 
witness is not, after all, an unusual event in Brazil ...

 Rough politics. Besides, they have always played hardball in northeastern 
politics. Fernando Collor's own father, Arnon de Mello, shot a colleague 
dead in the senate in the 1960s; he had been aiming at a political opponent, 
but missed. And in neighbouring Paraiba, current senator Ronaldo Cunha Lima 
was elected in 1994 after riddling a rival with bullets in a restaurant.

 The conspiracy theorists were jubilant when, on 25 June, the company that 
claimed to have made the murder weapon, a .38 revolver, said it had been 
supplied to the Alagoas military police.

 If that were proved to be so, it would scotch the crime-of-passion theory 
right away. And the most enthusiastic proponents of that hypothesis, apart 
from the Farias family, are ... the Alagoas police.

 Crime of passion? As far as the forensic medicine department in Maceio, 
capital of Alagoas state, is concerned, it is an open-and-shut case. The 
body of the 51-year-old businessman was found in bed in his beach house a 
few miles from Maceio. He had a single bullet wound in the heart. Beside him 
was the body of his 28-year-old girlfriend, Suzana Marcolino da Silva, who 
also had a bullet wound in the chest. (Earlier reports, oddly, suggested she 
had taken poison or hanged herself.)

 Tests showed she had recently fired a gun, and the wound in PC's body 
suggested he had been shot by a non-expert, certainly not a hired assassin. 
(Police insisted, though, that the gun was hers.) Moreover, there were no 
signs of an intruder or a struggle. Domestic staff had heard the couple 
quarrelling violently early on the morning of their deaths (but curiously 
had not heard the gunshots).

 PC had recently told an interviewer that he had no intention of marrying 
again, but was thinking of entering politics, standing in the 1998 
congressional elections. Suzana was rumoured to be pregnant, and there were 
reports that PC had refused to acknowledge the child as his own; he was said 
to have had a vasectomy.

 The police are not the only people in Alagoas who subscribe to the crime-
of-passion theory. PC's lawyer, Nabur Bulhoes, insists that nobody could 
have had any interest in silencing his late client, as he had already told 
all he knew. And PC's brother, federal deputy Augusto Farias, said on 24 
June that his brother had recently confided in him that Suzana had tried to 
commit suicide a couple of months earlier.

 That is emphatically denied by the dead woman's family, who say she would 
have been the last person to take her own life.

 Curse of the Collors. As for the curse of the Collors, the evidence is as 
persuasive as that produced in support of rival hypotheses -so far. Ill-
fortune does indeed appear to stalk the superficially glamorous Collors and 
their allies.

 Fernando's younger brother, Pedro, who first denounced the corrupt 
practices he saw going on around him, developed brain cancer and died soon 
after his brother's acquittal. Their mother, Leda, suffered a stroke in 1992 
-allegedly brought on by the stress of her children's feud -fell into a coma 
and died three months after Pedro.

 PC's life had also been marked by tragedy. His wife, Elma, died suddenly, 
apparently from a heart attack, in July 1994, at the age of 44. She had 
always insisted that Collor, not her husband, was the mastermind behind the 
network of corruption.

 Her view, shared by many other Brazilians, was that Collor's inner circle 
of Alagoas politicans and hangers-on were intent on accumulating vast 
amounts of money to invest in expanding the family's regional media empire 
and constructing a dynasty that would remain in power for decades.

 Ministry's suspicions. The justice ministry has made clear where its 
suspicions lie. And it does not trust the Alagoas gumshoes to get to the 
bottom of things. Minister Nelson Jobim ordered the federal police to assist 
the local force with their inquiries within hours of the bodies being 
discovered. 'As Paulo Cesar Farias was involved, we cannot rule out the 
possibility that this was an attempt to destroy evidence,' said federal 
police commissioner Vicente Chelotti.

 COLLOR CLEARED

 Collor was cleared by the supreme court on 20 June of any part in a Farias 
racket, in which the Credicard company paid more than US Dollars 800,000 
into a fictitious bank account in return for PC's help with the renewal of a 
contract with the state-owned Caixa Economica Federal savings bank.

 ZELIA SUMMONED

 Former finance minister Zelia Cardoso had been summoned by the supreme 
court, STF, to give evidence in a case involving PC two weeks before his 
death.

 Zelia was suspected of accepting a US Dollars 800,000 bribe from the 
national bus operators' association, Rodonal, in return for decreeing a 
17.4% increase in bus fares on 14 September 1990. According to federal 
police documents, the US Dollars 800,000 was deposited in an account opened 
under a false name by PC on 13 September.

 A Rodonal official, Jose Augusto Pinheiro, told the police that the 
association paid Farias US Dollars 1m, but was told that, unless more was 
forthcoming, it would have problems with securing fare increases. The police 
think that the total amount paid out by the transport lobby during the 
Collor administration was more like US Dollars 3m.

 ROSANE'S EXTRAVAGANCE

 Rosane Collor used money from a charity she headed to fly her couturiers, 
doctor and spiritual adviser to Brasilia while her husband was President, 
according to a report from the social security department's legal advisers, 
submitted to the federal accounts tribunal, TCU, on 4 June.

 According to the report, she should be required to return US Dollars 15,300 
to the Legiao Brasileira, a social works foundation traditionally headed by 
the First Lady.

 BRAZIL: ELECTIONS: SERRA THROWS HAT INTO SAO PAULO RING: MINISTER SEEN AS 
BEST HOPE OF STOPPING ERUNDINA AND MALUF

 The decision of Jose Serra, one of the Cardoso government's heavyweights, 
to resign from the planning ministry and run for mayor of Sao Paulo is 
evidence of just how seriously the government and President Cardoso's PSDB 
party are taking the October local elections. They can be seen both as a 
plebiscite on their performance so far and the first shots in the 1998 
campaign.

 Stop Erundina ... Serra's immediate mission is to stop the candidate of the 
left-wing Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), former mayor Luiza Erundina, who 
is well ahead in the opinion polls. But throwing him into the contest put 
yet more strain on the unstable congressional coalition of the PSDB, Partido 
da Frente Liberal (PFL) and Partido Progressista Brasileiro (PPB).

 The right-wing PFL is committed to backing Celso Pitta, candidate of the 
incumbent, Paulo Maluf (PPB). The PFL immediately withdrew its support for, 
and participation in, the administration of PSDB governor Mario Covas.

 On the positive side, Serra moved into second place within a week of 
announcing his candidacy, with 22% support against Erundina's 27% in a Vox 
Populi poll. As the senator who secured the highest number of votes in the 
country in the last national elections, he stands a better chance than 
anyone else of overhauling Erundina. If he does well, the governorship of 
Sao Paulo could be his next objective, in 1998. According to Veja, he might 
even go for the presidency.

 ... And Maluf. His other immediate task is to stop the presidential 
ambitions of Paulo Maluf getting off to a flying start. Maluf is said to 
have decided to support Pitta as PPB candidate, as the latter has no 
previous links with local government (he has a private sector background). 
His squeaky-clean image will do no harm to Maluf's plans to run for 
President in 1998. Part of his strategy is to portray the PPB as modern, 
innovative and open and Pitta, a black businessman, is seen as the epitome 
of such values.

 The political coordination minister, Luiz Carlos Santos, noted that 
'without [Serra] in the campaign, Maluf, Erundina, perhaps even Orestes 
Quercia would move into fill the space.'

 The mention of Quercia, former governor of Sao Paulo, was a reference to a 
split in the Partido do Movimento Democratico Brasileiro (PMDB) in the 
state, where a rebel group has defied the local leadership, dominated by 
Quercia, and put up deputy Jose Aristodemo Pinotti as its candidate for 
mayor.

 BRAZIL: POSTSCRIPT

 INEQUALITY/ Worst in the world. Brazil has the most uneven distribution of 
wealth in the world, according to a United Nations report. It says that the 
richest 10% of Brazilians hold 65% of the nation's wealth, while the poorest 
40% have only 12%.

 The UN's human development index, which attempts to put a figure to the 
standard of living, also varies substantially from one region to another. 
Brazil as a whole scores 0.797, only fractionally below the highly developed 
country threshold of 0.8. However, Rio Grande do Sul state stands at 0.871, 
while Paraiba registers only 0.466, comparable to the poorest countries in 
Africa.

 BANKS/ Riskiest in Latin America. A report published by credit ratings 
agency Standard and Poor's says that the country's banking system is now the 
riskiest in the region, because of loose regulations and an end to the 
banks' easy money period during hyper-inflation.  Small banks, the agency 
claims, are most at risk, while larger ones are on a par with their 
counterparts in the rest of Latin America. 

 ALCOHOL-FUEL CARS/ Appeal evaporates. The environmentally-friendly and 
economical cars which run on alcohol are becoming obsolete, because no-one 
is buying them. According to figures published by Anfavea, the car makers 
association, only 602 alcohol-fuelled vehicles were sold in May, 85% down on 
the May 1995 level, and for the second month running less than 1% of the 
total number of cars sold. Ten years ago 95% of vehicles in Brazil ran on 
alcohol; the figure is now down to 3%.

 INVESTMENT/ US Dollars 20bn in 1996. President Cardoso has predicted that 
long-term investment will total US Dollars 20bn this year. Figures released 
to date indicate that foreign direct investment in the first five months of 
the year had reached US Dollars 3.3bn, a 10% year-on-year increase; FDI is 
forecast to reach US Dollars 8bn by year-end. 

 TELECOMS/ Satellite service. Four companies have formed a joint venture 
called Globalstar do Brasil to offer telephone services via satellite to 
regions that lack them, starting in 1998. The new company comprises 
Brasilstar and Globalstar of Brazil, Loral Corp of the US and Germany's 
Daimler-Benz. Investment worth US Dollars 180m has been earmarked for the 
project.

 MEDIA/ Journalist dies. Julio de Mesquita Neto, editor since 1969 of the 
Sao Paulo newspaper O Estado, has died of cancer at the age of 74. He was 
one of the strongest critics in the press of the military regimes which 
governed between 1964 and 1985.

 CRIME/ Hard graft. Hasmany Ramos, the famous plastic surgeon turned super 
criminal who threatened to join the IRA to learn the art of bomb-making, has 
been recaptured by the police. Ramos, who was serving a 22 year sentence for 
murder and extortion, had escaped from prison after his 11th attempt. He was 
arrested by Minas Gerais detectives while attempting to collect a ransom 
payment from the family of an abducted businessman. The authorities, 
however, did not realise it was Ramos until they took his finger prints.

 NUCLEAR POWER/ New member. Brazil has been granted full membership of the 
Nuclear Suppliers Group. The association, which consists of thirty countries 
who have adopted policies to control the export of goods and technology in 
the nuclear sector, promotes the use of nuclear power for peaceful means.

 OIL/ Argentine imports. Argentina has overtaken the Arab countries for the 
first time ever as Brazil's leading oil supplier, according to a report by 
the state company Petrobras. Brazil currently imports 135,000 bpd from 
Argentina, compared with 125,000 bpd from Saudi Arabia and 90,000 bpd from 
Venezuela. The report adds that Venezuela is likely to overtake Saudi Arabia 
before the end of the year. Brazil imports a total of 700,000 bpd and 
produces marginally more itself, some 750,000 bpd.

 Petrobras search. The state oil copmany is looking for private sector 
associates to help it develop the rich natural gas reserves that are thought 
to exist in Amazonia, according to Gazeta Mercantil. The Urucu and Juru 
reserves are estimated to hold 82bn cubic metres of natural gas, making them 
the second most important in the country, after Campos in the state of Rio 
de Janeiro. Petrobras lacks the resources to build a 270km pipeline linking 
the reserves to the city of Coari, from where the gas could be distributed.

 The state company's overtures towards the private sector reflect its 
concern over potential competition from foreign multinationals in 1998, when 
Petrobras's monopoly in the hydrocarbon sector will end.

 TRADE/ May surplus. A trade surplus of US Dollars 268m was recorded in May, 
giving a US Dollars 31m surplus for the first five months of the year. 
Brazil exported US Dollars 4.5bn worth of goods and imported US Dollars 
4.2bn in May, the finance ministry says. In May 1995 a trade deficit of US 
Dollars 690m was sustained. 

 Paraguayan contraband. Between 1 May and 10 June 350 tonnes of goods 
smuggled into the country from Paraguay were seized by the authorities. The 
products included food, household appliances, tobacco and alcohol, and were 
valued at US Dollars 4m. Customs officials said they confiscated 50 tonnes 
of cigarettes, enough to supply 82,000 smokers for a month. Most of the 
products were destined for Brasilia's informal market.

 CONSUMPTION/ Spirits rise. Falling inflation and lower import tariffs led 
to a 25% rise in alcohol sales last year, to US Dollars 23bn, according to 
the weekly Veja. Wine, champagne and whiskey consumption rose by an average 
of 34%; beer and rum by 21%. Sales of cachaca, the country's most popular 
spirit, rose by 1%.

JULY: THE TURNING POINT?

As the phased decontrol of wages and prices frozen under Collor Plan II
at end-January proceeds, policy makers in Brasilia are monitoring the
inflation trend carefully -- and the early indicators appear favorable.  The
risk, as in past transitions from shock plan freezes, is that repressed price
pressures and high-inflation expectations will lead businesses to
implement sharp markups upon termination of controls, forcing the
government to close the vicious circle with implementation of a new
freeze.  But preliminary estimates indicating only a mild rise in monthly
inflation to around 10% in July have bolstered optimism that Economy
Minister Marcilio Marques Moreira will succeed in stabilizing the
economy without resort to a new shock.

Not all economic observers share that view: Cesar Maia, onetime aide
to Rio Governor Leonel Brizola and now a prominent economic adviser
to PMDB national president Orestes Quercia, contends that Moreira
already is stumbling into the same traps that ensnared previous finance
ministers.  And Moreira, whose efforts to restore dialogue with the
business community have allowed the government to achieve voluntary
sectoral pacts for wage and price restraint, has drawn criticism from the
private sector for his surprise move in late June to tighten terms for
industrial tax collection.  Rules established under Emergency Measure
297, issued in late June, reduce the maximum period for remittance of
industrial production tax (IPI) collection from 40 days to just five --
effectively requiring remittance before most payments from clients are
received.  Industrialists complain that the measure will cut deeply into
scarce capital reserves desperately needed to finance productive
expansion at a critical stage in Brazil's economic recovery (see
SPOTLIGHT report in this issue).

Moreira's supporters counter that the IPI collection term could prove an
effective and flexible tool to tighten fiscal policy when the pace of
growth accelerates to a level that could reignite inflation, and ease when
the recovery threatens to stall.  Moreover, other provisions of
Emergency Measure 297 could bolster the recovery while posing little
inflationary risk.  EM 297 authorizes creation of foreign exchange
debentures backed by export earnings, which should significantly expand
availability of trade finance to Brazilian companies.

Another key provision allows for immediate release of new cruzado
funds blocked at the Central Bank since the original Collor Plan entered
force in March 1990 for payment of tax and debt obligations to the
government incurred through end-1990.  Holders of blocked new cruzado
deposits also are authorized to transfer NCz$ funds to another party for
use in settlement of the latter's tax and debt obligations.  This measure
provides an effective mechanism to bolster the federal treasury even as
it diminishes the mountain of liquidity due to hit national money supply
in mid-September, when the government is committed to commence
disbursement of blocked NCz$ funds in monthly instalments over a one-
year period.  The option for transfer of NCz$ funds also offers a vehicle
to obtain liquidity without waiting for scheduled disbursements -- though
the discounts of 15-25% applied by companies and institutions to
cruzeiro payments for NCz$ funds will likely discourage small
depositors.

The debate over EM 297 highlights the difficult economic policy
challenge confronting the Moreira team in Brasilia.  On the one hand,
Moreira must avert a resurgence of inflation as price and wage controls
are lifted -- and that implies a monetary and fiscal policy sufficiently
tight to avert economic overheating.  On the other, he must provide
sufficient monetary and fiscal impetus to prevent the economy from
slipping back into recession.  If inflation can be capped around the 10%
monthly level -- as the  preliminary forecast for July suggests -- Moreira
can claim a critical victory on the inflation front, which should reinforce
business confidence in the new economic team.  Whether he can maintain
the delicate balance between moderate inflation and nascent recovery
remains to be seen: The economic outlook to yearend is reviewed in
depth in this week's SPOTLIGHT report.

July also marks a watershed month in Moreira's efforts to push long-
stalled debt negotiations toward conclusion by yearend -- a critical
element in the economy minister's long-term game plan for sustained
economic revival.  Moreira's unofficial visit last week to New York and
Washington, including talks with US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
and IMF Director Michel Camdessus, prepared the ground for the IMF
technical mission that arrived in Brazil this week for review of fiscal and
economic performance.  Moreira also conferred in New York with
money center bankers and the Brazilian negotiating team led by Pedro
Malan and Jorio Dauster (now charged with handling the Paris Club
talks), who had just returned from meeting with creditors in Japan and
Europe.  Moreira has assured creditor banks that they will be offered a
broad menu of options in renegotiation of Brazilian debt, including
securitization and debt swaps linked to impending parastatal
privatizations.

The technical mission now in Brazil will have to weight the recent
progress made under Moreira against lingering concerns, specifically
over the inflation outlook and a deterioration in the fiscal situation after
steady improvement in 1990.  The latter problem reflects a sharp
reduction in government revenues, caused by restoration of diverse fiscal
incentives by Congress and an unexpected plunge in income tax receipts
laid to bureaucratic confusion under the previous economic team.
Restored tax breaks alone have cost the federal treasury an estimated
US$1.77 billion, boosting total giveaways through fiscal incentives to a
crushing US$7.82 billion -- or 1.51% of GDP.  Bureaucratic foulups in
income tax collection over the past year have cost the treasury another
US$1 billion.

Despite these fiscal problems, Moreira stands a good chance of
persuading the Fund to sign off on a new credit facility so long as he can
offer convincing evidence that the economic situation has been stabilized
and inflation has been brought under control.  In this context, the July
inflation figures assume added weight as an indicator of the credibility
and effectiveness of Moreira's economic policy management.  His clout
with US and IMF officials in Washington should also help -- but no
amount of influence could overcome a renewed deterioration in the
inflation trend.

To bolster anti-inflation policy, Moreira has concentrated his formidable
diplomatic skills on persuading Congress of the need to resist pressure
for a return to full-fledged wage indexation.  His success in maintaining
wage restraint thus far should improve Brazil's case with the IMF.
Moreira also can be expected to emphasize the fiscal windfall anticipated
from the dramatic shortening of the term for industrial tax collections
under EM 297.

Assuming July inflation holds below 11%, Moreira is well positioned to
gain IMF approval of a new letter of intent, clearing the way for signoff
on a credit facility.  Moreira's immediate objective is to gain IMF
commitment to an 18-month standby loan, which currently is expected
to total between US$1.5-2 billion.  If Brazil remains on course in
meeting its IMF targets, the economy minister is expected to seek
subsequent Fund approval of an extended fund facility for a three-year
term, with a credit commitment totaling US$3 billion or more.

If the IMF hurdle can be cleared, Moreira remains optimistic that a deal
with commercial bank creditors can be reached by yearend.  The bank
talks can be expected to proceed in parallel with renegotiation of Paris
Club debt, currently estimated at around US$4 billion.

Conclusion of agreements with the IMF, the Paris Club and the banks by
yearend would significantly improve Moreira's position to achieve
economic stabilization and lay the foundations for sustained growth with
moderate inflation.  But the economic risks remain formidable: Witness
the fact that Brazil has failed to meet targets established in all of its six
previous accords with the Fund since 1982.  The optimists in Brasilia
contend that Moreira will succeed where his predecessors have failed --
the skeptics are deferring judgment for now.

COLLOR ON THE OFFENSIVE

President Fernando Collor de Mello has mounted a powerful
counterattack against former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia, now
national president of the PMDB and the early front-runner for the
presidency in 1994.  In the first week of July, Collor ventured into
Quercia's stronghold in upstate Sao Paulo to launch a new farm program
offering close to US$1 billion in credit for the 1991/92 harvest.  The
program, engineered by Agriculture Minister Antonio Cabrera, also
slashes taxes on farm equipment sales, bolsters price support levels for
local producers, and slaps punitive tariffs on subsidized agricultural
imports.  The clear intent is to pull Sao Paulo and other key producing
states out of recession, setting the stage for strong recovery in 1992 --
and shoring up Collor's eroded base of farm support in the process.

At the public unveiling of the farm program, the president shared the
platform with Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, a political
unknown until Quercia tabbed him as PMDB gubernatorial nominee last
year.  The gesture to Fleury appears consistent with Collor's recent
efforts to woo the Sao Paulo governor -- not only to secure the latter's
support for key elements of the administration's legislative agenda in
Brasilia, but also to weaken Fleury's relationship with Quercia and thus
undercut the Quercia presidential campaign.

Collor also has sought to steal the initiative from Quercia by
concentrating a heavy proportion of federal assistance for local public
works projects in heavily populated and prosperous upstate Sao Paulo.
Already these efforts have triggered a significant number of defections
by mayors and even congressmen in the state to Collor's small PRN
party, and more desertions are expected.  Collor's generous new farm
program will accelerate the flow of funds into the region, a center for
Brazilian agricultural production.

The key figures behind the administration's Sao Paulo offensive are
Leopoldo Collor, the president's oldest brother and a Sao Paulo
businessman; Secretary of Regional Development Egberto Baptista, an
increasingly influential member of the president's inner circle.  The
youthful Baptista, also a paulista, demonstrated his clout with his key
role in the kitchen cabinet campaign to oust former Economy Minister
Zelia Cardoso de Mello, and he is widely regarded as a politician to
watch.
Collor already has used his control over federal largesse to forge a
political alliance with Rio Governor Leonel Brizola, a longtime political
rival.  If he can use similar influence to woo Fleury, he would appear
better positioned to confront Quercia openly.  That would mark a major
shift from Collor's recent dependence on Quercia for critical support,
notably in the recent battle to end the computer market reserve.  An open
war between Collor and Quercia would match two of Brazil's most
skilled political infighters -- and it would be a drama worth watching
closely.

MORE BANKS, MORE LOSSES

Bank earnings reports for the first five months of the year show an
industry that has grown in numbers -- and deteriorated in profitability.
The number of banks in Brazil has reached 239, and 116 -- nearly half
--reported losses for the January-May period.

In good part, this negative performance reflects the fallout from an
excessive expansion of the industry in 1990, spurred by a flurry of
incorporations of small and medium-size institutions.  Liberalization of
rules for bank incorporation under the 1988 constitution and subsequent
regulations issued by the Sarney administration set the stage for last
year's expansion.  The result was a surge in institutions from 153 in
1989 to 239.

The irony is that the expansion occurred even as the draconian freeze of
investment funds implemented under the original Collor Plan in March
1990 drained liquidity from the system.  Total liquidity in the banking
system shrunk by nearly 50%, from US$116.5 billion in 1989 to US$59
billion in 1990.  In other words, the new banking ventures came
precisely as prospects for industry profits reached low ebb.

Many of the new banks were not well prepared to face the adversities of
1990.  Most were founded by industrial and retail groups, restructured
brokerages and distributors seeking to profit from lucrative margins of
as much as 50% that prevailed in the last months of the Sarney
administration.  Then came the liquidity crunch, followed by a wave of
bankruptcies in the second half of 1990 and a continued monetary
squeeze that put additional pressure on industry profit margins.

Few of the new banks thus far have failed as a result of these financial
pressures.  But industry executives believe that many will eventually
have to seek mergers to avoid going under, which could reduce the total
number of banks by as much as 40% over the next year.

State banks remain a continuing source of trouble for the state and
federal governments, with most reporting spectacular losses in the first
semester.  Even foreign banks with Brazilian operations suffered
setbacks; Mitsubishi and Bank of Montreal ranked among the poorest
performers in the first half.

PRIVATIZATION: NEXT TARGETS

With the debut selloff of the state-owned steelmaker Usiminas set for
September, the Collor government is preparing to launch its second
privatization with sale of the jet-turbine maintenance firm Companhia
Eletro-mecanica.  Celma, with assets officially valued at US$84 million,
will be privatized in several stages.  An initial tender of up to 10% of
total Celma shares will be offered to the company's 2,000 employees
from August 1 to September 13, supported by financing from the
BNDES.  United Technology, which currently owns a 13% shareholding
in Celma, will be offered the option to increase its stake up to the 40%
maximum established for foreign shareholders in the privatization
process.  Remaining Celma stock will go on the block for public offer
on October 22.

One problem that has held back privatization of Celma is the fact that it
is the only domestic company qualified to service Brazilian Air Force
jets.  This issue was resolved through inclusion of a clause in
privatization terms guaranteeing such maintenance will be continued.
Though the Celma selloff is on a much smaller scale than the Usiminas
deal, its sale breaks a number of nationalistic taboos and paves the way
for a much more significant privatization: Brazil's biggest aircraft maker,
Embraer.  The recent surprise appointment of former Infrastructure
Minister Ozires Silva as president of Embraer -- the company he headed
from its founding until he assumed the Petrobras presidency in 1986 --
has been widely interpreted as a mission to get the parastatal ready for
privatization.  Silva was a strong proponent of privatization even before
he assumed a central role in drafting the Collor government's program
for parastatal selloffs as infrastructure minister.  He has openly
recommended that the aircraft company be transferred as soon as possible
to private interests.

GENERAL OVERVIEW

State bank rollovers of debt obligations to the Central Bank have kept the
financial system under pressure in July.    The financial markets  have
responded with a gradual backup in interest rates, though liquidity has
remained adequate to prevent a more dramatic surge.  In this
environment, CDs and fixed-rate mutual funds have ranked among the
leading fixed-income perfomers. The rise in interest rates has dampened
demand for the dollar, and should also slow improvement in gold prices
in the second half of the month.  The stock market has shown surprising
strength despite the interest rate trend, bolstered by privatization
progress, foreign capital inflows and growing optimism over the
economic outlook and pending debt negotiations.  Stocks have maintained
their position in July as the strongest performer among major investment
vehicles. The influx of foreign funds, coupled with share sales in the
privatization process, is critical to sustaining the rally on the Sao Paulo
and Rio exchanges.  Market analysts anticipate a new market surge if
inflation remains moderate this month and Economy Minister Moreira
can make headway in debt negotiations with the IMF and the banks.  The
rally should be reinforced as interest rates level off in the second half of
July.

FINANCIAL INVESTMENT FUNDS

Overview: Financial investment funds turned in a reasonable showing in
the first half of July, with the 10 leading funds averaging a net gain of
3.9%.  Top performers for the period were the Fundo Azul of the
Federal Savings Bank and the Fundo Real.  But the range in returns
among the leading funds narrowed to just 18 basis points, from 4.04%
for Fundo Azul to 3.86% for Citiconta.

Prospects: Leading funds should average a monthly gain of around
10.5% in July.  That would put the fundao roughly on a par with
monthly inflation, and marginally above the pre-fixed TR of 10.05%.

CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT

Overview: CDs have continued to rank among the top investment
performers in July.  Rates for large-lot investments moved up from
260% to 330% annualized in the first half of the month, with interbank
rates rising from 15% to 17% monthly.  The rising trend has been
reinforced by the market impact as state banks roll over debts with the
Central Bank.

Over the longer term, CD returns have been more modest, with nominal
gains on large lots of 81.84% in the first six months of the year and
340.32% over the past 12 months.  These returns lagged inflation for the
periods, though still outperforming cadernetas.  The tax disadvantage for
smaller lots makes CDs a less attractive vehicle for small or middle-scale
investors.

Prospects: The money markets will continue to be pressured by the
problems of the state financial institutions, which will keep rates high in
the near term.  But interest rate pressure should begin to ease by the end
of the month, and CD yields should also begin to fall by early August.
GOLD

Overview: In the first half of July, gold prices rose by 4.39%, ranking
third-highest amont investment vehicles and moderately above the official
TR index for the comparable period.  Over the longer term, however,
gold remains a lackluster performer, with gains of 77.47% in the first
half and 322.51% over the past 12 months.  Though it has outperformed
the black dollar in July, gold price gains have trailed the dollar for the
year to date.

Prospects: Market operators expect gold prices to track the government's
TR at least so long as interest rates stay high and international gold
prices remain stable.  That implies a price advance of around 10% for
July -- but gains in August could be lower as interest rates stabilize or
fall.

BLACK DOLLAR

Overview: The black dollar recovered from stagnation at the start of the
month to post a 4.01% gain for the first half of July, at a rough parity
with inflation and the TR for the period.  The commercial dollar
improved by 4.33% in the first two weeks of July, while the tourist
dollar lagged with a gain of 3.45%.  The premium of the black over the
commercial dollar widened to 11.44% by the end of the second week,
after narrowing to a low of 10.31% in the first.

For the first half of 1991, gains have reached 87.63% for the black
dollar, 83.91% for the commercial, and 85.80% for the tourist.  Over
the past 12 months, the commercial dollar returned 412.52%, compared
with 295.45% for the tourist and 294.35% for the black.

Prospects: The black dollar appears likely to stagnate in the second half
of July.  With interest rates moving up, exporters have grown more
anxious to accelerate exchange of dollars for cruzeiros, boosting dollar
supply.  The Central Bank also has signaled that it plans to intervene to
sell dollars if the exchange rate against the local currency appreciates
sharply.

S&L ACCOUNTS

Overview: With the TR pre-fixed at 10.05% for July, gains on a
caderneta investment held during July will reach 10.60%.  That offers
a sufficiently wide spread over estimated July inflation to make this
instrument attractive.

Over the longer term, the caderneta has not done so well.  In the first six
months of the year, gains reached just 69.85%, more than 25 points
behind inflation for the period.  Gains for the past 12 months reached
243.25%, making the caderneta the worst performer among investment
vehicles.  The paltry gain -- directly attributable to past government
manipulation of the official correction rate -- exposes the administration's
dismal failure to date in enhancing the attraction of savings and thus
diminishing pressures for immediate consumption.

Prospects: July returns for the caderneta should be positive in real terms.
So long as the government continues to fix the TR at a rate close to
inflationary expectations, this investment will not be a losing proposition.
The risk is that inflation might surge above forecast, leaving investors in
savings accounts vulnerable to a hard blow.  Government plans to
sweeten terms for caderneta investment appear to have been set aside for
now; the economic team appears confident that most of the new liquidity
produced when the government begins release of blocked NCz$ funds in
September will move into financial investments, without need for new
inducements.

STOCK MARKET

Overview: BOVESPA staged a rally in the second week of July,
returning the stock market to the head of the pack in investment yields
for the first half of the month.  The market rally was triggered in
significant part by heavy share purchases by futures index financing
agents, reinforced by continued strong foreign capital inflows.  On July
12, BOVESPA closed with a net gain of 10.6% for the week and 6.32%
for the first half of July.  The BVRJ also rallied to post a 7.5% gain in
the second week of July.  But heavier losses in the previous week left the
Rio exchange with a net gain of just 2.64% for the first half of the
month.

In the first six months of the year, BOVESPA showed a vigorous gain
of 438.01%, with BVRJ staging a healthy 394.7% advance.  That
compares very favorably with inflation of around 95% for the period.
In the past 12 months, gains were less spectacular but still well above
inflation, at 668.02% for BOVESPA and 627.63% for BVRJ.

Prospects: Stock prices could stabilize or drop in the second half of July.
The factors pointing to a correction are largely technical: Finance from
agents to guarantee new credit and roll over existing lines for stock
purchases has temporarily dried up as agents struggle to meet
requirements for large deposits with the Central Bank.  Many investors
will be forced to sell to keep liquid, and this may pressure prices lower.

Over the medium and long term, however, the market outlook remains
favorable -- and stands to improve further with interest rate stabilization,
continued moderation in inflation and progress on debt renegotiation and
privatization.  As a result, investors should view a near-term correction
as an opportunity to buy.

MUTUAL FUNDS

Overview: Mutual stock funds continued to lag other investment vehicles
with a net loss averaging 4.09% in the first half of July, repeating the
poor performance of June.  Despite their recent reverses, however, stock
funds have provided a net return of 296.07% for the first half of the
year.  Gains over the most recent 12-month period were less impressive
at 328.34%, breaking even with inflation. Leading fixed-rate mutual
funds ranked as the second-best investment in the first half of July with
a gain averaging 4.45%.  Fixed-rate funds also did moderately well over
the longer term, breaking even with inflation with gains of 95.23% in the
first six months of 1991 and 387.34% over the 12-month period.  Fixed-
rate funds for companies fared modestly better with gains of 103.29% in
the first half and 436.14% over 12 months.

Prospects: Stock funds could continue doing poorly in the second half of
July, but should rebound smartly to make up for lost ground -- possibly
in August.  Fixed-rate funds should continue their moderately good
showing, which has made them one of the more dependable investments
in the financial markets. The Brazil Service table of leading mutual funds
appears on page 10.

MOVING INTO RECOVERY?

The second half has begun amid emerging signals that the economy is
moving gradually out of the recession that has gripped Brazil for the past
year.  Industrial production and consumer sales in key sectors have risen
in two consecutive months for the first time this year, and businesses are
cautiously optimistic that the trends can be sustained in the second
semester.  Other economic indicators show modest improvement as well
-- but not all Brazilian analysts are convinced that the recovery has taken
firm root.

One factor that could give impetus to a second-half recovery is the
incipient revival in the consumer economy.  Consumer credit requests
are increasing for the first time in six months.  Employment numbers are
rising slowly but steadily in the industrial hub of Sao Paulo, and wages
in the region have improved this year in real terms.  The latter
improvement has been preserved in part by the success of the Collor
government thus far in preventing a new explosion in inflation as price
controls are gradually lifted.

The revival in consumer expenditures should gain further momentum in
mid-September, when the government is committed to release the first of
12 equal instalments from new cruzado accounts blocked in the Central
Bank since launch of the original Collor Plan in March 1990.
Consumers already have stepped up instalment purchases in anticipation
of receipt of funds now blocked at the CB.  Liquidity has expanded
modestly and the credit squeeze has begun to ease for some industrial
and agribusiness sectors, further bolstering prospects for sustained
recovery.

External developments on the trade and debt fronts also would appear to
support the recovery scenario.  Major industrial and agricultural
exporters have continued to thrive despite a persistent overvaluation of
the cruzeiro against the US$.  International trade credit lines, while
diminished, have remained adequate despite slow progress in the bank
debt talks.  And with prospects for an IMF agreement this summer
increasingly favorable, the government should be in position to achieve
a comprehensive renegotiation of the bank debt in the second half --
which would brighten hopes for greater availability of foreign credit to
finance Brazilian trade.

Not all economic portents for the second half are favorable, however.
Analysts in Brazil are divided as to whether Economy Minister Marcilio
Marques Moreira can prevent inflation from moving well above 10%
monthly in the third quarter, which would heighten the odds of a new
shock plan to arrest the price surge.  In fact, some critics of the new
economic team suggest that it already has implemented its first shock in
the form of Emergency Measure 297, issued in late June.  That measure
shortens the grace period for corporate payment of the industrial tax,
which some business leaders view as a de facto confiscation of funds that
could fuel private sector recovery.  The emergency measure also
authorizes longer credit terms for export financing and use of new
cruzado funds blocked at the CB for settlement of debts with the
government.  Overall, critics view the sharp tightening in industrial tax
collection terms as negating the reflationary impact of other aspects of
the measure.

On balance, Brazil Service finds the weight of economic evidence
pointing toward an incipient recovery.  But both domestic and foreign
investors should be asking whether this is the beginning of a sustainable
long-term recovery, or merely a temporary rebound induced in part by
short-term government measures.  This SPOTLIGHT report gauges the
general economic scenario and specific factors that could influence the
recovery outlook.

RECOVERY OR ILLUSION?

Is the recovery for real, or does the apparent economic upturn mask
gathering momentum for a new economic shock?  Opposition economist
Cesar Maia, the former top adviser to PDT presidential nominee and Rio
Governor Leonel Brizola who recently bolted to join the PMDB,
enthusiastically supported Collor Plans I and II -- but now has emerged
as a leading critic of economic policy under Moreira.  Maia contends
that the Moreira team remains stuck in the "heterodox shock rut" that has
plagued government anti-inflation policy since launch of the Cruzado
Plan in early 1986.  He argues that Moreira already has fallen victim to
the recurring cycle of initial success yielding to subsequent economic
distortions that must be corrected by a new shock plan.  In fact, Maia
views Emergency Measure 297, which combines tightened corporate tax
collection with expanded trade finance options and release of blocked
new cruzado funds for internal debt payments, as the effective launch of
"Collor Plan III."

Economist and PUC/Rio professor Edmar Bacha, a member of the
economic team who engineered launch of the Cruzado Plan and now an
informal adviser to Moreira, agrees that previous shocks have introduced
economic distortions, particularly in the public/private sector
relationship.  But whereas past price/wage freezes have fostered the
unsustainable illusion of lasting inflation control and economic recovery
-- and ultimately paved the way for the next shock as collapsing
confidence drove businesses to drive up prices --Bacha is less pessimistic
this time round.  He credits the present economic team for managing the
price decontrol process thus far without provoking a new inflationary
surge or undermining private sector confidence in the government.  That
success has laid the groundwork for slow but steady recovery -- and
improved prospects that a new shock can be avoided.

Former Planning Minister Joao Paulo dos Reis Velloso endorses Bacha's
positive assessment of progress on price decontrol.  He notes that -- in
contrast to widespread private sector expectations in the wake of previous
shocks that price decontrol would be temporary -- the Moreira team thus
far has managed to retain the confidence of the business community in
its capacity to curb inflation without a new shock.

The rub is that the government has maintained such confidence in part
by maintaining a generally tight monetary policy designed to prevent the
economy from moving into a premature and accelerated recovery that
would revive price pressures.  The economic team in Brasilia has grown
increasingly concerned in recent months that an excessively swift and
strong recovery could produce a consumer spending boom, triggering a
price surge reinforced by markups driven by renewed business fears of
an imminent shock.

The Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA), the Economy
Ministry think tank, gives some insight into the reasons behind the
present concern of the economic team over the pace of recovery.  A
newly released IPEA study shows that industrial production in the first
four months of 1991 was up by 14.5% from the year-ago period -- well
above levels for comparable periods in previous economic stabilization
plans.  In fact, however, the increase is exaggerated by the comparison
with the depressed level of industrial activity in the January-April 1990
period, devastated by the impact of the massive confiscation of corporate
capital at the start of the Collor Plan.

The IPEA recommends that the government maintain a generally tight
monetary policy as the most effective means to assure sustained recovery
without a new inflationary surge.  That implies that Brasilia will be
cautious to take measures that might accelerate the recovery, with a stop-
and-go monetary policy not unlike that applied in recent months by the
Federal Reserve in the US.

THE INDUSTRIAL TAX SHOCK

Since his appointment as economy minister in early May, Marcilio
Marques Moreira has succeeded in repairing government relations with
business badly strained by recurring confrontations during the tenure of
his predecessor, Zelia Cardoso de Mello.  Moreira has consciously taken
a more conciliatory line in reopening lines of communication with
business leaders and offering assurances that he plans no new
interventions in the private sector.  The end result has been a gradual
resurgence in business confidence in the government -- but these gains
could be squandered by Moreira's quiet move to tighten corporate tax
collection rules under Emergency Measure 297.

At first glance, the emergency measure's more obvious fiscal policy
change -- elimination of TR use for tax indexation to comply with
constitutional constraints established by the Supreme Court -- appeared
of little relevance to the economic outlook.  But buried in the bureacratic
language of EM 297 was a bombshell with powerfully negative
implications for the private sector: a dramatic reduction of the grace
period for corporate deposit of receipts from the Industrial Production
Tax (IPI), the most important federal tax source, from 40 days to just
five.  The implication is that companies are now required to remit tax
payments in most cases before they have even received payments from
clients, since few sales are made for cash and most carry a standard 30-
to 60-day payment lag.  As a result, industries already strapped for cash
suddenly confront a major new drain on operating capital -- which
threatens to cut short the nascent recovery.

An element of EM 297 with a less predictable impact on recovery
prospects is the authorization for immediate release of new cruzado funds
to pay tax and debt obligations to the government incurred through
end-1990.  Moreira's motivation is obvious: Designation of a substantial
portion of blocked NCz$ funds for tax and debt settlements stands to
bolster the federal treasury, even as it diminishes the money supply
impact as release of blocked funds into the general economy begins in
September.  The impact on corporate spending would appear a wash,
since the funds are not currently available for other purposes.

Moreover, the authorization for holders of blocked accounts to transfer
funds to another party for the latter's use in meeting tax and debt
payments to the government has effectively created a market for new
cruzados.  In theory, such exchange of new cruzados for cruzeiros could
have a reflationary impact in bolstering consumer spending power.  In
practice, however, the capital gains tax on NCz$ transfers (currently
under challenge in the courts) and the 15/25% discount currently applied
by companies and institutions to payments for new cruzados will lead
most small and middle-scale deposits to wait for disbursement of blocked
funds to begin two months hence.

In any event, the abrupt narrowing of the grace period for IPI collection
appears likely to offset any positive economic impact from the measure
in the near term.  Moreira retains the option of increasing the grace
period for IPI deposit by industries should the economy slip back toward
recession, however -- and that could prove a convenient mechanism for
extending the stop-and-go strategy to fiscal policy.

INDUSTRIAL OUTLOOK

Much of the apparent recovery in June was concentrated in a single
sector -- the auto industry.  Automakers reported a surge in production
in June of 18.06% from the previous month, and 73.53% from June
1990.  The government's authorization of a temporary 10-point cut in the
IPI applied to car sales -- a concession to gain the industry's
acquiescence in a sectoral pact holding new-car price increases to the
general inflation level -- significantly widened profit margins, providing
a powerful inducement for expanded production.

It would be premature, however, to interpret the impressive June
performance as proof of a definitive turnaround for the industry, in part
because the government is committed to extend the temporary IPI cut
only through August.  Over a longer timeframe, the industry's
performance has been lackluster, with production in the first half up by
just 1.2% from year-ago levels.  Moreover, monthly production figures
to yearend close to the 67,000-unit average for the first semester would
put 1991 output at around 700,000 vehicles -- 7.5% below the 1990
total.

Still, a comprehensive breakdown of auto industry results shows a
substantial improvement in domestic sales during the first semester.  That
trend compensated for a 25.85% year-on-year fall in auto exports during
the same period.  The government's extension of the IPI reduction for
another 60 days to end-August should keep auto production stable and
prevent layoffs -- but the extraordinary gains seen in June are unlikely
to be repeated.

Autoparts suppliers are cautiously optimistic that the recovery in vehicle
production also will translate into a substantial rise in orders from
carmakers.  Autoparts sales fell by 20% year-on-year in the first five
months of 1991, but a reversal in the trend in May has bolstered industry
hopes that sales will return to year-ago levels by August.  The industry
currently reports capacity utilization in a range of 82-85%.

Some durable goods manufacturers have suffered from rushing
prematurely to step up production on the basis of a sharp but
unsustainable pickup in sales.  Tractor makers, for instance, responded
to improved sales in May by boosting output by 20.9% the following
month, only to see June sales fall by 4.2%.  The reversal reflected the
broader trend in the agricultural equipment sector, where production
increased by 22.9% while sales slumped by 5.8% in June.

Despite falling sales in May, the food industry interpreted signs of
gradual improvement in the consumer economy -- including a rise in
supermarket turnover -- as sufficient justification to rehire workers and
push up production in June.  The industry's optimism on recovery
prospects is also rooted in the impetus that release of blocked new
cruzado funds beginning in September is expected to give to consumer
spending.

Manufacturers of capital goods, steel, petrochemicals and other industrial
products generally appear poised for a sustained recovery.  If the
recovery in these core industries takes firm hold, it can be attributed in
significant part to long-term government measures undertaken to improve
productivity and profitability of these sectors.

The risk -- notably in the capital goods sector -- is that the decade-long
pattern of recurring recession interrupted by brief spasms of recovery
will be repeated.  Capital goods production in April rose by 5.7% from
March; the 7% rise in inflation-adjusted April sales from the year-ago
level marked the first year-on-year improvement in monthly sales
performance in three years.  But after steady if gradual industry
improvement during the first four months of the year, production fell by
2.3% and sales by 1.1% in May from April levels.

Luiz Carlos Delben Leite, president of the Association of Machinery and
Equipment (ABIMAQ), cautions that a genuine recovery would imply at
least 10 consecutive months of production growth.  Despite the
ambiguous indicators through May, however, most capital goods makers
view the outlook for industry recovery with cautious optimism.  Sales
and production of machinery in 1991 could still fall below the industry's
worst-ever performance last year.  But over the longer term, the capital
goods industry hopes to reap the benefits of new exemptions from IPI
and ICMS assessments at the federal and state levels, as well as new
facilities for technology import and credit lines for this purpose.

Steel production this year has recovered in relation to 1990.  In the first
half, steel output rose by 8.4% from the year-ago period to 10.9 million
tons.  June production at 1.7 million tons was 12.5% above the June
1990 total, though down by 11.6% from the previous month.  The
Brazilian Steel Institute (IBS) discounted the monthly decline in June as
an aberration due to operational problems at the big state mills that
provide all basic flat steel.  The IBS prognosis is for continued recovery
in the second half, with annual production expected to hit 22.8 millon
tons -- up 11% from 1990.  The industry association attributes the gains
to both the nascent domestic market recovery and continued expansion
in key export markets.

AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK

One major restraining influence on the overall economic recovery has
been the poor performance of the farm sector in Brazil this year.  During
the troubled 1980s -- commonly called the "lost decade" by Brazilian
economists -- agriculture was one of the few economic sectors that
prospered.  In the keystone producing state of Sao Paulo, for example,
the economy as a whole grew by just 0.64% from 1981 to 1990, but
agricultural sector growth was nearly four times as high at 2.28%.
Regions in upstate Sao Paulo and other southern states where production
of top agricultural exports such as soybeans, chicken, beef and oranges
is concentrated became islands of prosperity in the midst of recession.

But that situation has reversed in the wake of the third consecutive poor
grain harvest this year, compounded by the recent fall in soy product
exports and a softening in international prices for orange juice exports.
These factors have brought the full force of recession to the farm sector,
and producers in most areas show no signs of moving into recovery
before yearend.  The dampening impact of the agricultural recession has
restrained consumer expenditures and slowed recovery in related
industries.

While the near-term agricultural outlook remains grim, prospects for
recovery in 1992 appear more favorable.  The new farm package
announced by the Collor government in mid-July reduces taxes on farm
equipment, expands farm credit facilities and establishes a more rational
market-based system of price supports.  The government has also
promised to accelerate decontrol of prices for agricultural products.  At
the same time, key farm states such as Sao Paulo have reduced taxes on
agricultural exports and production inputs such as fertilizer and
pesticides.

These positive steps should pave the way for a robust recovery in the
agricultural sector next year.  But so long as the sector remains
depressed, it is bound to slow the general economy's movement into
recovery given the farm sector's continued importance as both a major
purchaser of durables and other inputs and a source of consumer
spending power.

RETAIL OUTLOOK

The June surge in new car sales by 25% from the previous month and
18% from year-ago levels gave a big boost to overall retail sales
performance.  A preliminary study by the Sao Paulo State Retail
Federation estimated June gains in retail sales in the state of 6% from
May, and 9% from June 1990.  Excluding car sales, however, retail
business actually fell by 1% in June from the previous month.  For the
entire first semester, retail sales showed moderate improvement with a
2% gain from the year-ago level.

Final statistics through May confirm the sectoral trend toward recovery.
Overall retail sales in May improved by 4.4% from the previous month,
the largest gain for the January-May period.  Supermarket sales in May
posted a robust 13.7% advance from the previous month, though sales
for the first five months of 1991 fell by 23% from 1990 levels.
Department store sales in May rose by 22.5% from the April total.

Greater demand for credit purchases appears to indicate that the present
momentum of the retail sector recovery should carry at least through
August.  In the first half of July, consumer credit inquiries in Sao Paulo
were reported up by 8.5% from a year ago.  That indicator is significant
given the virtual disappearance of credit purchases in the past two years
because of prohibitively high interest rate charges.  As inflation has
stabilized, retail stores have begun to offer more reasonable rates,
whetting consumer appetite for credit.

Recovery in the consumer economy should get a new push in September
as the government begins disburse-ments in 12 monthly instalments of
new cruzado funds blocked at the CB.  Many consumers already are
counting on use of this money to finance purchases on credit, and the
retail sector is beginning to introduce special promotions aimed at
exploiting this emerging source of demand.

PROSPECTS FOR RECOVERY

At this early turning point in the recovery, Brazilian businesses still show
considerable confusion over the near- and middle-range economic
outlook.  Some industries are gambling heavily on recovery: Processed-
food companies, for instance, are proceeding with productive expansion
despite present softness in sales performance, in expectation that the
consumer economy will move firmly into recovery in the second half.

By contrast, most capital goods manufacturers have been slow to expand
capacity and investment despite promising signals of gradual market
improvement.  Similarly, foreign investors face a difficult call in
determining whether recovery indeed has taken firm root in Brazil -- and
the answer in many cases will be decisive in determining whether and
when to enter or expand commitments to the Brazilian market. Moreira's
stop-and-go fiscal and monetary strategy -- encouraging recovery to an
extent, but also restraining its pace so as to maintain control of inflation
-- will keep prospective investors guessing for some time to come.

Despite the apparent contradictions in present policy, notably in EM 297,
Moreira has shown considerable skill thus far in lifting price controls and
nudging the economy toward recovery without triggering a new
inflationary surge.  The next challenge is to fulfill Collor Plan
commitments to commence disbursements from blocked new cruzado
accounts in September while maintaining control over money supply
expansion.  The mere prospect already is heating up the consumer
economy, which poses an immediate inflation risk.  Moreira's move to
tighten industrial tax collection terms, though clearly recessionary, could
also provide a useful brake in preventing the economy from overheating.

Brazil Service views prospects for sustained recovery in key industrial
and retail sectors as favorable, though a revival in the agricultural
economy appears unlikely until 1992.  Moreira's action to maintain a
measure of fiscal and monetary restraint on the pace of recovery could
provide a more solid base for long-term recovery by preventing a
resurgence of inflation, and thus a return to the shock-plan therapy that
has distorted the general economy over the past five years.  It appears
that the present economic team is less concerned with short-term political
expediency than responsible fiscal and monetary management -- and that
must be regarded as good news for prospective investors.

INDIA: Strong buying interest fuels Thermax and affects performance at
other companies

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by T.B. Kapali & Krishnan Thiagarajan

THE Bombay Stock Exchange failed to shake off the bear hug as the
30-share Sensitive Index plummeted further by around 13 points to
close the day at 3,226.80. The value of  business  transacted  at
the exchange dropped sharply from Rs. 349.95 crores to Rs. 297.58
crores. With 1,276 stocks appreciating  in  value  against  1,061
declining in value, the advances to decline ratio stood at 1.20.

Thermax hogged the limelight during the day's trading.  The  trad
ing volumes in the stock shot up from  7,000  shares  during  Mon
day's trading to 50,900 shares on Tuesday. The stock  price  rose
by Rs. 0.50 to settle for the day at Rs. 415.

Indian Petrochemicals  Corporation  (IPCL)  marginally  recovered
some lost ground to appreciate by Rs. 2.25 to settle for the  day
at Rs. 113.50 on the back of strong trading volumes. The  trading
volumes spiralled from 4,54,060  shares  on  Monday  to  4,60,420
shares during the day.

Recent news reports reveal that the company, besides being hit by
an unfavourable Budget, has also closed down its xylene plant for
the past three to four months due to poor offtake  from  domestic
producers. The bottomline is likely to be  affected  as  a  conse
quence. Over the last  week,  the  stock  had  consistently  shed
value.

The Modern Threads stock registered a gain of Rs. 1 to settle for
the day at Rs. 76.50 accompanied by a surge in  trading  volumes.
The trading volumes soared from 3,355 shares  to  21,262  shares.
Modern Threads is coming out with a rights/public issue of 18 per
cent fixed  convertible  debentures  (FCD)  to  part-finance  its
paraxylene-purified terepthalic acid project.

The Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) stock  gained  Rs.  6  to
close for the day at Rs.  287.50.  The  trading  volumes  in  the
stock, however, declined from 1,89,300 shares to  99,200  shares.
The company has  deferred  its  Rs.  412.50-crore  maiden  equity
issue, which was to expected to open for subscription  late  next
month, on account of the poor market sentiment.

The Himachal  Futuristic  Communication  (HFCL)  stock  attracted
heavy trading volumes, which soared from

1,400 shares to 1,00,700 shares. The stock price moved up by  Rs.
1.15 to rest for the day at Rs. 14.65.

The ACC stock ended the day at Rs. 1,760,  down  Rs.  19.75  from
Monday's close of Rs. 1,779.75. The volume of  shares  traded  in
this counter rose from 15,636 to 36,161 shares. This stock, which
had been ruling at around Rs. 2,025 about a month and a half ago,
rose to around Rs. 2,160 towards August-end and  early-September.
But, it moved back to the Rs. 2,025-level in mid-September.

Since then, it has been on a steady decline, and  closed  at  Rs.
1,779.75 on Monday. The trading  volumes  have  also  been  quite
heavy in the last month and a half with an average  daily  volume
being about 18,000 shares.

The Sesa Goa stock  also  moved  southwards  as  trading  volumes
increased sharply,  indicating  intense  selling  pressure.  From
1,350 shares traded on Monday, the quantity of business  in  this
counter rose substantially to 25,345 shares on Tuesday.

The scrip shed Rs. 9.25 to close the day  at  Rs.  180.25.  Price
movements in this scrip also fall into two distinct periods  over
the last month and a half. From the Rs. 329-level  in  the  third
week of August, the scrip gained initially to  touch  around  Rs.
360-370 in the second week of September. But there  was  a  sharp
drop in values in the subsequent period, when it fell  to  around
Rs. 310 and then to around Rs. 290.  The  plunge  continued  with
about Rs. 70 lost in a single day's trading on  September  18  as
the scrip ended that day at Rs. 221. It has since moved  down  to
the current levels.

Sterlite Industries also  continued  its  downward  journey.  The
scrip ended the day at Rs. 177, down Rs. 8.75 from Monday's close
of Rs. 185.75. From 47,832 shares  that  changed  hands  in  this
counter on Monday, the number of shares traded almost doubled  to
Rs. 91,945 shares in the day's trading.

INDIA: National Panasonic launching new products

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Staff Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Oct. 1

NATIONAL Panasonic is launching  a  whole  new  range  of  colour
television sets and audio systems in the Indian market.  The  new
products, to be introduced next month, include 11  colour  televi
sion (CTV) models and three audio systems.

Announcing the launch, Mr. Toshi Nakajima, Managing  Director  of
National Panasonic India Pvt Ltd, said at the core of Panasonic's
technology was the realisation that picture quality was the  most
important element influencing purchases even in the case  of  the
Indian consumer. Every Panasonic TV was a multi-system  with  106
receivable channels and hyper band, he said. No other  colour  TV
brand in India offered hyper band in all models.

The new TV models include a 47' wide projection TV, to be  priced
at approximately Rs. 2.40 lakhs, a model in the 32'  width  range
to be priced at about Rs. 1.25 lakhs and two models in the `GAOO'
series priced at Rs. 65,000 and Rs. 59,000 each.  This  would  be
the first time in the Indian consumer electronics market that  11
CTV models are being launched simultaneously by any company.

The new audio systems being  launched  include  two  mini  stereo
compos with 5-CD changers and a premium  segment  60+1CD  changer
with 1,600 watts PMPO. All these models are equipped with  patent
ed Panasonic MASH  technology  for  noise  reduction  and  V-Bass
circuitry for ensuring deep bass.

Panasonic launched its products in the Capital in  December  1994
and later all over the country.  The  company  sold  as  many  as
60,000 CTVs last year, which represented  3.5  per  cent  of  the
Indian market. It expects to sell about 1,00,000 sets,  represent
ing 5 per cent of the projected market size, this year.

Currently, the company is importing four out of the 11 CTV models
and the other seven models are being produced indigenously.

A company statement said the  commitment  to  excellence  in  all
spheres such as manufacturing, marketing,  research  and  develop
ment and customer  care  of  Matsushita  Electric  worldwide  was
sought to be incorporated in the operations of National Panasonic
India too. Worldwide, Panasonic hopes to manufacture and sell  10
million CTVs this year. It would represent about nine per cent of
the total international demand for CTVs.

Indian Oil Corp unveils Rs. 35,000-cr. investment plans

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Principal Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Oct. 1

EVEN as Indian  Oil  Corporation  unveiled  long-term  investment
plans of Rs. 35,000 crores here on Tuesday,  officials  indicated
the company would tap the market only in the next fiscal. Neither
a public issue nor a bonds offering was envisaged in the  current
fiscal.

The IOC CMD, Mr. R. K. Narang, said the corporation was  revising
the size of its Paradeep refinery, being  set  up  in  consortium
with Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, to 12 MMTPA from 6 MMTPA.

Official sources said the corporation  would  meet  its  resource
requirements through  internal  accruals  in  1996-97  and  might
launch its initial public offering in the next fiscal. The  bonds
offering, too, would materialise only next year,  said  the  offi
cials. They also said the  corporation  was  considering  issuing
bonus shares before the Government disinvestment. (The Centre  is
disinvesting 5 per cent stake).

Profits are expected to rise to Rs. 1,800 crores in 1996-97.  The
four focus areas for the corporation are upgradation of  existing
facilities, expansion of infrastructure and customer  facilities,
entry into new segments and globalisation of  operations,  includ
ing consultancy.

The corporation has projects of Rs. 10,000  crores  on  hand  and
investments of Rs. 25,000 crores have been identified.  The  Para
deep refinery, expected to go on stream by 2001, would involve an
investment to the tune of Rs. 10,085 crores, Mr. Narang at a news
conference.

Although IOC has obtained approval for only a 6 MMTPA refinery at
Paradeep, it now plans to move a proposal for a 12 MMTPA unit  on
the basis of the recommendation  of  the  recently  completed  de
tailed feasibility report. A product pipeline, linking  the  Para
deep refinery to high consumption  centres  such  as  Ranchi,  is
envisaged as an add-on.

Mr. Narang also  officially  confirmed  that  the  memorandum  of
understanding between IOC and the Saudi  giant  Aramco  was  off,
since the latter was setting up a refinery in Punjab  with  Hindu
stan Petroleum Corporation. The  IOC-Aramco  venture  was  for  a
refinery project in the same region.

Mr. Narang said the company had been intimated that it could  set
up power plants based on residual fuels,  such  as  furnace  oil,
near its refineries. Naptha, as a base, however, was  ruled  out.
The company's memorandum of understanding with the Punjab  Govern
ment for a power plant at Bhatinda still stood.

Projects for production of  MTBE  and  butene-I  at  Gujarat  and
propylene in Panipat were already in progress.  LNG  imports  and
production of paraxylene, linear alkyl benzene and ACN were  also
on the anvil, he said.

The corporation is prioritising globalisation of its  consultancy
services, R&D activities and lubricants marketing. It  has  envis
aged an investment of over Rs. 8,000 crores marketing  infrastruc
ture. Expansion of capacity at various refineries has  also  been
planned.

Securities & Exchange Board of India insists stock exchanges verify payment
of all commissions & brokerages

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

MUMBAI: The Securities and Exchange Board of  India  (SEBI)  will
insist  that  the  stock  exchanges  verify   whether   all   the
commissions  and  brokerages  have  been  paid  before   allowing
companies to use the proceeds of a public issue. The  Association
of Merchant Bankers of India (AMBI) had presented a  proposal  to
SEBI for the creation of a separate account in which the all  the
proceeds due to the intermediaries would be deposited. SEBI is of
the view that as a regulatory body, it should not involve  itself
with the  enforcement  of  commercial  transactions  between  the
intermediary and the  issuer,  as  the  company  is  not  in  its
jurisdiction.

Indian Petrochemicals Corp hikes DMT price

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

MUMBAI: Indian Petrochemical Corporation Ltd has hiked its  price
for DMT to Rs. 25,500 per tonne for October from  Rs  22,000  per
tonne. The hike follows the uptrend in  international  prices  of
DMT. The company has, however, cut its price for acrylonitrile to
Rs. 32,000 per  tonne  from  Rs.  42,000  per  tonne,  to  remain
competitive against cheaper imports of the material and  expedite
liquidation of stocks. Prices of heavy alkalites have dropped  to
Rs. 15,000 per tonne from Rs. 17,000 per tonne. The hike  in  the
prices of DMT by IPCL follows the increase by  Bombay  Dyeing  by
Rs. 3,500 per tonne to Rs. 28,500 per tonne.

INDIA: Nippon Telegraph and Telephone develops WebDeFax

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

TOKYO: Now, you can easily view faxed documents on your  personal
computer hooked up to the local-area networks (LANs),  thanks  to
the WebDeFax, a new system  developed  by  Nippon  Telegraph  and
Telephone    Corporation    (NTT),    the     country's     major
telecommunications  giant.  According  to  NTT,  the  new  system
converts the fax into a HyperText Markup Language (HTML) document
and then stores it on a World Wide Web (WWW) server. WWW  browser
software is used to view the fax on a PC. In other words,  a  fax
can be received by simply hooking a PC to the Internet and a  fax
machine can transmit to a PC that is connected to  the  Internet.
The Web browser provides an interface at the  receiving  end  and
the system can be integrated with other groupware  products  that
use a Web  browser  for  the  user  interface,  such  as  a  time
management programme. NTT said the  system  was  also  compatible
with the Media Agent/GW system, which allows electronic  mail  to
be forwarded to fax machines and pagers using the same  procedure
as sending e-mail. NTT plans to put the WebDeFax on the  Japanese
market before the end of the year.

INDIA: STOCK MARKET, 10-02-96

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

DALAL STREET: Equities on the Bombay Stock Exchange  (BSE)  moved
in a narrow range on Tuesday on account of lack of  support  from
institutions, both foreign and domestic. The BSE sensitive  index
moved down by around 13 points to end the day at 3226.80  points.
The market opened at 3249.15 and touched the day's low of 3220.05
points. The BSE National index ended at  1447.43  points,  losing
over two points over the previous close. The  total  turnover  on
the exchange was 1.98 crore shares worth Rs. 297.57 crores. While
the market moved listlessly, heavy short-covering  was  witnessed
in ITC towards the end of the session on the  NSE.  According  to
brokers, operators in Calcutta had huge short  positions  in  ITC
with the scrip gaining Rs. 2 over the previous close  to  end  at
Rs. 302.25. Foreign funds were once again selling  SBI  with  the
stock touching the day's low of Rs. 248.50 before closing at  Rs.
249.75, down Rs. 3  over  the  previous  close.  There  was  some
interest in IPCL as well with the stock moving up by Rs. 2.25  to
end at Rs. 113.50. Tata Tea ended at Rs.  237.  HDFC  once  again
touched a 52-week  low  of  Rs.  2,200  while  Grasim  Industries
recorded a 52-week low of Rs. 381.25. In the cash  group,  shares
which were active included ABB,  Thermax,  IFCI,  Thermax,  Bajaj
Tempo, Sesa Goa, NIIT, BHEL, HDFC  Bank,  Dr.  Reddy's  Labs  and
Punjab Wireless.

NSE: Political uncertainty continued to dampen  market  sentiment
and share prices on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) ended lower
in end-account trade. The 50-share NSE index  touched  a  low  of
933.56 points before closing at 936.27, losing 7.69  points  over
the previous close. The net traded value was  Rs.  987.87  crores
and the net traded quantity was 521.11 lakh shares. Shares of ITC
were in the limelight on  account  of  hectic  short-covering  by
speculators. The share gained Rs. 4 to end at Rs. 306 with shares
worth Rs. 163.40 crores traded. State Bank of India edged down to
Rs. 251 from the previous Rs. 252 in moderate  trade  with  deals
aggregating Rs. 468.58 crores. IPCL also moved up by Rs. 4 to Rs.
116 on short-covering. Shares worth Rs. 24.80 crores were traded.
The other active shares include Reliance,  Bajaj  Auto,  Bank  of
Rajasthan, NIIT, BHEL, Tata  Tea,  Hindalco,  Oriental  Bank  and
Brooke Bond Lipton. The National bourse is closed on Wednesday on
account of Gandhi Jayanti.

LYONS RANGE: ITC remained at the  centre-stage  at  the  Calcutta
Stock Exchange on Tuesday. In an otherwise dull market, the scrip
improved as a result of concerted buying in all the  major  stock
exchanges.  Among  the  other  pivotals,   while   Reliance   was
unchanged, Tisco and SBI declined. The CSE Sensitive Index  eased
to 423.38 points from the previous close of  424.61  points.  The
overall volume was poor. ITC opened higher at Rs. 303 against the
previous closing of Rs. 302, then  shot  up  to  Rs.  306.25  but
declined on profit-taking to close at Rs.  303.  Tisco  lost  Rs.
1.50 at Rs. 173. Reliance, moving on a very thin groove, returned
to the previous close of Rs. 192. SBI surrendered Rs.  3  at  Rs.
250.50. ACC was down by Rs. 10 at Rs. 1,775 and L&T at close sold
at Rs. 232, a rupee down from the previous level. CESC,  however,
inched ahead by 25 paise to Rs. 63.75 and Hind Motor improved  by
10 paise to Rs. 18.80. Bata was down by Rs. 3 at Rs. 62.

MADRAS: Sentiment at the Madras Stock Exchange (MSE) continued to
remain weak,  with  prices  of  most  scrips  maintained  at  the
previous close. The market, which opened  weak,  dropped  further
during close. The  MSE  share  price  index  closed  at  3373.27,
reflecting a  loss  of  1.44  points  over  the  previous  close.
Pivotals Reliance and Tisco witnessed some  buying  interest  but
prices moved in a narrow band. Going against the trend,  however,
was ITC which closed at better levels than Monday. Market sources
said the weak trend was reflective of the trend in bourses across
the country. Tuesday being settlement day,  there  was  a  slight
improvement  in  volumes.  FIIs  continued  to   maintain   their
wait-and-watch attitude. Low-priced counters also did not witness
much activity. The exchange will remain closed  on  Wednesday  on
account of Gandhi Jayanti.

DELHI: The stock market showed a mixed trend when  select  scrips
continued to forge ahead on persistent speculative-cum-investment
buying while a few others  lacked  the  necessary  follow-up  and
declined. Institutional  support  was  negligible  and  upcountry
advices were weak. The market opened on a steady  note  and  soon
some scrips met with fresh offerings  and  declined,  while  some
others continued to attract speculative  support  and  rose.  The
Delhi Stock Exchange sensitive  index,  however,  eased  by  2.50
points to settle at 719.74 points. In the specified section, ACC,
Asian Hotels, Bajaj Auto, BSES, Hind Lever, ITC  Hotels  and  ITC
improved on increased speculative buying. On the other hand, DCM,
Apollo Tyres, ICICI, IPCL, L&T, MTNL,  Reliance  Industries,  SBI
and Telco declined on profit selling. In the cash  section,  Bank
of Rajasthan, Dewan Rubber, Modern Syntex, Monnet Industries  and
Reliance Capital rose on brisk  investment  support  while  Dewan
Tyres, Dr. Wellman's Homeopathic  Labs,  Escorts  Finance,  Hotel
Leela, Jindal Iron, Jindal  Strips,  Kuber  Auto,  Padmini  Poly,
Ramanuj Leasing and Saw  Pipes  met  with  selling  pressure  and
declined.

BANGALORE: A dull trend prevailed on the Bangalore Stock Exchange
with most of the counters failing to receive buying support.  The
volumes were low during the day. After a  bearish  trend  in  the
previous session, the market commenced on  a  dull  note.  Though
there was no fresh selling pressure  in  the  opening  hour,  the
volumes were low and the operators were unwilling to  take  fresh
positions. According to market sources, the general sentiment has
been hesitant in the last  couple  of  weeks.  With  the  primary
markets being active, the investor funds have been minimal in the
secondary markets. Despite the low volumes, most of the  pivotals
ruled firm in Tuesday's  trading.  Reliance,  for  instance,  was
steady at around Rs. 191 and SBI moved up to Rs. 255  during  the
day. The activity in local shares was limited.

HYDERABAD: The near total absence of financial  institutions  and
FIIs from the stock market had a lot to do with  the  decline  in
select scrips. As such, the lowest turnover of Rs.  48  lakhs  in
the last three decades was registered  on  Tuesday.  Brokers  say
that unless some sops  are  given  to  the  capital  market,  the
sentiment is not likely to improve. The Hyderabad Stock  Exchange
(HSE) authorities should take some remedial measures to  gear  up
the trading process. The HSE recorded a meagre turnover of Rs. 48
lakhs in 188 transactions involving 1,71,826 shares of 86 scrips.
The scrips which remained  dormant  were  Ashok  Polymers,  Asian
Polymers, Kreb's Bio,  Livewell  Home,  Nath  Securities,  Sanghi
Polyesters, Sri Krishna Drugs, Sri Vasavi Steels,  Sujana  Steels
and V.R. Mathur Mass Comm. Among the losers were H.G.  Portfolio,
Indo-Asian Housing Corporation, Northeast  Securities,  Sharpscan
and Prints, V.B.C. Ferro Alloys and Vini Metaspin.  However,  the
scrips of Amar Raja Batteries, L.N. Polyesters and Sibar  Finance
were among the gainers.

INDIA: COMMODITIES, 10-02-96: Precious metals decline

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Both the  precious  metals  declined  moderately  on  the  Mumbai
bullion market on Tuesday. Silver  declined  in  the  absence  of
industrial demand and in the wake of  increased  arrivals.  Lower
international advices dampened the sentiment. Gold prices dropped
on account of increased stockists offerings in the wake of  fresh
arrivals as against poor local buying interest. Silver ready .999
fineness and tenderable silver both declined by Rs.  25  each  to
Rs. 6,900 and Rs. 6,905 respectively. Raw  silver  .916  fineness
dropped by Rs. 30 to Rs. 6,800. Standard gold eased by Rs. 10  to
Rs. 5,105. 22-carat gold was nominally quoted lower by Rs. 10  to
Rs. 4,720. Ten-tola gold bar .999 purity moved down by Rs. 100 to
Rs. 59,700.

INDIA: Costly amputation: Ponni Sugars

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Ponni Sugars' decision to sell its 2,500 TCD (tonnes crushed  per
day) sugar unit at Erode to a  group  company,  Seshasayee  Paper
Boards, may not augur well for its share price.  The  Erode  unit
has been the mainstay of the company's operations, being its only
unit with an established command area. With the sale of the Erode
unit, business volumes  will  have  to  come  entirely  from  the
company's units at Bolangir and Bargarh  in  Orissa,  where  cane
availability has posed frequent problems for the company  in  the
past. Both these units have been operating at less  than  50  per
cent capacity utilisation over the past two years. As the sale of
the Erode unit creates considerable uncertainties about the  near
term business prospects of  Ponni  Sugars,  the  share  price  is
likely to remain under selling pressure.

INDIA: Strained margins: Non-disbursal of ad hoc subsidies due to
di-ammonium phosphate producers

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

The reported non-disbursal of the ad  hoc  subsidies  due  to  di
ammonium phosphate (DAP) producers since December 1995, is likely
to adversely impact the first half financial results (1996-97) of
companies such as Godavari Fertilisers, Zuari Agro and FACT.  The
subsidies have not been disbursed on  account  of  the  delay  by
respective State Governments in certifying the sales, which is  a
prerequisite for disbursement. Delays in realisation of  revenues
at a time  when  the  industry  is  already  facing  considerable
pressure on the profit margins on  account  of  spiralling  input
costs, could strain the finances of DAP producers.

by Krishnan Thiagarajan

The  BSE  Sensex  continued  its  downward  course  relentlessly,
shedding another 15 points on Monday. With the Sensex registering
a consistent decline, the stocks which have  lost  lustre  assume
relevance and  include  some  heavyweights  such  as  HDFC,  ACC,
Century Textiles, BSES, Apollo Tyres and Pfizer. While HDFC  shed
Rs. 398.75 over the last fortnight, ACC lost around Rs.  380  and
Century Textiles nosedived by Rs. 885.75.

INDIA-FAST TRACK: Housing Development Finance Corp

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

HDFC: The share price has been on a steady  decline  having  lost
Rs. 398.75, moving down from Rs. 2,697.50 to  Rs.  2,298.75  over
the last fortnight. HDFC is a  premier  finance  housing  finance
company and is also credited with  the  creation  of  the  retail
housing finance industry. It has the largest retail network.  The
company has widened its span of activities to encompass,  besides
its core lending business, property-related  services,  training,
consultancy and lease  finance.  It  has  also  assisted  in  the
setting up of housing finance companies in  joint  ventures  with
various banks and General Insurance Co. The company has put in an
impressive financial performance in 1995 -96 in  the  face  of  a
tough financial environment. The total income registered a 26 per
cent increase to Rs. 982.18 crores. It  was  fully  supported  by
loan approvals and disbursements which were Rs. 2,071 crores  and
Rs.  1,683  crores  respectively.  Despite  the  rocky  financial
situation, the company managed to raise deposits from  Rs.  1,853
crores to Rs. 2,513 crores which is likely to help it enlarge its
presence in both the retail and wholesale segment of the  housing
finance business.

INDIA-FAST TRACK: Apollo Tyres

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Apollo Tyres: The share price declined by Rs.  52,  shedding  Rs.
167 to Rs. 115 over the last 15 trading days.  Apollo  Tyres,  an
established player in the truck  and  bus  tyre  segment,  has  a
market share of 10.90 per cent by weight and  7.30  per  cent  in
numbers. Work on the modernisation and expansion plant at  Baroda
has been successfully  completed  and  the  benefit  of  enhanced
production will accrue to the bottomline from the  current  year.
The  modernisation  plant  at  Perambra  plant  is   also   under
implementation.  It  has  also  commissioned  a  new   plant   to
manufacture tubes and flaps with a capital cost of Rs. 32  crores
at Ranjangaon near at Pune for captive consumption. It  has  also
drawn up a detailed modernisation plan for Premier Tyres  (sought
to be revived through a BIFR revival package) at  Kalamassery  in
Kerala at a capital outlay of Rs. 8 crores. In order to meet  the
demand arising from the new generation technology  radial  tyres,
it  has  recently  entered  into  a  50:50  joint  venture   with
Continental AG of Germany to make a foray into the passenger  car
radial tyre segment at Pune. The capital outlay is expected to be
Rs. 400 crores and the initial production capacity would  be  4.7
million  passenger  car  radial  tyres  per   annum.   Commercial
production is slated to commence by mid-1998. For the year  ended
March 31, 1996, it has recorded a turnover of Rs. 1,237.69 crores
and post-tax earnings of Rs. 35.31 crores. On an equity  base  of
Rs. 29.46 crores, the EPS works out to Rs. 11.98. On the  current
market price, the stock trades at a price earnings multiple of 10
times its 1995 -96 earnings.

INDIA: Cane diversion may increase in "96-97

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

CALCUTTA:  Diversion  of   sugarcane   to   khandsari   and   gur
manufacturers during the 1996-97 sugar season is expected  to  be
larger than what it was during the 1995-96 season,  according  to
estimates. It may also lead to lower production of  sugar  during
the 1996-97 season at 155 lakh tonnes (as per industry estimates)
compared to 164.02 lakh tonnes in 1995-96. The total availability
for 1996-97 is, however, expected to be 235 lakh  tonnes  against
220 lakh tonnes in  1995-96,  largely  because  the  industry  is
overburdened on account of heavy stocks (with an aggregate  stock
of 80 lakh tonnes lying with all sugar factories) to the tune  of
Rs. 600 crores.  The  decrease  in  production  over  1995-96  is
expected to  be  11  lakh  tonnes  in  Maharashtra  (the  largest
producer), 5.8 lakh tonnes in Gujarat, 4.7 lakh tonnes in Central
UP and 4 lakh tonnes in Madhya Pradesh. Mr. O. P. Dhanuka, former
President of the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), said  the
industry, due to high production, was holding  stocks  equivalent
to 7 months' consumption. Another factor adding to the  indstry's
woes was the plunge in alcohol prices, from Rs. 28 per  litre  in
1993-94 to Rs. 4 per litre as on  date,  with  demand  still  not
picking up. This led to a huge pile-up of  molasses  stocks  with
sugar mills, which are having inventory problems, he said.

EDITORIAL: Anti-dumping blues: Major hurdle in the way of India"s exports
to Europe

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Anti-dumping action by the European Union has  the  potential  of
developing into a major hurdle in the way of India's  exports  to
Europe. Currently, as was made clear at a recent seminar  by  Mr.
Harold Wenig, head of the anti-dumping unit of the EU,  ``only  a
minuscule 0.05 per cent of Indian exports is  covered  under  the
anti-dumping provisions of the  European  Commission''.  But  the
fact remains that since the beginning of the current  year  there
has been  an  increasing  trend  of  anti-dumping  charges  being
slapped on India's exports. This has been linked  to  efforts  on
the part of the European industry trying to protect itself in the
face of WTO-regulated moves to lower trade barriers all over  the
world.

As is to be expected, it is not only European importers  who  are
moving to make the entry of cheap  imports  from  the  developing
world more difficult. In the course of  a  single  month  earlier
this  year,   the   US   International   Trade   Council   levied
countervailing duties on 15 Indian exporters of  iron  and  steel
products and anti-dumping duties on as many as 25  exporters.  In
the  case  of  the  US,  this  is  an  election   year   and   no
administration can  afford  to  alienate  the  powerful  domestic
industrial lobbies whose support is  crucial  for  a  re-election
bid. The EU has begun more than 10 investigations  against  India
alone, two of which  have  ended  with  the  imposition  of  anti
dumping  duties  on  oxalic  acid,  polyester  blended  yarn  and
polyester staple fibre. In March, reports indicated that  the  EU
had taken up  a  fresh  investigation  into  dumping  allegations
relating to grey cotton unbleached fabric against India and other
textile-exporting  countries  such  as  Pakistan,  China,  Egypt,
Turkey and Indonesia. The specific allegation made by  Eurocoton,
a European trade lobby, was that the exporters (around 265 Indian
producers are involved) were underpricing their  products  by  36
per cent resulting in a decline in the market share  of  European
textile manufacturers to 25 per cent from 33  per  cent.  Despite
the fact that an earlier investigation into  the  same  complaint
was, according to Indian officials, ``on the  verge  of  collapse
when it was withdrawn'', there is now every indication that  anti
dumping duties will  be  slapped  on  the  exporters,  the  rates
varying between 3.3 per cent and 27.5  per  cent.  In  fact,  the
Union Textiles Ministry is already reported to have taken up  the
matter with Brussels since this specific product category forms a
sizeable chunk of the country's total textile exports.

The argument that the EU should desist from slapping anti-dumping
duties of this magnitude  because  of  their  serious  impact  on
Indian exports will, of course, not be effective because Brussels
can argue, equally effectively, that it cannot allow the European
industry to be hurt by  such  cheap  imports.  The  point  is  to
convince the EU authorities that the prices of textile and  other
products currently being investigated are not  artificially  low.
This can be done only with effective legal support. Indeed,  this
need has been recognised  to  the  extent  that  a  proposal  has
already  been  made  to  the  Commerce  Ministry  (when   Mr   P.
Chidambaram was the Commerce Minister) to set  up  a  fund  which
could be utilised by exporters to challenge the levy of  punitive
duties in appropriate courts. The fund could also be used  mainly
by small and medium-size exporters to represent their case before
the EU for a reduction in the  rates  of  anti-dumping  duty  (as
reflected in the varying rates imposed on exports of grey  cotton
unbleached fabric). Such consultations  were  encouraged  by  Mr.
Wenig  at  the  New  Delhi  seminar,   his   entirely   justified
apprehension being that in the absence of such cooperation the EU
would be forced to rely on ``estimates which (are) not always  in
the best interests of the exporters''.

In short, there is nothing wrong with the  levy  of  anti-dumping
duties as such. India too has slapped similar charges  on  select
imports such as theophylline and caffeine from China.  The  point
is that the imposition should not be perceived as arbitrary,  the
latest example being the duty slapped by the  EU  on  exports  of
plastic woven sacks. The Government has an important role to play
in helping exporters in this specific sphere, a task which it has
not performed satisfactorily till now.

INDIA: Ramar claim dubbed "dishonest": Herbal fuel

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Science Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Oct. 1

MR. Ramar Pillai's claim of a successful  process  for  producing
`herbal fuel' has been dubbed `dishonest' by  the  Department  of
Science and Technology (DST), which ostensibly tried its best  to
help him obtain a patent and prove his method.

The DST Secretary, Dr. V. S.  Ramamurthy,  today  said  when  the
experiment at the Chennai IIT  failed  to  produce  any  fuel  on
September 26, Mr. Ramar used a hollow metallic stirrer from which
oil flowed into the boiling concoction of herbs, chemicals, etc.

The scientists carrying out the test had to stop  the  experiment
and were convinced beyond doubt that the wonder fuel  was  not  a
result of the reaction of the herbs  and  chemicals  mixing  with
water, but an external source, Dr.  Ramamurthy  explained  to  re
porters.

An extensive analysis of samples of the end product generated  by
Mr. Ramar in the demonstrations conducted at  the  Delhi  IIT  on
September 3 clearly indicated that it was a mixture of  kerosene,
diesel, gasoline and naphtha which matched with that available in
the country.

The Indian Institute of Petroleum  (IIP),  Dehradun,  Indian  Oil
Corporation's Research and Development Centre, Faridabad and  the
National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Pune carried out  the  tests.
In fact, the IIP said the sample, with a high content of  60  per
cent kerosene, naphtha, diesel and petrol, matched with  products
manufactured using crude oil available in India.

The DST was forced to react aggressively because  Mr.  Ramar  had
not only thrown an open challenge but  had  been  accusing  scien
tists of not being fair, when in fact all-out efforts were  being
made to help him get a patent, Dr. Ramamurthy said.

"Even today, we are open if he comes back with a request to help
him scientifically. Our effort had been limited  to  helping  him
file a strong patent and, since we did not find  scientific  vali
dation for the process, we decided not to proceed further, " the
DST Secretary said.

`No political pressures':  Denying any political pressures in the
entire episode right from the beginning, the DST  Secretary  said
what had prompted him to seriously process  the  matter  was  the
claim that herbs were the source for the  petrol,  and  that  too
from the Western Ghats, and positive  certificates  had  been  re
ceived from three Chennai-based organisations.

He said the story of Mr. Ramar, as far as the DST was  concerned,
began in December 1995 when he wrote to the  Government  that  he
had discovered a herbal fuel that could run vehicles.  The  claim
was attested by three test certificates from the Chennai IIT, the
Pollution Control Board and the Chemical  Testing  Laboratory  in
Chennai.

In July, Mr. Ramar came to the DST and demonstrated his  process.
A sample of the product was then tested at  the  NCL,  Pune.  The
report said it was pure hydrocarbon. Based on  this  feedback,  a
demonstration was organised at the Delhi IIT on September 3  with
a full log kept on whatever happened.

According to Dr. Ramamurthy, in the IIT test, Mr. Ramar used 1.05
litres water, 55 gm leaves and wood, 10 gm common salt, one slice
of lemon, a pinch of ash, 1 ml of secret chemical A, a few  drops
of petrol and a small quantity of secret chemical B.

After the experiment was done in a stainless steel vessel and the
boiling matter transferred into a bucket and covered with a white
cloth, the resultant product contained 900 ml water,  400  gm  of
the herbal fuel and 110 gm of other material.

Puzzling questions:  The puzzling questions that arose were:  How
did the clear mass increase of  400  gm  in  excess  weight  come
about? How did lead, sulphur, which  are  used  in  the  refining
process, olefins -- a consequence  of  the  cracking  process  in
refinery -- find their presence in the natural crude product that
was supposedly produced?

Armed with these doubts, the DST got together a  10-member  scien
tists' team (DST-3, DRDO-2,  IOC-1,  and  IIT  Chennai-4)  and  a
patent lawyer and went to Chennai with an open mind to  help  Mr.
Ramar file a patent if he could demonstrate his  process  success
fully, Dr. Ramamurthy said. The experiment  was  conducted  using
glass equipment provided by the IIT and as directed by Mr.  Ramar
in the presence of Ms. Poonkini and her  father,  two  other  key
players in the fuel drama. Mr. Ramar, however, could not  produce
any fuel. He later told the media  in  Chennai  that  the  entire
thing was done on too short a notice and  that  his  leaves  were
contaminated.

Southern India Mills Association for strong action to avert European Union
anti-dumping duty

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Special Correspondent

COIMBATORE, Oct. 1

THE Southern India Mills Association (SIMA) has urged the  Govern
ment to caution the European Union (EU) that  any  levy  of  anti
dumping duty on grey  cotton  fabrics  from  India  would  invite
retaliatory action from it.

In a memorandum to the Union Commerce Minister, Dr. B.  B.  Ramai
ah, the SIMA Chairman, Mr. B. K. Patodia, said it was stated that
the EU was planning to slap anti-dumping levies  on  grey  cotton
fabrics imported from India. The levy ranged from 3.3 per cent to
25 per cent, the average duty being  around  17.8  per  cent.  If
levied, it may come into force from next month.

He said there was no justification for the EU to resort  to  this
step and urged the Minister to persuade the EU through  all  chan
nels to desist from its move.

Mr. Patodia pointed out that it was not as  if  the  EU  did  not
benefit from trade with India. In 1995, India  imported  430  mil
lion-ECU worth of textile machinery from the it. Airbus Industrie
was a major supplier of aircraft to Indian airlines.

He wanted the Government to send clear signals to the EU that any
unreasonable anti-dumping levy on grey cotton fabric sourced from
India would invite reciprocal action.

He also wanted the Minister to remove the ceiling on cotton  yarn
exports and to link the export of cotton yarn to  the  fulfilment
of hank yarn obligation. He said the annual quantitative  restric
tions on cotton yarn exports was based on the wrong premise  that
unlimited yarn export would hit domestic users.

While an additional 31.66 million kg of yarn  was  exported  last
year, the additional quantity supplied  within  the  country  was
136.86 million kg.

Mr. Patodia said the  hank  yarn  obligation  was  an  artificial
restriction as there was no shortage of it. In 1995-96, hank yarn
production had been put at 580 million kg but mills were  saddled
with unsold stocks.

The SIMA Chairman said the insistence  of  the  DGFT  that  mills
given EPCG licences should export cotton yarn of  counts  of  41s
and above or they should import cotton if  they  were  to  export
lower count yarn was a  retrograde  step,  which  would  hit  the
modernisation process.

He said the international demand for cotton yarn  of  counts  41s
and above was limited. In 1995-96, counts 41s  and  above  consti
tuted barely 16 per cent of the total cotton yarn  exported.  The
restriction on the counts of cotton yarn exported would deny  the
mills the facility of importing machinery availing of  concession
al duty.

He also wanted the threshold limit of Rs. 20 crores on  the  duty
free import of capital goods under the EPCG scheme to be  altered
in so far as the textile industry was concerned and  a  limit  of
Rs. 5 crores fixed.

Mr. Patodia said Bangladesh was the largest  importer  of  Indian
cotton yarn, importing to the tune of Rs. 700 crores to  Rs.  800
crores, which  were  routed  through  Petrapole.  Infrastructural
bottlenecks there had caused a delay of 30 to 60 days in clearing
the goods. Of the Rs. 250 crores sanctioned by  the  Centre  last
year to improve facilities, only Rs. 5 crores had been disbursed.

He also opposed any move to permit the  export  of  cotton  under
open general licence (OGL) as it would erode the  competitiveness
of the cotton textile industry. He said concrete  efforts  should
be made to increase the yield of cotton,  which  at  300  kg  per
hectare was one of the lowest in the world.

He urged the Centre to permit the import of viscose staple  fibre
(VSF) under OGL on a duty-free basis to check  the  price  of  in
digenously manufactured VSF. Mr. Patodia said though VSF was  the
nearest complement to cotton as a raw material and  fabrics  made
from it met the needs of the poorer sections, there were only two
indigenous producers of VSF and its price was raised frequently.

He said the import of VSF under OGL was being allowed  even  now,
but it attracted a duty of 56.21 per cent. He wanted  imports  to
be allowed on a duty-free basis, as in the case of  cotton.  This
would help the mills obtain raw materials  at  reasonable  prices
and also steady the  price of indigenously produced VSF.

Mr. Patodia said if they  were  to  remain  cost  effective,  the
garment/knitting industry had to use sophisticated machines. But,
these industries were reserved for the SSI sector with an  invest
ment cap of Rs. 60 lakhs. He suggested that in view of  the  need
for the latest technology, the investment limit be  scrapped.  De
reservation would attract large-scale industries  to  enter  this
field.

INDIA: Contest likely for top slot in Catholic Syrian Bank

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Special Correspondent

KOCHI, Oct. 1

WITH the term of the present Chairman of  Catholic  Syrian  Bank,
Mr. Alfred Solomon, drawing to a close  on  October  30,  a  keen
contest is likely for the top slot. At the recent annual  general
body meeting, the by-laws were amended for creating the post of a
part-time Chairman. Two contenders have emerged  from  among  the
existing directors.

Mr. George Chemmanur, one of the directors in the  race  for  the
top post, said several others in the board had been urging him to
throw his hat into the ring. He said that he would be a candidate
for the post.

Meanwhile, Mr. Jose Pulikken,  another  director,  told  Business
Line that the board would come out with  a  consensus  candidate,
emphasising that there would be no contest.

Being the seniormost director of the bank, Mr. Pulikken  did  not
envisage any contest from his junior colleagues on the board.  He
was optimistic that the board  would  forward  his  name  as  the
consensus candidate for the post of part-time Chairman. He evaded
questions on whether he would withdraw  his  candidature  in  the
case of a contest.

The contest for the Chairman's post will come out into  the  open
on October 1, when the Board of Directors meet  to  consider  the
names for the post. Once the Board's choice is finalised, it will
then have to be intimated to the RBI for ratification.

Though no outcome is expected at today's (Tuesday)  meeting,  the
issue is likely to exercise the minds of board members and figure
in board meetings in future.

The possibility of appointing a part-time Chairman arose once the
Banking Regulations Act was suitably amended to create the  post.
The Thrissur-based Dhanalakshmi  Bank  already  has  a  part-time
Chairman, Mr. T. S. Pattabhiraman.

Though the part-time Chairman is not entitled  to  exercise  much
executive powers, he is supposed to convene  and  coordinate  the
board meetings of the bank.

Meanwhile, the Catholic Syrian Bank is likely to remain  headless
once Mr. Solomon reverts to his parent organisation,  State  Bank
of India as Chief General Manager.

The bank is still in the process of short-listing applicants  for
the post of Managing  Director  from  among  the  respondents  to
newspaper advertisements. The respondents have to be at the level
of a Deputy General Manager in a nationalised bank. The Board  of
Directors will have to select three candidates  and  forward  the
list to the RBI for the final choice and approval.

Several directors conceded that this was a time-consuming process
and the slot was likely to be filled well after the exit  of  the
present Chairman. Even in the  event  of  a  consensus  candidate
emerging, the process of selecting a new part-time Chairman would
be delayed since the final seal of approval has to come from  the
RBI. In the interim period, when the present Chairman leaves till
a new Managing Director or a part-time Chairman is appointed, the
RBI is likely to ask a committee comprising  three  directors  to
discharge the duties of the head of the institution.

Some of the directors expressed apprehension  over  the  emerging
contest for the Chairman's post. They conceded that the  takeover
controversy in which all the existing directors played a part had
taken a toll on the fortunes of the bank. It was an arduous  task
re-building the bank from that crisis, they said.

Uncertainty continues to persist over the 39 per cent  equity  of
the bank, which had been purchased by the  Bangkok-based  Surchan
ChansriChawla. The request to transfer  the  shares  to  the  new
purchaser is still pending clearance from the RBI.

In the absence of a clear-cut  status  on  this  large  chunk  of
equity, the bank had written to the RBI stating its inability  to
abide by the stipulated capital adequacy norms.

The move to go in for a rights issue to shore up its capital  was
stalled on account of the uncertainty over the ownership of these
shares.

INDIA: Best and Crompton impasse: Mallya blames financial institutions"
"intransigence"

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by M. Ramesh

MADRAS, Oct. 1

Mr. Vijay Mallya, Chairman of the UB group, blamed  the  intransi
gence of the financial institutions for the continued impasse  in
reviving Best and Crompton Ltd.

Talking informally to this correspondent  at  the  extra-ordinary
general meeting of McDowell and Co. Ltd here  today,  Mr.  Mallya
said in just four days after the Best and Crompton AGM  (held  on
March 27, he had deposited the Rs. 5 crores with the bank  in  an
escrow account.

The rehabilitation package  was  contingent  upon  the  promoters
bringing in their initial contribution of Rs. 5  crores.  At  the
AGM, shareholders demanded an explanation as to  why  Mr.  Mallya
had not brought in the money. To which, he replied at  that  time
that any money brought in by the promoters would be taken away by
the financial institutions against the dues to them, and Best and
Crompton would not derive any benefit out of it.

"The financial institutions (ICICI) are just  not  interested",
Mr. Mallya said today. He said that within "just 96  hours"  of
the AGM, he had deposited the required  money  "in  cold  liquid
cash". He had also given a commitment in writing  that  the  pro
moters would bring in Rs.  20  crores,  once  the  rehabilitation
package is signed, he said.

"It is six months since  I  have  deposited  the  money  (Rs.  5
crores). Where is the rehabilitation package?", he asked.

Asked what were the  events  that  followed  his  depositing  the
money, Mr. Mallya  said  financial  institutions  said  that  the
company's building on Cenatoph Road (in Madras) would have to  be
sold. For this, there were several  permissions  to  be  obtained
from the State Government. Besides,  the  financial  institutions
wanted the Rs. 20 crores to be also deposited before the  rehabil
itation package was finalised.

"I am fed up with the whole thing", Mr.  Mallya  said.  "Every
body is blaming me for what happened, but Best and Crompton is  a
100-year old company", he said, implying that  the  reasons  for
its being in a shambles were historical.

At the Best and Crompton's AGM, Mr. Mallya had said that when  he
took over the company, he was  misled  by  the  fudged  accounts.
Therefore, he had not realised the extent to  which  the  company
had gone down. When he attended the first board meeting  of  Best
and Crompton (as soon as the UB group took it over) in  1989,  he
was forced to approve the transfer of funds from the reserves  to
the profit and loss account so that  the  company  could  show  a
profit and pay a 10 per cent dividend. Further, no provision  was
made for liabilities of Rs. 30 crores, which was against  account
ing norms, he told the shareholders, in front of Mr.  V.  Sriniva
san, senior partner, Fraser and Ross, which is the auditor of the
company.

He was equally unhappy with the way things were proceeding in the
matter of Mangalore Chemicals and  Fertilisers  Ltd  (MCF).  Here
again, Mr. Mallya  blamed  the  financial  institutions  for  not
agreeing to any meaningful rehabilitation package.

Indian Statistical Institute to conduct survey on co.s awarded ISO
certification

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Principal Correspondent

CALCUTTA, Oct. 1

THE Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) has decided to  conduct  a
national survey of the 1,260 companies which  have  been  awarded
the International Standards Organisation (ISO) certification.

The exercise was to be carried  out  from  Bangalore,  under  the
leadership of Mr. U. H. Acharya and Mr. Sanjit Ray, senior  advis
ers to the statistical quality control  and  operations  research
division of the ISI.

The head of the SQC and OR  division,  Professor  Anup  Majumdar,
told Business Line that the exercise was to find  whether,  since
the rush for the ISO 9000 certification began  fours  years  ago,
the Indian industry had really achieved a improvement in  quality
or was it just a status symbol that had remained on paper.

"We also want to evaluate the degree of competitive  edge  which
the certified companies have been able to gain for themselves, "
he said.

"We plan to assimilate  through  an  independent  analysis,  the
experiences of the big, small,  private  and  the  public  sector
companies which went through the certification process, "  Prof.
Majumdar said, adding that the exercise to be  conducted  through
client contacts, personal interviews and  questionnaires  to  the
ISO companies, had already been launched on  an  informal  basis.
The entire exercise was expected to be completed in three months.

Pointing out that the three year validity period of  the  certifi
cates would now have matured for around 100  companies,  he  said
the survey would also reveal whether the corporates had opted for
decertification or had in any way lost their certification due to
non-compliance.

Referring to the UK experience in this regard, he  said  the  ISO
9000 family of certifications had more followers in the  UK  than
in any other country, even as uncertainty remained about the real
benefits from certification.

An in-depth survey of British  companies,  however,  showed  that
only those which saw certification as an integral part  of  their
management strategies were able to push the quality benchmark  to
the full extent of its possibilities.

Stressing that certification did reward investment, he said  this
was borne out by almost  12,000  UK-based  businesses  which  had
opted for ISO 900  certification.  Their  sales  were  more  than
double the UK average between  1993-94  and  1994-95,  and  these
companies were four times more likely to have survived the recent
recession. Certified companies had a failure rate of 1.1 per cent
a year, compared with the national average of 5.2 per cent.

INDIA: Iomega unruffled by LS-120 drive entry

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by Arun Natarajan

MADRAS, Oct. 1

IOMEGA Corp.,  the  US-based  maker  of  removable  data  storage
products, has dismissed any threat to its best-selling Zip  drive
from the recent entry of  the  LS-120  drive.  According  to  the
company's Senior Vice President (Europe),  Mr.  Srini  Nageshwar,
the technological superiority of the Zip drive  and  its  one-and
half year lead over the new product  will  ensure  its  continued
success over its competition.

The LS-120 has emerged as a potential threat to  the  Zip  drive,
with the world's leading PC maker, Compaq  Computers,  announcing
that it will include the LS-120 `flopptical' drive in  select  PC
models. Mr. Nageshwar, however, downplayed  the  significance  of
Compaq's move and said  the  Zip  continued  to  receive  growing
support from the rest of the industry.

"In any other industry, the  market  leader  commands  something
like 30 to 40 per cent of the market, and has a lot of clout.  In
the PC industry, however, where  the  leading  players  typically
have 10 to 15 per cent share, the influence of  just  one  player
like Compaq is not as important, " he said in an interview.

The LS-120 disks can store 120 MB of data, as against the 100  MB
capacity of the Zip disks. Mr. Nageshwar said though it would  be
"quite simple" for Iomega to increase the capacity of the  Zip,
the 20 MB difference would not warrant a change.

While the Zip drive uses a purely magnetic technology to read and
write data, the LS-120, which was developed jointly by 3M,  Matsu
shita and Compaq, uses a  combination  of  optical  and  magnetic
technology. (The `LS' in LS-120 stands  for  `laser-servo'  mecha
nism). While optical storage techniques -- like those used in  CD
drives -- provide higher storage capacities, the per  unit  costs
of optical media are much higher than those of  magnetic  storage
products. The flopptical technology attempts to  incorporate  the
best of both.

"We considered the use of a 21 MB  flopptical  as  far  back  as
1990. While in terms of performance it was slightly  faster  than
the floppy disk, the cost did not come down to  less  than  $100.
Companies like IBM and other  PC  makers  said  the  cost  should
approach something like $50. That is why we  decided  to  abandon
the flopptical technology, " Mr. Nageshwar said. While the costs
of the LS-120 and Zip drives are approximately the  same  ($200),
the LS-120 disks are expected to  cost  thrice  as  much  as  Zip
disks.

"In fact -- and this is not very well known -- it is we who sold
the flopptical to 3M and Matsushita. And it was some of our  guys
who moved to those  companies,  who  developed  it  further.  The
specifications (of the LS-120) are in fact still almost the same,
" he added.

The LS-120 enjoys an edge in the fact that  it  provides  compati
bility with the  currently  used  3.5-inch  (1.44  MB)  floppies.
Iomega is, however, confident that the  Zip  will  soon  overcome
even this handicap.

Mr. Nageshwar said the company closely analysed the importance of
compatibility before deciding to go ahead with a new format.  For
support, he pointed to the example of how the 3.5-inch floppy has
almost completely replaced its predecessor, the 5.25-inch  floppy
despite the incompatibility of their drives.

Since it began shipping in March last year,  Iomega's  Zip  drive
has become one of the hottest-selling data storage products.  The
company has sold more than two million drives in  a  little  more
than one year. It also sold about 10 million Zip disks. In  fact,
last year, it could not meet demand and has  since  licensed  out
the manufacture of drives and disks.

Iomega says the Zip  is  more  user-friendly.  According  to  Mr.
Nageshwar, the drive was created after a lot of  market  research
to identify user requirements and the problems  they  face  while
using existing storage devices. It comes with a  built-in  backup
system and the `Zip Tools' software,  which  makes  it  easy  for
users to manage, share and save data.

Iomega claims increasing  support  from  major  PC  and  consumer
electronics companies. The list includes IBM, HP,  Unisys,  Power
Computing, Micron Electronics, Acer, Packard Bell  and  NEC.  The
Zip is also supported by several of the world's leading drive and
media manufacturers, including TDK, Fuji, Sony, Maxell, and Seiko
Epson.

Recently Acer Corp. chose the Zip drive as the storage device for
its `AcerBasic' line of low-cost PCs. Also, Bandai Digital  Equip
ment Corp., one of the  licensees  for  Apple  Computer's  Pippin
Internet and gaming terminal, has announced that it will make the
Zip drive an option for its product.

Iomega's other storage products include the 1-gigabyte (GB) `Jaz'
drives and disks, the `Ditto' tape backup drives and  cartridges,
and the `Bernoulli' line of removable  drives  and  disks.  These
products are targeted at home and business PC  users.  The  educa
tion and  the  creative  professionals  (animators  and  graphics
specialists) segments were especially important to  the  company,
Mr. Nageshwar said.

Iomega has nearly 2,000 employees at its offices  worldwide.  The
company's products are available in India through TVSE's  Indmark
Infocom division.

The Zip drive was introduced in India two months ago.  The  drive
is priced at Rs. 11,500 and the disks at Rs. 1,200. Mr. Nageshwar
said the late launch here was primarily due to Iomega's inability
to provide enough units to countries  outside  the  Americas  and
Europe. He said the entire range  of  Iomega  products  would  be
available in India by the first quarter of 1997.

Mr. Nageshwar, who heads Iomega's European operations from  Germa
ny, also oversees the Indian market. Hailing from Tamil Nadu,  he
had a long stint at HP in the US before joining Iomega. While  at
HP, he was also involved in the development of the standards  for
the 3.5-inch floppy drive.

INDIA: National Thermal Power Corp posts record sales despite outstandings

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Senior Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Oct. 1

NATIONAL Thermal  Power  Corporation  Ltd  (NTPC),  has  reported
record sales of Rs. 8,387 crores during  1995-96  despite  having
outstandings in excess of Rs. 4,955 crores owed  to  the  corpora
tion by various agencies.

Addressing a press conference, the  NTPC  Chairman  and  Managing
Director, Mr. Rajendra Singh, said that the World  Bank  had  cau
tioned NTPC to take steps to recover its outstandings or the Bank
would stop the sanction of future loans.

He added that total dues, which stood at Rs. 4,047.96  crores  on
March 1996, increased to Rs.  4,944.4  crores  till  the  end  of
August, which is about 4.2 months of billing.

"This is against the World Bank norm  of  two  months.  We  have
geared our commercial activities and power supply  was  regulated
to major defaulters which include the State electricity boards of
Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. When  the  Railways
do not allow people to travel without tickets, why should we keep
on providing electricity without payment?" Mr. Singh asked.

Among the States which owed huge amounts to NTPC  include  Delhi,
which owes the corporation Rs. 743.89  crores,  UP  with  an  out
standing of Rs. 1,006.5 crores, Bihar Rs.  533.63  crores,  Jammu
and Kashmir Rs. 334.02 crores, Rajasthan Rs. 353.45 crores,  West
Bengal Rs. 186.85 crores and Maharashtra Rs. 239.37  crores.  Mr.
Singh added that the corporation was facing  less  problems  from
the States of the southern and western India.

He said that the corporation had entered into a tripartite  agree
ment with the Haryana electricity board for non-payment of  dues.
"The agreement which is legally binding  will  ensure  that  the
Reserve Bank of India pays us in case the SEB defaults."

However, despite such setbacks NTPC has been able to  register  a
net profit of Rs. 1,352.61 crores and has declared a dividend  of
Rs. 195 crores for the financial year 1995-96, up  from  Rs.  130
crores paid as dividend  last  year.  The  corporation  generated
93,155 million units of electricity at a  plant  load  factor  of
78.80 per cent, Mr. Singh said. He added that  the  total  commer
cial realisation during the year was 84.54 per cent amounting  to
Rs. 7,171.59 crores.

During the year, NTPC commissioned an additional capacity of  710
MW by synchronising one 500 MW unit in Talcher, Orissa,  and  one
unit of 210 MW in Kahalgaon, Bihar. Besides, the corporation also
acquired 460 MW of Talcher Thermal Power station  of  the  Orissa
State Electricity Board. "The total installed  capacity  of  the
corporation rose to 16,795 MW on  March  31,  1996,"  Mr.  Singh
said.

He added that during 1995-96, NTPC generated 93,155  MU  of  elec
tricity and contributed more than  31  per  cent  of  the  entire
thermal generation and 24.6 per cent of the total  generation  in
the country. "The availability factor  of  NTPC  coal-based  sta
tions for the year was 85.32 per cent, " he said.

He added that the corporation's total approved investment  up  to
March 1996 was Rs. 27,873.28 crores corresponding to an  approved
capacity of 19,115 MW.

Turning his attention to external assistance, Mr. Singh said that
work on the second stage of Unchahar project had  commenced  with
an assistance of $ 160 millions from the Asian Development  Bank.
He added that the Japanese  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund
(OECF) had agreed to give a financial assistance  of  19.817  bil
lion Yen for the proposed 1,000 MW coal-based  project  in  Simha
dri, Andhra Pradesh.

INDIA: Pradeshiya Industrial & Investment Corporation of UP taking tips
from ground realities

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by Rabindra Nath Sinha

LUCKNOW, Oct. 1

THE Pradeshiya Industrial &  Investment  Corporation  of  UP  Ltd
(PICUP), which is among the top three promotional agencies in the
country, has sought to strike a balance between  its  promotional
role and the ground realities in the capital and money markets.

With bank and institutional  funds  costly,  the  capital  market
showing no signs of a sustained pick-up and ICD rates fluctuating
on the higher side, the PICUP top brass found some deviation from
usual practices unavoidable if it were to ensure  that  its  rela
tively cheap funds were  effectively  utilised  for  the  State's
industrialisation.

Thus, in its fine-tuned scheme of things, term-lending, equipment
refinance and equipment finance have been  accorded  the  highest
priority, which, in turn, means drastically  reduced  commitments
for short-term loans. Also, PICUP has taken the view that working
capital must be the responsibility of commercial banks.

Finally, PICUP, considering ground realities, has  chosen  to  de
emphasise the joint sector concept. As it is,  entrepreneurs  are
not showing much interest in the joint  sector  concept.  On  its
part, PICUP has lost interest as subsequent disinvestment  hardly
ever takes place and, therefore, the  objective  of  re-deploying
funds in the equity of new ventures is  not  realised.  Moreover,
disinvestment in the  present  depressed  state  of  the  capital
market is ruled out.

PICUP has also minimised the earlier practice of back-loading  as
a result of which bulk of the disbursals used to be made  in  the
last four months of project implementation. A strategy of  evenly
spread disbursals is already in place to the benefit of  entrepre
neurs who, in the prevailing circumstances, are finding it  tough
to raise funds from the capital market.

The PICUP Chairman, Mr. Brijendra Sahay, and the  Managing  Direc
tor, Mr. Atul Chaturvedi, are optimistic  that  despite  the  pre
vailing political uncertainties, 1996-97 will prove to be another
successful year for the organisation "which  has  been  able  to
earn the confidence of entrepreneurs because of its  professional
ism and expertise in  project  formulation  and  appraisal".  It
enjoys `A' rating of IDBI and SIDBI, they point out with a  sense
of satisfaction.

Against the targeted Rs. 185 crores for 1996-97, sanctions in the
six months to September are placed  at  around  Rs.  134  crores,
which is 90 per cent higher on Rs. 72 crores for the  first  half
of 1995-96. Disbursements between April and September are  placed
at Rs. 64 crores, against Rs. 63 crores for the  same  period  of
1995-96. The mismatch, according to Mr.  Chaturvedi,  is  due  to
fact that this year  August  and  September  accounted  for  many
sanctions. PICUP's MD feels sanctions for the  current  financial
year may exceed the target if buoyancy  returns  to  the  capital
market.

Recoveries at around 85 per cent of the target should  be  consid
ered "good", says Mr. Chaturvedi. NPA,  at  9.92  per  cent  in
1995-96, was lower on 9.99 per cent of 1994-95 and the aim is  to
bring it down to around nine per cent at the end of  the  current
financial year. PICUP makes 100 per cent provision  against  NPA,
he points out.

According to estimates, its net profit in 1995-96  stood  at  Rs.
2.87 crores. The net profit for 1994-95 was higher  at  Rs.  5.54
crores. A pronounced downtrend in its merchant  banking  activity
during the whole of 1995-96 is a major factor to cause a  dip  in
the net profit. For the  current  financial  year,  expecting  an
improvement in the  overall  situation,  PICUP  has  projected  a
substantially higher profit of around Rs.  10  crores.  "We  fer
vently hope buoyancy will return to the capital  market  and  our
merchant banking activity will pick up, " says PICUP's MD.

An overwhelming majority of the proposals that it  receives  from
entrepreneurs are for setting up units in western and central UP.
The western UP areas -- Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater  Noida,  Meerut
-- contiguous to New Delhi are  naturally  the  investors'  first
preference because  of  excellent  communication  facilities  and
proximity to markets. Central UP is the next choice of investors;
a good number of units are already there and more are  likely  to
come up. Of the new proposals received and being processed by the
organisation, many are for setting up units for auto  components,
steel fabrication, castings, bulk drugs and pharmaceuticals.

In eastern UP, sugar and by-products continue to be the  mainstay
of the economy. PICUP hardly receives any investment proposal  of
the kind it gets for western and central UP. Mr. Sahay says  that
efforts are being made  to  generate  investments  in  agro-based
industries including food processing units.

While time alone will show to what extent the  efforts  have  suc
ceeded, it is clear that in eastern UP, further breakthrough will
be possible only with integrated sugar  complexes  having  within
their purview paper making facility, distillery, chemicals  units
and cogeneration of power.

The success of PICUP in its rather limited sphere  does  not  war
rant an inference that UP is set to emerge industrially stronger.
Because of political instability and socio-political tensions  in
the past five years, the State could not derive benefits from the
liberalisation process, despite the fact that its incentives  for
new industries compare  favourably  with  those  offered  by  the
industrially-advanced States of Maharashtra and Gujarat.

Much will hinge on the outcome of the ongoing electoral  process.
The State's industrialisation prospects will certainly look up if
the electoral process paves the way for political stability.

INDIA: Chennai housing property still dear

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by Deeptha Rajkumar

CHENNAI, Oct. 1

WHILE commercial property prices in Chennai have  plateaued  over
the past 5-6 months after a distinct fall, the prices of  residen
tial property in the city, though not exactly  untouched  by  the
slide, continue to rule high.

Builders, promoters and surveyors alike  insist  that  there  has
been no great slide in residential property prices in  the  city.
There are instances where residential properties within the  city
and even in the suburbs have defied the trend.

Of late, with a burgeoning middle class, there  has  been  a  con
scious shift on the part  of  reputed  builders  to  exploit  the
hitherto untapped potential in the suburbs. As such,  the  market
only anticipates an increase in the supply of housing stock.

While conceding that land value in Chennai has  appreciated,  Mr.
C. H. Gopinatha Rao, a valuer, however, feels that it is  more  a
seller's market. The rules and regulations are more in favour  of
the promoter.

According to Mr. P. Viswanathan, president, Sanmar Properties and
Investment Ltd, the residential property market  is  dictated  by
peripheral sentiment. His argument is that any difference can  be
attributed to the attitude of the end-user. "I conceive the real
estate market as a standard industrial product. As such, I market
a unit apartment as an industrial and emotional product. You  may
buy it as a perception product."

Mr. Ravikumar, General Manager, Chaitanya  Builders  and  Leasing
Pvt. Ltd, agrees that the effect is not so much in terms of money
as in terms of perception. He is of the  view  that  there  is  a
"tendency of late on the part of the end-user  to  postpone  his
decision".

Mr. Viswanathan said, "There is  a  difference  today  in  that,
deals which six months ago would have  been  concluded  within  a
week are taking longer to transact and  at  a  slower  pace.  But
there are transactions taking  place  and  not  at  lower  quotes
either." A tight money market,  a  dull  stock  market  and  the
effects of other financial sectors, are factors that  go  towards
slowing the pace.

Flats in Tambaram and Velachery quote at Rs. 800-1,200 a sq.  ft.
and in Mogappair around Rs. 1,100 a sq. ft. Flats in  residential
areas like Mylapore and T. Nagar go  for  upwards  of  Rs.  2,500
2,900 a sq. ft. and in areas such as Chamiers Road, Landons  Road
and Victoria Crescent, anywhere between Rs. 3,000-3,500 a sq. ft.

One reason for the comparative stability is the fact that Chennai
is predominantly an end-users' market, where in most  cases  hous
ing is an investment for life rather  than  for  speculative  pur
poses. Hence, the degree of  volatility  witnessed  elsewhere  is
absent.

Reiterating this factor is Alacrity Housing Ltd, which says  that
it is into housing as a basic need and not into real  estate  per
se. With ongoing projects in the city as well as in the  suburbs,
the company claims to have remained  untouched  by  the  apparent
lull. The company, which has branched out into the suburbs, feels
that there is a substantial market for housing there. Sales,  the
company asserts, have in no way gone down.

Mr. Navratan Lunawat, Chairman  and  Managing  Director,  Arihant
Foundations and Housing Ltd, is of the opinion  that  residential
property prices have gone up. In its  forthcoming  projects,  the
company has targeted the upper segment of the residential  proper
ty market. He reiterates that sales were never  a  problem.  "It
all depends on the credibility and repute of the builder."

Another point of view is that the lull in the real estate  market
today is more a process of  technical  correction  than  anything
else. What follows is swift reassurance that  given  the  current
scenario in the residential property market, neither the end-user
nor the long-term investor need worry. Only those  in  for  quick
returns may be affected.

Sources in the industry maintain that for the real estate  market
in the city to recoup its former gloss, it  could  take  anywhere
from nine to 12 months. Meanwhile, builders continue to look  for
customers. There are hoardings across the city  advertising  easy
credit. And the response to advertisements shows that not only is
the broker network active, the enthusiasm of  the  landowner  too
has not flagged.

INDIA: New rubber tapping system

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by Aravindan

UNLIKE most plantation crops, harvesting is a complicated process
in rubber. Latex is obtained from the  bark  of  the  tree  by  a
process of `controlled-wounding' when the shavings  of  bark  are
removed.

The response to different tapping systems varies from  one  clone
to another. In general, budded trees are to  be  tapped  on  half
spiral alternate daily (1/2Sd/2) system  and  seedlings  on  half
spiral third daily (1/2Sd/3) system. There are, however,  certain
clones such as RRII 105, PB 235 and PB 28/59 which are  prone  to
tapping panel dryness under alternate daily system.

To ward off the incidence of panel dryness, it is recommended  to
adopt d/3 tapping system where a high incidence of panel  dryness
is encountered. It is preferable to resort to d/3 system at  BO-1
and BO-2 stages if high incidence of dry trees is encountered  in
new high-yielding clones. Daily tapping will  lead  to  increased
incidence of panel dryness.

For high-yielding varieties d/3 systems  can  be  adopted  during
tapping on the virgin bark. Though the yield per hectare  may  be
less during the initial period, the return  per  tapper  will  be
higher. The difference between d/2 and d/3  system  will  be  nar
rowed in due course and there will be saving in  the  cost  under
d/3 system.

The yield from trees varies with clone, age of tree, fertility of
soil, climatic conditions, tapping system followed and  skill  of
the tapper.

Intensive tapping is generally done on old rubber trees for a few
years prior to their removal. The methods  of  intensive  tapping
depend on the  condition  of  trees,  previous  tapping  systems,
availability of bark and the period  available  for  exploitation
before felling.

When tapping of renewed bark on basal panels becomes  uneconomic,
new cuts are opened at higher levels, 180 cm from  bud  union  or
even higher. The tapper uses a small ladder  to  reach  the  cut.
Since ladder tapping is more  strenuous  and  time-consuming,  re
duced tapping tasks are done.

Controlled upward tapping (CUT) is of recent origin.  It  can  be
practiced for longer exploitation of the virgin  bark  above  the
base panel. In the CUT system, instead of using a ladder, a  long
handled modified gouge knife is used for upward tapping from  the
ground and bark consumption is minimised.  Higher  yield  can  be
obtained as there is no bark island effect.

In the CUT system, monthly bark consumption is about  3-4  cm  in
the lower half of the panel and 4-5 cm in  the  upper  half.  The
support cut may be cleaned 3-4 times a  month  to  prevent  spill
over. Since it is difficult to rainguard the panel it is  advised
to rest the panel during the  rainy  season.  With  tapping  rest
during rainy season, one panel can be tapped for  more  than  two
years. Efforts are on to evaluate methods to tap the  high  panel
during rainy season.

Special training is required to use the modified gouge knife  and
to tap without raising the hands  above  the  shoulder.  As  rain
guarding is not a normal practice in  Kanyakumari  district,  CUT
can be practised by small growers and estates. About 50 per  cent
increase in yield can be achieved by adopting this method.

Trees can be puncture-tapped when they attain 40-45 cm girth  one
year before normal opening of the tree. But, this  is  restricted
to large estates on an observational basis.

INDIA: Campco to make, sell arecanut products

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by R. Mohan

MANGALORE, Oct. 1

THE buzz word at the Rs. 175-crore Campco, Mangalore is to  diver
sify. The Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing  Co
operative Ltd, has wiped off its modest losses and emerged with a
profit of Rs. 1 crore in 1995-96.

"The figures are yet being audited.  We  will  improve  our  net
profits this year again, " Mr. K. Ram Bhat, Chairman  of  Campco
said. Talking to Business Line,  he said it had  already  decided
to reintroduce Campco chocolates in the market as early as  possi
ble.

At present, the Rs.  20-crore  chocolate  manufacturing  unit  at
Puttur is utilised by Nestle. This agreement will end in 2000 and
attractive terms are offered to Campco to let it out on lease for
30 years. However, Campco now wants to go it alone.

The aim of Campco is to ensure a fair price for arecanut  farmers
in Karnataka and Kerala. It  has  been  holding  the  price  line
favourably since 1990. It had bought 25,000  tonnes  of  arecanut
from farmers last year and this year the target was three  lakhs,
he said.

There are 64,000 farmer members of Campco in Karnataka  and  Kera
la, 465 co-operative members and 129 branches all over  the  coun
try. Though Campco's market share is only about 15 per  cent,  it
influences the market price.

One of the diversification is to make baskets and trays through a
technology developed by the Central Food  Technological  Research
Institute (CFTRI) in Mysore. The other is  to  sell  arecanut  in
small pouches of different sizes.

Mr. Pramod Kumar Rai, Managing Director of Campco, said  the  Rs.
50-lakh facility to produce such pouches was  ready  at  Yeyyadi,
near Mangalore. Trial production had commenced and Campco  expect
ed a good domestic market and demand in places such as  Singapore
and the Gulf countries, he said.

About 68,000 ha producing 1,00,000 tonnes is  under  arecanut  in
Karnataka and 69,000 ha in Kerala producing 80,000 tonnes. Campco
has already signed a tripartite agreement with the CFTRI and  the
Next Paradigm in Singapore to manufacture and sell articles  such
as baskets and trays from the arecanut  sheath  and  leaves.  The
supari pouches will  be  of  scented  and  non-scented  varieties
priced between Re. 1 and Rs.  1.50,  according  to  current  esti
mates, Mr. Rai said.

For years it was manufacturing `Winner' comparable to  Bournvita.
"From this year onwards we want to repackage it  and  market  it
aggressively, " Mr. Rai said.

The co-operative approach has helped tackle  pests  and  diseases
which affected Indian cash crops. The latest  is  the  `Kole'  or
`Mahale' disease, which has affected arecanut  trees  in  Puttur,
Sullia and Bantwal areas.

Mr. Ram Bhat and Mr. Rai were confident of tackling this  disease
and have decided to set up a research and development  unit.  The
endosulfan pesticide used killed  the  milibug  and  its  natural
predator. Further research will concentrate on a cure that  would
spare the natural predator of these ant-like pests.

Campco has invited experts from the Bangalore-based University of
Agricultural Sciences, Horticultural Department  and  Plantations
Research Institute to tackle the disease which has affected about
50 acres this year.

RM60m for SHL"s expansion

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 6

By Ishun P. Ahmad

SHL Consolidated Bhd has allocated RM60 million for the expansion of its
brick and quarry operations in its scheme to develop them as core
activities in future.
  Executive director, Mr Yap Teiong Choon told reporters yesterday after
SHL's annual general meeting that from the RM60 million, RM40 million will
be invested for the construction of a third fully automated brick plant in
Sepang while RM10 million will used for the upgrading of its first brick
plant.
  "The remaining RM10 million is set aside for the expansion of a third
quarry plant which will increase the present annual production capacity of
3 million tonnes by another 1.5 million tonnes giving a total annual
production capacity of 4.5 million tonnes," Yap said.
  The third plant, which is expected to be installed by 1998, will add-on
another annual production capacity of 100 million pieces of bricks to its
current annual capacity of 200 million pieces of bricks.
  The new plant is expected to start construction in the third quarter of
next year.
  The upgrading of the first plant involves the construction of a new
tunnel kiln and extension of a new factory space together with further
add-on of new equipment.
  Yap said the expansion will see it to be the largest manufacturer of
bricks in Malaysia and a major player in the quarry business which will
help improve future profits.
  "From our experience in the quarry business, we foresee the new quarry
plant will generate about RM10 million annual profits," Yap said.
  Meanwhile, Yap said that SHL is in the process of negotiating a number
of big projects but declined to disclose the amount and when the projects
are expected to be finalised.

Across the board: Hefty rises on second board may elicit queries

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 6

By Adi Satria

HEFTY rises in the prices of Second Board stocks may be sweet for those
individuals who happen to own the stocks but for the companies concerned,
a sudden surge in prices and volume traded invariably elicit queries from
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE).
  This is as it should be because of the danger of small capitalised
stocks being manipulated by syndicates which if left unchecked, would lead
to a sudden plunge in prices - and volume - and those who would suffer
most would be most likely the individual retail players.
  Of course, not all individuals who buy second board stocks lose money
because if they had bought the stocks sometime ago when prices were lower,
they would still stand to gain if prices drop sharply.
  A retail player who bought his shares in a second board company when the
Second Board Index was at the 300 or 400 point level.
  However, given the small number of shares floating around among the
small capitalised stocks on the second board, it would not have taken much
buying power for prices to jump up over the last few weeks.
  What this means is that if many players had been chasing stocks on the
way up, many of them would have bought them at the higher end of the price
range.
  Those who play second board stocks would have realised by now that if a
person buys second board stock to keep it and then wait for something to
happen which would push up the price, he may have to wait for quite
sometime. Maybe even a long time because there are some second board
stocks which are thinly traded and their prices barely move.
  Therefore, the person who buys a second board stock may see his money
tied in the market for an uncomfortably long time because it is not easy
to sell his stock if he needs money urgently.
  In short, the lack of liquidity among the small second board stocks is a
drawback for those may want to buy stocks when the market is "quiet." It
may be so quiet that he will not be able to find a buyer for his stock at
a reasonable price.
  The net effect of this lack of liquidity among second board stocks is
that  many punters prefer to indulge in buying and selling of second board
stocks when there is already a build-up in the volume so that there is
sufficient liquidity for him to get in fast and get out even faster when
there is a need to do so.
  Unfortunately, given the small capitalisation, by the time there is a
surge in the trading volume of second board stocks - and thus in their
liquidity - their prices would have shot up to quite a high level.
  The upshot of this is that it is at this time when many punters jump
into the second board stocks, thus ending up buying the stocks at
dangerously high prices. However, after a sharp pullback, second board
stocks need not necessarily continue to slide.
  Like all cycles, second board stocks have their ups and downs, and they
can come back again - the only question is when they will make a comeback.
Many punters will, of course, hope that they do not have to wait too long
for their comeback.

proposed acquisition of Prisma Meridian Sdn Bhd, Infostas Engineering Sdn
Bhd and a three-for-five rights issue of 61.55 million new AISB shares of
RM0.50 each at an issue price of RM5.50 per share.
  This is because the directors have been informed that Teknologi Tenaga
Perlis Sdn Bhd (TTP)'s right to finance, construct, own and operate a gas-
fuelled combined cycle power station of 650MW in Perlis has been made void
as it has been awarded to Teknologi Tenaga Perlis Consortium Sdn Bhd.
  As a result, the company has decided to abort the proposed acquisition
and consequently not to raise equity finance required through the proposed
rights issue to invest in TTP.

Hwa Tai ventures into building

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 7

By Elena Shamsuddin

BISCUITS manufacturer, Hwa Tai Food Industries Bhd is said to be
diversifying into the construction sector following the recent acquisition
of a stake in the company by Mancon Bhd.
  With this new venture, Hwa Tai is hoping that in the long term,
contribution from the construction segment will "be the same" with its
biscuits manufacturing, said a source.
  At the moment, said the source, Hwa Tai is doing earthworks at a cost of
RM15 million, for a 2,000-unit medium cost residential development project
by Mancon in Lukut.
  The source who is close to the company also pointed out that Hwa Tai,
with no landbanks, is on the look out for more land to be developed in
East Malaysia as well as in Peninsular Malaysia.
  Hwa Tai, which is listed on the second board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) is also aiming for a transfer to the main board in the
next two to three years, said the source.
  On Hwa Tai's biscuits manufacturing, he said that Hwa Tai plans to build
one factory each in a 4.5ha piece of land in Senai, Johore and an 8.1ha
land in Bukit Rakit, Terengganu.
  He said Hwa Tai has submitted layout plans to the respective state
authorities, and approval for the land in Senai is expected to be obtained
earlier than the approval for Bukit Rakit.

DVB meets local, foreign demand

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 7

By Lokman Mansor

DELLOYD Ventures Bhd (DVB), manufacturer and distributor of automotive
parts and accessories, en route for a listing on the Main Board of the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, has forecast a pre-tax profit of RM29.27
million for the year ending December 31 1996.
  The forecast includes net earnings per share of 34.75 sen, and proposed
gross dividend of 6 per cent worth RM2.73 million, according to its
prospectus released on Saturday.
  The 10-year-old DVB Group expects its business relationship with
Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd (Proton), its largest client, to
strengthen further, following the setting up of DVB's factory-cum-
warehouse at the DRB-Hicom Proton City project in Perak.
  "About 66 per cent of the group's turnover last year is attributable to
Proton and EON Trading Sdn Bhd. Orders have been increasing, including
those requiring production to commence only in 1997," DVB managing
director Tee Boon Kee said in an interview.
  He said although the group presently commits a significant part of its
production facilities to Proton, there exists a ready OEM market which is
constantly requesting the group to increase its current supplies of
automotive parts and accessories.
  "Efforts to expand and diversify our customer base is expected to result
in sales increasing to such an extent that percentage of sales to Proton,
although expected to follow a growing trend, will decrease in future.
Everything will balance out," Tee added.
  In line with its overseas marketing strategy, the DVB group is already
seeking to expand its export customer base through the manufacture and
supply of radio antennas to Thailand for Toyota cars, and the manufacture
and supply of automotive parts and accessories for PT Timor Putra
Nasional, the Indonesian national car manufacturer.
  "Our products are already exported there. Eventually, we plan to set up
manufacturing facilities in Indonesia," he said.
  DVB's list of international direct export customers include countries in
South-East Asia and West Asia, Pakistan, the US, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, New
Zealand, Brazil and Fiji.
  Tee said the group also has plans to set up overseas joint venture
companies to strengthen its international marketing and distribution
networks with both its existing and new potential customers.
  DVB's other future plans include diversifying its product base for the
manufacturing of new automotive parts and accessories. These include
mirror lens for interior and exterior view mirrors, and door latches for
cars through a technical assistance and license agreement with a German
company.

George Town to diversify

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 7

By Ishun P. Ahmad

GEORGE Town Holdings Bhd expects to not only expand its current activities
but also to diversify into film studios, entertainment centres and theme
parks to ensure long-term growth.
  Chairman Tuanku Abdullah Ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman says in the
latest annual report that the RM204.75 million from the proceeds of its
rights issue in November 1995 were used to expand its overseas business
and its existing operations.
  He says George Town has acquired a project in Leavesden, north-west of
London, which will house England's first movie theme studio tour and
family entertainment complex, comparable with that of Universal Studio,
Disneyland, and Disneyworld.
  Reviewing its financial standing, he notes that George Town has posted a
slightly higher group pre-tax profit of RM12.33 million for the year ended
March 31 1996 compared to RM12.19 million in 1995. This is on the back of
a turnover of RM310.20 million compared to RM310.11 million previously.
  Profit after-tax before minority interest improved slightly to RM8.02
million compared to RM7.92 million previously.
  Directors are recommending a final dividend of eight per cent less tax
for the year just ended.
  During the year under review, George Town Chemist Sdn Bhd opened two
oulets, one each in Kuala lumpur and Port Klang, bringing its total to 25
in the Klang Valley.

Notebook: An investor modest enough to admit making mistakes

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 5

By Yee Liam

THERE is this seasoned investor who told his friends that he had been
buying and selling stocks for over 30 years, experienced five major market
declines and yet he still makes the same mistakes.
  The only investor who does not make any mistake is a dead one and even
if he were to somehow return from the dead to invest in stocks, he is
likely to commit the same mistakes as before.
  The seasoned investor is modest enough to admit that he continues making
mistakes but as he is still rich and continues to speculate, he must be
making fewer of the same mistakes over the years. Otherwise, he is
unlikely to be rich today because if he had continued making the same
number of mistakes as he did in the early years of speculation in stocks,
chances are he would have lost most of his money by now.
  If he had gone through five major market downturns, it is logical that
he would have survived each of the downturns and participated in the
subsequent market rallies.
  He may have lost money because of the mistakes he made in each of the
boom and bust market cycles but as he is still wealthy today, his personal
scoreboard suggests that his right decisions outweigh his wrong decisions
in the stock market. The net effect of his decisions is that his profits
over the years have more than offset the losses incurred.
  Only an ignorant investor will strive for a perfect score and hope to
see profits in all his trades and suffer no losses.
  The most dangerous experience that a new investor can undergo when he
first ventures into the market is that of striking it big and making a lot
of money in his initial trades. He will think that making money is so easy
in the stock market, failing to realise that losing it could be even
easier if he becomes careless and over-expose himself. A new investor is
commonly in a hurry to make big money and consequently endangers himself
by taking on too much risk.
  A wise man knows his own limitations and accepts these limitations
gracefully and this seasoned investor is certainly wise because he readily
admits to his friends his limitations as an investor - one of which is
that he continues to make mistakes in stocks.
  He will still be making mistakes because he is only human and there is
no way he can avoid them completely as long as he is subject to the same
emotions and impulses which all human beings have.
  The only difference is that a successful investor makes fewer mistakes
than a less successful one, but they are likely to continue to make
mistakes.
  An experienced investor is likely to make fewer mistakes than the newer
one because he would have learnt from his past mistakes and make repeated
attempts to avoid them.
  Still, despite being more alert in avoiding mistakes, the experienced
investor will occasionally make some mistakes but he would have taken
precaution to make sure than he is not fatally injured financially and
that he will recover to fight another day in the market.
  After so many years of involvement in stocks, he will be realistic
enough to accept the fact that mistakes are unavoidable in stocks.
  More often than not, it is the new and inexperienced investor who goes
around with the notion that they must not make mistakes if they are to be
successful in stocks. He feels that many of those who came before him lost
money or if they did make money, they should be making more money, because
they made mistakes in their trading.
  As far as this new punter is concerned, he is out to "prove" that he
will be better than many of them because he will not make the same
mistakes committed by many others before him.
  He may not have realised it at this early stage but he had just made his
first mistake by carrying in his head the erroneous idea that he will not
make mistakes in the market. Over time he will realise how wrong he was.
  Ironically, by accepting the simple fact that making mistakes is part
and parcel of the whole business of speculation, the punter is better
prepared mentally to avoid the mistakes that come in our way.
  The reason is simple. If a speculator buys a stock because he feels that
the price will double in two months' time, he will not hesitate to get rid
of it if it does not perform to his expectations after one month. For
instance, if the price falls sharply instead of rising, he may quickly re-
examine the stock and come round to the conclusion that he had been
mistaken about the stock. He accepts that he can make mistakes and before
any further damage is done, he may decide to cut loss and clear out of the
stock.
  A punter who carries the notion that he will not make mistakes may not
be psychologically prepared to accept mistakes even if he is uncertain of
a stock anymore.
  Instead of acting fast and cutting losses if a trade has gone wrong and
he had obviously made a mistake, he may just refuse to budge and continue
hoping that things will get better.
  He has already made up his mind that mistakes will cause him to lose
money and as he does not want to lose money, he will not make mistakes and
by refusing to sell to cut losses, he can continue with the fiction that
he has not made a mistake. It tends to become a vicious cycle and it can
be costly to the punter when the vicious cycle is finally broken by him
selling out to cut his losses.
  There is this thing about realising one's losses and if a punter has to
ultimately realise his loss, it is better than he realise it sooner rather
than later because that way, he minimises his loss. Inaction and refusal
to accept reality can be enemies of the successful punter.
  If the punter cannot avoiding mistakes because stocks can be so volatile
and unpredictable, then he can at least minimise the damage that can be
caused when he makes the inevitable mistakes.

Ariston to compensate land occupants in Sihanoukville project

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 20

By Leela Barrock in Phnom Penh

PHNOM PENH, Sun: Ariston Sdn Bhd has agreed to pay some US$400,000 (US$1 =
RM2.51) in compensation to 360 families who are occupying land on the site
of the Kang Keng airport and on Naga Island, in Sihanoukville.
  "We are paying the compensation on behalf of the Royal Government of
Cambodia, eventhough land is a state matter," Mr Tan Teng Chye, Ariston's
project director, said in Sihanoukville.
  Ariston, which was awarded the US$1.3 billion Sihanoukville development
project, was accused of dragging its feet in starting work on the project,
by several quarters, including Cambodian First Prime Minister Prince
Norodom Ranariddh.
  The Malaysian company explained that it was unable to begin renovation
work at the Sihanoukville International Airport - the first phase of the
project - as it was unable to obtain vacant possesion of the land.
  The amount that was paid to the various families is said to vary
according to the size of land each family lived or worked on.
  According to Tan, Ariston was advised on the amounts to be paid to the
villagers by a special task force within the Sihanoukville Development
Authority that was set up to determine the figure.
  According to the villagers and some of the provincial officials, the
cheques reportedly ranged from US$25 to more than US$3,000.
  However, Tan said Ariston has still not obtained vacant posession of the
land as the villagers are still on the land. "They should move off soon
and then we should be able to get things going," he told Business Times in
a telephone interview.
  Ariston has begun work on Naga Island, however, where an international
standard casino resort and hotel will be built.
  The deputy governor, Kim Bo, who witnessed the handing over ceremony,
said the villagers had arrived at a mutual understanding with the Royal
Government and were happy to accept the compensation.
  "I am aware that my land is located on a development site and I am happy
with the compensation," a villager was quoted as saying in a local
newspaper.
  He admitted that he was among those who had taken up weapons and
demonstrated at the airport site in May this year.
  "I thought that my land was being invaded by Ariston at the time and so
I took an axe to fight against them. But now I find they are honourable
and I am very happy with the compensation," he said.
  Neither Tan nor Cambodian officials would specify the amount of cash
that had been paid for each plot of land.
  However, Cambodian officials say the agreed compensation that was paid
by Ariston amounted to some US$1,500 for each hectare of land, though
other sources say US$1,700 was paid per hectare of land.
  Meanwhile, Ariston signed three agreements in mid-September with the
Royal Goverment that will expedite work on the Sihanoukville project.
  The first agreement was for the lease of land on Naga Island for a 70-
year period. Naga will be the site of an international standard hotel
resort and casino.
  The second was a land lease agreement for O Cheou Teal, involving the
development of an 18-hole international golf course and international
hotel.
  The third agreement was a 25-year build, operate and transfer (BOT)
concession agreement for the Sihanoukville International Airport.

Off market: Giving local analysts prominence

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 5

By Datuk Salleh Majid

A CHIEF executive of a stockbroking company told me how difficult it was
for him to get an appointment from an old friend. This friend happens to
be one of the key executives of a big and still expanding outfit listed on
the stock exchange with operations so diverse from the original core that
it is difficult to keep track. One day this chief executive thought, why
not look up this old friend and since his background is research, he
thought it might be a good idea to know what is happening with the
company. Instead, he was surprised to be greeted with a barrage of
questions, cynical enough to question his motive of seeking an
appointment. He said to himself that he is not going to ever call this old
friend for an appointment again. He felt if it has been any of the foreign
analysts such as Merril Lynch, Solomon or BZW, in no time will they be
granted an appointment. He is wondering what is happening to our
executives? Don't they realise that by being reluctant to meet local
analysts they are placing the local analyst in a more disadvantaged
position than the foreign ones?
  Not too long ago the Research Institute of Investment Analyst Malaysia
(RIIAM) conducted `Meet the Analysts' sessions for listed companies.
Although we had some response from some listed companies, but overall it
was difficult to get anybody to face the local analysts. In the end the
sessions were stopped for lack of response. At the same time we read about
companies with their entourage going overseas to meet the foreign analysts
or accommodating requests of foreign analysts. Maybe local analysts do not
represent billions or trillions of dollars foreign ones do, but disclosure
of information to our local investors will certainly help improve the
current situation of believing in rumours, so typical of the Malaysian
market. Take the second board companies for example, the whole euphoria
has the semblance of the 1993 bull run and prices are really getting to
dizzy heights. The amount of rumour being generated is unbelievable so
much so those so familiar with the characteristics of our investors need
only to generate some ridiculous rumour to get their support.
  This year the focus has certainly been on the second board but the
gullibility of the investors have certainly not been confined to just the
second board companies. The dialogue with local analysts was intended to
help enhance the transparency of companies. With the rapid pace of
economic growth it is not strange to find the rapid change in a company's
situation. The number of companies listed too increase rapidly and one
hardly has time to differentiate the numerous acronyms companies assume.
If companies are reluctant to entertain requests made by local individual
analysts, then the dialogue with a number of analysts might save a lot of
time and be more beneficial for the local investors. One cannot really
pass a law to stop rumour mongering. Neither can one pass a law to believe
in a rumour. If a rumour is being worked upon very hard by certain
individual to make it look like it is not a rumour (the prices actually go
up as claimed), it is even more difficult to convince the public not to
believe in rumours. So much has been said about the importance of relying
on fundamentals but this year anyone can throw fundamentals away by
showing the increase in the prices of second board companies.
  So much has been said of the importance of not relying on rumours about
the importance of investing in fundamentals but this year what seems to
drive the market is the same thing that drove the market in 93 and 94. The
volume of trade may be inflated by those who trade intraday, purely on
speculation. Do we limit the increase narrower? Do we limit the increase
on the first day of listing? Do we restrict the availability of
speculative trading? Do we restrict the flow of funds to the stockbroking
companies so that they cannot grant too many facilities to their clients?
Or do we shorten the settlement period so that there is not much room for
speculative activities? These are not easy questions to answer. We need to
balance between maintaining order and the need to allow the market to take
its course. If allowing to take its course means a lot of people are going
to get hurt, does it mean we will still allow it to happen?
  In the meantime, companies should come forward to be more transparent in
their activities and not necessarily wait for queries should there be any
irregularity. Periodic meetings with analysts will certainly enhance
investors' understanding of the corporate sector. Provided of course the
analysts do not keep the information to themselves.

Improved services with accountability

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 20

By Wendy Lim

THE corporatisation of the Standards and Industrial Research Institute of
Malaysia (Sirim) will be different from other such exercises undertaken by
the Government. This is because the role, contribution and viability of
Sirim will not be measured by its revenue-earning capacity.
  Sirim Bhd president and chief executive Dr Mohamed Ariffin Aton said its
corporatisation will allow a more flexible management system for it to
provide fast, efficient, cost-effective and customer-oriented services
with accountability.
  "Ultimately, we want to be cost effective and broaden our customer base
and train our people to make decisions at their level. This will certainly
speed things up but quality is maintained as they know their job well.
  "At the same time, everyone learns about responsibility and will be held
accountable for making that decision," he told Business Times in Shah
Alam.
  Ariffin was the managing director of Petronas Research Sdn Bhd before he
was appointed to head Sirim Bhd, taking over from Datuk Dr Ahmad Tajuddin
Ali who became the executive chairman of Tenaga Nasional Bhd,
  For Sirim to achieve quality and speed, Ariffin is embarking on an
"inside out" quality services strategy to meet its vision.
  He believes that quality, when planted internally, will progress
naturally outwards.
  "In our day-to-day work, for example, the finance department which holds
the traditionally role of scrutinising every claim will have to think of
its colleagues as clients.
  "Some think this will encourage forgery but the claimants have a
responsibility and are accountable for their claims.
  "In this way, there will be continuous improvement and value creation
for the company to move faster. Ultimately, Sirim is the people," Ariffin
said.
  Sirim's vision, he said, is to be a renowned institution in three of its
core businesses: research, technology development, and standardisation.
  His said his task is to strenghten the competency base and put in place
the research and development (R and D) strategy.
  Sirim's technology competencies include industrial instrumentation and
electronics, industrial automation, automotive, measurements and
artificial intelligence systems.
  Ariffin said R and D does not necessarily get one's hands dirty. "There
is also a management side to it which I am dealing with."
  He feels that R and D is a continuing process of investment and regards
researchers as "a special breed of people who are very independent".
  "It is an intellectually challenging experience to be in the group," he
said.
  Ariffin, who considers working as his pastime and thinking of solutions
as his hobby, feels that the biggest challenge in managing researchers is
to change their perception of research work as a service.
  "Research is not a hobby, especially when there is a sponsor, and
researchers must try to provide the quality work in as short a time as
possible within a limited budget," he said.
  On human resource management, Ariffin said he is not worried that
Sirim's staff will be pinched. "All good companies will have staff
movement. Those who move away from Sirim are not totally lost as they will
be contributing to the country in other ways."

PM unhappy with UN Security Council"s failure to censure Israel

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 20

PRIME Minister Datuk Seri Mahathir Mohamad yesterday expressed
disappointment with the UN Security Council members for their failure to
censure the Israeli Government led by Mr Benjamin Netanyahu for breaching
the peace agreement between Palestine and Israel.
  "The Security Council members should have taken into account the various
violations committed by the Netanyahu Government such imposing blockades
on Palestine by preventing Palestinian aircraft to land on the Palestinian
airport, preventing Palestinians to commute to work, and building of
Israeli settlements," he told reporters at the Sultan Abdul Aziz
International Airport yesterday.
  "Members of the Security Council failed to accuse Israel of committing
these violations out of fear of being branded as pro-Palestine," Dr
Mahathir said.
  "That is why we had the (UN Security Council's) resolution calling for
the cessation of hostilities, closure of tunnel and resumption of peace
talks.
  "I am attracted to (British Foreign Secretary Malcolm) Rifkind's speech,
where he outlined one-by-one all the violations of treaty committed by
Israel since Netanyahu took office as Israeli Prime Minister."

Amcorp sees abundant opportunities for expansion

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 5

WITH the Malaysian economy heading for the ninth consecutive year of
strong growth, opportunities are abound for Arab-Malaysian Corp Bhd
(Amcorp) to further enhance its position as a leading provider of
financial, property and infrastructure services, says its chairman Tan Sri
Azman Hashim.
  In his latest annual statement, the chairman says the group will
"entrench our strategy on our financial and property/infrastructure
services expertise to create synergies these two core business areas and
at the same time, seek to develop our interests in other sectors such as
industrial services".
  Reviewing the group's performance, Azman says the group's core business
areas continued to record impressive growth.
  Amcorp's activities in property development have been given a boost when
it acquired about 82.96ha of land for the development of 311 bungalow lots
under the exclusive Kayang Heights development project, which is next to
the Bukit Cerakah Forest Reserve in Shah Alam.
  Amcorp has also successfully concluded conditional mandatory general
offers for shares in two companies. The first being the shares in
Melawangi Sdn Bhd, developer of the prestigious Amcorp Trade Centre in
Petaling Jaya, which is now 100 per cent-owned by Amcorp.
  The other is South Peninsular Industries Bhd, a manufacturing company
listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) second board, which is
presently a 51 per cent-owned subsidiary of the group.
  Azman says growth within AMMB Holdings Bhd, which led the financial
services sector of the group, continued to be significant. Among the
developments is the commencement of offshore banking operation in Labuan.
  Elsewhere, Arab-Malaysian Securities Holding Sdn Bhd expanded its
operations to Indonesia when it acquired a 60 per cent stake in Jakarta-
based stockbroking firm, now renamed PT Arab-Malaysian Capital Indonesia.
The group, through a subsidiary company, has also acquired a seat on The
Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Ltd.
  Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank, which obtained Tier-1 status and the
approval from Bank Negara to open four more branches, has entered into an
asset management joint-venture agreement with Macquarie Bank Ltd of
Australia.
  Closer to home, AMMB Futures Sdn Bhd began operations trading in futures
contracts on the Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange and
the Malaysia Monetary Exchange. Meanwhile, Arab-Malaysian Finance Bhd and
Arab-Malaysian Bank Bhd has also received approvals from the Central Bank
to open nine and eight new branches respectively.
  Azman says the growth prospect of the Malaysian economy is expected to
create increased loan demand which will provide lending opportunities for
the AMMB Holdings group. Likewise, activities in the capital markets will
remain robust, in line with Government's objective of promoting Kuala
Lumpur as a regional financial hub.
  "Thus, the group is poised to harness further opportunities arising in
the forthcoming year," says the chairman.
  Other significant events include the listing of Powertek Bhd, in which
Arab-Malaysian Development Bhd has a 30 per cent stake, on the main board
of the KLSE. Azman says this is notable as it is the first independent
power producer and first new infrastructure project company to be listed.
  For the year ended March 31 1996, the Amcorp group registered a profit
before tax of RM321.9 million, which shows a growth of 38.6 per cent.
Profits from Amcorp's own activities, comprising financial services and
property construction and development, surged by 79.3 per cent to RM87.7
million.

Marina Cove"s RM100m project

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 6

By Meera T'Ratnam

MALACCA-bound Marina Cove which will be built on a 35-acre coastal site at
the Kuala Linggi riverine estuary joins the latest string of waterfront
development projects to take off this  year.
  Construction for the RM100 million integrated waterfront property is set
for December this year. The project will be developed by Harvest Rimba
Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of public listed Harvest Court Industries Bhd.
  The development, which is projected to be completed by 1999 is situated
close to Port Dickson and the new Kuala Lumpur International Airport in
Sepang.
  "We are very pleased and excited to be developing this project in
Malacca given the state's historical ties with the sea. With the
development of Marina Cove, we hope to generate local interest in yatching
and other related activities," director of Harvest Rimba Sdn Bhd, Encik
Abdul Halim Yunus said.
  "The main attractions of the cove lie in its low resident per acre
density, exclusive home designs and its own private marina berthing
facilities," he said, in a statement.
  "These factors, together with pleasant surroundings and world-class
marina facilities make it a high value investment."
  Marina Cove waterfront project, which was launched a few days ago by the
Chief Minister of Malacca Datuk Seri Haji Mohd Zin Abdul Ghani, will
comprise of bungalows, townhouses, apartments, shops, hotel apartments, a
clubhouse with marine facilities and a broadwalk.
  "Marina Cove will have the lowest resident density per acre in the
waterfront marina development segment. We will be developing only 12 units
per acre  compared to the industry average of 40 units per acre," said
Abdul Halim.
  "Because we want own ers and residents to enjoy the privacy and serenity
for their surroundings, we will be developing only 19.25 acres of the
alloted 35 acres of coastal land. The remaining acre is devoted to open
spaces and water ways," he said.
  On the developed area, a Marina Arcade comprising of 10 shoplots and a
16-storey Waterfront Apartel consisting of a 150 unit apartment hotel will
be built.
  On the residential side, Cove Apartments-made up of five different
blocks of either four or five storeys and only 176 apartments, will be
built. The company also plans to offer 80 units  of terraced townhouses
with private berthing facilities as part of its Waterfront Quay Terrace.
  "In other waterfront projects in Malaysia, private berthing facilities
are available only to bungalow owners. Marina Cove has extended this
exclusive facility to our terrace house owners because we want as many
residents as possible to enjoy the pleasure of yachting and boating," he
added.
  Some 20 bungalow lots are expected to be available to owners of
Waterfront Villas.

Malaysia an atrractive choice: Economist

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 1

By Meera T'Ratnam

WITH the outlook for both the Malaysian stock market and economy set to
improve considerably by year-end, Malaysia will be an attractive choice
for the astute investors wishing to bank in Asia, Jardine Fleming Pte's
Singapore-based economist Rajeev Malik says.
  Not only have fears of a fast-paced economy been allayed but purer
economic and political fundamentals, coupled with Malaysia's ease in
coping with this year's global electronics slowdown, are just some reasons
why Malaysia may win hands down in garnering economists' approval.
  "Until a few months ago investors were worried that Malaysian economy
was growing too rapidly. The economy was like a Kancil bounding with a
high centre of gravity," he said. "It raised fears it would topple coming
round the corner."
  "But it's made a very skillful turn, so much so the concern now in some
quarters is that softer external demand will cause a sharper-than-expected
slowdown," he said.
  In an interview with Business Times, Malik said some downward revision
of the government's own estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) growth -
previously set at 8.5 per cent - should be expected with the budget. The
budget is set to be tabled on October 25.
  Expectations of a sharp slowdown in GDP are quite unwarranted though, he
says. While the economy is moderating, its overall strength remains
robust. Malaysia's second quarter performance of 8.4 per cent was much
better than Singapore where half-year growth came in at a lower-than-
expected 7 per cent.
  Despite estimates that up to half of Malaysia's total exports are tied
up in electronics, the slowdown in electronics has hurt Malaysia far less
than other Asian tigers. The absence of lumpy imports has also contributed
to this year's trend of sharply falling trade figures, with exports
outpacing imports.
  "Malaysia's current account deficit for 1996 is already set to be much
lower than Thailand," he said. "Neither does it have to contend with a
hotbed of political and economic woes like Indonesia and Thailand."
  Malik expects real domestic demand to ease from 14.6 per cent to 10.1
per cent in 1996. He credits the central bank for steering the economy
without resorting to severe credit controls. Last year's budget brought
tighter controls on credit card users, higher taxes on real property gains
and foreign purchases of real estate, higher taxes on luxury cars and less
financing for car purchases.
  The central bank followed up with initiatives to free up interest rates
by introducing a new framework for calculating base lending rates; raising
the statutory reserves requirement twice; and, a healthy dose of moral
suasion.
  It may have taken some time for the slowdown to register but loan growth
has clearly eased. Though partly driven by a decline in lending to broad
property and consumption, Malik says it's happening across the board. "A
recent pick-up in property lending growth in no way bucks this trend," he
adds.
  On the longer-term horizon, Malik dispelled the need to agonise over the
loss of competitiveness issue hounding the coverage of Asian economies
lately. "Sure, the convergence theory that Asia is cheap is no more. But
it does not mean because costs are rising, foreign investors are shifting
their investments and moving out."
  On trend in Malaysia, a greater proportion of new investment in
manufacturing goes towards expanding existing operations, instead of
setting up new ventures but as Malik sees it, "It's part of a gradual
process that has to take place for Malaysia to become the capital of
value-added manufacturing operations".

"Shorties" to debut on KLSE today

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 1

By Jennifer Jacobs

TODAY, for the first time, the Malaysian stock market opens itself to
"shorties", the colloquialism for those who carry out short-selling, that
is "... selling shares one does not own in anticipation of buying them
back later at a lower price and profiting from the difference in price."
  Many foreign players, as well as professional traders, have long
commented that opening the market to short-selling is a crucial step in
the development of the Malaysian capital market as it will facilitate
hedging and arbitrage activities which are essential for the introduction
of stock options trading.
  What this roughly means is that one can either buy equities and short-
sell futures, thereby covering one's back if the market turns either
bullish or bearish or short-sell equities and buy futures contracts.
  With the introduction of short-selling, investors can also profit in a
bearish market.
  Short-selling is expected to increase the liquidity of the market
especially for the securities in the approved list. The list of 50
counters, released on Friday evening, came as a surprise to many who had
only expected some 20 to 30 counters initially to be on it.
  As at the end of last year, only 28 counters had met the relevant
criteria for short-selling, namely, an average daily market capitalisation
of RM2 billion for the past three months; at least 100 million shares in
public float; at least 2,000 registered shareholders; five years of
uninterrupted profit track record; and, an average monthly share volume of
more than 2 million for the past 12 months.
  These criteria had been drawn up to ensure that short-selling is not
allowed across the board but limited only to the "bluest of blue-chips".
  Of course, the Securities Commission, in approving the rules drawn up by
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), had added that the exchange has
the discretion to expand and change the list of approved securities as and
when deemed necessary.
  The exchange must have deemed it necessary right away because the list
included companies that are hardly blue, maybe a pale azure.
  The question, of course, is whether in "shorting the shares" investors
can actually manipulate the prices and push them down unnaturally, as it
is one thing to bet on the shares going down and another altogether in
forcing the counter down.
  The exchange, with this concern in mind, has introduced prescribed
limits to bring about an idealised form of short-selling.
  KLSE senior manager for marketing development S. Loganathan said the
exchange will suspend further short-selling for any period if the position
exceeds the amount that is desirable to public interest or if it is
detrimental to the counter.
  Every deal has to be reported to the KLSE at the end of the trading day
so that the exchange can disseminate the positions of the short-selling
done for the day.
  Direct deals are not allowed, meaning no off-market deals between the
dealer and the client.
  And only stockbroking companies which have in place approved written
guidelines on "Know Your Customers" practices will be permitted to engage
in regulated short-selling.
  Investors seeking to engage in regulated short-selling must be fully
aware of the risk and have the financial capacity to meet their financial
commitments. Which basically means as in all other types of trading: "If
you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen."
  Professional traders used to the liberality of the more matured markets
may find these safeguards rather draconian and unnecessary, but they
should bear in mind the highly speculative image of the KLSE, especially
the second board, where speculators have had a field day in pushing up
stocks as the fancy takes them.
  The exchange, which has been trying to fight off this image, would be
loath to put yet another toy into the hands of these gamblers.
  However, all in all, short-selling is essential for the maturity of the
capital market and regulated short-selling protects the market from
possible foul play, so maybe this will be one market that can have its
cake and eat it.

Resolve problems within party, advises Dr M

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 1

By Jimmy Yeow

PRIME Minister and Barisan Nasional chairman Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad has urged members from the Barisan component parties not to go to
court to solve their internal disputes.
  He said while it is common to have differences in opinions between
members, they should try to resolve their problems within the party.
  Dr Mahathir said there will be no end to the culture of members seeking
legal action if members persist in doing so.
  "Today it will at the party's central committee level, tomorrow
divisional and branches."
  For example, he said even if a member succeeds in getting the court to
declare him or her as the party leader, it would not help if the majority
of the members reject his or her leadership.
  "There must be some form of compromise within the party.
  "If this cannot be achieved, the dispute should then be solved by the
political way of who is getting the most support from members," he told
reporters at the Sultan Abdul Aziz International Airport on his return
from New York yesterday.
  He was asked to comment on the political tussle between Parti Gerakan
president Datuk Seri Dr Lim Keng Yaik and Gerakan member and member of
Parliament for Batu, Datuk Joseph Chong.
  Dr Mahathir said the dispute within Gerakan will not affect the Barisan
coalition and expressed confidence that the Gerakan members will be able
to resolve their problem among themselves.
  On Umno, Dr Mahathir said the special committee, headed by him, to
investigate complaints against disciplinary committee members for
allegedly breaching the no-campaign ruling is keeping an eye on the
conduct of the candidates.
  "You will find out in time," he said to a question whether any of the
disciplinary committee member had breached the ruling.
  A total of 185 candidates has been declared eligible to contest in the
Umno party elections in October.
  On allegations that some candidates are using their official functions
as a  "platform to campaign" by opening two or three functions a day, the
Prime Minister said the bunching of some of these functions could not
avoided.
  "But I hope the delegates will be able to judge for themselves the
motives of these functions," Dr Mahathir said.

Act now to ensure sufficient supply (HL)

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 1

THE construction industry's strong run may falter if measures are not
taken to ensure sufficient supply of basic building materials, according
to findings of a study prepared for the Ministry of Domestic Trade and
Consumer Affairs.
  At least six basic materials critical to the industry are likely to be
short in supply before the year 2000.
  Clinker, the main component for making cement, is also on this list.
Supplies of marble, reinforcement steel, structural steel, and PVC pipes
are also not expected to be able to meet the industry's demand. The supply
of sanitary ware and fittings are expected to begin running short by 1999.
  Even materials which are expected to be in surplus could experience
"localised" shortages.
  The study investigated supply and demand trends of 15 building materials
since 1994 and produced a trend forecast up to the year 2000.
  Expansion plans, existing production capacities, imports and exports
were also analysed in studying future trends for the building materials.
  The study was conducted by Arthur Andersen HRM (Management Services) Sdn
Bhd in association with the Quantity Surveyor Malaysia. It is the first
report prepared for the Goverment which covers the aspect of basic
building materials.
  The 15 materials included in the report are cement, carpentry and
joinery timber, aggregates and crusher-run, marble tiles, ceramic tiles,
bricks, reinforcement steel, structural steel, sand, roofing materials,
uPVC pipes, cast iron pipes, concrete pipes, sanitary wares and fittings
and timber of formwork (plywood and timber remnants).
  The construction sector is forecast to grow at an average rate of 7.5
per cent a year.
  Clinker is likely to be short in supply up to the end of the year. Even
at 90 per cent production capacity, local manufaturers are only expected
to churn out 9.9 million tonnes of clinker this year. Domestic demand
however is forecast to be 10.7 million tonnes.
  Clinker is a major semi-finished product used in the production of
cement. Production of a tonne of cement requires a 0.95 tonne input of
clinker.
  Last year, local clinker production was only 7.7 million tonnes which
was only about 83.7 per cent of the required 9.9 million tonnes, thus
causing a supply deficit of 2.2 million tonnes.
  Local cement producers will continue to source clinker from South Korea,
Japan, Thailand and Indonesia until the shortage, which has been occuring
since 1991, begin to ease later next year, the report said.
  The study forecasts a 1,000 tonne surplus of clinker next year.
  The situation will further improve in 1998 with a surplus of 3.2 million
tonnes but dropped to 2.9 million tonnes in 1999 and 2.1 million tonnes in
the year 2000.
  The cement industry, as a whole, is involved in a production expansion
programme from 13 million tonnes in 1995 to 21.87 million tonnes by the
year 2000. The Malaysian Cement Industry's 1995 Report showed that the
demand for cement last year was 12.1 million for Peninsular Malaysia and
1.35 million tonnes for Sabah and Sarawak.
  In the case of marble wall and floor tiles, the report said that with
its current production at 52 per cent capacity, shortages can be expected
right up to the year 2000 and beyond. However, the shortage may be delayed
at least until 1999 if production runs at full capacity. The report
suggested that the authorities look at the possibility of imports to meet
the rising demand.
  For reinforcement steel, the report forecast a shortage of 29,000 tonnes
next year which will reach 430,000 tonnes, or more than a quarter of the
total demand, in 2000.
  In the case of structural steel, the shortage since 1994 is expected to
last until the end of the decade despite increases in production capacity.
The authorities have been urged to introduce new incentives to attract new
investments to the sector.
  Demand for sanitary ware and fittings grew between 1988 and 1993 but
supply has been able to meet the industry demand. At 85 per cent
production capacity, the industry is expected to face a shortage by the
year 1999.
  The uPVC pipes are substitutes for cast iron and concrete pipes and are
mainly imported. Since the early 1980s, local production capacity has not
been able to meet the requirements of the local market. This is not
expected to change during the period under review.
  The study also highlighted manpower shortages in the respective
industries producing the building materials. Inefficient transport
services, quality of materials, and pricing were also discussed.

Smooth start for self-service at selected Caltex petrol stations

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 2

SELF-service for motorists at Caltex Oil petrol stations seems set to have
a smooth introduction with the company offering self-serve educational
programmes for motorists at three sites.
  The three selected petrol stations, located in the Klang Valley, have
been positioned with a group of trained experts known as customer service
assistants to help motorists get comfortable with the idea of serving
themselves.
  "We are committed towards addressing the labour issues that are plaguing
the country, especially with the issue of foreign labour at the
forecourts," chairman and managing director of Caltex Oil (M) Ltd, Mr.
Robert J. Gregory said in Kuala Lumpur.
  "As with any change, there is bound to be some apprehension and we
believe the best solution is to help, prepare and educate the public to
get used to the various aspects of self-service," he said.
  The Meor Hisham station in Ampang began to offer self-service on
September 19, followed by F I Star and Kwang Hap Siang.
  The company has put in place a programme that incorporates various on-
site programmes for motorists. This is to familiarise them with the
concept of self-serve well before the Government mandated date for all
petrol stations to be on self-service by January 1, 1997.
  Trained customer service assistants will point out how to use user
friendly electronic facilities and to guide customers on payment methods
according to their choice of cash or card.
  In addition, Caltex Malaysia will also have an elite squad of trained
personnal who will be deployed to these self-serve test stations initially
and subsequently to the various self-serve test stations in residential
neighbourhoods.
  Tagged as the "Self service Support Squad" (SSS Squad), the squad will
be commissioned to provide additional support to customer service
personnel at petrol stations and introduce the do-it-yourself concept
whilst giving hands-on demonstrations on self-serve.
  Apart from investing in mobile labour squads, Caltex has also invested a
total of RM9 million on hardware, electronic and retail automation for
facilitating self-serve.
  Caltex has also set up a toll-free hotline at 800-3188 to handle
enquiries on self-serve.
  "We are confident that with our comprehensive programme, additional
features and unique services, Caltex Malaysia will take the lead for self-
serve," said Gregory. "We will also be joining the Government and other
oil industry members in the joint educational programmes that have been
planned." he added.

Ecodrill scores a first with oil well workover service

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 2

By Kang Siew Li

IN THE past, Malaysia had to depend on foreign-based workover service
contractors to put non-productive oil wells back into business, but
Ecodrill (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd has changed all that.
  In the middle of last year, the company purchased its own workover rig
for RM15 million and, in doing so, became the first Malaysian company to
provide full workover service.
  The rig, named "Merpati Cerah", was designed and partly built by
Ecodrill and is capable of "working over" or reconditioning 30-40 oil
wells a year and drilling up to 10,000ft, Ecodrill director Raj Narayanan
said in an interview with Business Times.
  "Unlike other rigs used in the oil and gas industry, this rig is easy to
dismantle and is designed to handle all heavy duty workover work except
pure drilling," he said.
  He believes the improved design will help the company's clients save
substantial amounts of money in conducting remedial operations to restore
production at problem wells.
  The company was awarded a major workover service contract worth RM11
million a year by a leading oil and gas company - Unocal Thailand, which
is a subsidiary of US-based Unocal Corp.
  "The initial contract period is for one-and-a-half years, but the deal
is expected to take between four and six years," Narayanan said.
Operations are expected to start in the middle of next month.
  The contract is viewed as a means to help Ecodrill realise its long-term
objective of becoming a regional integrated workover service company, he
said. The company is also negotiating similar deals with three other oil
companies in Brunei and Indonesia.
  "This, coupled with our approval as a local contracting arm under the
Vendor Development Programme of Petronas, should see the company operating
at least four workover rigs (inclusive of the existing one) by the year
1999," Narayanan said.
  Ecodrill hopes to have its subsequent rigs totally manufactured in
Malaysia.
  Besides workover services, the company is also actively involved in
providing technical training services.
  "We have successfully established a skills training centre in Miri,
Sarawak, known as Ecotech Training Centre and Technical Institute since
1990," Narayanan said.
  Established in 1988, Ecodrill is jointly owned by Narayanan (16 per
cent) and chairman Mej. (R) Mat Salleh Noor (84 per cent). "The initial
paid-up capital of the venture was RM25,000, which has since increased to
RM3 million."
  Narayanan said the company with 32 workers was set up to provide
consultancy services to the oil and gas industry in Malaysia and the Far
East region in the drilling, engineering, production and maintenance
areas.
  "Four years later, we started providing technical training in petroleum
and drilling engineering at the present Technical Institute," he added.
  "Miri was chosen because we saw tremendous potential growth in the area
at the time. We also wanted to go to an area where we felt we could
introduce certificate and diploma courses to people interested in the oil
and gas industry," he said.
  Plans are already under way to set up its first branch campus in Kuala
Lumpur next year.
  "We also intend to upgrade the Technical Institute to become a research
and development support centre, now that we have direct involvement in oil
production operations, as we own a workover rig," Narayanan said.
  "From there, we can move to the development of new products and
technologies," he added.
  Narayanan believes Ecodrill is now ready to export its services
regionally, particularly to Brunei, Indonesia and Vietnam.
  Currently, Ecodrill's business totals some RM4 million a year which is
solely from the provision of training and consultancy services.
  "This year, we expect total business to increase to RM6 million from
training and consultancy services together with a small contribution
coming from workover services," Narayanan said.
  From next year onwards, with the Unocal Thailand contract in hand and
improvements at the Technical Institute, the company expects turnover to
reach RM18 million to RM20 million a year.
  "By 1999, we'll see turnover rising to RM60 million-RM70 million a
year," he said. "Workover services will eventually contribute 70 per cent
of total revenue while the remaining 30 per cent will be from training and
consultancy," he added.
  Narayanan estimated that in Malaysia, the workover business is worth
RM100 million a year. "We are not looking at monopolising the industry,
but we aim to secure between RM20 million and RM30 million worth of
services."

YOUTH and Sports Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Mohd Yassin says Automobile
Association of Malaysia (AAM) chairman Tunku Mudzaffar Tunku Mustapha has
written to him requesting that they meet with local motorsport officials
over alleged infighting and disputes within the affiliates. Speaking in
Subang yesterday after opening the national level "Jati Diri Budaya Belia"
programme, he said he will listen to their viewpoints and get an objective
picture of the situation. While Malaysia plans to host a Formula One event
in 1999, the Malaysian rounds of the Formula Asia series have been
cancelled and the International Automobile Federation has struck the Rally
of Malaysia off the Asia Pacific Championships Round next year.

MAH to "represent all hotel views"

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 3

By Kang Siew Li

MALAYSIA Association of Hotels (MAH) president Mazli Mohamed wants the
211-member body to be truly representative of the entire sector by getting
most, if not all, the nation's hoteliers to join MAH.
  "I don't want the association to be perceived as one that only looks
after the welfare of hotels in Kuala Lumpur just because it is based in
the capital," he told Business Times in Kuala Lumpur.
  Mazli who is also Holiday Inn (hotel operations/development) general
manager, has taken the first step by ensuring the association represents
the views of hotels across the board.
  "Our new management committee members comprise not only four- and five-
star hotels but also three-star operations as well," said Mazli, who has
taken over from Encik Azman Harun whose two-year term ended recently.
  Mazli wants the association to be more vocal in fighting for the
interests of hotels and the industry. MAH is currently seeking to lower
electricity charges which have gone up with the withdrawal of the 10 per
cent discount on electricity tariffs for the hotel sector.
  He said the hotel industry contributes substantially to the country's
total electricity consumption and that the average three- or four-star
hotel (with 200 to 300 rooms) in Kuala Lumpur spends about RM500,000 per
year on electricity.
  Tenaga Nasional Bhd is very aware of this and it has already raised
electricity charges considerably without giving prior notice, he said.
  The association has submitted a memorandum to Energy, Telecommunications
and Posts Minister Datuk Leo Moggie in June to consider its claims but has
yet to receive a response.
  MAH, working together with the Government, is also looking into
ambiguities in sewerage and service charges, the Social Security
Organisation (Socso), the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and wages.
  "We have compiled these matters in a memorandum which has already been
sent to Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim during a pre-budget dialogue session in Ipoh in July," he added.
  Mazli said the hotel industry is presently enjoying a boom, with hotel
occupancy rates at between 70 and 80 per cent.
  "At the end of next year, we'll see tremendous growth in hotels in the
country as the industry gears up to host the Commonwealth Games for the
first time," he explained.
  At present, there are about 55,000 hotel rooms in the country.
  The number is expected to reach 100,000 by the end of next year.
  On whether the hotel market will be saturated then, he says, this
largely "depends on how well we promote our country and how good our
economy will be".
  "Equally important is the location of a hotel. If a hotel is not
properly located, it may suffer with the onset of fierce competition," he
added.
  However, Mazli said one unavoidable problem is the shortage of skilled
workers and service staff.
  "This will inevitably lead to an uncontrolled increase in wages as
hotels fight for more staff to fill positions in their hotels. Each
(hotel) tends to offer more for similar posts," he explained.
  Because the market share for hotels is becoming smaller, Mazli said
hoteliers must now work hand in hand with the authorities to find ways and
means to bring in more visitors into the country.
  "I think we should not rely solely on the Government to bring in more
visitors. I believe hotels have got to do more," he said.
  He added that the association has been supporting the Government in all
its efforts to promote tourism in the country.
  Mazli said MAH is currently working with the Malaysian Association of
Tour and Travel Agents and the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board in
anticipation of the Asean Tourism Forum which will be held in Kuala Lumpur
in January next year.
  "The event will generate income and create more awareness of Malaysia's
tourism industry," he believes.
  "At the same time, the association is also looking at the meetings,
incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) sector.
  "This is one component of the tourism business that I think will
contribute major exchange earnings to the country in the long run," he
said, adding that business travellers have higher disposable incomes and
their length of stay is longer.
  Mazli said there is a need to build convention centres in Kuala Lumpur,
Penang and Kuantan so that business will be spread out evenly.
  According to him, the construction of the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport (KLIA) in Sepang marks the beginning of a new era, as "the new
airport means more airlines will be coming in, more visitors and more
business for the hotel industry".

Ordinary week but for 2nd board plunge

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 11

By Roziana Hamsawi

IT WOULD have been a rather uninteresting week if not for the "sad
incident" which befell  a majority of the second board stocks on Thursday,
leaving punters to shift their attention to cheaper main board stocks.
  Otherwise, the local bourse last week was mildly active on quite a
healthy number of shares traded, making it "generally uninteresting but
definitely not boring" according to one analyst.
  Despite the country's seven months' good trade figures, the market had
started out on a weak note last week, arising from the uncertainties in
the direction of US interest rates. The KLSE Composite Index, on Monday,
lost 4.09 points, closing at 1,126.51 while the second board index rose
1.35 points up to 608.48.
  On Wednesday, shares rose in active trade with strong gains registered
in index-linked stocks. It was an immediate reaction to the US Federal
Open Market Committee's decision to maintain interest rates at the current
level. The Composite Index closed 5.59 points higher at 1,129.31, while
the second board rose 16.62 points to 625.41.
  After a continuous upward movement in the second board index, Thursday
saw it tumble down 24.86 points or 3.98 per cent to 600.55. Although a
correction was expected, the fall on Thursday was due to concerns of
restrictions on second board stocks, imposed by some local stockbroking
firms. The KLCI, however remained steady, losing only half a point to
1,128.81.
  The last day of the week ended fairly mixed with the CI moving up 1.78
points at 1,130.59 while the second board index continued its downward
fall, breaching the 600-psychological level to end the week at 595.58. The
first time the second board index hit the 600 level was the Friday before
when it closed at 607.13.
  Overall last week, a total of some 1.647 billion shares were traded
worth RM14.258 billion compared to 1.781 billion shares worth RM15.006
billion the week before.
  About 914.247 million shares were traded on the main board valued at
RM6.681 billion, while the second board saw a total of 602.420 million
shares done worth RM7.114 billion.
  Analysts said for this week, the market is expected to move sideways,
with speculative main board stocks continuing to attract punters. Interest
in second board stocks, however will not cease, said one analyst.

Chart trend: Bourse set to be choppy with wide fluctuations

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 11

By Raymond

ACTIVITY on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) started on Monday with
blue-chips taking a back seat while play resumed among speculative stocks
on the second board.
  Negative trade figures which were reported did not have a significant
impact on the KLSE.
  Volatile trading on Tuesday saw second board stocks trading in an
erratic fashion.
  Stocks on the main board were not doing much either, one way or the
other.
  Heavy speculative buying on Wednesday pushed prices of small capital
stocks upwards.
  The overall market sentiment also improved with a new batch of stocks
which came into play.
  The volatile movement of second board stocks continued on Thursday, only
this time round, they were hammered by aggressive selling.
  The bearish situation was, however, cushioned by firm support for
selective main board stocks which registered good gains.
  Mixed trading was the order of the day on Friday. Market sentiment was
pulled down by cautious selling on second board stocks, while only the
situational issues on the main board were giving supportive play in the
market.
  For the week, second board stocks were again in the limelight for the
right and wrong reasons.
  The much expected correction came in to cool off the over speculation
which has taken the second board stocks to record highs.
  Market players who were caught on the high side would be licking their
wounds, but for medium- term investors, this correction is healthy.
  Sentiment wise, the KLSE is expected to be choppy with wild fluctuations
to remain a feature among second board stocks.
  The market minus the very speculative second board stocks is still
attractive in value terms and interest may just shift to main baord
counters.
  In the past couple of weeks, there has been a slow uptrend which has not
caught too much attention among main board counters.
  This gradual momentum has not produced anything spectacular but with
patience there is a high potential for lagging stocks to bring in the
rewards.
  On the technical front our short-term Timing Device has been on the
downtrend for the past eight trading sessions and currently the falling
pace has been steadily reduced in the past four sessions.
  It is quite possible that this short-term market barometer which is now
standing at -56.4 points, is preparing itself for a trend reversal
sometime this week.
  The first supporting level is at -119.2 points, failing which, it is
expected to have the second support at around the -300 point level.
  Our O/O Indicator has continued to go up but at a lesser pace.
  Until this rising market barometer is arrested, we will continue to
remain bullish and treat corrections such as the one we are now seeing as
a technical pullback, which are necessary for any rally in the market.
  Currently, breaking out of the overhead resistance at zero is vital to
the continuation of the bullish trend we are seeing.
  Failure to do so can lead to our market heading for a new serious
correction.BT O/O INDICATOR

The Kunta Kinte column: Maintain good name of country abroad

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 4

By Datuk A. Kadir Jasin in New York

NEW YORK: A prominent Malaysian businessman I met strolling on New York's
Fifth Avenue a couple of mornings ago excitedly told me that his managing
director was in the Bahamas to attend the wedding reception of his nephew.
  He told me the story after I remarked that the Malays have come very far
from their rice farming days to be able to stay in the best hotels, shop
at the most fashionable stores and stroll leisurely on one of the most
fashionable streets of one of the largest cities in the world.
  And he was not alone and he may not have travelled on the supersonic
Concorde as some did. A whole group of Malaysia's most successful
businessmen descended on the city last week to join the Prime Minister,
Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, at the United Nations.
  The fact that an untypically large group of Malaysian businessmen had
accompanied Dr Mahathir to the UN is explained by the fact that the Prime
Minister had earlier attended and addressed a business meeting organised
by the Asia Society.
  They could have joined the trip in deference to the Prime Minister and
the co-sponsor of the Asia Society dinner, Petronas.
  Having covered major international conferences around the world in which
Malaysian leaders have participated since the late 1970s - first for the
Business Times, then for Berita Harian and now the New Straits Times - I
can quite confidently say that our country has come a long way.
  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, only a handful of business people
would accompany the Prime Minister or his deputy on such trips. The
Bumiputera businessmen were the rarest.
  The Prime Minister or his deputy could count themselves lucky if they
had more than the usual group of journalists from Radio and Television
Malaysia, Bernama and the few large newspapers accompanying them.
  Businessmen almost invariably did not consider accompanying the Prime
Minister on international trips a fruitful business. Officials, too, did
not find it appropriate to invite them to join him on his official tours.
  Malaysia Incorporated was still many years away and the likes of Tan Sri
Tajudin Ramli, Tan Sri Halim Saad and Tan Sri Abdul Rashid Hussain were
still in the backrooms learning the tricks of the trade.
  Even dealmakers Tan Sri Vincent Tan, Datuk Francis Yeoh and the youthful
Datuk T.K. Lim were still in the background - shadowed by the likes of Tan
Sri Lim Goh Tong, Mr Robert Kuok and Datuk Tan Chin Nam.
  Tan Sri Kishu Jethanand of Globe Silk Store fame had already hit the big
time but had yet to develop an international profile, while Mr K. Ananda
Krishnan had the name but not the face. He had made his fortune in oil
and, being a graduate of Harvard University, was at ease with things
American.
  He is still a shy and highly private person. But like other successful
Malaysian businessmen, he too has been thrust onto the world stage by
Malaysia's unprecedented economic success in the last decade and by Dr
Matathir's Malaysia Incorported policy.
  In the early days, the media organisations were invited to send
journalists to cover the Prime Minister's visit abroad and their expenses
were often borne by the Government. This practice was stopped by the late
Tun Hussein Onn when he became Prime Minister in 1976.
  Fortunately, since media organisations also benefit from the rapid
economic growth, they can continue to send journalists on overseas
assigments at their own expense.
  When I was first sent to New York for assignment, the best hotel the
Business Times could offer was The Tudor, which in the late 1970s and
early 1980s, charged US$70 a day (US$1 = RM2.51). Today, even middle-level
journalists stay at St Regis together with the Prime Minister.
  Times have certainly changed. But the bigger change is in the way the
Government and businesses are collaborating to strengthen the country's
position on the global political and economic map.
  For this very important reason, it is contemptible that we find some
Malaysian companies and businessmen showing tendencies of becoming
arrogant and insincere in their dealings with the outside world,
especially the poorer countries.
  I think it is the collective responsibility and moral obligation of
Malaysian businessmen, especially those enjoying the privilege of being
included in the Prime Minister's entourage, not to do things that will
tarnish the good name of the country and its leaders.
  It is alright for them to take pride in telling people that they are
accompanying the Prime Minister or his deputy, especially if it helps to
open doors. But they must make sure that they announce the Prime
Minister's name at the appropriate door.
  Those who misbehave, even in front of a United Nations security guard or
a hotel clerk, should be hauled up and spoken to by those responsible for
including them in the Prime Minister's entourage.
  Kurang ajar and arrogance should not be made our trademark. If they are
not known to have good manners (including table manners), they should be
given proper briefings before they are let loose on the world as members
of the Prime Minister's entourage.
  Although some Malaysians can travel all the way from Kuala Lumpur to the
Bahamas to attend wedding receptions and their children's graduation or
are picked up in a private jet to go on a gambling trip to Las Vegas, we
should avoid behaving like kaduk naik junjung. We should try to be like
padi, semakin berisi semakin tunduk.

Prices end lower on US rates fear

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 12

SINGAPORE blue-chip stocks closed last week 0.8 per cent lower on Friday
amid an absence of local and overseas incentives after fears of a US
interest-rate rise were disproved.
  The Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) ended the week 16.81 points
down at 2,171.05. The broader All-Singapore index was 2.35 points lower to
529.17.
  Dealers said the market was expected to trade in a narrow range in the
near term, but added that the start of October could see some programmed
buying by institutional investors.
  Average daily turnover fell to 68.79 million shares worth S$187.46
million.
  The week opened on a quiet note with investors trying to digest the
release of lower-than-expected August trade data and awaiting the Federal
Reserve's decision on interest rates.
  Creative was still the top gainer, its share price recording an absolute
increase for the week of S$1.95 to S$7.95.

Stocks rise as US rate jitters ease

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 13

SHARE prices rose 1.4 per cent over the week to Friday as the futures
market gained after the US federal reserve left interest rates untouched
mid-week, dealers said.
  The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong's key Hang Seng Index gained 167.03
points last week to finish at 11,759.39 on Friday.
  Average daily turnover amounted to HK$6.2 billion, down from the
previous week's HK$7.158 billion dollars.
  The market rose on blue-chip buys, up 29.77 points last Monday. It lost
75.43 points on Tuesday on rate jitters but recovered 0.5 per cent on
Wednesday and a further 32.60 points on Thursday.
  Friday saw the biggest gain of the week with the Hang Seng up 123.26
points.

Mart ends mixed on FOMC move

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 14

By Public Bank Treasury Division

THE market's immediate reaction was mixed as to the surprise move by the
Fed to leave rates unchanged at the September 24 FOMC meeting. The Fed's
action gave the market a clearer direction for interest rates as the
week's economic data turned out mildly weak.
  Consumer confidence for September was down to 111.8 against August's
112.0 and August's existing homes was also down 0.02 million to 4.13
million. More significant was the durable goods for August which dropped
3.1 per cent against a 1.4 per cent increase the previous month.
  With this, rates eventually eased and they are expected to stay soft
next week until the next FOMC meeting in November.

Rates expected to close firmer this week

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 14

By Bank Bumiputra Treasury Division

INTERBANK money rates closed firmer as players borrowed the short- to
medium-term money for the settlement of the new bonds to be issued today.
  Shorter-end money rates rose higher while the longer-end closed steady
as covering activities were mostly centered on the short to medium tenors.
The highlight of the week was the tender result of the new bonds issue
which was announced on Friday afternoon.
  The 7-year MGS 2/96 coupon, fixed at 6.586 per cent, rallied after the
result to a high of RM100.60 as short covering activities took place. It
settled at RM100.33/35 in active trading.
  Even though the market was still flush with excess liquidity, term money
rates were pushed up in anticipation of a tighter market next week as
there will be an outflow of RM2.0 billion being payment for the new bonds
issue.
  The benchmark one, three and six months closed higher at 7.25/30 per
cent, 7.30/35 per cent and 7.33/35 per cent respectively.
  While one, two and three weeks money closed above 7.00 per cent as
dealers did not want to be caught short next week.
  The new MGS 2/96 bonds showed a big jump as the yield was depressed to
as low as 6.48 per cent after the announcement compared to 6.60/58 per
cent when it was traded in the grey market. It however retraced to close
the week at a 6.53 per cent yield (price RM100.33/35).
  There was no Bank Negara bills issue during the week forcing some banks
who were short on their liquid assets requirement to buy up Bank Negara
bills in the secondary market.
  As a result the band 4 (68 to 91 days) Bank Negara Bills dropped to
6.65/63 per cent at closing compared to the last tender result average
which was at 6.728 per cent.
  For this week, we expect rates to tighten temporarily due to the payment
of the RM2.0 billion for the new bonds.

Money talk: Investors surprised by Fed decision

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 14

By Bank of America Treasury Division

EARLIER last week, speculation of whether the US Federal Reserve will
increase interest rates during the FOMC meeting had preoccupied the
foreign exchange market.
  However, the market was caught by surprise with the Fed's decision to
leave interest rates unchanged, prompting fresh concerns about rising
inflation. The FOMC voted against raising short-term rates, even though a
majority of analysts had predicted a modest 25 basis points increase.
  Currency investors that had banked on a rate increase sold the US dollar
from 1.5140 to 1.50  marks, with strong support seen intact at 1.4980.
Some dealers blamed politics for delaying a much-needed interest rate
increase, with the pressure of Presidential and Congressional elections in
November.
  By the end of the week, the market witnessed a steady bid interest on
the US dollar after a surprising Swiss interest rate cut. Switzerland cut
its discount rate to an 18-year low of 1 per cent from 1.5 per cent and
investors fled the Swiss franc and the mark . Investors appear to have
forgotten their dissapointment with the Fed's decision to keep interest
rates untouched. The market is also expecting lower interest rates in
Germany in the coming months. The market has also turned a blind eye to
the dissolution of the Japanese Parliament's Lower House.  The market
closed at 1.5240 amd 110.70 against the mark and the yen respectively.
  As for next week, the market is vulnerable to all US indicators in the
run-up to the key non-farm payroll on Friday. Some analysts believe that
the US asset markets are currently hyper-sensitive to all kinds of rates
and so the US dollar could be on its guard. Others express concern that
the US dollar is gaining its strength mainly from external factors. The US
dollar will require fresh internal incentives/factors to rise above its
current key resistance level of 1.5250 marks.
  As for the local unit, the ringgit fell to the 2.51 level on fresh US
dollar demand ahead of the month-end requirements from commercials and
also due to heavy stop losses orders being triggered as the market
approaches the 2.51 level. The market is expected to be traded between
2.5050 and  2.5125 for next week.
  As for the Asian currencies, we expect the Singapore dollar/ringgit  to
trade between the 1.7750 and 1.7880 range and  the yen/ringgit between
2.2500 to 2.2800.

assumed on our part for error of facts and opinions.)

Hope for a city struggling for survival

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 4

By Leela Barrock in Phnom Penh

PHNOM PENH: There was a loud sound. The car dipped and then appeared to
levitate. A harsh gasp broke the startled silence as the passengers
waited, almost expectantly, in the split second for the bang ... There was
a dull thud and then the silence was broken by an apologetic giggle.
  "Sorry, pothole," the driver said. A regular journey through the streets
of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia.
  This is a city of contradictions. The traveller first meets what must be
a collection of the nicest Customs officers in the world, as they
apologise for having to check your luggage and then actually help you to
put your things back.
  Having been lulled into a false sense of security that all the
literature on the gentle Cambodian people is true, the weary traveller
sets foot outside Pochentong International Airport, only to be accosted by
a large crowd of deafeningly aggressive taxi drivers. They stick their
faces in yours and holler at the top of their voices: "Taxi, madam".
  If it is not the taxi drivers, then it is self-styled porters who try to
grab your bags and rush off in any direction they think you want to go.
Saying "No" is of no help.
  After locating your vehicle, they will shove everything into the boot
without a thought given to the fact that you may be blanching in shock at
the sound of breaking bottles of sambal belachan and Lee Kum Kee oyster
sauce. The inevitable tip is asked for. You could get away with a 500 riel
tip (about 50 sen) although if you do not have riels, US$1 (2,500 riels)
will get you a princely bow.
  Once safely in the car, the next shock hits you: there are no street
lights in most parts of Phnom Penh. This adds a new dimension to the
meaning of the phrase "pitch dark".
  Then, comes contradiction number two in the glaring and almost
decadently bright shape and form of Monivong Boulevard, one of the main
streets in the city.
  Almost every shop is adorned with colourful lights, and neon signs blink
away the darkness announcing the presence of massage parlours, snooker
parlours and parlours where one can do any number of parlour-like things.
This is the world of Suzie Wong - on a smaller scale and without the
American GIs.
  In the glaring daylight, however, Monivong is a lot less colourful. It
is shrouded in a perpetual cloud of dust that seems to hang over the whole
country and choke and cloak everything. The facades of the shops and
stores without the cover of night, are no more inviting than the "rumah
tumpangan" in Chow Kit, Kuala Lumpur.
  A quick whizz around Phnom Penh, and this city-bred Malaysian had parted
with a fortune in US dollars to what appeared to be society's downtrodden.
Beggars come at you from all sides and do not mind pinching conveniently
exposed parts of your body to attract attention. Most of them are
heartrendingly incapacitated, lacking in at least one limb, usually more.
  These are just a small part of the thousands of mine victims in
Cambodia, struggling to make a living in a country where even the fit,
hale and hearty have a tough time making ends meet. The only other two
places in the world where I have seen these many beggars are India and the
London underground.
  By lunchtime, several dollars poorer, wearing a cloak of dust and
parched from the dry heat of the city's "rainy season", we stepped into a
"Pizza Hot" restaurant. The logo is a mirror of the more well-known Pizza
Hut's red and white. The food is not that much different - a tad more
international than the Malaysianised fare in Kuala Lumpur's Pizza Huts.
  Suddenly overcome by a fit of homesickness, I decided to find that
accoutrement of most homesick Malaysians - Maggi Mee. Choosing the fastest
means of transport, I hopped on to a "moto dop" (motorcycle which doubles
as a taxi) and whizzed away, past the slower "cyclos" (trishaws).
  Whizzing with me were whole families of five or six, perched on
motorcycles. There were also the odd motorcycle balancing a mattress or
two, or with furniture strapped high on the back seat. I ogled at them and
the Cambodians ogled back at me, for I was the only woman sitting astride
a motorcycle, hanging on for dear life to the rider.
  The other women all sit side-saddle and do not come into any physical
contact with the riders. During the war years, apparently men too were
required by law to sit side-saddle on motorcycles because this made hand-
grenade throwing more difficult.
  In a local supermarket catering for expatriates, I found Maggi Mee. It
was also here that I encountered Cambodian directness.
  "Madam come from where?" a sales assistant asked me.
  "Malaysia."
  "Madam how old?"
  Looking as mortified as I felt, I decided to pander to this peculiar
outrightness. "Madam, 29 years old."
  "Ah ... " (She looked surprised). "I think Madam sirty fife," she said,
driving the point home by holding her hands up to show three and five
fingers.
  I left the store bemused and amused, armed with a packet of curry laksa
flavoured Maggi Mee which cost 25 US cents. Also in my grocery bag was a
packet of cigarettes which cost US$1, a bottle of Angkor beer for 80 US
cents and a French loaf for 30 US cents.
  Grabbing a newspaper for 1,000 riels, I walked out of the store to read
the first person account of a Khmer Rouge deserter on life with the
notorious Pol Pot leader of the guerrilla faction, which had stayed in
power in the country from 1975 to 1979.
  Almost 20 years after the Khmer Rouge were overthrown, their legacy
remains in the broken families, the shattered dreams of the people, their
crushed city, the homeless children, the bomb craters dotting the
countryside, and ruined lives.
  That night, after a packet of Maggi Mee and sitting in the balmy night
breeze of my villa (read this as semi-detached house), I noticed the smell
of Phnom Penh was finally overpowered by the large "mata kucing" tree in
my front garden.
  Phnom Penh smells like a growing child - of food, sweat and hope.
  And it is this hope that is most infectious. I found myself hoping that
the Khmer Rouge will surrender and that complete peace will be restored to
this still tragic country, that those of my generation who have known not
much more than a life of war and deprivation will be the last to know such
a life.
  The gentle smiles from the older generation of Cambodians are no longer
mirrored in the younger folks. It is this gentleness that could be the
biggest loss if hardship and constant economic struggle become the way of
life.

Fed seen raising rate by -1/4-point

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Leon Hadar in Washington

But some expect rate rise only after presidential polls

THE consensus among Fed watchers is that policymakers at the US central bank
will decide when they meet tomorrow to raise the federal fund rate, now 5.25
per cent, by a quarter point.

If this happens, it would be the first increase in 19 months.

Economic data issued on Thursday that showed stronger-than-expected housing
starts and shrinking claims on jobless benefits bolstered arguments that the
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would boost interest rates to keep the
economy from overheating.

Some experts, however, think the Fed may refrain from raising rates during a
presidential election campaign. They think the FOMC may instead decide on a
half-point rate hike at its next meeting, which will be after the November
poll.

Those who expect an immediate increase in the federal fund rate, which is what
banks charge each other for overnight funds, note that a majority of the 12
Federal Reserve district banks are now reportedly in favour of a quarter-point
hike.

There are signs that some of the inflation doves in the Fed, including
Governor Janet Yellin, are now concerned about the growing signs of inflation
and support a tighter monetary policy.

The FOMC consists of the six governors of the Federal Reserve and the 12
regional bank presidents.

Wall Street has been perplexed by the mixed messages in recent days about the
economy, with stock and bond prices falling at signs of inflation (and a
possible rate hike) and then rising as threats of inflation (and a rate
increase) seemed to dissipate.

Lowest take-up for new homes in eastern S'pore

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Michelle Low and Agnes Wee

Leasehold status, prices said to be among reasons for highest proportion of
unsold units

[SINGAPORE] The Geylang and East Coast areas have the highest proportion of
unsold new apartments, a BT survey shows.

And for new houses, the lowest take-up rates are in the Kew Drive area in
Bedok. BT looked at private housing projects of at least 50 units now under
construction and which are not yet fully sold. Data was divided into
sub-regions according to postal districts.

Geylang has the highest percentage -42 per cent -of unsold new apartments.
Next comes the East Coast (28 per cent).

In contrast, only 2 per cent of new apartments are still unsold in Pasir Ris.
In the Orchard/Bukit Timah area, 12 per cent are unsold, and in Upper Bukit
Timah, 13 per cent.

Market watchers offered several reasons for the varying take-up rates.

Geylang, for instance, was only recently turned into a residential corridor
with a series of new launches last year, and still suffers somewhat from its
reputation as Singapore's red-light district.

But location and pedigree are not the only reasons why people buy property.

The East Coast is a well-established residential district and yet 28 per cent
of the 2,949 newly-marketed apartments there have not found buyers.

Said one consultant: "The East Coast already has a high concentration of
freehold private housing estates and the new ones are mostly leasehold, which
may be less popular."

Also, prices of new leasehold East Coast projects are typically a shade higher
than equivalent freehold Upper Bukit Timah properties.

The Bukit Timah stretch (districts 11, 21 and 23) has seen a flurry of new
launches over the past year, and these projects generally saw strong take-up.
About 400 new units are still on the market.

But supply in this sector is growing -1,300 new condominium units being built
by Far East and City Developments in Bukit Batok (district 23) have just come
on the market.

In landed properties, projects in familiar landed territory (like Serangoon)
fared well, while those in new areas (like Kew Drive and Jurong West) sold
slowly.

In the East Coast area, more than half of the houses in three Kew Drive
projects have not been sold. Consultants say, though, that buyers' resistance
to these 99-year lease houses, launched last year, is slowly wearing down.

Far East still has 18 of its 31 Kew Gate units and 20 of 37 Kew Residencia
houses to sell. Nearby, CityDev has yet to sell 46 of its 76 Villas at Kew
units.

In district 22 (Jurong West), United Overseas Land still has 98 houses up for
sale in Westwood Park after phase one (170 units) was launched about a year
ago.

In the prime Holland Road area, a third of Far East's 113 Holland Grove
(99-year lease) are unsold.

The biggest developer, Far East, has not yet sold 27 per cent of its new
houses and 29 per cent of its apartment or condo units unsold.

Far East is by far the biggest supplier to Singapore's private housing market,
marketing thousands of new units every year. Recent projects which are now
fully sold include the Kew Vale houses and Westcove condos. Another big-league
developer, CityDev, has 21 per cent of its condos and 60 per cent of its new
houses still unsold. Earlier this year, the Kwek-controlled company sold out
its 928-unit Signature Park.

DBS Land, meanwhile, still has 30 per cent of its condos on the market. It has
sold out Casuarina Cove in Tanjong Rhu and the 159-unit Richmond Park near
Orchard Road.

Chavalit, Amnuay ahead in race for new Thai PM

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Loh Hui Yin in Bangkok

Markets likely to be cautious until outlook becomes clearer

THE Thai government's six coalition partners are in intense behind-the-scene
manoeuvring following Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa's resignation and
ahead of a meeting tomorrow.

Mr Banharn's Chart Thai Party, with 92 seats in parliament, remains the core
of the coalition and its Members of Parliament have indicated they want a say
in who becomes the next premier.

Mr Banharn, who is being blamed for Thailand's economic slowdown, has said the
next prime minister must be competent in economic affairs.

The two front-runners are Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, leader of the New Aspiration
Party, and Amnuay Virawan who heads the Nam Thai Party. Both men are deputy
prime ministers in the current cabinet.

Dr Amnuay, formerly a respected bureaucrat, finds more favour with the
business community. He was executive chairman of Thailand's largest bank,
Bangkok Bank, from 1983-1992.

While Dr Amnuay might be preferred by the business community, his Nam Thai
Party has only 18 seats in parliament and this would make it difficult for him
to govern.

General Chavalit, a former army chief who quit to join politics, has been
bolstering his political base with the just-announced military reshuffle. He
has been promoting big commercial projects, like a new bank, for the military.

Mr Banharn announced on Saturday he would resign in seven days' time. But it
is not clear if Mr Banharn will take any position in the new cabinet.

His departure will be greeted with relief by the business and financial
community, but the financial markets are likely to be cautious until the
political outlook becomes clearer in the next few days.

Photipong Lamsam, chairman of the Board of Trade, said the new cabinet should
be formed quickly because the prolonged political problems have affected
business.

Mr Banharn's hand was forced on Saturday morning when New Aspiration Party,
Nam Thai Party and Muanchon Party banded together and threatened to vote
against him on the no-confidence motion if he did not agree to quit before the
vote.

During the blistering three-day censure debate, Mr Banharn was accused by the
opposition of economic mismanagement and corruption.

An upset Mr Banharn, whose 14 months as prime minister has been stormy, said:
"I have been very tired after working for slightly over one year. I am proud
of what my government has done so far."

Thailand's exports have slumped this year and economic growth is at its lowest
in a decade. Speculation is rife that the Thai baht will be devalued to
stimulate exports, and the currency has been under attack with Thai stocks
sinking to three-year lows.

Top Asian groups to join US$200m Yangon project / Wharf Holdings, Jardine
Matheson Holdings, Salim Group, Pidemco Land,

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Loh Hui Yin in Bangkok

Jardine, Salim and Wharf to take stakes in industrial project promoted by
S'pore

THREE of Asia's biggest conglomerates are joining a Singapore-promoted US$200
million (S$280 million) industrial development project in Myanmar.

They are Wharf Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings of Hongkong; and the
Salim group of Indonesia.

Singapore's Pidemco Land will also become a shareholder of Sinmardev
International which is promoting the project.

Sinmardev International's original shareholders are architect-businessman
Albert Hong and his firm, RSP Architects, Planners and Engineers, and building
materials producer PD International of Singapore.

The project calls for the development of a 12 square kilometre industrial park
and a port for bulk cargo on the outskirts of Yangon. It is a much scaled-down
proposal from the ambitious $4 billion township that Sinmardev mapped out two
years ago.

The Myanmar government, which has a 40 per cent stake in the project, will
provide land in Thanlyin-Kyauktan, about 18 km south-east of Yangon. The bulk
terminal will be located in Thilawa where another Singapore firm, C&P
Holdings, has been given permission to build and operate container berths.
Thilawa is 16km inland from the Yangon river.

Having the three big business groups, which are likely to be minor
shareholders, will help Sinmardev market the project to potential investors.

A Singapore businessman active in Myanmar said the three big groups are most
likely using the Sinmardev project as a testing ground for future investments.
He added that Singapore-backed projects are held in good esteem by the Myanmar
authorities.

Singapore's Pidemco is not new to Myanmar as it is building a hotel there. The
Port of Singapore Authority is also exploring an investment in a Thai-backed
township project in Yangon.

Ex-head of derivatives trading at Barings to sue

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Neil Behrmann

LONDON

He claims FT, authors of new book have defamed him

RON BAKER, former head of derivatives trading at Barings, is suing the
Financial Times and authors of a new book on the collapse of the bank.

Mr Baker has featured in alleged transcripts of taped telephone conversations
at Barings. They were obtained by FT reporters John Gapper and Nicholas Denton
and have been published in the newspaper's serialisation of their book, All
That Glitters.

Mr Baker, who was in charge of Nick Leeson when the rogue trader brought down
the bank, has been trying to clear his name for some time. He contends that
the serialisation and book to be published today have defamed him by quoting
conversations out of context.

Moreover, he claimed the FT has prejudiced a forthcoming hearing before the
Securities and Futures Authority. Several months ago, Mr Baker sought a
hearing before an SFA tribunal to defend himself and reverse a proposed
three-year ban and [pound]10,000 (S$22,000) fine.

"The implication of what is said in the Financial Times is that I somehow
contributed to the collapse of the bank and this is untrue," Mr Baker told BT.
"The cause of the collapse was a fraud in the segregated client accounts of
Barings' agency broking business; it had nothing to do with house trading
which I ran in 1994."

Mr Baker added that he became head of the derivatives desk at the beginning of
January 1995, less than two months before the bank collapsed.

"Nothing in the SFA allegation against me relates to the collapse of Barings,"
Mr Baker said. He added that by the time he was made Leeson's manager, the
trader's fraud was well advanced and Barings' losses ran into millions of
pounds.

"The publishing of taped telephone conversations in its own right does not
bother me, although they are a dangerous medium for establishing the facts
upon which to draw conclusions," Mr Baker said. "Isolated telephone
conversations do not provide the full story (my telephone wasn't taped) and
they give no context."

"However, in this case, they have cut and pasted a number of different
conversations, omitting large areas, in a manner which creates a picture
totally at odds with the facts."

The FT will be defending the case because it believes that the book has strong
evidence.

All set for invasion of Normandy / Microsoft Corporation

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Toh Han Shih

BusinessIT

Microsoft plans landing of its first Internet platform in the Asia-Pacific

[SINGAPORE] Microsoft is planning to invade the Internet of entire nations in
the Asia-Pacific with Normandy, its Internet platform with capabilities in
Internet commerce and the Intranet.

Normandy is Microsoft's first platform for commercial Internet services
specifically designed for Internet service providers (ISPs), network operators
and Internet content providers. It has several servers including Merchant
Server, Microsoft's Internet commerce server that allows customers to set up
Internet malls; tools to build Intranets; and security features for Internet
commerce.

"The Internet war is not over browsers because both companies (Microsoft and
Netscape) are giving away browsers (free). The war is over Internet servers.
It is the servers that makes money for these companies," said Ray Chang, chief
executive officer of AsiaConnect, Malaysia's largest provider of Internet
sites. AsiaConnect is Asean's first Normandy user.

Analysts predict that Intranets will generate many times more revenue than the
Internet. Mr Chang said Normandy would be one of the platforms for a broad
bandwidth Intranet consisting of fibre optic cables and microwave networks
that will cover the whole of Malaysia in two years.

Though Netscape now dominates the Internet server market, Mr Chang predicted:
"A fairly large portion of Malaysian Web sites will use Normandy. Normandy
will command a substantial market share worldwide rapidly."

He said this is because the money Microsoft is putting into research and
marketing, running into billions of dollars and exceeding Netscape's turnover,
is "mind-blowing".

Chinese organisations, Indosat (Indonesia's only international
telecommunications company), NTT (Japan's national telecommunications
carrier), Datamat (a Thai ISP), Singnet and Singapore Cablevision are
evaluating Normandy. Analysts believe NTT will take up to half of Japan's
Internet market in future.

SAP, one of the world's largest software firms, will integrate its enterprise
software with Merchant Server.

However, Mr Chang qualified: "I would not write off Netscape."

He noted the high quality of Netscape's Applications Foundry, a suite of
Intranet tools. AsiaConnect deploys both Netscape's servers and Normandy.

Ben Yeo, a deputy manager with Sembawang Media, pointed out that Normandy
works only with Microsoft NT. This means organisations running Unix servers
cannot use Normandy for their Internet applications. Mr Yeo said that as long
as Unix remains, Normandy cannot totally replace Netscape. Sembawang Media is
a Netscape distributor.

However, Microsoft network manager Chong Yoke Sim said: "With Normandy, it
will accelerate the adoption of NT, not only for corporations, but also ISPs."

Netscape regional manager Casey Ong said Normandy is not so open. He
explained: "Merchant Server works closely with ActiveX, which makes Windows an
indispensable component in the Internet. That rules out Internet appliances
which do not use Windows, and future versions of Windows will include Explorer
(Microsoft's Internet browser).

"Microsoft, in trying to promote Explorer, will make it such that there are
certain sites that Netscape Navigator cannot get into. The only access to
non-Microsoft databases like Oracle is through ODBC, which is not conducive to
massive exchange of information or mission-critical applications."

Ms Chong said future versions of eshop, an Internet commerce technology now
incorporated into Merchant Server, will be compatible with NT only, whereas in
the past eshop worked with Unix software and Silicon Graphics hardware.

Netscape's Mr Ong pointed out that computers not using Windows or NT, users
with Netscape browsers, and millions of future Internet appliances like
handphones and TV will not access Normandy easily. And AsiaConnect's Mr Chang
said Sun hardware cannot work with Normandy.

"For Internet commerce to take off at full speed, we need to embrace open
systems. Even if Netscape doesn't do well, there are third parties to build
applications, based on open standards," he said.

Internet malls are coming your way

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

BusinessIT

[SINGAPORE] It's been great to send and receive e-mail. It's been mind-blowing
to surf the ever-expanding world of the Internet. And soon, Singaporeans will
have a new cyber treat -- they will be able to shop at Internet malls.

These "malls" allow users to virtually inspect goods, shop, order goods, bank
and conduct financial transactions via the Internet.

Contact, a subsidiary of the Sembawang Group, and AsiaOne, a subsidiary of
Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), will set up the Internet malls early next
year. Both companies will set up infrastructure for the malls and from there,
their customers can set up as many shopping "precincts" as they want.

The concept is part of the Electronic Commerce Hotbed, a National Computer
Board initiative.

Contact general manager Gary Koh said last week: "We will have customers
running their malls by early next year. Some people have committed
themselves."

He declined to reveal who these Internet shopkeepers will be, but said most of
the organisations which expressed interest in the cyberspace malls are local
banks and local merchants. He added that Contact would have regional customers
setting up Internet malls soon.

There has been similar enthusiasm, too, for AsiaOne's Internet mall scheme.
Low Huan Ping, general manager of AsiaOne, said local parties had committed
themselves to setting up shop. It will also, in future, have stores from the
region.

Contact's parent company, Sembawang Media, offers a service whereby customers
can put their Internet malls on Sembawang's Asia Internet Holdings (AIH)
backbone.

Similarly, AsiaOne will be putting its Internet mall on Cyberway's own
pan-Asian backbone, which Cyberway is building with regional Internet service
providers. SPH is a majority owner of Cyberway.

HP cautious over home PC push into Asia-Pacific market / Hewlett-Packard

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Jennifer Lien in Palo Alto

BusinessIT

Company V-P tells why it's better to be safe than sorry

US-BASED computer giant Hewlett-Packard is taking a cautious approach in
bringing its home PC product, the Pavilion, to the Asia-Pacific market, a
senior official said.

"Just because it's been successful in the US, it doesn't mean it will be
successful elsewhere," said vice-president Duane Zitzner, who heads HP's
worldwide personal information products group.

"We have to be very careful to balance that business with our return on
investment," he said.

He gave several reasons why the home PC space is difficult to compete in -poor
margins ("They're terrible. Sometimes they even go the other direction") and
the existence of "garage shops" or clone-makers which sell PCs at cut-throat
prices.

The product's launch in Asia has also been slowed by some "supply-chain
difficulties", director of South-east Asian sales and distribution Philip Chua
told a press conference in Singapore earlier this month.

Despite these difficulties, the home PC market is important for HP as a
springboard for HP's entry into other emerging home technologies, such as a
"home server" which manages household appliances and information -a product
about "a year away" from being launched, estimated Asia-Pacific marketing
manager Steve Haslett. Mr Zitzner said: "Being in the home market gives us
knowledge and understanding of the consumer and where that business might go."

HP also already has several other non-PC products in the home space, including
printers and calculators.

After a successful 1995 pre-Christmas launch in the US, HP decided to launch
the product in Europe and test the Asia-Pacific market, starting with
Australia and New Zealand. The countries were chosen for their similarity to
the US, said Mr Zitzner. Launched in April, the Pavilion has quickly moved to
become one of the top seven home PCs in those markets.

"We need to make sure the business model works well -supply chains, sales and
distribution model, retail channels. As we become more sophisticated with
that, then we'll look at expanding the market," said Mr Zitzner.

Singapore could see the launch of the Pavilion as early as the second quarter
of next year, according to Mr Chua.

Features customers can look forward to, based on HP's new October models,
include Pentium microprocessors of between 120 and 166 MhZ, 3D accelerated
video graphics, an 8X CD-ROM drive, pipeline burst cache and up to 2.5 GB hard
drive.

The products will also have a suite of imaging features as well as built-in
Internet access.

Eutech sets global sights with software consortium / Eutech Cybernetics

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Annette Pau

BusinessIT

[SINGAPORE] Home-grown Eutech Cybernetics has initiated an Asia-wide virtual
corporation that it hopes will vault the high-tech company into the ranks of
global IT players.

Hari Gunasingham, scientist-turned-entrepreneur and managing director of
Eutech Cybernetics, told BusinessIT in an interview: "We want to be the
standard for enterprise systems, the Windows 95 of the enterprise game."

Eutech Cybernetics is the main driving force in the formation of the
Eutech-Asia Software Consortium, which currently comprises six member
companies, including five publicly-listed Indian software companies. It hopes
to add other IT companies over time.

Eutech-Asia is a software consortium which aims to deliver IT products and
services aligned with business systems through an architectural model to set
new standards in the fast growing area of enterprise computing.

The consortium will be officially launched tomorrow, based on a Memorandum of
Understanding signed early this year. Members include Eutech Cybernetics,
Microland, Infosys Technologies, Macmet India, Ashok Leyland Information
Technologies, BFL Software.

"Today, the whole paradigm is about enterprise systems. People are
increasingly looking at corporate networks and systems, and as more corporate
Intranets are connected up, they will want new ways of doing business, new
business systems, new concepts. These are the areas that we as a consortium
want to tackle," Dr Gunasingham said.

Consortium director Arun Abraham explained how the consortium helps pool
resources: "Eutech provides the systems knowledge, management and marketing
infrastructure in Singapore, while our Indian counterparts have the technical
skills and expertise, and the human resource."

One of the central aims of the consortium is to create an architectural
standard for both IT and business systems. Eutech has in fact developed an
architecture as a framework for building enterprise systems and for delivering
both products and services to businesses. This, says Dr Gunasingham, is both
userand network-centric, allowing business objects to communicate with each
other using "intelligent agents".

It also seeks to join forces in R&D, focusing on wireless communications and
agent-based technology. Collective R&D spending so far has amounted to some
$15 million.

According to Dr Gunasingham, response to the consortium has been good. Many
regional companies have asked to join the consortium, and it intends to take
in more members to increase their pool of IT professionals to a lofty number
of 100,000 in the year 2000.

"We expect to grow faster than the current 70 per cent average growth of the
(Indian) members of the consortium," said Dr Gunasingham.

Eutech Cybernetics was founded in 1990, a spin-off from research scientists
from the local university. Staff has grown from five to 140 now.

Eutech's revenues for FY95 were some $11 million. In FY96, Dr Gunasingham
reckons modest revenues of $16 million. This is expected to double the
following year, with the launch of Catseye, described as the embodiment of
Eutech architecture.

Canon Singapore sales surge with whopping printer demand / Canon Singapore

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

BusinessIT

[SINGAPORE] Sales by Canon Singapore, which oversees the electronics
manufacturer's operations in Asia outside Japan, grew almost three times more
than projected, thanks to strong demand for its printers.

Canon Singapore last week posted a 35 per cent increase in sales to US$493.3
million (S$690 million) in the first half of this financial year from US$366.4
million in the same period last year. The steady growth of the office
automation industry and the introduction of a new range of printers are
believed to have contributed to this.

Actual sales have far surpassed the projected growth of 13 per cent, the
group's managing director, Mr Kohtaro Miyagi, said. "It is certainly a boost
for the group's operations, especially in the emerging Indian and Indo-China
markets," he added.

Sales of printers accounted for most of the increase in sales, with a 118 per
cent jump in demand for Laser Beam printers. Bubble Jet printers also
registered a 20 per cent increase, with brisk sales of low-cost-high-output
models such as the BJC-610 and the BJC-210.

Calculators also sold well, with a 56 per cent growth in sales due to an
expanded range of products. Sales of facsimile machines and cameras increased
by 9 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively.

Parent company Canon Inc also did well, recording a 89.2 per cent increase in
consolidated net income in the first half, compared with a 20.7 per cent rise
in net sales in the same period last year. Canon Singapore's results were the
foremost contributor to this increase. Projected consolidated net income and
net sales for Canon Inc this year are US$727 million and US$22.7 billion
respectively.

Hopes of Windows NT surge overstated : Analyst

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Kenneth James

BusinessIT

But Smith Barney's Bosak still sees 18 to 20 per cent PC growth

[SINGAPORE] For months analysts have been predicting that the launch of
Microsoft's Windows NT 4.0 operating system will light a fire under the
personal computer industry.

Won't happen, says Smith Barney Inc's computer research chief Barry Bosak.

But Mr Bosak, managing director of the New York securities major's research
division, adds that PC growth should still hit a respectable 18-20 per cent
this year. "Business isn't bad," the veteran analyst says. "Demand, especially
corporate demand, is steady."

Mr Bosak, a former head of the Computer Industry Analysts group in the US,
tracks computer and related stocks for Smith Barney, the second-largest
securities firm in the US. Speaking to BusinessIT last week, he gave his
perspective of the state of the industry.

The softening in the PC and related industries is because "too much electronic
capacity has been put on line", he says. Part of the reason has been the
doubleor triple-ordering of components and peripherals by PC makers, and
resultant cancellations.

Add to that an overhang of PC supply from last year. He cites a finding by
research group Dataquest that as much as six million PCs were made in excess
of demand last year. That will have to be cleared this Christmas quarter.
Still, he doesn't expect a repeat of last year's December quarter which was
characterised by "whimsical purchases by consumers who had a lot of money".

But demand in both corporate and consumer markets is healthy, Mr Bosak
emphasises. Only don't expect last week's launch of Windows NT 4.0 to spark
off a resurgence in PC sales. That's "overstating the case" and there will be
"no big wave" of NT-induced buying, he says. "I don't think corporations are
running out to buy Pentium and Pentium Pro PCs."

He explains that corporations are "more methodical" in their computer
purchases now. And they have had plenty of time to build up their PC armoury
in anticipation of a switch to Windows 95 and Windows NT.

He cites the case of a large financial institution that has been buying
Pentiums and Pentium Pros steadily since March. "It's not something that's
happening all at once."

So who are the likely winners and losers among computer stocks? For a start,
Mr Bosak zeroes in on a largely unheralded group: data storage providers.

He offers this insight on the changing nature of computing: "I don't think
computing is about computing, it's about information, either getting it or
sending it."

So storage companies will be engines of the new information age. Which is why
countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, which succeeded in attracting
the major players, "are going to feel very fortunate".

His pick of the winners in this category: EMC Corp in high-end disk arrays;
Seagate, IBM and Western Digital in disk drives.

Among PC companies, he is upbeat about beleaguered Apple Computer. "They are
doing the right things to shore up the company, and they have some exciting
machines coming out," he says. Apple rates a "buy, with speculative risk" in
his book. But leader Compaq is an "underperform, high risk" stock: "High
margins gone; near term bounce over," he says.

In networking, "Cisco is doing a phenomenal job" while Sun "has a lot of
potential". And the star of stars? Analysts mention HP, Sun, Microsoft, Intel,
he notes "but IBM probably makes it to the top of the list". The computer
giant is sitting on a US$7 billion cash hoard and "cash might be king in a
technology stock correction".

Also, its various divisions are in good shape, with mainframe sales "steady",
storage manufacturing "growing very nicely" and its US$15 billion PC business
"finally looking like a contender".

What could go wrong? Mr Bosak, who's seen it all after 30 years in the
business, admits to a "greatest fear": recession.

Indeed the official line at Smith Barney is that "the slowdown (of the US
economy) is coming, it's just taking its sweet time".

The securities house expects real GDP growth to slow to 2.6 per cent in the
second half of this year, down from the 3.4 per cent of the first half; and to
decelerate further to between 1.0 and 1.5 per cent in the first half of next
year.

But if the slowdown tailspins into a recession, then all bets are off.

Internet takes centre stage at trade show: Novell unveils new products and
strategies at Networld

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By David Welcher in Atlanta

BusinessIT

THE most recent major networking trade show, Networld+Interop, has just ended
here, with more than 60,000 participants seeking definitive networking
solutions from over 600 vendors, but largely finding them elusive.

Grown from an extremely modest event in 1986, when only 300 people attended,
it today represents a must-visit constellation in the galaxy of networking
events. Not surprising, then, that Novell chose this venue to introduce
IntranetWare, the latest, Internet-empowered version of NetWare.

IBM, showcasing its server families, anti-virus tools, and Internet abilities,
was also there, as was Lotus, promoting the new, Internet-capable Notes
Version 4.5. Microsoft, despite a highly publicised challenge from Novell
about whose network directory services were superior, essentially ignored the
Utah contingent and continued to promote Windows NT as the ideal network
server.

Industry professionals could also take a guided tour of the InteropNet, a
state-of-the-art network which tied together all exhibitors at the show.
Featuring ATM, FDDI, Fast Ethernet and the latest in diagnostic and monitoring
tools, it provided an operating, production-scale demonstration of the
industry's latest advances.

InteropNet runs TCP/IP, IPX and AppleTalk, uses twisted-pair copper, fiber
optic cable, and wireless connections, and contains nearly 200 km of cabling
to connect the show's 6,000 on-line devices.

Although it could safely be stated that the future of networking technology
was clearly represented on the show floor, choosing the winner of that
sweepstakes was not quite that simple. In fact, although the usual candidates
competed for attention and claimed superiority, it remained for the visiting
professional to determine the questions at the show, and resolve the answers
carefully over time.

In the broadband arena, there was no clearly superior solution. While numerous
vendors proclaimed that ATM and Frame Relay were available now, and costly
FDDI (fibre) begged for continuing attention, most professionals seemed to be
taking the cautious track. Many continued to look towards the proposed
1-gigabit Ethernet standard, perhaps because it does not seem to require such
a radical change in direction. The Novell caveat -that the best solution is
one that leverages existing technology without requiring that everything be
replaced -appeared to be right on the mark.

With relatively little truly new in the hardware arena, software took centre
stage, prominently featuring the Internet. The commercial future of the
Internet, hampered by security concerns, remains some distance down the road.
But corporate networks, featuring smooth integration of Internet access, are
readily available now, especially in the GroupWare and e-mail categories from
Lotus, Microsoft and Novell.

While professionals struggled to determine the best solutions to network
planning problems with global impact, and vendors invested millions in trying
to promote their message, a few unusual items stood out from the crowd; not
because of their gravity, but rather because they were different.

One of the most fascinating is a log-in authentication system from National
Registry Inc (NRI), of Reston, Virginia. Combining NRI's imaging software with
fingerprint recognition touchpads, NRIdentity Scanners come in two models, a
mouse-like pad which connects to a Enhanced Capabilities Parallel (ECP) Port,
and one built into a keyboard.

Together, they provide any Windows-based computer system with a biometric
scanning and identification system to control computer access, by comparing a
user's scanned fingerprint to an image previously placed in a database.

Current pricing is about US$400 (S$560), still a bit costly, but down
significantly from the US$1,000-US$2,000 of a few years ago. The company
anticipates significant further price drops with volume production, said
Robert Leamy, vice-president, Product Development. More info is available on
the World Wide Web at http://www.nrid.com.

Those who missed the show and would like an opportunity to draw their own
conclusions about the industry's future, can visit local versions next year.
In Singapore, Networld+Interop is scheduled to run from April 7 to 11.

Novell unveils new products and strategies at Networld: Internet takes
centre stage at trade show / Novell

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By David Welcher in Atlanta

BusinessIT

NOVELL Corporation, long seen by many industry observers as lacking a coherent
corporate marketing strategy, has apparently been listening to its critics. At
the just concluded Networld+Interop in Atlanta, Novell rolled out
IntranetWare, the latest iteration of its flagship NetWare product, and also
described a cohesive mission knitting together the strengths of its various
product groups.

Novell has been seen by many industry experts as marching to the wrong
drummer. This is because NetWare uses the IPX protocol, while most of the
industry, including the Internet, uses TCP/IP. In a move to correct this,
IntranetWare adds new services to Novell's NetWare 4.11 operating system to
provide a complete Intranet platform.

The defined mission, according to senior company officials, is to combine
NetWare, groupware, Internet browsing and Java development into a
comprehensive solution for providing corporations with Intranets.

As corporations seek to maximize the Internet's business potential, there is a
growing interest in Intranets, said William Donahoo, Novell's Director of
International Marketing. "Intranets are business networks used for corporate
information needs, which also utilise Internet technologies," he said.

IntranetWare provides both IP and IPX access to its Intranet resources, which
include Web servers and browsers, FTP servers, and Internet connections. The
arrangement provides a natural security firewall, Novell officials explained,
since unauthorised access from the Internet cannot penetrate the NetWare IPX
gateway to access corporate NetWare servers.

Novell's installed customer base includes 3.5 million servers and 55 million
users. The new strategy is intended to capitalise on its core networking
strengths, as well as leverage its 55 million-strong user base. The "glue"
intended to cement together this new corporate strategy is Novell Directory
Services (NDS), which is widely considered to be one of Novell's strongest
assets. NDS allows users to see other file servers as directories, and will
now be able to do the same for Internet sites.

Novell is not only targeting its own installed base, but is promoting NDS to
vendors of competing operating systems. "Other operating system vendors want
to use NDS," said Michael Simpson, Director of Novell's Internet
Infrastructure Division. "It is, in fact, intended to be OS portable. Only 9
per cent of the code is platform specific."

Novell expects to see considerable revenue from this new initiative, Mr
Simpson said.

Heading off the obvious question of whether NetWare's future was questionable,
Mr Simpson emphatically stated: "This is a new revenue potential, not a hedge
in case NetWare slips." SCO released an NDS-aware version last January, and
negotiations are under way with numerous others, he said.

The upgrade needs of Novell's existing customers have also been carefully
considered, said Denice Gibson, Novell senior vice-president, at
IntranetWare's formal rollout last Tuesday. "Customers are looking to
implement Internet solutions, and they need to seamlessly turn existing
technology into Intranets with minimum disruption and cost," she explained.
"They are not interested in a solution which requires them to rip out
everything they have."

"To both do this and give them best of breed technology, we are partnering
with other companies to provide this," she added.

Major partners who have signed on with Novell in the effort include Netscape,
whose browser will give NetWare users access to the Internet, and UUNet, which
has the network in place to deliver the necessary information.

Although all this comes too late for ex-CEO Robert Frankenberg, who resigned
in August, it seems to directly echo his previously stated vision of Novell's
future. Frankenberg's address at the November, 1995 Comdex, envisioned a
"Smart Global Network, incorporating NetWare, the Netscape browser, and Sun's
Java language as the core of a global data communications network."

IntranetWare will be available on Oct 7, and carries no increase in price from
previous versions. Limited time incentives are being offered to encourage
existing users to upgrade.

Summing up Novell's message that its customers need not look elsewhere for
answers, Ms Gibson concluded: "To our 55 million users, we say tonight: Look
at what you've got."

Microsoft NT 4.0, Workstation 4.0 hit the market

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Toh Han Shih

BusinessIT

[SINGAPORE] Amid analysts' predictions that Microsoft NT will gain market
share from Novell NetWare, Microsoft last week launched its latest software
server, the NT 4.0, as well as its client operating system, Workstation 4.0.

Microsoft is giving the NT 4.0 Internet and Intranet features, as is Novell
with its latest NetWare, as both try to outdo each other in the software
server market.

Microsoft back office manager Yong Yun Seong said NT 4.0 has Intranet
capability, in addition to the application's support, file and print
capability of earlier versions.

NT 4.0's new Intranet features include Microsoft FrontPage 1.1, which allows
users to publish Web pages easily; Microsoft Index Server; an Internet search
engine; and Internet security. NT 4.0 is optimised for broad bandwidth
networks like Fast Ethernet and allows users to make local calls for remote
Internet access to their corporate LANs.

Dataquest industry analyst Janardan Menon said Novell would continue to lose
market share to NT at an even more accelerated rate than last year.

He attributed this to the growing popularity in the corporate world of
Microsoft Workstation as a client operating system, which is designed to fit
in with NT. He said that although NetWare is compatible with Workstation,
people would prefer to have the same operating system from the same company on
both the client and server.

Mr Menon added that Intel would promote NT because NT requires Intel's Pentium
Pro chips to run.

"It's not only the product that matters, but the marketing around it," he
said, adding that NetWare's network directory services are superior to NT's
equivalent.

Ray Chang, chief executive officer of AsiaConnect, a Malaysian company that is
one of Asia's largest providers of Internet Web sites, offered a more extreme
opinion. "I don't think Novell stands a chance against NT," he said.

"NT is scaleable, cheap, seamlessly integrated to the Internet and easy to
implement. NetWare does not seamlessly fit into the Internet as well as NT."

Now, over 60 per cent of the world's PC LANs use Novell NetWare, and it is
easier for these NetWare users to upgrade to future versions of NetWare than
to NT, according to Novell Asia-Pacific marketing manager Jason Pan.

Microsoft's Mr Yong said NT 4.0 is compatible with NetWare, so companies that
deploy NetWare can add NT 4.0.

Microsoft has also provided tools to allow users to migrate from NetWare to NT
4.0.

Workstation is part of Microsoft's plan to target the corporate market. Mr
Menon said corporate users would prefer Workstation to Windows 95 because the
former is pure 32-bit and more robust.

Microsoft marketing manager Natasha Kwan said PCs with Workstation would be
powerful enough to move into the workstation market. However, Microsoft
Singapore managing director Paul Lovell admitted Workstation consumes so much
power that notebooks need a power cable to operate Workstation.

Wing Tai net earnings jump 73% to $145m / Wing Tai Holdings, DNP Holdings

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Michelle Low

Result beats market forecasts by $20m; more project profits booked than
expected

[SINGAPORE] Wing Tai Holdings has reported a 73 per cent rise in net profit to
$145 million for the year to June 30, higher than market forecasts by about
$20 million.

Wing Tai, which started out making garments but now makes its money from
property, said it would wind down its loss-making garment manufacturing
business in Singapore. But it will continue profitable garment-making
operations in Malaysia through associate DNP Holdings.

Space vacated by the manufacturing operations at its Tampines headquarters
building will be leased out. The site may be redeveloped in future -its
location in a housing district and near a proposed MRT station makes it ideal
for a residential project.

Almost all of 1996 (and 1995) earnings came from Singapore property projects
sold in the early '90s.

In the second half, the group earned almost $100 million more than it did in
the first half. Analysts said forecasts were off the mark as Wing Tai booked
more profit from development projects than they had provided for.

In the period under review, the group recognised 40 per cent of total bookings
from Maplewoods, 29 per cent from Palm Springs and 30 per cent from the
Hougang Mall it sold to NTUC Income. Pre-tax profits came to $238 million, up
68 per cent from last year. Turnover rose 53 per cent to $573 million.

Earnings per share jumped to 25.7 cents from 14.9 cents. Net tangible assets
went up to $2.06 per share from $1.84 per share. Directors recommended a
dividend of 20 per cent, the same as last year.

Sales of its new housing projects here are steady. The just-launched Sunrise
Gardens sold 50 per cent of its 252 units in a week. The Bedok apartments were
priced at $580 per square foot and marketed just after the "Ghost Month"
ended.

Sales at the 251-unit Duchess Crest improved to 65 per cent, up from 45 per
cent in July. Analysts say sales improved after Wing Tai took the $1,000 psf
project to Hongkong to sell.

Between now and mid-1997, Wing Tai will sell four more projects -one
commercial (Bencoolen Street) and three residential.

Another 400-unit Bukit Timah project on the Rothmans site will be sold only in
1998.

50% of profit to come from overseas / Wing Tai

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Michelle Low

[SINGAPORE] By the turn of the century, half of Wing Tai's profits will come
from overseas property projects in Hongkong and Malaysia.

The largest single project on Wing Tai's plate now is the massive Airport
Railway Kowloon Station Development in Hongkong. Wing Tai leads a consortium
in developing the HK$7.7 billion (S$1.4 billion) residential project, phase
one of a seven-phase project.

The first phase will have about 1.6 million square feet of built-up area. Wing
Tai, which has a 30 per cent interest in the project, declined to give profit
estimates.

But analysts suggest that at a conservative selling price of HK$7,000 per
square foot, the first phase could generate revenue of close to HK$12 billion.
Subtracting a cost of close to HK$5,000 psf, profit could be more than HK$3
billion.

The group was mostly silent on China, except to say that activities were "at a
relatively low level" but "longer term prospects are positive". Wing Tai is
involved in the Suzhou Industrial Park and is also building apartments in
Suzhou's New District.

In Malaysia, associate DNP has "started to make property development and
investment a core business".

DNP owns 14.3 million sq ft of commercial and residential land in Kuala Lumpur
and Penang.

As part of its regional focus, Wing Tai is also planning a chain of high-end
service apartments under the Lanson Place brand.

Some 700 units in four projects are being built in Singapore (Winsland House
II), Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta. Two developments start operating next year.

The China hand

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

Column:  Hang Seng Insight

By Quak Hiang Whai

Two separate events may share a common link

WHAT has Tung Chee Hwa's candidacy for the post of chief executive of the
Special Administrative Region government and the settlement of a long-delayed
container terminal project have in common? On the surface, the link is
shipping. Mr Tung is chairman of Orient Overseas International Ltd, which owns
shipping firm Orient Overseas Container Line.

But hidden beneath the waves, the link could well be China, extending a
"guiding hand".

Mr Tung's declaration puts to rest months of speculation about the intention
of the hottest favourite for Hongkong's top post-1997 job. Pro-China and
pro-business parties will be relieved by his declared interest, while liberals
will see the development as part of a staged competition. After all, the
low-key shipping tycoon has been tipped to be China's prefered candidate and
is expected by many to toe the "make money, not democracy" line.

His candidacy may even provide comfort to some pro-British elements since he
was also a member of the Governor's advisory body. As for those without a
stand, Mr Tung has at least widened the field for a contest which has so far
yielded only two other candidates.

Yet, all is not rosy. Is a businessman with huge interests in Hongkong and
China and business partners like Li Ka-shing right for the job? To reassure
doubters, Mr Tung plans to resign from all his key positions and stay away
from the selection committee which will elect the chief executive. He will
also transfer his business interests to other family members.

More importantly, however, is whether the selection process will be fair and
transparent. To many people here, the choice of the chief executive has
already been made by Beijing.

Meanwhile, Secretary of Economic Services Stephen Ip called a press briefing
with the major port operators Hutchison Whampoa, Jardine, Wharf and Sealand to
announce the breakthrough in the agreement on CT9 (Container Terminal Nine).

He had difficulty assuring and reassuring the media that the CT9 agreement was
a purely commercial deal and no political pressure was made to reduce
Jardine's role.

Despite his efforts, it seemed that none of the journalists who attended the
briefing came away convinced. As far as the media was concerned, the British
hong was clearly the loser. After four years of highly-charged political
wrangling between the British and Chinese, Jardine's participation has been
reduced from a lead role in a new terminal to a secondary stake in a
restructured consortium which will take over two existing berths at CT8. The
group gets no part at all in CT9.

Optimists say, however, that the two berths will ensure that Jardine still has
a role in the thriving port business here. Also, Hongkong finally gets to
expand its port capacity and the government can now move on to tendering CT10
and CT11.

As for China, it now badly needs to show the world that the impasse over CT9
was an isolated case and no such wrangling will happen again in future
"commercial" deals.

Do we see a show of hands?

SembCorp may inject transport and logistics into SML / Sembawang
Corporation, Sembawang Maritime, SML

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Rahita Elias

[SINGAPORE] Sembawang Corp (SembCorp) has confirmed that it is considering
transferring some of its transport and logistics (T&L) businesses into
takeover target Sembawang Maritime Ltd (SML). This was revealed in SembCorp's
offer document to SML issued over the weekend.

"In line with the on-going restructuring of the SembCorp group's business
activities into five business groups, SembCorp may consider transferring
certain transportation and logistics businesses held by other companies within
the SembCorp group into SML."

SembCorp T&L president Billy Lee, who is also president of SML, told BT
earlier that the T&L division would be placed under one entity but declined to
name the umbrella company. Market watchers had speculated that SML would be
that entity.

SembCorp also said in its offer document that SembCorp, which owned 35.8 per
cent of SML's issued and paid-up capital as at Sep 16, may transfer some of
SML's business outside the transportation and logistics field to other
companies within the group. Such businesses could include the shiprepair
business.

Its voluntary conditional offer for SML will close on Oct 14, 1996, at 3.30pm.

Electronics : fall in export growth

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

Column:  Eye on the Economy

By Genevieve Cua

Trade

GROWTH of domestic exports of the top three electronics items slowed
considerably in August, with the key disk drives segment expanding just 7.9
per cent after growth of as much as 50 per cent in January.

Integrated circuits made its worst showing this year with a year-on-year
contraction of nearly 18 per cent. Manufacturers exported $748 million worth
of ICs, compared to $912 million last year.

Data processing components and peripherals slipped 1.1 per cent, after a 20
per cent rise in January. The three items accounted for about 35 per cent of
August's non-oil domestic exports.

The latest trade figures released last Friday showed a worse-than-expected
fall in non-oil domestic exports of 6.3 per cent in nominal terms, and
detailed data on the major electronics items reflect manufacturers' woes.

HG Asia economist Song Seng Wun said: "The hard disk drive segment is showing
some stability but the semiconductor segment is under a heavy cloud. Product
prices are falling..."

He said checks on the local industry revealed a pick-up in orders ahead of
Christmas. "But these are hopeful purchases. Should there be signs of
inventory piling up again and weak sales, customers will turn around and
cancel orders."

"People are placing orders in anticipation of being able to flog them ahead of
Christmas, but if the US numbers remain depressed and demand is weak from
Europe, those orders will be cancelled," he said.

He said month-on-month numbers might look encouraging, but year-on-year
numbers were not.

"You're seeing the sharp impact of the decline in product prices."

In the personal computer segment, he said demand was growing by 20 per cent
while supply was rising by between 40 per cent and 50 per cent. "Something has
to give."

Economists expect the slowdown to last until the first quarter of 1997.

MIT to build integrated system to speed up production for chip firms /
Manufacturing Integration Technology Pte Ltd

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Clarissa Tan

MANUFACTURING Integration Technology (MIT) will be making life simpler for the
electronics industry.

The company intends to build an integrated system that will speed up the
manufacturing process for semiconductor companies, as well as allow
manufacturers to meet customer demands with greater accuracy.

"The integrated system will basically cut the time needed for the
manufacturing process," said MIT managing director Tony Kwong.

"The system does in half a day what others now do in six or seven.

"Also, at the packaging end, the system is an intelligent one and can place in
each package the exact amount that the customer requires."

Mr Kwong feels that this will help the related electronics industry to avoid
problems such as oversupply and the consequent fall in prices for electronics
goods.

When completed in about one and a half to two year's time, MIT's automated,
integrated system for semiconductor processing will be the first in South-east
Asia. The project, called the Fully Automated EOL Process, is being helped by
the Economic Development Board which has given MIT a $1.5 million grant.

Semiconductor firms need processing equipment at various stages of
manufacturing, such as testing, laser marking and packing. What MIT will do is
to integrate all these processes into one automated system. It will also
reduce labour.

Incorporated in 1992, MIT designs and builds processing equipment for
semiconductor firms. A family-owned company, it intends to be listed by
end-1998 or early-1999. Turnover for the company has been doubling every year
until this year, when it rose 20-30 per cent due to the slowdown in
electronics sector. Mr Kwong, expects turnover to start doubling again in the
next year.

Academic defends tender system: Housing cost not up as much as property
prices

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Chuang Peck Ming

EXCESSIVE demand, not the tender system, is the culprit that has pushed up
property prices in recent years, academic Jennifer Mao told the Cost Review
Committee on Friday.

"It is an over-demand problem," she said, fuelled by the opening of the HDB
resale market and the liberalisation of HDB and CPF for the purchase of
properties.

The tender system is only used as a convenient scapegoat by its critics, said
Ms Mao, a lecturer from the Department of Finance and Banking at the National
University of Singapore. "If the tender system is not used, whatever other
mechanism employed will be similarly blamed."

The tender system, she said, is superior to any other system to determine
prices -- especially when the true or fair value of land is hard to assess.

Ms Mao also defended the government's high reserve price in tendering out
land. "As the land belongs to all Singaporeans collectively, it is the
government's responsibility to capture as much as possible the full economic
value of the land," she said.

Housing cost not up as much as property prices: Academic defends tender
system

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Chuang Peck Ming

Chief statistician: consumption and investment distinct

THE cost of accommodation for home owners has not increased as much as the big
jumps in property prices would suggest, said government chief statistician
Paul Cheung on Friday.

His submission to a Cost Review Committee hearing, embargoed to be released
today, showed that the proxy measure of changes in housing cost -the annual
assessed value (AAV) estimated by the Chief Valuer of the Inland Revenue
Authority of Singapore -rose by single-digit figures, and not the double-digit
rises witnessed in the property market in recent years.

He said: "The owner-occupied housing sub-index (of the Consumer Price Index)
has increased by 5.1 per cent between 1992 and 1993 and 0.9 per cent during
1993-95. However, it declined by 0.2 per cent during January-June 1996."

A distinction has to be made between consumption and investment when the
buying price of a house or flat is considered, said Dr Cheung. The CPI, which
tracks price changes in consumption, is only interested in the shelter service
that is consumed. It does not take into consideration the house or flat as an
asset which can be sold for capital gains. Ordinarily, the CPI needs only to
track the changes in rentals to get a measure of the price changes in
accommodation, or user cost. But since most Singaporeans are owner-occupiers,
the rentals have to be imputed. And the AAV provides the best imputation. "The
rental equivalence approach for treatment of owner-occupied housing is
conceptually and methodologically sound," he said. "The same approach is
adopted in the compilation of national accounts statistics."

Electronics slump hits Singapore most : report

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Anna Teo

AMONG the region's economies, Singapore has probably been the hardest hit by
the global electronics slump, says Consensus Economics Inc, noting that the
average 1996 growth forecast had been cut to 7.4 per cent from 8.5 per cent in
the last two months.

The London-based firm's latest gross domestic product (GDP) growth average is
derived from 17 forecasters in early September, including NatWest Markets
which heads the list with an 8.5 per cent projection.

But NatWest has since sliced its 1996 Singapore growth forecast to 7 per cent,
which brings the Consensus Economics average down to 7.3 per cent.

A separate BT list of 19 GDP growth forecasts for 1996, ranging from J P
Morgan's 6 per cent to Nomura Research Institute's 7.6 per cent, produces an
average of 7.1 per cent.

Consensus Economics polls financial and economic forecasters around the world
every month for their estimates of key variables.

Its findings for Singapore show a GDP growth average of 5.3 per cent in the
third quarter (compared to a BT average of 4.6 per cent) and 6.4 per cent in
the fourth quarter (BT average: 6.1 per cent).

Manufacturing growth is expected to reach a trough of 4.5 per cent in the
third quarter this year, according to Consensus Economics' poll.

"Consumer sentiment, and thus spending, has also been badly affected by the
subsequent job-cutting in the manufacturing sector," it says, noting the
sluggish consumer demand reflected in weak retail sales.

Retail sales grew about 2.9 per cent over the first half of the year, and 4.3
per cent in July. The poor retail performance has reduced price pressures,
with inflation below 1.5 per cent in the last few months.

The government remains on course to reach its year-end inflation target of 1.5
per cent, says Consensus Economics.

But while most of Singapore's recent indicators show signs of an economic
slowdown, investment growth remains strong, rising by 23 per cent in the
second quarter. This has been reflected in an upward revision to the consensus
investment forecast to 11.9 per cent for 1996.

Boosted by robust investment growth, GDP growth is expected to recover by the
second quarter of 1997, says Consensus Economics.

[KUALA LUMPUR] Leader Universal Holdings Bhd has proposed to issue up to
US$125 million (S$175 million) Euro bonds to take advantage of its
substantially lower interest cost over local bank financing.

Commerce International Merchant Bankers Bhd said in a statement on behalf of
Leader Universal that proceeds from the issue would be used to repay bank
borrowings, additional investment in subsidiaries and the settlement of
expenses for the proposed exercise. The bonds will mature in seven years.

The proposed issue is not expected to have any effect on the company's net
tangible assets per share and earnings until such time when the bonds are
converted.

Inchcape first-half profit down 23% to $24m / Inchape Bhd

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Rahita Elias

Decline due mainly to loss of contribution from Rolex

[SINGAPORE] Inchcape Berhad's net profit fell 23 per cent to $23.8 million for
the six months to June 30, 1996.

The trading firm said over the weekend that the loss of contribution from
Rolex Singapore Pte Ltd was the main reason for the fall. A 47 per cent rise
in interest expense to $4.4 million also dragged down its interim performance.

The fall was offset partially by a 29 per cent decline in taxes to $11.4
million.

Earnings per share (EPS) fell 23 per cent to 14.5 cents. Analysts polled by
The Estimate Directory have pegged Inchcape's full-year EPS at 30.7 cents,
down 14 per cent.

Group turnover was down 2 per cent to $643.8 million.

Profit before interest dropped 5 per cent to $39.3 million. This included
contributions from associates.

Of the total, its "motors business stream" generated some $21.1 million -down
25 per cent year-on-year.

The "marketing business stream" fared better with profit rising 61 per cent to
$8.4 million. Its consumer division did particularly well, with profit
tripling to $6.4 million. It had benefited from the rationalisation of loss
makers last year and the disposal of the office automation business.

Meanwhile, Inchcape's shipping business incurred a loss of $200,000 compared
to a $200,000 profit in the same period last year.

Its financial services business saw profit before interest rose 25 per cent to
$9.5 million. IRB Finance, which mainly finances retail car purchases in
Brunei, had benefited from the higher value of car sales financed.

Directors declared an interim dividend of 10 cents per share before tax,
unchanged from the same period last year.

On current year prospects, they said the second half would be a challenging
time for the group, especially in the motor industry. "Notwithstanding that,
(we) believe that, excluding the discontinued Rolex business, the group will
be able to maintain a similar level of profit as in 1995."

State-owned BNI's IPO on track / Bank Negara Indonesia, BNI

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By S N Vasuki in Jakarta

Bank's massive float next month seen bringing investors back into market

STATE-OWNED Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) has filed a registration statement
with Indonesian regulators, paving the way for its massive initial public
offer next month. BNI is the first state-owned bank to be privatised in
Indonesia.

The bank said over the weekend that it would float 25 per cent of its paid-up
capital in the IPO and is awaiting formal approval from the Indonesian Capital
Markets Supervisory Agency (Bapepam).

Analysts had earlier speculated that the size of the issue would be around one
trillion rupiah (S$608 million) with market capitalisation of four trillion
rupiah.

BNI shares will be listed on the Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges though
the bank said that it is also open to international investors. The IPO will be
underwritten by Danareksa Securitas while Lehman Brothers will act as the
international adviser.

The BNI issue comes at a time when sentiment on the local stock market has
turned bearish. Foreign investors, who dominate trading on the Jakarta bourse,
have pulled out of the market over political succession concerns.

The July 27 riots that rocked Jakarta have further eroded confidence.

Not surprisingly, this has not been a particularly good year for IPOs.
Analysts have revised downwards earlier estimates of US$1.5 billion (S$2.11
billion) being raised through new offerings in 1996. Nevertheless, the BNI
offer is expected to bring investors back into the market.

The BNI issue will be the only Indonesian state-owned firm to go public in
1996. Besides BNI, the government originally had ambitious plans to float
three other state firms this year.

These are toll-road operator PT Jasa Marga, steel firm Krakatau Steel and
international carrier Garuda Indonesia. But the flotations have been delayed
because of international perception that these state firms are not performing
well and hence the government would not be able to set an attractive price.

BNI, which is the largest of Indonesia's seven state-owned banks, is also the
healthiest. At end-June, the bank had assets of 32 trillion rupiah and
reported revenue of 17 trillion rupiah.

The bank said that between 1993 and 1995 its net earnings rose from 245
billion rupiah to 378.7 billion rupiah. BNI has a capital adequacy ratio of
9.1 per cent and a loan-deposit ratio of 86.3 per cent.

BNI proposes to use the IPO proceeds to fund its investment and development
programme. The bank operates 489 branches in Indonesia and six overseas. Its
core business is corporate and retail banking.

Extending trading net into retail / EasyKnit International Holdings Ltd

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Quak Hiang Whai in Hongkong

COMPANY VISIT EasyKnit Int'l Holdings

Easyknit defies narrow margins and competition to launch its own fashion brand

AT A time when many garment retailers are facing intense competition and
narrowing margins, Matthew Koon is doing what some analysts here would imagine
to be the unthinkable -launching his own fashion brand name and chain of
retail stores in the region.

The founder of listed Easyknit International Holdings is also planning for a
secondary listing in Singapore to help finance his new venture.

About 80 million shares or 20 per cent of the existing capital would be
issued. The Singa pore offer is expected within the next two weeks. Analysts
expect the company to raise up to HK$250 million (S$46 million) from the
issue.

The funds will help Easyknit develop its own fashion brand name, Library. The
company plans to open 10 Library outlets here by the first quarter of next
year, before penetrating Taiwan and China's markets.

Mr Koon says: "We have a very strong design team and we have a very strong
supplier network. We can offer many styles at lower costs."

In fact, much of Easyknit's success in recent years had been attributed to the
group's unusual relationship with its 16 or so suppliers. Years ago, Mr Koon
parcelled out production functions to his employees and helped them set up
their own businesses.

Now they are his suppliers, helping him to source for cheap materials from
around the world while he focuses on expanding his export markets.

"I lent them money and now I'm taking my money back. Some are my long-time
friends. Some are my ex-employees," said Mr Koon.

"They only concentrate on working for me. We both make money together. My
material costs are about 10 per cent lower than my competitors."

Easyknit's links with its suppliers are further stamped by exclusive contracts
which last for 10 years each.

Mr Koon, who won the Young Entrepreneur of the Year award in 1994, employs a
small number of staff compared to his listed rivals. Easyknit has only about
70 employees, dealing in marketing and merchandising. Still, turnover for the
year ended March 31, 1996 came to HK$1.2 billion and net profit, HK$104.6
million.

In comparison, Glorious Sun Enterprise, which employs more than 1,000 people,
has a turnover of about HK$1.6 billion.

Mr Koon is confident that the new retail business would be profitable by the
first year. "It is because we don't keep inventories. We don't do the
production. We can test market first and then we make bulk orders. We don't
get stuck with inventories."

Besides going into the retail business, the company is also expected to
generate property income from its investment in a new building.

Easyknit recently bought a plot of land and is developing its new 27-floor
headquarters on the Cheung Sha Wan site in Kowloon. The property investment
will help to diversify its earnings base from 1998.

The recent diversification into retail and property has gone down well with
analysts. Analysts expect the company's rental income to hit HK$10 million a
year and the retail business to contribute about 20 per cent of turnover from
next year.

As for its core trading business, the company will continue to enjoy low
material costs, quick turnaround times and strong profit margins, thanks to
its exclusive contracts with suppliers in low cost countries such as
Indonesia, China and Honduras.

Analysts expect Easyknit's net profit to grow by at least 20 per cent in the
current year to about HK$146 million and to HK$174 million in the following
year.

GIC, DBS Land among S'pore groups vying for HK$7b project

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Quak Hiang Whai in Hongkong

SINGAPORE's interest in Hongkong's real estate market remains unabated as
several of the republic's biggest property groups joined in the territory's
latest land tender for a HK$7 billion (S$1.3 billion) airport-railway station
property project.

At the close of the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) tender on Friday,
the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), the Hong Leong Group
and DBS Land were among the over 30 companies which formed 12 consortiums to
bid for the second phase of the Tung Chung MTRC project.

With previous MTRC tenders attracting only five to six consortiums each, the
latest tender for Tung Chung will be the hottest contest ever for an MTR site.
The Tung Chung site is the first station linked to the proposed airport at
Chek Lap Kok island.

Hong Leong and GIC, which were unsuccessful for the prestigious HK$40 billion
Central MTR tender earlier this year, joined Hongkong China and HKR
International for the contest.

DBS Land, which has teamed up with Ng Teng Fong's Sino Land for several
Hongkong property projects, was part of the consortium which includes Sino
Land, Tai Cheung Holdings and Great Eagle Holdings.

Last year, DBS Land joined the winning consortium led by Sino Land for the
HK$12 billion Tai Kok Tsui MTR mixed project. DBS Land is expected to join
Sino Land for phase three of the same project.

The MTRC has so far awarded six contracts along the airport railway line,
including phase one of the HK$70 billion Kowloon project which was won by a
Singapore-dominated consortium. That consortium was led by the Wing Tai Group
with participation from Singapore Land, Straits Steamship Land and Temasek
Holdings. Property developers like airport railway projects because of the
mixed features and proximity to the railway line.

Analysts say the record numbers of bids for the second phase of Tung Chung
project reflects the reviving bullish sentiment in the Hongkong residential
property market. Analysts also attributed the strong response to the smaller
size of the development.

East Asian gold demand slumped in first half

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Neil Behrmann in London

Consultancy says China leads region in falling demand

GOLD demand in East Asia, particularly China, slumped in the first half of the
year, according to a London-based consultant.

Gold Fields Mineral Services, a respected and well-connected consultancy,
estimated that fabrication demand from East Asia, including Japan, slid to 485
tons in the first six months of the year from 572 tons in the same period in
1995.

Consumption in China contracted to only 69 tons from 128 tons in the same
period. Hoarding of gold in East Asia shrank to 61 tons from 140 tons and in
China the amount was only two tons in the first half, compared with 13 tons in
the same 1995 time-frame.

In the early part of the year when gold touched a year-high of US$418 an
ounce, there was resistance to higher prices, the consultant said.

"But China's slump in gold purchases is also the result of a prolonged
austerity campaign, the stabilisation of the currency and a growing preference
for jewellery set with diamonds and other gems," said Stewart Murray, chief
executive of Gold Fields Mineral Services.

In contrast, Middle Eastern gold jewellery consumption and hoarding, jumped to
271 tons in the first six months from 230 tons the previous year. Consumption
and hoarding in India rose to 321 tons from 296 tons and good weather for
farmers points to a continuation of this trend, forecast Mr Murray.

Despite a sound market in the Indian sub continent and the Middle East, global
gold demand fell 8.3 per cent to 1,727 tons in the six months to end-June
1996. In the major European nations, spending on gold jewellery fell because
of a worsening economic climate and rising unemployment. Gold prices,
presently languishing around US$383 an ounce, down 8 per cent from their
January peaks, have also fallen because of an increase in supply.

Year-on-year global mine production rose 3.2 per cent to 1,120 tons in the
first of the year and gold scrap recycling by 15 per cent to 338 tons.
Disenchanted investors who had bought at high prices in 1995 and early 1996
off-loaded 160 tons between February and the end of June.

Central bank sales dipped to 108 tons in the first half of 1996 from 196 tons
in 1995, but the timing of the supplies contributed to the market depression.
Mr Murray said he believed there were secret sales over and above this amount.

He expects gold consumption to improve in the coming months ahead of Christmas
and Chinese New Year in late January. Yet, the price will only rise if there
is lower producer and central bank sales. The market is uncertain about the
psychological impact of potential International Monetary Fund sales of 155
tons.

Fed seen staying its hand

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

Column:  Simex Weekly Roundup

By Collum Henderson

Interest rate differentials still hold key to strength of greenback

[SINGAPORE] Will they or won't they? It's definitely a close call. On balance,
however, MMS expects the Fed to continue to stay its hand -the Reuters story
notwithstanding.

Fed governors have proved less hawkish this time than their regional Fed
colleagues and are notably more reluctant to simply fight growth, particularly
when inflationary pressures remain very muted.

Granted, the Philly Fed price component rise is a concern, but the latest
Producer Price Index, and more importantly Consumer Price Index, data suggest
that there continues to be no inflation problem as yet.

Some might see the upcoming US presidential election as an obstacle to any Fed
tightening. However there is surely no question that Alan Greenspan would hike
now if he thought it was warranted, whether or not he was ever invited to sit
next to Hillary again.

We expect steady Fed policy this week -followed by a 50 basis point tightening
at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting just after the election.
So what does this mean for the US dollar?

The forex market is pricing in a Fed tightening this week, resulting in the
dollar trading higher. No Fed rate hike means the US dollar is likely to see
those gains eroded very quickly.

The Fed statement, if there is any, will be important. Going forward, the key
will be consequent rate expectations -the dollar will not suffer as much if
the market continues to expect the Fed to hike.

Interest rate differentials, rather than trade fundamentals, remain the key
for now. Near term, we do not expect any change in the official interest rate
differential between the US, and Germany and Japan. Thus, the dollar should
soften near term from here.

Aside from the FOMC, we have a full slate of data this week. First off, today,
is the Italian September CPI data. Though most attention is focused on
government attempts to bring forward a credible 1997 budget, this data should
confirm that inflationary pressures in Italy are continuing to decline
-leaving the Bank of Italy room after the budget to ease rates further.

German COL and Import Price data for September and August respectively is due
tomorrow. MMS expects these to show price pressures remaining equally muted in
Germany.

Also coming out tomorrow is the UK's Q2 Gross Domestic Product data. The
market has already priced in steady Bank of England policy from here given the
extent of the rebound.

solicitation to invest in any currency or Simex product.

THE KL Second Board is now at dangerously high levels and if it cracks,
speculative money will channel itself into other areas. One prime candidate is
of course the KL main board, so it might make sense for punters to quietly

One possibility is the Johan 1999 warrant which is also traded

and at M$1.01 per warrant, this works out to 55 per cent. Gearing is slightly
above average at 2.24 times and the instrument has about 28 months left to
run.

To be honest, the numbers are not convincing as a 55 per cent premium for time
is a lot to pay for. But the stock is way off its 52-week high of M$3.28, it
has proven in the past to be a favourite among punters and the warrant is
cheap in absolute terms. If the Second Board does undergo its much needed
correction, this warrant could benefit. -By R Sivanithy

All eyes likely to remain on KLSE's Second Board

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By R Sivanithy

Liquidity in S'pore stocks improving but sobering trade figures will rein in
further rises

STOCK MARKET COMMENTARY

[SINGAPORE] Anyone who raised the possibility at the start of the year that
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Second Board would be occupied by
billion-ringgit companies before the year-end would probably have been scoffed
at.

Not now, of course. Not when the Second Board Index has more than doubled and
it's hosting two counters that have crossed the M$100 level.

Last week, the index set four record highs and, as usual, dominated the market
-more than M$1 billion was traded daily, which is significantly more than the
$325.71 million average chalked up by the entire local market comprising the
main board, Clob and Sesdaq.

Brokers here tell of harrowing sessions every day as excited clients, lured by
the double-digit gains, call constantly to place huge orders, for which few
actually have the funds to pay. One stressed dealer at a foreign brokerage
said: "Clients buy in the morning, sell before lunch and buy again after
lunch. This goes on throughout the day, and all in minimum lots of
30,000-50,000 and all on a contra basis. I've actually had to talk them out of
some trades."

If retail punters here are minting money on the Second Board, then imagine
what the impact has been on the personal wealth of some of the people who own
significant stakes in Second Board companies. Take, for instance, Wan Adli Wan
Ibrahim, a relatively unknown Berjaya group executive director who currently
chairs two Second Board companies, Transwater and Bridgecon.

Having just bought 50.84 per cent of Transwater's capital for M$15 per share
or M$99.1 million last month, Mr Wan Adli's stake is now worth M$100 per
share, or about M$661 million. On paper, he is sitting on M$561.82 million of
profit.

As for Bridgecon, he raised his stake to 20 per cent just before the shares
were suspended last week. The stock jumped 68 per cent to M$32 when trading
resumed on Friday. Wan Adli's stake is now worth M$127.68 million, bringing
the combined value of his Transwater and Bridgecon shares to M$788.68 million.

Along the way, Transwater said it had submitted a M$1.1 billion bid to the
government to rebuild the Johor-Singapore Causeway, while Bridgecon announced
an increase in its rights issue, an acquisition of land costing M$463 million,
and an acquisition of its shares by SAP Holdings managing director Raduan
Taib, who bought a 36 per cent stake at M$20 per share. Both Wan Adli and Mr
Raduan have Vincent Tan's Berjaya Group to thank for their instant wealth --
the conglomerate is believed to be the main contender for the Causeway's
reconstruction and is the party which sold the land to Bridgecon.

Transwater, whose shares traded at M$5 last November and M$15 in August, is
now capitalised at about M$1.3 billion. No doubt if Bridgecon continues to
make similarly exciting announcements as it did last week, it too will join
Transwater in the billion-ringgit club.

The Second Board, no doubt, will continue to dominate trading but it is
uncertain which direction it would take. Most analysts are now calling for a
long overdue correction and hopefully, when this happens, it won't be too
painful for those involved.

As for the local market, it would be unfair to say that interest is
non-existent as liquidity has improved. However, although the Straits Times
Industrials Index managed to break 2,200 during the week, its inability to
hold onto its gains and Friday's sobering trade figures will probably rein in
any further rises.

On the external front, the US Federal Reserve meets tomorrow for its regular
interest rate meeting. The long bond yield on Friday was largely unchanged at
7.05 per cent, suggesting that any forthcoming rate hike has already been
factored into prices.

According to NatWest Markets, the market has "already priced in a rate hike of
25 basis points and should not encounter a substantial gyration even if the
Fed were to raise rates. A major surprise would be a larger hike, say 50 basis
points, or "rate inaction".

Whether or not the Fed acts or not remains to be seen. Meanwhile, all eyes
will still be on the Second Board.

Banking reforms end era of profligacy: Uncertain future for Laotian
T-bonds

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Harish Mehta

[SINGAPORE] Before 1976, Lao guerillas ran their own parallel economy. The
zone, controlled by guerillas of the Lao Patriotic Front, had its own
currency, and its own mechanism for distributing money in provinces it
occupied.

The zone under the US-leaning Vientiane government consisted of a central
bank, and six private banks.

After liberation, the existing banks were nationalised by the Lao Patriotic
Front which committed the deadly mistake of consolidating all commercial
banking activities into the central bank, the National Bank of Laos.

Soon afterwards, the name of the central bank was changed to State Bank, and,
as its name suggested, the bank extended loans primarily to state firms, while
retaining the exclusive right to issue currency. The State Bank established a
network of 96 branches across the country. It was only in 1988 that autonomous
state-owned commercial banks were allowed to start.

When the late strongman Kaysone Phomvihane launched reforms under the New
Economic Mechanism the same year, the central bank was restructured into a new
entity, the Bank of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and a two-tier
banking system introduced to separate central banking from commercial
functions.

First signs that the government would relax entry rules for foreign banks came
with the establishment of a semi-private bank in 1989 in which both the state
and private firms held shares.

These reforms put an end to an era of profligacy when state firms had
unfettered access to central bank funds at negative interest rates. The
government, for the first time, in 1991 introduced minimum and maximum
interest rates. Interest rate controls were scrapped in mid-1993. The only
controls left were a minimum savings deposit rate, and a maximum lending rate.

It was the reformed banking sector that introduced bonds and T-Bills. Now with
Laos set to join Asean, it has set its sights on issuing long-term bonds.

Uncertain future for Laotian T-bonds: Banking reforms end era of
profligacy

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Harish Mehta

Inflation deflates euphoria that came with launch of short-term bonds in 1991

[SINGAPORE] WHEN Laos launched its first government bonds five years ago,
residents of the capital, Vientiane, were delighted by the novelty of earning
interest at double-digit rates.

The euphoria accompanying the introduction of short-term bonds in 1991 is
over. Bond issues have been hit since last year because inflation runs at more
than 19 per cent.

Things are just as bad this year. As a result, the government has stopped
issuing long-term bonds. For now, it offers only six-month bonds that earn
half-yearly interest of about 10 per cent.

Laotians venture into the bond market as their kip-deposits in banks earn
lower annual interest of 16 per cent. But even so, interest gains are being
wiped out by inflation. Many Laotians, in the days of single-digit inflation
in 1994, were able to save a small part of their salary, and happily parked
what they saved in short-term bonds. But since last year, as prices of
essential goods rose, the choices for the man on the street, with an average
annual income of US$331 (S$463), were clear: food came before all else.

Sharp price rises between March and September last year triggered substantial
depreciation of the kip, which lost about 27 per cent of its value as the
currency plunged to about 1,000 to the US dollar in September last year from
734 six months earlier.

Pany Yathotou, the governor of the Bank of the Lao People's Democratic
Republic (PDR), the central bank, said: "When inflation was low, even
foreigners bought bonds through their relatives living in Laos. But with
higher inflation, they're not buying them anymore."

Bonds issued by the central bank and the Ministry of Finance look like a cash
certificate, and come in a maximum denomination of 10 million kips (about
US$10,520).

Laotians fret about three issues -the climbing rate of inflation, constant
danger of kip devaluation, and the lack of a secondary market.

So kips are often converted into Laotians' favourite currencies -US dollar and
Thai baht.

Although the future of bonds is hobbled by a lack of a secondary market, Ms
Pany said bond holders could redeem them at the central bank.

Her predecessor, Bousbong Souvannavong, said before a secondary market could
be created, it was necessary for the central bank to issue sufficient paper in
the primary market. "Once the market is sufficiently liquid, will it make
sense to talk of a market price," he added.

Until a secondary market can develop, Laotians will have limited opportunities
of converting their bonds into cash.

Mr Bousbong said the underdeveloped state of the financial markets was due to
errors of the recent past. The government handed over the power to issue
currency to the governor of the central bank as late as in 1990. That ended a
period when the government extended interest-free loans to state companies.

Laotian bonds also have a strategic difference from bonds issued by other
developing countries: the Bank of Lao PDR issues bonds as a monetary
instrument to mop up excess liquidity in the economy, not to raise capital.

"For infrastructure development we would need a long-term maturity of bonds,"
Ms Pany said, "but we have issued only short-term bonds."

Three years after the bonds came on the market, the Laotian Ministry of
Finance began issuing Treasury bills to soak up a very liquid economy. The
first auction took place in March 1994, and auctions of one billion kip are
held once every two weeks.

The government now needs bonds and T-bills more than ever as the threat of
inflation is growing, and the economy is skidding.

Mr Bousbong explained that since Laos introduced financial reforms in 1988,
one of the main objectives was to "curtail liquidity expansion that had
resulted from the easy access state-owned enterprises had to bank credit at
negative interest rates". To tackle the crisis, the government adopted a
positive interest rate policy in August 1989. It ensured interest rates would
be higher than the inflation rate, lending rates higher than deposit rates,
and long-term rates higher than short-term rates.

In time, the central bank will be compelled to create a variety of riskier
instruments such as corporate bonds and equities. Perhaps, the electricity and
water utilities should be encouraged to issue their own paper. A next logical
step would be the creation of financial institutions such as pension funds and
insurance firms.

ShipRepair 96 : a chance to find out what competitors are doing

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

Column:  Dockyard

By David Hughes

THIS time of the year is always marked by a flurry of conferences, conventions
and exhibitions. This year is no exception with the normal northern autumn
crop of events, on everything from Ship's Agency and Crime at Sea to Arresting
Ships.

Being somewhat the Cinderella of the shipping industry, despite its crucial
importance, there is not much of interest to the repair and conversion sector.
But it does have one annual gathering, at London's Olympia, in early November.
The organisers of ShipRepair & Conversion 96 have just put out the publicity
for the two-day conference and exhibition.

Once again Alan Thorpe and Ronald Sim have put together a well thought-out
programme. The conference covers a wide range of topical issues, though with
perhaps some emphasis on tankers and dry bulk carriers.

The conference, as ever, tackles a mixture of technical and commercial
subjects.

The first session looks at something that ought to be dear to every yard
managers' heart, money. The initial paper looks at how repairers can help
themselves by getting contracts right to start with. Solicitor Mike Lax,
partner with UK law firm Lawrence Graham, provides "A Practical and Legal
Guide to Enforcement under Shiprepair Contracts".

There will be more than enough to keep those who go to ShipRepair mainly for
its technical content happy. The only reservation in this regard is that the
organisers make use of "technical workshops" which take place in parallel with
the presentation of the main papers on both mornings.

Having more than one presentation at a time has its drawbacks. Firstly it
assumes that people interested in, for example, listening to a paper on
Pollution-free Sterntube Seals will not be just as keen to attend the
presentation on Planning for Special Surveys.

To be fair, the organisers have to weigh up all sorts of practical
considerations and still try to pack in as much as possible. Probably the main
problem is that two days is not really long enough to do justice to the
shiprepair and conversion industry.

And there is certainly is a terrific amount packed into this programme. But
most of the presentations are from representatives of European-based companies
and organisations.

There is, though, one Singapore-based speaker. Sigurd Gude, executive
vice-president of Kvaerner Ships Equipment, will be presenting Service
Agreements -Predictable Maintenance Cost True or False. Also from this region,
Hongkong United Dockyards managing director Chris Pooley will present The
Future of Hongkong's Repair Industry after 1997.

The European emphasis should not deter anybody from the Asia-Pacific region
from attending. This is the one annual opportunity to find out what
competitors are doing, and thinking, especially what they think about
competition from Asian yards.

ShipRepair ventures into the area of competition between the major
shiprepairing countries. On the first day there is a panel discussion on the
European shiprepair market. This focuses on competition within Europe and
particularly on the impact of the yards in what was the Eastern Bloc.

Polish yards already have a formidable reputation for cheaper steel repairs.
Now they are moving into technically more complicated areas. That worries the
repairers in western Europe, whose views should be well represented in the
debate.

The European yards are also worried by competition from this region for
conversion contracts. So the second day will see Peter Fetton from the UK's
A&P Group asking: "Is the European conversion industry competitive against the
Far East?"

Since Mr Fetton's paper is preceded by two about current FPSO conversions in
European yards, the answer to his question seems self-evident. After all
Singapore yards, for example, are not inexperienced with, or slow to bid for,
FPSO conversion work.

The reality is that much of the world's repair and conversion business is
subject to intense competition, driven by severe overcapacity, and winning
contracts depends on providing dependable quality at a keen price. That
applies wherever your yard happens to be.

Lumut port expects cargo volume to double

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

[KUALA LUMPUR] Lumut port in Perak has projected an 80-100 per cent increase
in cargo throughput to 600,000 tonnes by the end of this year from the level
achieved in its first year of operations which ended in July 1996.

Lumut Maritime Terminal (LMT) general manager Kwek Chee Wah said the projected
cargo handling for the port during July to December 1996 will be higher than
the 400,000 tonnes achieved during the one-year period (July 1995 to July
1996).

"Port operations took off after the second half-year (January-June 1996) of
its operations, with a 230 per cent increase in cargo handling to 295,170
tonnes as compared with the first half-year of business," he said recently.

Dry bulk cargo remains the principal cargo type handled, with 190,010 tonnes
or 64 per cent of the total volume handled during January-June.

The port also handled 99,760 tonnes of breakbulk cargo such as iron and steel,
project cargo, asbestos and hydrated lime which made up 34 per cent of total
throughput.

Mr Kwek said the port's growth reflects the users' growing confidence and the
increasing number of manufacturing industries in Perak.

He reiterated that Lumut port is not competing against Port Klang or Penang
port for cargo but will play a complementary role.

LMT is owned by Perak Development Corp and Halim Rasip Holdings Sdn Bhd, each
holding a 30 per cent stake, and Ipco International, 40 per cent. -MBT

Apply aviation's approach to safety, conference told

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Felix Chan

MARTECH '96

Speaker urges pro-active investments in accident prevention

[SINGAPORE] The aviation industry's emphasis on proactive investments in
accident prevention as opposed to reactive investments in accident cost
reduction should also be applied to shipping, delegates at the Martech '96
conference were told.

Speaking on the final day of the international conference on Maritime Safety
and Environmental Protection, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
professor E G Frankel said that emphasis should be placed on a limited number
of important maritime issues, instead of casting the "current wide net" of
largely unimportant regulations which dilute the effectiveness of existing
regulations.

Many of the existing regulations address mainly short-term effects or isolated
incidents and are more oriented to publicity and political gain than longer
term improvements in maritime safety and environmental protection, he noted.

He also noted that although the world's maritime community agreed to adopt
certain safety and environmental protection agreements, and introduced port
state control as an enforcing mechanism, the resultant enforcement is
generally quite "lax or non-existent".

"Differential enforcement of international conventions is self-degrading as
ships always gravitate to the flag of lowest enforcement," he told delegates
at the conference on Friday.

Prof Frankel stressed the need for an institution that could act like a world
maritime court with enforcement powers -something akin to a "worldwide UN
coast guard".

"Ocean shipping is an international industry and ships in international waters
should be accountable to international conventions independent of their
national laws. National sovereignty should not extend beyond national
borders," he added.

Other speakers on the final day of the conference include Lloyd's Register of
Shipping's deputy chief surveyor JM Ferguson, who spoke on bulk carrier
safety; and ABS Pacific Singapore's head of safety and environment system
certification R N Chandha, who spoke about auditing to ISM.

Joint bunker venture all set to go / KMP Coastal Oil Pte Ltd, M Zain Wakil
Penghantaran Sdn Bhd

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Yong Mei Fong

KMP Coastal Oil and M Zain Wakil Penghantaran waiting for licence

[SINGAPORE] A bunkering joint-venture between Singapore operator KMP Coastal
Oil Pte Ltd and Malaysian freight forwarding company M Zain Wakil Penghantaran
Sdn Bhd is now awaiting the final step -a licence -before starting to supply
bunkers in Port Klang.

KMP Coastal Oil, a major bunker operator in Singapore handling about one
million tonnes of bunkers a year, holds a 40 per cent stake in the
joint-venture set-up Straits Energy Sdn Bhd.

Its Port-Klang based partner holds the majority share of 60 per cent through
its subsidiary, Fasa Prestij Sdn Bhd.

According to M Zain Wakil Penghantaran director Jason Goh, the joint-venture
company has an initial paid-up capital of M$100,000 (S$56,290). He said the
new company was expected to start operations in the first quarter of next
year.

When licensed, Straits Energy will be among the small handful of about eight
approved operators in the port, of whom only about two are said to be active.

Currently, the volume of bunkers lifted in Malaysia is low, at an estimated
volume of about 200,000 tonnes last year.

Industry sources say because of customs duty imposed on bunkers for ships
plying the domestic trade, Malaysian shipping lines found it uneconomical to
lift bunkers at home and turned to Singapore for their needs.

However, the Malaysian government recently abolished bunker taxes, as part of
an incentive package to promote Port Klang as a cargo load centre. With the
tax lift-off, more shipowners are expected to take bunkers at Malaysian ports,
particularly Port Klang.

Port Klang spells out its policy on bunkering

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Yong Mei Fong

No intention to compete with S'pore, but it aims to cut price difference

[SINGAPORE] Despite what the industry says, Port Klang is not likely to be a
major bunker centre like Singapore, nor does it aim to compete with Singapore
on bunkering services, says M Rajasingam, general manager and chief executive
of Klang Port Authority (KPA).

"We have to develop the marine services here and our strategy is to see if we
can provide bunkers at prices which will not make ships calling here look for
another site," he told Shipping Times.

Convenience to the ship and costs were issues that the authority was tackling,
said Mr Rajasingam.

South Korea is already giving Singapore -currently the top bunkering port in
the world -a tough run for its money by offering lower bunker prices. Industry
players say Port Klang is a potential competitor too because it has been
attracting more international lines.

Disputing this, Mr Rajasingam said: "A lot of ships go to Singapore, not for
cargo handling but just for bunkering. I don't think Port Klang will be like
Singapore, a bunker centre, because of the differences in location."

Referring to the port's position next to the Straits of Malacca, he said: "The
sheltered water area is very limited. I don't think we can afford the luxury
of ships coming here just for bunkers."

Given this, the authority was in fact encouraging ships to take bunkers
outside the port limits, under the Malaysian Bunkering Procedure, which would
be issued soon, he said.

Mr Rajasingam also said that bunker prices at Port Klang -at about US$12
(S$16.90) to US$14 more per tonne than at Singapore -were a lot higher. He
hoped to narrow the difference.

"I am not even thinking of matching the price at Singapore, but to bring it
down to about US$3-US$4 more," he said.

"Though it may still be higher, it is better for the ship operator than having
to make an extra trip to another port for bunkers. This will keep the cost of
calling at Port Klang reasonable," he added.

Likewise, said Mr Rajasingam, Port Klang would also work at putting other
support services in place, such as ship chandling, supplies, water, shiprepair
and even professional services like banking and insurance.

Some of land along the port was already alloted by the government for
shipyards, he disclosed. "The idea is that we must provide services to ships
that will make the ship operator say that if I go to Port Klang, there will be
facilities that would take care of my needs."

Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Department of Ocean Engineering. Prof
Frankel will speak on the changing role and technology of intermodal
transportation.

authorities will discuss ways of improving the relationship between customs
and transporters.

Another subject to be covered during the event is infrastructure development
as a basis for effective intermodal growth.

Among the speakers is Tim Bismire, an associate with Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick
of Hongkong, who will cover the subject of regional port developments.

He will review Hongkong's container terminal and river trade terminal
development. He will also discuss the competition and cooperation that exist
between Singapore and Thailand.

The event will also explore the intermodal links that exist in South-east
Asia, North-east Asia and South-west Asia.

Richard D Barclay, executive vice-president of Asian Terminals Inc, will speak
on P&O's investments in the Philippines, while P T Indonesia Bulk Terminal's

VIETNAM: Profits low

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vietnam has 20 foreign banks with branch offices and 4 joint venture
banks.  Their average profit is around $350,000 each, a measely
figure even if it is double that of last year.  One bank, which the
State bank of Vietnam refused to identify, still hadn't made a profit
after four years of operations.  Foreign banks had raised their
share of loans to just over 15% but most still faced problems
loaning money to local firms because of "the inadequate legal
framework in Vietnam, unaudited accounting date and ... the poor
quality of credit information and risk evaluation."

VIETNAM: Beach sleaze

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vietnam's coastal resort town of Nha Trang has turned to sleaze to boost
its economy.  It has a thriving sex industry that is attracting
foreign tourists by the score.  Police may have been able to crack
down on beach-front gambling and to have broken the power of the
local mafia but paedophilia and drug addition remains prevalent.
Even waitresses in state-run restaurants have been known to offer
their services along with the bacon and eggs.  Much to the
amusement of foreign backpackers and the disgust of more elderly
tourists.

VIETNAM: Party cells

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

With only 82 Communist Party cells in some 1500 foreign-invested
enterprises, Hanoi obviously feels there is room for improvement.
It has announced a  policy to put party cells (its a vital
ingredient for business development', one official told incredulous
investors) in every foreign-invested enterprise, whether it be a
joint-venture or 100% foreign owned.

With Party rules clearly stating that a member's first priority is
to the Party, it is difficult to understand the Party's
general-secretary Do Muoi who commented that cells would be
`beneficial' to foreign investors.  The question foreigners want
answered is to whom the Party cells answer to, the Party or the
employer ?

VIETNAM: Short-changed

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

The Golden Hanoi Hotel is no longer golden.  The very group of
Vietnamese architects that had originally approved its design have
now forced a redesign that reduces its number of rooms by a third.
Instead of the planned 150 rooms, the hotel can only have 110.
This has boosted the room cost by 40% to $168,000.  In addition,
the overall profitability of the hotel is severely reduced.

If the Hongkong investors oppose the redesign (construction is well
in hand), too bad.  The entire project would then be `handed over'
(confiscated might be a better description) to the Hanoi People's
Committee.  They would `compensate fairly' the foreign partner.
But as `fair' means one thing to the Vietnamese and another to
foreigners, it is only fair to say that the Golden Hanoi Hotel
could well be an $18.5m write-off.

LAOS: Tourists wanted

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Laos has finally awoken to the power of the tourist dollar.  To
facilitate entry, Loas will now issue visas an arrival at its
Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai borders.  This reverses a longstanding
policy that enforced strict visa controls in an effort to keep out
budget tourists.  Some 300,000 tourists visited Laos this year and
the new visa policy is expected to boost this figure to 500,000 in
1997.

The hotel and tourism industry, with $393 million in foreign
investment since 1988, is the second largest sector for investment
after electricity generation.

VIETNAM: Overcost

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Cost-accounting takes on a whole new meaning in Vietnam if a government
project to upgrade Phan Thiet port is anything to go by.
Originally budgeted at $2.6m, it is now nearly three times that and
still climbing.  So drastic is the blow-out that Phan Thiet
authorities are paying contractors only 80% of their work, even if
they have completed 100% of their contract.  The Asian Development
Bank has been asked to cover the $2m projected shortfall to
complete the entire project.  But ADB has shown a marked reluctance
to get involved in a project which is simply running out of control.

MANILA: Ny listing?

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vietnam Motor Corporation (VMC), the aggressive Philippines backed
assembler of foreign auto's in Vietnam, plans to list it's shares on the
American Stock Exchange.  It is not known whether VMC is actually
making a profit (turnover since 1992 is only $90m in total on sales
of only 5500 odd cars) Bankers and fund managers believe that a
NASDAQ, Australian or Asian listing might be more appropriate for a
company from such a vulnerable market.

If VMC was able to list in America, it would mean more excitement
than success.  Smaller diversified companies with Vietnamese assets
listed in Australia and New Zealand have not fared well, and
competition in Vietnam's car market is fast heating up.

VIETNAM: Stay healthy

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hospital rates in Vietnam are going up, so much so that one could get a
heart attack just thinking about them.  The rate in a major Saigon
hospital is currently $130/day.  That includes a phone, TV and
air-conditioning.  But Swiss company, Ketone, is aiming to build
it's own hospital where patients would be charged $150/day.  The
difference in price is attributed to foreign doctors being paid
$10000 a month.  That's 300 times what a local doctor now receives.
 The message to expatriates in all these figures is that getting
sick in Vietnam will soon be too expensive to contemplate.

VIETNAM: Cloudy Windows

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Microsoft's introduction of a Vietnamese version of its Windows 95
program has resulted in somewhat cloudy results.  Because people in
the north describe technical terms differently from those in the
south there is no uniform technology for all users.  This has left
many users confused and grumbling over the product's $110 retail
price.  Apparently, Microsoft launched its Vietnamese Window
without first ironing out all the bugs.  It wanted the product in
place before launching its Vietnamese Windows 97.  Mircosoft has
got just that plus legions of disappointed users who now look
forward to the real thing.

VIETNAM: Free labor

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

In a throwback to a time when Vietnam was fighting for its survival
against the Americans and French, the country's Vice Minister of
Finance Nguyen Sinh Hung wants to see the reintroduction of
compulsory labor on "projects of public interest".  He has
calculated (possibly without including himself) that if Vietnam's pool
of 30 million labours contributed one day a year to the notion for
"patriotic duties" the country would have an extra trillion dong to
play with.  Its a nice notion, and one that has worked well for the
Burmese for many years.  But in most countries such a concept is
simply called forced labor and while it certainly enhances a
citizen's patriotism, its does little for public relations.

VIETNAM: Degenerate

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Bank officials have been described as a bunch of degenerates and
incompetents by none other than the official Communist Party
newspaper Nhan Dan.  A description that fits many state employees
in Vietnam.  The paper quoted State Bank chief Cao Si Kien who bemoaned
the lack of control over domestic banking activities.  He cited
operational shortcomings (a nice way of explaining away banks that
accept deposits but can't find the money at withdrawal time),
inadequate checks on loans (assets are a bit difficult to quantify
in Vietnam), and the employment of unqualified and `degenerate'
officials (loans are sometimes given on the basis of available sex
and entertainment).

VIETNAM: Expansion

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

The ADB is loaning Saigon Port $30m as part of a $40m upgrade.
Work has already begun on the three year project which will see
capacity increase by 25%.  Piers will be expanded, new warehouses
built, container facilities improved, and lighting, water, and
drainage revamped.

The upgrade will give Saigon Port an annual capacity of 9 million
tons, with a further 5 million tons added by 2010.

VIETNAM: Compensation set

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Saigon's latest compensation rates of $2000 per square metre are
not yet set in stone, but the effect is the same since the formula
was handed down by the city's People's Committee.  Developers are
not supposed to pay compensation.  The Vietnamese party is supposed
to offer a clean site.  That is the theory.  The reality is
somewhat different.  To fast-track any property project, the
foreign developer usually has to compensate the residents.  It can
now figure in $2000 psm per resident in they invariable cost
over-runs that have to be paid to the Vietnamese partner.  That
doesn't necessarily mean that the resident will receive $2000.  The
Vietnamese partner could skim off up to 80% of the compensation.

VIETNAM: Chicken feed

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Farmers in the Mekeng Delta have been growing marijuana as chicken
feed.  As least that is what they told the police who confiscated
1000 kg of cannabis plants during a recent anti-drug sweep.  Police
found it hard to swallow the chicken feed claims of the two old
ladies who had been tending the crop for the past three years.  It
is believed that the cannabis is destined for the local market
where there has been a dermatic surge in drug-taking since Vietnam's
economic reforms really took hold in the last five years.

VIETNAM: Unlucky

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

It not easy to advertise a product in Vietnam.  What is bared in the
north could be quite acceptable in the south, or vice vera.  The
latest casualty in the marketing wars is Saigon's banning of
lottery promotions whereby when a customer buys a product he
becomes eligible for a prize.  The ban hit companies as divserse as
Motorola, Shell Oil and Toshiba.  However, the ban only applies in
the south.  In the north, foreign companies are continuing to use
lucky-draws as a marketing play.  Overall, they seem to be well
received by the average Vietnamese.

VIETNAM: History Rewritten

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Not to be outdone by the famous tunnels of Cu Chi, enterprising
tourist officials in Phuoc Tuy province near Saigon have unearthed
their own "tunnels' right under the old Australian army base at Nui
Dat.  This never-before-discovered tunnel network has been lauded
by old Viet Cong as having played a major role in their war against
the south.  Never mind that the 'tunnels' don't look 30 years old,
or that they are much bigger than the average Vietnamese.  The
'tunnels' look genuine and are certainly attracting tourists.  What
the tourists don't know is that they were dug this year so that
local tourist officials could cash in on the foreign visitors.

VIETNAM: Stumped

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Foreign vegetable growers in the cool highlands town of Dalat
continue to face astronomical transport costs in getting their
produce to market.  Cathay Pacific and Vietnam Airlines have the
cargo monopoly on the Saigon to Hongkong route.  Their extortionate
rates means that its cheaper to air freight produce from Sydney to
Hongkong.

Exporting to Europe is no different.  Air freight rates are 50%
higher out of Vietnam than out of Thailand where a variety of vegetables
are grown around the northern city of Chiang Mai.

The main foreign vegetable processor in Dalat, Bio-organics, is
shifting production to vegetables that can be shipped by sea.  It
is also branching into the growing of cut flowers that can
initially be sold locally.

VIETNAM: Power drive

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vietnam is to build a new 17 billion kilowatt hours a year power plant
in its northern province of Son La.  With an expected completion by
2007 it will be three times bigger than Vietnam's existing largest hydro
project at Hoa Binh.  Official figures reveal that 50,000 people
will have to be relocated but the reservoir so created would swamp
forest and farmland in both Son La and Lai Chau provinces.  That
means that more than 100,000 people, mainly ethnic minorities,
could be affected.

The Son La project is seen as a key part of plans to boost power
output to 29 billion kwh by 2000, although total domestic
consumption could top 60 billion kwh within 10 years.  However, Son
La is set to cost in excess of $3.5 billion.  Vietnam doesn't have that
sort of money and foreign lending agencies are wary of funding
projects with so many obvious environmental concerns.

ESTABLISHING A PRESENCE IN MYANMAR

passed the Myanmar Foreign Investment Law (the "MFIL"), which
signalled a new era in Myanmar's economic development.  The MFIL
offers attractive incentives and guarantees competitive with those
of the neighbouring nations.  Though most sectors of the economy
are open to foreign investors, there are certain reservations.

A.    Permitted Areas for Investment

Some sector of economic activity are reserved to the State by
virtue of the State Economic Enterprises Law s. 3.  There are:

    -    extraction and sale of teak;

    -    exploration, extraction and sale of petroleum, natural gas and
production of by-products;

    -    exploration, extraction and export of pearls, jade and precious
stones;

    -    breeding and production of fish and prawns in fisheries;

    -    postal and telecommunications;

    -    air and railway transport;

    -    banking and insurance services;

    -    broadcasting and television services;

    -    exploration and extraction of metals and export of same;

    -    electricity generating services; and

    -    manufacture of products relating to security and defence which
the Government has prescribed by notification.

However, even in these sectors Myanmar citizens and foreign
investors alike may apply under s. 4 for a certificate allowing
them to undertake these activities.  In practice such permission
will often only be forthcoming where the proposed activity is to be
undertaken in a joint venture with the relevant State entity.

B.    Entry Vehicles for Doing Business in Myanmar

There are three primary methods for investors to establish a
presence in Myanmar :

1.    Appoint a Business Representative;

2.    Obtain a Permit to Trade and incorporate a company/register a
branch office;

3.    Apply to invest pursuant to the Myanmar Foreign Investment Law
(the "MFIL"), and then, if doing so as a company, obtain a Permit
to Trade and incorporate a company or register a branch office in
Myanmar.

Given the size and sector restrictions applying to MFIL
investments, most foreign investors utilize #2.  It is worth noting
immediately that 100% foreign ownership and control of companies
incorporated in Myanmar is permissible, and that where the State is
to have any form of equity interest in company it must be formed
pursuant to the Special Company Act 1950.  Finally, where a joint
venture is to be through a corporate vehicle, the provisions of
Myanmar's Partnership Act will obtain.

1. Business Representatives

Registration of a Business Representative

Though there are no provisions for "Representative Offices" as the
term may be understood in other countries, there is a procedure
under which a Myanmar citizen, or a branch office or company in
Myanmar, can be registered as the official Business Representative
of a foreign entity.

Who may be a "Business Representative"

The appointment of business representatives in Myanmar is governed
by the Ministry of Trade's Registration of Business Representatives
Order (order No. 2/89, or the "Business Representatives Order").
The Business Representatives Order defines a "Business
Representative" as:

1.    "an agent engaged in accepting indents and placing orders for
goods from the supplier abroad on a commission basis or any
business representative employed to do any business transaction for
any individual or organization abroad or to represent another
person in dealings with third person."

It also includes:

1.(1)    technical assistants and business consultants employed by a
foreign manufacturer or exporter;

1.(2)    products specialists, buying agents, technicians and business
consultants employed by foreign buyers who purchase Myanmar
products;

1.(3)    individuals who represent a foreigner in foreign trade and
who render services for the benefit of such foreigner; and

1.(4)    individuals having an established office in the Union of
Myanmar and representing a foreign company or organization or an
entrepreneur to act as business representative or to engage in
consultancy services or employee recruitment but not registered as
they are not governed by any existing law.

Section 3 stipulates that a person appointed a Business
Representative must be:

    (a)    a citizen of Myanmar;

    (b)    at least 18 years of age;

    (c)    not a service personnel of any State owned entity; and

    (d)    must possess appropriate qualifications.

It is also possible to appoint companies incorporated in Myanmar,
or branch offices registered in Myanmar, as a Business
Representative, even if these companies are foreign owned.

Powers of a Business Representative

As between the Business Representative and the Principal, the scope
of the permitted powers must be clearly delineated in the
Appointment Letter, which will be registered at the Ministry of
Trade.  Any liability for the acts of a Business Representative
will be determined with reference to the terms of the appointment
letter and will be governed by common law agency principles as
codified and modified by the Contract Act 1872.

Appointment Process

An application is filed for a certificate of registration, which
certificate will be valid for one year.  With 30 days notice prior
to the expiry of the certificate an application may be made to
extend the registration for a further year.  The appointment letter
must be certified as authentic by the Myanmar embassy in the
foreign principal's country.

Registration Fee

The registration fee is based on the proposed remuneration of the
representative.  This remuneration must fall within defined
parameters.  A Business Representative may earn agency commission
in foreign exchange, in which case the registration fee is kyat
10,000 payable in foreign exchange (which would be approx. $1800.00
at the official exchange rate of 5.75 kyat/ 1$).

Alternatively the Business Representative may earn a salary, in
which case registration fees are payable in local currency as
follows:

            Category            Registration Fee        Extension Fee

(1)    monthly salary of US$1,000    kyats 10,000            kyats 5,000
        and above

(2)   monthly salary of US$501        kyats 5,000            kyats 2,500
        to US$1,000

(3)   monthly salary of US$100        kyats 2,500            kyats 1,000
        to US$500

For reference the official exchange rate is pegged to the Special
Drawing Right (SDR) and the rate is currently approximately kyat
5.75 = $1US.  However, the market exchange rate, which can now be
legally obtained at a recognized new Exchange Centre, is about kyat
130 = $1US, so that for example the registration fee of kyat 2500
would cost only $20.

When is a more formal corporate presence in Myanmar necessary ?

Though  the definition of "business representative" noted above
gives some indication of the scope of activities contemplated for
Business Representatives, the point at which a company must
establish a more formal corporate presence in Myanmar remains
ill-defined.  The trigger appears to be when a company is "doing
business" in country.

2. Obtaining a Permit to Trade only

Section 27A of the Myanmar Companies Act requires that requires
that foreign companies obtain a Permit to Trade.  Formerly such
Permits were issued by the Ministry of Trade, whereas now they are
issued by the Ministry of National Planning and Economic
Development.

An application for a Permit must be in the prescribed form and will
require certain information regarding the investor and the
investment.  The Capital Structure Committee will consider
applications, and will stipulate a minimum capitalization amount.
There are certain prescribed minimum amounts, which are outlined
below for the 5 categories of Permits to Trade, but in some cases
the CSC may stipulate a higher amount in part based on
consideration of the company's expected expenditures during the
first year of operations.  One half of the stipulated amount must
be brought into the country before the Permit will be issued, and
the balance must follow within one year.

Following are the categories:

    i.     Manufacturing             kyat 1,000,000

    ii.    Trading                   kyat 500,000

    iii.   Services                  kyat 300,000

    iv.    Hotel/Tourism             kyat 300,000

    v.     Banking/Finance/Insurance kyat 300,000

As the official exchange rate is approximately kyat 5.75 - US$1 the
effect is that, for example, a requirement to import 300,000 will
actually require that the investor bring in roughly $53,000.  These
funds will be transferred into the investors foreign currency
account, and can be withdrawn in foreign currency equivalent
Foreign Exchange Certificates ("FEC's") to meet local expenses.  Up
to 75% can then be used to open an LC and thus in effect to bring
capital :in kind".

It is important to note that the company will be restricted to
activities which fall within the purview of its Permit to Trade
category, and that this Permit to Trade category must gybe with
stated objects of incorporation of the company.  Whereas formerly
companies would adopt "kitchen sink" objects clauses which
contemplated every conceivable manner of activity, now companies
are restricted to a list of objects issued by the Registrar of
Companies for companies in the relevant category of Permit to
Trade.  Companies must choose a limited number of the objects
clauses on this official list.

Additionally, whereas previously the categories of Permit to Trade
were tiered and inclusive, such that a manufacturing company could
engage in trading and services, and a trading company could engage
in services, now each category of Permit to Trade is distinct.  For
example, a manufacturing company may not engage in trading or
services, but must instead incorporate a distinct company and
obtain a distinct Permit to Trade for that purpose.  However,
companies may engage in what might be termed "downstream or
upstream" operations directly related to the activities
contemplated in their Permit.  Thus a manufacturing company could
engage in the retail sale of its own products and could import the
raw materials necessary for production.  That company could not,
however, participate in trading of unrelated goods.

Please note that in many sectors the economy the investor will need
to submit a licence fro the relevant Ministry as part of the Permit
to Trade application.

Once the Permit to Trade has been issued the investor can proceed
with the incorporation of a company or registration of a branch
office.  These application must again be in the prescribed form,
and require information on the shareholders, directors etc.

3. The MFIL

Investment under the MFIL always merits consideration because of
the generous tax and export/import incentives, and the explicit
guarantees regarding repatriation and nationalization, for which
MFIL investors are eligible.  However, there are certain listed
areas of permitted investment, certain minimum thresholds for MEIL
investors and MFIL has certain objectives to be considered when
assessing an application, including:

    - promotion and expansion of exports

    - exploitation of natural resources which require heavy investment

    - acquisition of high technology

    - supporting and assisting production and services requiring high
capital

    - opening up of more employment opportunities

    - development of works which would save energy consumption

    - regional development

In the results trading companies, for example, will not generally
be eligible for MFIL incentives.  By law it is never mandatory to
invest under the MFIL, but as a matter of policy companies
investing in certain sector of the economy might be asked to submit
the comprehensive MFIL proposals even if they do not want the
incentives that the MFIL offers.  It would be a rare case however
where an eligible company did not want to avail itself of the
MFIL's benefits.

Under the MFIL, foreign investment can occur in the form of 100%
foreign-owned venture, or in a joint venture with a Burmese entity
or individual.  If wholly foreign owner the investment can occur in
the form of a sole proprietorship, a partnership, or a limited
company; if a joint venture, at least 35% of the joint venture
equity capital must be foreign capital.

MFIL applications require detailed information which must be
complied and submitted in a prescribed form.  Information required
includes information as to the investment participants (including
bank references and other information as to financial standing),
the investment structure, the magnitude, nature, division and
timing of capital contributions, the input requirements (foreign
exchange, personnel, power, etc.) and output projections for the
business, and any draft agreements (such as leases, contracts with
relevant Ministries, etc.) relating to  the project.

MFIL applications will be vetted and forwarded to the Myanmar
Investment Commission (the MIC") for review.  The MIC's members
include all Ministers whose portfolio's could be said to related to
commerce, industry to commerce, industry or finance.  When the MIC
has issued its recommendation regarding the application it will
forward it to the Cabinet for final consideration.  This
requirement that the powerful Cabinet explicitly consider and issue
its approval for issuance of an MFIL Permit is an important
distinction from certain other regional nations lacking such a
unitary central authority.  Such a "seal of approval" can greatly
expedite future dealings with government officials, provided always
that the matter at issue was explicitly contemplated in the MFIL
application materials.

When an MFIL Permit is granted the investor may then establish a
corporate presence in Myanmar pursuant to the steps noted above in
#2 if this is the chosen investment vehicle.

VIETNAM: Success is a mind's game

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

FT : - For a country that for decades learned more from the
text-books of Marx than the market economy, Vietnam is doing
remarkably well.

Group domestic product growth is around 8 per cent, mainly on the
back of rapid growth in construction, increased exports and
industrial growth.  Saigon, the country's engine of growth, grew by
almost 15 per cent, although there are signs that Hanoi and the
north is catching up.

"The main thing is staying on course in terms of macro-economic
management," says Bradley Babson, resident representative of the
World Bank.

But despite the past four years of successes, Vietnam has reached
an economic crossroads.  Inflation, which in 1988 raged at about
300 per cent, was brought down to 5.2 per cent by 1993.

However, consumer prices have increased ominously and economists
fear that the indicator could climb back up to alarming levels on
the back of rapid economic growth unless the trend is checked.

Although domestic savings accounted for some 17 per cent of growth
this year, far above the paltry 7.4 per cent recorded in 1990,
economists say that this is still too far below average levels in
the region and compares unfavourably to that of China, where the
rate is about 35 per cent.

Although the fruits of doi moi are evident in the main cities -
where cars are becoming more common and many residents have been
busily converting their homes into mini-hotels or small shops - the
countryside lags far behind.  Since agriculture employs more than
70 per cent of the workforce and accounts for more than 50 per cent
of total export volume, this could act as a drag on growth.

However, the economists sound greatest alarm over investment
inflows, which, though increasing, will not be enough to sustain
industrialisation.

The World Bank, normally upbeat on Vietnam, has in its latest
report tempered its praise with a warning that Vietnam must
demonstrate more enthusiasm for developing the nascent private
sector if growth is to be sustained.

"Despite the success of state enterprise-led industrialisation
since 1991, a strategy based on developing large, capital-intensive
state enterprises, protected from foreign and domestic private
competition and concentrated in selected `strategic' sectors, would
not deliver the kind of industrialisation Vietnam needs," said the
World Bank report.

Vietnam's private sector is restricted to small-scale enterprises
such as food processing and the manufacturing of garments and some
consumer goods.  Vietnamese private businessmen complain of an
unequal playing field on which they are forced to compete with
privileged state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

"The state sector has a monopoly of many high profit businesses
like telecoms, real estate, export and import but the private
sector is not allowed to take charge of them," says Bui Huy Hung,
president of Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank, one of a handful
of share holding banks.

"This is the biggest obstacle to the transition to the market
economy."

Despite a vigorous campaign by Hanoi that has cut the number of
SOEs to 6,000 from 12,5000 since 1990, Hanoi appears set on
maintaining the state sector's dominance of key sectors of the
economy.  Foreign economists point out that most of the SOEs closed
down as part of the down-sizing were small, town-based units in the
provinces, with little economic clout, even collectively.

In mid-1994, Hanoi formed 14 conglomerates in sectors such as
electricity, cement, textiles and rubber.  "The idea is to increase
competition and to form more commercial establishments," says Phan
Van Tiem, chairman of the government's State Enterprise Reform
Committee, admitting that Vietnamese policy makers are using the
chaebol of South Korea as one model.

Foreign economists and the World Bank suspect that the creation of
such conglomerates may be just another way of strengthening SOE
control over the economy, saying that rubber scarcely qualifies as
a strategic industry.

"They cannot do this with the state sector as the centre of
gravity," says one foreign economist.

Economists see an urgent need to mobilise domestic savings -
estimated at about $2bn - and channel them into the banking system.
 Progress on this has been slow due to traditional mistrust of
banks and despite the launch this year of a series of domestic
treasury bill auctions ultimately aimed at the retail market.

In the meantime, Vietnam hopes to meet some of its spending needs
by issuing government bonds internationally.  Hanoi is keen to move
as fast as possible with huge sums needed for infrastructure,
education and healthcare.

"Vietnam has ambitious targets and the danger is that they going to
spend too much too quickly, and that could affect inflation and the
balance of payments," said a foreign economist in Hanoi.

VIETNAM: $1bn for flat steel mill

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

Vietnam's attempts to aggressively recruit foreign companies to build
steel mills within its borders are about to pay off in a big way.
Korea's Posco and Daewoo are finalising plans to build Vietnam first
flat-product steel mill, which could cost as much as $1 billion.

"We are discussing this project with Daewoo and VSG," Sujin Oh,
Posco's chief representative in Hanoi said.  "We have finished the
pre-feasibility study."

The large infrastructual needs expected to be associated with the
project are causing headaches in determining its location.  At
least three sites are under consideration, two in central Vietnam
and one in the north.  The Vietnamese are again pushing for Duang
Quat as a steel mill fits in well with their ideas of
industrialising central Vietnam.  Costs for infrastructure alone,
including a deep-see port that could accommodate ships of at least
40,000 dead-weight tonnes and adequate electricity and roads, are
likely to be about US$200 million.

"We assume the Vietnamese government will provide the
infrastructure," he said.  The Vietnamese are assuming that the
foreigners will pay for it.

Four joint ventures between Vietnam Steel Corporation and foreign
partners have come on line within the last 18 months with a total
capacity of more than 700,000 tonnes.  This is still short of
Daewoo's annual projections for Vietnam of 3 million tons by 2000.

All of these mills are producing construction steel, which is used
primarily for reinforcing buildings.

Vietnam at present has no mills producing flat steel, which is used
in products such as cars, refrigerators and washing machines.  The
Korean flat steel mill will be a welcome part of the national
strategy that Vietnam is encouraging in its shift to heavy
manufacturing.

VIETNAM: $650m for Vung Tau port

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Saigon:

In the largest build-operate-transfer deal ever signed in Vietnam, a
Taiwanese led consortium  is to put up to $650m into turning Vung
Tau into the nation's leading container port.  The deal, involving
Taiwan's Evergreen, Malaysia's MMC Ports, and Singapore's Tredia
Resources, is the largest infrastructure investment on record.
Under the BOT contract the consortium will run the port for 40
years before handing it back to the government.

A first phase is expected to go into operation within two years and
with 15 years the project will have the capacity to handle 45
million tonnes of cargo annually.

Vietnam Marine Corporation, a state-owned entity, will initially
hold a 5 per cent stake in the project but as the expansion starts
to make money it will buy shares from its foreign partners to
increase this to up to 20 per cent.

The Vung Tau upgrade will complement the $40m revamp of Saigon
Port.  The ADB funded project will see capacity there expanded by
25% by 1998.

With annual trade growing at 30% Vietnam's ports are woefully inadequate
to handle it.  They could become completely congested within two
years as new infrastructure development fails to keep pace with
trade.

Vietnam has a BOT law to encourage infrastructure improvements but
few companies have attempted this form of investment because of
limited guarantees on foreign exchange and pricing of services.

Cambodia downsizes contract

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Phnom Penh:

Cambodia has a unique interpretation of downsizing, the American
term for reducing employees.  Cambodia downsizes entire contracts.
Two years ago it threw out two Thai airlines and signed with the
Malaysians for Royal Air Cambodge.  A year ago Phnom Penh signed a
billion dollar deal with Malaysian company YTL to turn Angkor Wat
into a major tourist attraction.  Now, the land that had been
awarded to YTL (1095 hectares) has been cut in half and seven new
companies have been called in to bid on its development.

Aspara, the agency charged with overseeing protection and
management of the temples, has asked two local companies and five
foreign firms including France's Dumen GTM Cambodge, and Korea's
Daewoo.  YTL was not even on the list.

The rebidding for the Angkor Wat complex reveals the infighting
between Tourism Minister Veng Sereyvuth who supported YTL, and
State Minister Van Moulyvann who leads Aspara.  The latter had been
particularly critical of YTL's proposals for a light-and-sound
show, while conservationists are worried that the hotels will be
built on archaeologically protected land.

For his part Veng Sereyvuth defended YTL saying that it had
produced a professional plan that would protect the environment and
had commissioned a study showing the light-and-sound show would not
damage the temples.

The real question that investors are asking on their Cambodian
deals is whether a Cambodian contracts is worth the paper it is
written on.  The YTL downsizing is an obvious example that its not.

BURMA: $7 billion despite pressure

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Rangoon:

The generals in Burma have reason to feel optimistic.  Despite
increasing pressure for foreigners to disinvest and continuing
American calls for sanctions, total approved investment in Burma
should reach $7 billion by year's end.  All is from the private
sector with oil and gas attracting the most investment with 25
projects worth $1.44 billion.

Since 1988 when SLORC took over the government no loans had been
forthcoming from international financial institutions such as the
World Bank (WB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Asian
Development Bank (ADB).

The lack of foreign aid and soft loans does restrict development,
says David Abel, the country's Minister for Economic Development.
But he still believes that private investment will continue to
blossom with another $1.5 billion committed by March 1997.

Whereas Abel believes that Burma, which is still a member of the
governing bodies of the WB, ADB and IMF, faces only political
obstacles rather than "technical" ones for the resumption of loans.
 An ADB official said the inadequacy of economic reforms in Burma
and the government's foreign exchange policy were the main
stumbling blocks.

American companies remain the leading investors in Burma with more
than $250m committed so far on 15 projects.  Some 20 countries have
so far invested $4.13 billion in 176 projects, with two European
nations among the top three investors.

Britain tops the list with $1.003 billion invested, followed by
Singapore ($896 million) and France ($465 million).

VIETNAM: British may get a chance

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

British construction firm John Liang International may yet get the
chance to build Hanoi's new international airport.  Four years ago
it had submitted a bid for a new, smaller passenger terminal after
undertaking a privately financed feasibility study that assessed
passenger growth and traffic forecasts.  The British firm, despite
strong backing from London, lost the Hanoi contract to a Japanese
construction group and work on the first phase of the Hanoi
rebuilding scheme, the construction of a new international
passenger terminal, has just begun.

The Vietnamese, never slow to use foreign cash to achieve their own
goals, have decided that the new Hanoi airport would serve both
civilian and military aircraft.  Japanese aid is given under strict
civilian guidelines and is specifically prohibited from being used
to assist military - related projects.  This means that the
Japanese will most likely withdraw from the project altogether.  If
that happens, the most likely beneficiary will be John Liang
International that still has the original ,50m in government aid
that was used to back its earlier bid.  Talks have been opened and
the Vietnamese are receptive to a British takeover should the
Japanese falter.

The Hanoi revamp, plus a similar one in Saigon, are the
cornerstones of a massive upgrading scheme.  The country's civil
aviation department has proposed spending $5 billion to $8 billion
during the next 15 years to improve 50 airports throughout the
country.

An IATA report has predicted that air traffic in Vietnam would grow from
1.2 million passengers in 1993 to 3.9 million in 2000 and 17.4
million by 2010.

VIETNAM: Individual tax in VN

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

David King is the resident representative in Vietnam of accountancy firm
Pannell Kerr Foster.  He clarifies here the tax regulations that
foreign individuals face when they take up residence in Vietnam.

A recent crackdown on foreign representative offices by the tax
department has caused some confusion among foreign workers about
what taxes they should be paying and who they should pay them to.

The Hanoi People's Committee has sent a memo to all foreign
representative offices in the city saying that its External
Economic Department is now charged with collecting the income tax
of Vietnamese and foreigners in representatives offices.  This
means that staff in these offices must pay their salary tax to the
People's Committee instead of the tax department.

The tax department is looking at ways to increase its effectiveness
in tax collections and, in a sense, the People's Committee has been
sub-contracted to collect the taxes for which it receives a small
commission.

The People's Committee is taking a common sense approach to
collecting the taxes and there now appears to be an unofficial
amnesty for foreign representative offices to lodge their income
declarations.  However, if a representative office in audited and
found to be neglecting its tax payments, the tax office is unlikely
to show any leniency.

From the People's Committee's perspective the chief representative
must be a resident in Vietnam, which raises two issues.

One is the tax perspective.  If you are nominated as chief
representative, the People's Committee tax collection team
considers that you are a resident and you should be paying tax on
your worldwide income at Vietnamese tax rates.

There are three tax levels for foreign workers.  According to the
Tax Act a foreigner working in Vietnam for less than 30 days over
any consecutive 12-month period pays no tax on his or her income.

The difference between Vietnam and other countries is that the
12-month period does not necessarily coincide with Vietnam's tax
year, which is from January to December.

The second tax scale applies to a foreigner working in Vietnam for
more than 30 days and less than 183 days over a consecutive
12-month period.

If you fit into this group you are supposed to pay tax at a flat
rate of 10 per cent on Vietnam-sourced income.

The third rate is for a fully-fledged resident in the country for
any period over 183 days.  This is the criteria under which the
chief representative falls and is taxed on his worldwide salary and
wages income.

The chief representative should be paying tax at this third rate
because he should be a permanent employee of an office in Vietnam.

There is no difference between paying tax to the People's Committee
and the tax department.  The tax payer fills in the same form and
receives the same receipt - the payment simply goes to a different
address.

The People's Committee issues an assessment which says how much
each employee must pay per month.  The amount is paid and a receipt
is issued.

Confusion in paying taxes for foreign workers arises because
payments must be made monthly and many foreigners are in Vietnam -
on and off - for short periods.  Many workers are uncertain how
long they will remain in the country, making it difficult to assess
which tax level they fall under and how much they should pay.

A preferable tax system would not categorise tax payers at the
beginning of their work period - they would be categorised over the
long term.  Monthly tax would be paid at a marginal rate then fully
reconciled in the annual return.

BURMA: Is SLORC on a slide ?

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Rangoon:

In a country that is chronically short of telephones Burma's SLORC
is selling its citizens mobile phones - 4000 of them at $4000 each.
 But as the phones have to be purchased in dollars, the $16m

generated from the sale drained the local black market of dollars
and seriously undermined the value of the kyat.  The local currency
lost a quarter of its value in this odd attempt to boost government
coffers.  The attempted solution to one problem led to potentially
more serious problems elsewhere.

But mobile phones are only part of the story.  They are not the
sole reason for the fall in the kyat, and nor is the exchange rate
the only difficulty confronting  SLORC.

Newspaper headlines have been dominated by talk of rising political
tensions, increasing dissent among opposition groups and
international criticism of Rangoon's human rights record, and SLORC
faces a whole range of worsening economic problems.  Its attempts
to tackle these problems threaten to make matters worse before they
get better.  And the economic woes have great potential to add to
the discontent.

Inflation is rising, a trend that can only worsen as the currency
depreciates.  Dollars are becoming harder to find because they are
needed for imports, while dollar-earning exports face numerous
obstacles.  The trade balance is in deficit.

Investment, which ought to offer a major means of escape from this
vicious cycle, is also looking grim, with a growing number of
foreign firms deferring projects or withdrawing from the country
because of political controversy.

SLORC's hopes of raising foreign exchange through its Visit Burma
Year campaign have been largely dashed because of the dissidents'
campaign against the promotion, and because some tourists are
afraid of trouble.

"SLORC is tying itself up with economic problems," said one Asian
diplomat.

Most businessmen expect the kyat to hover around 180 kyat to the
dollar until the end of the year.  This compares to its movement
last year between 100 and 110 kyat on the unofficial market.  The
official exchange rate is 5.6 kyat to the dollar.

One of the reasons for the economic concerns is the deteriorating
political situation.  Confrontations between SLORC and opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the arrests in May of 262 of Mrs Suu
Kyi's National League for Democracy members for "questioning" are
the most visible troubles.

This incident, together with the death of James Leander Nichol, the
former honorary counsel for Denmark, Finland, Norway and
Switzerland, has prompted some Scandinavian countries and the
United States to seriously consider economic sanctions against
Rangoon.

Also contributing to the worries are rumours of the deteriorating
health of the country's main strongman, Ne Win, according to
analysts in Rangoon.

Suu Kyi has been outspoken in calling for the suspension of
overseas aid and for a boycott of the government's Visit Myanmar
Year 1996 campaign.  This has been "psychologically effective"
among international communications and is frustrating SLORC, said
one Burmese businessmen.

"The investment climate is now looking grim," said another observer.

"People are made to feel insecure by such political confrontation,"
said a third.

Their dissatisfaction could increase as the cost of living
increases.  Inflation has almost doubled, form 24 percent last year
to 40 percent at present.

As the kyat sinks, the cost of imports rises.  About 80 percent of
Burma's consumer products and construction materials are imported,
while exports include beans, pulses, low quality rice and raw
materials.

To generate more revenue for the government, SLORC has quietly
informed businessmen it has changed the formula for calculating the
tax it charges on imports and exports.

It has created a new official exchange rate to be used exclusively
for calculating import and export duties.  The price of imports and
exports is now calculated at 10 kyat per dollar instead of the 5.6
kyat official rate it sets for actual transactions.

This could have meant a 20-fold leap in tax payments, but SLORC at
the same time slashed the duties payable on imports and exports
from 100 percent to 10 percent.  The result is that the duty rate
has doubled, with SLORC hoping its revenues will increase by
approximately 50 percent.

The new formula has increased the price of imported consumer
products by 20-30 percent, according to Sriwat Suwarn, the Thai
Minister Counsellor for Commercial Affairs in Rangoon.

"Poor people and low-ranking civil servants are suffering most," he
said.

The salaries of government officials range from 1,000 kyat per
month to 2,500 kyat for those at the director general level.

Many local businessmen disagree with the new plan but say there is
no one to turn to with their complaints.

Mr Sriwat predicted SLORC would be forced to scrap the new formula
because it is unworkable and will cause widespread discontent.

The military government is aware of the rising cost of products and
early this year opened a new Government Employees Bank to help
civil servants.  The bank grants interest-free loans equal to 10
times monthly salaries so officials can keep pace with the rising
cost of living.

SLORC knows the public servants will have difficulties repaying the
loans, whose first repayments are due next month, so a 60 percent
salary increase is expected to be announced in the new few weeks,
according to one Burmese source.

"The 60 percent increase is to help them repay the money they
borrow," he said.

Unfortunately, traders have already raised their prices as they
know civil servants have more money to spend as a result of the
loans.  Rumours of a new salary hike will only add to the
escalating prices, said the source.

Thein Tun, the chairman of Pepsi-Cola Products Myanmar Co, places
the economic blame elsewhere.  He said export problems are caused
by port congestion, but this should ease in two years time when new
facilities are in place.

"There are 47 ships waiting to berth but we cannot export our
commodities," he said.

To ease the port congestion, the government has recently signed an
agreement with three Singaporean companies - C & P Holding,
Sinmardev International and Myanmar Integrated Port Service - to
build wharves and other facilities at a new port in Thilawa, about
30 kilometres from the capital.

Construction is expected to be completed in two years.

But Mr Sriwat of the Thai Embassy said this would not be enough.
The government should seriously consider measures to attract
foreign investment in manufacturing industries as the value-added
production would help reduce imports and boost exports.

Added investment would break the vicious cycle of devaluation and
inflation, but foreign confidence in Burma is at a new low.

The recent withdrawal of European brewers Heineken and Carlsberg,
and cancellations by a group of Japanese tourists planning to visit
Burma are just some examples of the multinational pressure mounting
on the junta.

Threats from the US to sanction Burma would not have a major impact
on the country because it is not a major trade partner of SLORC,
said one Burmese trader.

But it would cost the jobs of 40,000 Burmese who work in textile
factories serving the American market, he added.

VIETNAM: Hanoi admits foreigners are sceptical

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

In a somewhat refreshing comment, a high level official in Vietnam's
Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), vice-minister Nguyen
Nhac, has admitted that despite a decade of opening up, foreign
investors are still sceptical of the government's policies.

This month should see the amendment for the third time of Vietnam's
Foreign Investment Law.  It is supposed to focus on simplification
of post-licence procedures, such as land use permits, construction
permits and taxation, and other challenges which foreign investors
are encountering that, presumably, covers things such as the state
theft of 40 containers of mining equipment from Westralian Sands
earlier this year.

Under the revamped investment law investors will get permits for
land use and construction in one month.  The government has
facilitated licence procedures since the merger of a licensing body
(State Committee for Cooperation and Investment) and a planning
agency (State Planning Committee) last year creating a theoretical
one-stop service at the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI).

But investors are still struggling in some areas of investment and
in some parts of the country, Nhac said.  "In some areas MPI works,
but in others there are still problems.  That's why we're
determined to perfect our legal framework and improve the
environment including infrastructure.  In certain areas, investment
is falling, such as in real estate and office/hotel projects.  But
we see a good trend: over 80% of the projects are manufacturing
industries, which is in line with our needs."

MPI is considering more incentives or facilities for industrial
estate development.  "We try to provide facilities, the lowest land
rents of fees, fewer taxes and longer tax exemptions," he said.

What Nhac would do well to consider is a concerted effort to
prevent foreign investors from being ripped off at the slightest
excuse.  Over-charging and corruption is one thing.  That can be
managed.  But orchestrated state theft is quite another.  There is
far too much of both at a time when Vietnam is facing serious regional
competition for the investment dollar.

VIETNAM: Following in thou footsteps

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

As Westralian Sands executives fled their Ha Tinh ilmenite mine
with little more than the shirts on their backs, and leaving behind
40 containers of sophisticated mining equipment that was
subsequently stolen by provincial authorities, another Australian
company was digging in for the long term.

Perth based Golden Tiger Resources is one of the few publicly
listed firms in Australia to focus entirely on Vietnam.  "Our company is
now completely set up to become a mining company in Vietnam,"
Golden Tiger Resources managing director Rupert Crowe said.  "It is
going to take a while, but we have confidence that there is a lot
to be found there."

Two of Golden Tiger's Vietnam's projects are 50-50 joint ventures with
the Canadian mining company Teck Corp.  Golden Tiger has three
exploration programmes under way in Vietnam.  Two are joint ventures
with Teck to search for gold, and the other is a lead-zinc project.

With reference to Hanoi's theft of 40 containers of mining
equipment, Crowe said, "Obviously, there are concerns about those
sort of problems.  But our relationship with the Vietnamese is very
good." Westralian said much the same thing, right up until the
police put a padlock on their mine.

VIETNAM: Sponsorship opportunities abound

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

In Indochina, there are great opportunities for sponsorship, but a
lot of thought must be given to the realities of each country
before events are planned, according to Bates Vietnam chairman
David Bell.

Mr Bell said it is believed that consumer involvement in events is
stronger in the developing markets of Indochina because consumers
have been isolated from international-style events for a long time.

"In the case of Vietnam, it's about 20 years.  therefore, virtually
anything new is exciting," said Mr Bell.

However, because of the rigid system of government control in some
countries, it does not mean that all sponsorships will
automatically be a success.

In Vietnam, there is a three-station TV Choice in Saigon and Hanoi,
and the station calculates its rate on time segments rather than
programming.

"TV cost efficiency is generally good.  However, one of the major
problems is the inability of the TV Stations to plan their
programming in advance and their likelihood to change," said Mr
Bell.

"Viewers may get used to a foreign entertainment programme being on
at a certain time each week, but suddenly it will change and much
viewership is lost."

In Burma, only the state-run TV Station gives national coverage and
reaches a total audience of around three to four million viewers.
A peak time 30-second spot goes for $585, so for high rating
programmes, Myanmar TV is very economical.

According to Mr Bell, sponsorship is not well developed in
Cambodia, but it is possible to do it.  He explained that the Thai
station, TV5, is easier to deal with and has better coverage - with
spillover into Cambodia.  The Thais are also more clued up about
sponsorship.  However, it is more expensive for a peak time spot,
and no reliable research is used to evaluate performance.

All these three countries have marked differences in cultural
values.  They have different religions and languages, though there
are some common languages such as English, Chinese, French and Thai.

"The trend for marketing events in these countries is to use local
languages," said Mr Bell.

"Nevertheless, some important similarities, like sport, music,
entertainment programmes and popular sciences, are such that
sponsorship and event marketing can use them for regional
activities that can reach similar groups across differing cultures.

"Though there are a lot of problems we have to face in organising
sponsorships and event marketing in these markets, we should try
new things and have patience with the authorities and other
logistical problems."

LAOS: Lao runaround on telecom deal

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vientiane:

Doing business in Indochina is never easy but the runaround given
to Thailand's Shinawatra telecoms group was more frustrating than
most.  Three times it flew its executives and media reps into
Vientiane in anticipation of the contract signing.  The first
postponement was due to only a Lao version of the contract being
available.  The Lao's inexplicably gave as their reason for the
delay a requirement for an English version of the contract.

The second postponement was due to the arrival in Vientiane of
Thailand's Prime Minister which gave Lao government officials a
much better excuse to be unavailable.  The third postponement
underlined the reasons for the first delay.  Vientiane had been
offered a better deal by M Group, another Thai telecom giant which
has a high profile in Laotian telecommunications.

M Group has won a licence from the Lao government to operate a
gigantic broad-casting satellite project, L-Star.  The country's
first satellite will be put into orbit in December next year and
will cover all of Asia.

Shinawatra operates Thaicom satellites of similar coverage and
capacity.  The top bosses at both groups are widely known to have
had a difficult relationship for the past few years.  Suradet
Mukyangkoon, a highly-placed source in the Lao government said the
postponements were caused merely by a Thai company wishing to
participate in the telecom projects.

"The company has approached the government and made attractive
offers many times while Shinawatra was engaged in negotiating to
work out the new deal," said the government source, without naming
the contender.

The message to investors is clear.  If negotiating in Indochina in
good faith, you can bet on it that the other side isn't.  If the
other side comes up with a litany of excuses to avoid signing a
contract, look over your shoulder.  You will probably find the
competition using every trick in the book to get you out of the
picture.

LAOS: Urban growth, rural poverty

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vientiane, AP:

Ten years after embracing capitalist-style reforms and cautiously
opening its doors, this impoverished communist nation in the heart
of a dynamic Southeast Asia is beginning to register economic
growth.

But while more urban dwellers can buy cars and television sets,
relatively little has been done to fight malnutrition, disease and
illiteracy in the valleys and hills where most Laotians live.

"The growth is not distributed equally.  The challenge this country
is facing is a widening gap between city and country, the rich and
the poor," says Jan Mattsson, head of UN Development Programme in
Laos.

While sleepy by the standards of most Asian capitals, Vientiane is
revving up.  Its markets are full, new restaurants and hotels are
opening, and banks from neighbouring, wildly capitalistic Thailand
dominate the city's main Avenue of a Million Elephants.

But by World Bank estimates, half of Lao's 4.6 million people still
fall below a poverty line set at $12 of income or goods a month.
In rural areas, most are subsistence farmers who cannot participate
in a market economy and whose lives are mirrored in the bleak
overall statistics.

Average life expectancy is 51 years.  More than one-third of adults
are illiterate.  Electricity reaches only 15 percent of the
population.  Nearly half the children under 5 years suffer stunted
growth from chronic malnutrition.

Officials argue that a rich-poor gap is inevitable when centralised
control is loosened in favour of the free market.  But to this, say
analysts, is added a deeply rooted disregard for the countryside by
Vientiane's elite - colonial, royalist or today's mix of Marxist
power brokers,  old families and the newly rich.

"When you open up the country, the black beast emerges,: said
Thongphachanh Sonnasinh, a senior planning official.  "But we are
trying to decentralise the resources we get from outside."

At its sixth congress in last March, the 78,000-member Communist
Party focused on the issues of equality and how quickly it should
embrace the outside world.

Underlying the debate are apparent fears that the economic gap
could bring political instability and that wide open doors could
lead to loss of both party control and national sovereignty.

Laos is certainly vulnerable.  It is land-locked, heavily dependent
on some $200 million in foreign aid each year and surrounded by
economically aggressive Thailand, Vietnam and China.  It has little
to offer foreign investors but its natural resources - chiefly,
minerals, hydroelectric potential and rapidly diminishing forests.

The world's least populated communist state admits controlling the
more than 500 foreign investors already here is difficult.  Laos
will even be hard pressed to find qualified officials to staff the
200-plus annual meetings held by the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, which it joins next year.

"While not completely reversing course, the party appears to have
chosen to emphasize the perceived dangers stemming from the
open-door policy, including social problems and a loss of economic
control," says Ray Eaton, an Australian businessman with extensive
contacts in Indochina.

The liberalising "New Economic Mechanism", introduced in 1986, has
yielded some benefits, and Laos is one of the few least developed
countries to enjoy growth.

Despite an inflation rate of nearly 20 percent and flooding that
displaced 10 percent of the population, Laos still managed a 7.1
percent economic growth rate last year.

Since 1988, foreigners have invested $5 billion, three-quarters of
this going into hydroelectric power projects that economists say
could help pull Laos out of poverty over the decade.

"We want to grow faster and join the developed community, but our
conditions are not yet ready," said Mr Thongphachanh in an
interview.  "We now take one step forward, one step back.  We are
on the platform, but don't know when the launch will take place."

Despite such caution and anxiety - voiced by almost every official
in Laos - odds are great the country will inevitably be drawn into
the one of the world's fastest growing regions.

All-weather roads linking Laos to China and Vietnam are being
rapidly constructed, while agreement was recently reached to build
a second bridge across the Mekong River to Thailand.  Some 43,000
tourists visited the country last year, up from almost zero a few
years earlier.

Membership in the seven-nation ASEAN will force Laos to lower
trade, immigration and other barriers.  The country may even enter
cyberspace: One foreign company is trying to introduce the hitherto
illegal Internet.

VEITNAM: Environment loses in race for economic growth

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Bien Hoa:

More than two decades after the Americans decimated Vietnam's tropical
forests and farmland with defoliants and bombing, the country's
ecosystem is under attack again, this time from unharnessed
economic growth.

Flushed with the success of its drive to revamp an economy scarred
by years of war and isolation, Vietnam's communist leadership is now
planning a hell-for-leather dash to become an industrialised nation.

"If the government doesn't smarten up its act on the environment,
it will have a Bangkok or Jakarta on its hands by the end of the
century," said one Western aid worker.  "Alarm bells are ringing
and the government is listening with only half an ear."

Vietnam says pollution has not yet become a serious problem.  But a
casual observer in the southern boom town of old Saigon, might
disagree.

Long lines of trucks belching filthy emissions clog the main
arteries into the city, where the tinkle of bicycle bells has long
been drowned out by the roar of cars and motorbikes.

Cars are still somewhat of a novelty in what remains one of the
world's poorest nations, but annual sales are expected to grow
almost six-fold between now and the end of the century to 60,000
units.  That will put a major strain on the country's road system,
one of the most primitive in Asia.

Down at the Saigon River, which runs through the heart of the city,
scavengers rummage through stinking mounds of garbage.  Others poke
about in the inky water, where huge islands of debris float along
with dead rats and human faeces.

About 30 kilometres to the northeast, the ageing Bien Hoa 1
industrial park spews mountains of untreated waste into the Dong
Nai River, a tributary of the river that flows through Saigon and
provides 90 percent of its drinking water.

The Dong Nai Paper Company deposits some 3,000 tonnes of untreated
caustic soda into the Dong Nia River every year.  Hoan, general
director of the company, says fishermen have long deserted the
stretch of river by his plant.

"This is an old factory so we don't have a chemical recovery
system," he said.  "The chemicals just go into the river."

However, the government is starting to listen to the warnings of
environmentalists, even if it is less than keen to make the
financial investment needed for prevention.  A law on environmental
protection was introduced in 1994, and companies like the Dong Nai
Paper Company are being told to clean up or close down.

The state-run media has also been peppered in recent months with
articles critical of careless exploitation of resources,
particularly deforestation and indiscriminate use of fertilisers
for cash crops such as coffee and rubber.

The World Wide Fund for Nature says Vietnam's forest cover is just 19
percent today, against 43 percent in 1943.   Remote-sensing data
shows that at current reduction rates, the natural primary forests
will disappear within 20 years.

"At this juncture of Vietnam's development it is important not to repeat
the mistakes of many other countries, particularly some of the
neighbouring countries," Nay Tuen, the UNDP's Asia-Pacific
Director, said at one conference on the environment.

Nevertheless, critics say the authorities still show a worrying
tendency to brush pollution problems under the carpet.  A recent
oil spill in the Mekong Delta, for example, was reported days later
in the local press and officials refused to go further than confirm
it had happened.

VIETNAM: What's in a road ?

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

Laos and Vietnam are like two lovers sleeping together, but if they are
to grow together the roads linking them must be expanded and
upgraded.  The Lao's want the access to Vietnam's deep water ports that
will wean them away from expensive road transport and Bangkok.  The
Vietnamese are looking for tourist and trade links across Laos to
Thailand.  A number of options have been put forward, some by Laos,
others by Vietnam.  There is no doubt as to the benefits should road
links between Laos and Vietnam improve.

Route 8 which links Paksane with Vinh in Vietnam is the road most
favoured by the Lao's.  It is the shortest route from Thailand to
Vietnam, as well as from Vientiane to Vietnam.  The 260 kms of the road
that
is in Vietnam is in reasonable condition while much of the Laotian part
is barely usable over mountainous, winding terrain.  The road also
complements the continuing construction of Nam Theun 2 and Nam
Theun Hinboon hydro power plants.  Route 9 connects Mukdahan with
Savannakhet in Laos and Vietnam's central port town of Da Nang, some 500
kms away.  Again, in Vietnam it is in fairly good shape while in Laos it
is in bad need of repair.  There are plans, perhaps dreams would be
a better description, to revamp an old railway that runs parallel
to Route 9.

Both routes are seen as new avenues for the free flow of goods
between industrial northeastern Thailand and Vietnam.  Developing them
is a priority project for the Asian Development Bank, which is the
main advocate of a sub-regional cooperation scheme for six
countries sharing the Mekong River: China, Vietnam, Laos, Burma,
Thailand and Cambodia.

Since Vietnam is pressing ahead towards industrialisation or
semi-industrialisation by the year 2000 its leaders are aiming for
social, political as well as economic results by promoting direct
foreign investment in what is the poorest part of the country.
Laos, for its part, is serious about economic development and
raising the people's standard of living.  By 2000 it wants to see
its per capita income up to $500 a year and to introduce
electricity to at least half of Savannakhet province.  It is hoping
that renovating Routes 8 and 9 will give the province the magical
impetus.

The economic boast will, of course, come from he hundreds of
millions of dollars needed for the upgrade.  Its not just the roads
that require money.  Besides upgrading and reconstructing roads,
software issues like customs and immigration procedures also have
to be worked out.  The ADB is reported to be committed to financial
assistance, but disbursement will take time.  But once it does
start to roll out its millions there will be plenty all round for
foreign expertise and investment in the tourist infrastructure
associated with the two projects.

VIETNAM: Hold that lease

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Saigon:

Imagine that you're found your ideal office on home in Vietnam and the
lease is awaiting signature.  Before signing it would be wise to
consider the hidden extras.  An apparent `good deal' could be a
disaster in the making.

Depending on whether one is in the north or the south, measurement
can very greatly.  In the north, most buildings are let on a nett
internal area basis.  In the south, most projects are offered on a
gross area basis which means that tenants are charged for all the
common areas.  These could occupy as much as 20% of the floor area.

Rents are usually quoted nett of taxes and service charges, the
latter ranging from $3 to $8 psm.  When paying rent, expect also to
pay the 20% tax that is levied on the landlord's income.  That
brings the psm cost to 110% of rental.  Car parks are seldom
included in a rental.  They could cost an extra $100 psm per month.
 Even parking a bicycle may not be free.  Where daytime
air-conditioning costs may be included in the service costs, night
time or holiday air-conditioning will be extra.  The ideal building
should have a separate electricity meter for every tenant.

Once the extras have been understood and factored into the rental,
the lease can be signed.  Then one is faced with fit-out costs of
$250 psm for average quality to up to $1,000 psm for a quality that
approximates the best that Hongkong would have to offer.

It is vital that a tenant has clear understanding of what be is
getting.  In Vietnam, the `fair' part of a deal is usually found on the
side of the Vietnamese.

CAMBODIA: Caltex aims for 10%

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Phnom Penh:

It's been 21 years since Caltex was last in Cambodia.  The US oil
giant has re-entered the Cambodian market on a wave of confidence
starting with the first American owned retail outlet since 1975.

Caltex has plans to invest $20m in Cambodia, opening some 20
service stations in Phnom Penh and major provincial cities and
building a major oil depot at Sihanoukville.

"We see great potential here," said Clifton Hon, chairman of the
Caltex Group of Companies based in Singapore.

He said studies indicated that Cambodia's current
11,000-barrel-per-day consumption of petroleum products could more
than quadruple in the coming decade if its economy develops along
the lines of its neighbours.

"We're hoping for at least a 10% market share very quickly," said
John Raeside, the general manager of Caltex Cambodia Ltd.

Five other Caltex stations are now under construction in the
capital and the company is looking at sites to build on in
Cambodia's second-largest city of Battambang and in the populous
east-central province of Kampong Cham.

The service stations will eventually be supplied by the $8m
Sihanoukville depot which will handle oil from Caltex refineries in
Singapore and Thailand.

The depot is expected to be completed in mid-1997 and until then
products will be shipped up the Mekong River to the port in Phnom
Penh.

VIETNAM: Viet Kieu fail to invest

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Saigon:

Supporting one's relations is one thing, supporting the government
is another.  That seems to be the rationale behind the reluctance
of Viet Kieu to invest in their old homeland.  Only a trickle of
investment has found its way back from overseas Vietnamese, who
remain mostly unconvinced by the tax breaks and preferential
treatment on offer.  Viet Kieu investment is around half a per cent
of foreign invested capital.  Since Vietnam launched its reforms in 1988
only $130m has come from Viet Kieu.  Of that, only $7m can be
attributed to the 1.5 million Vietnamese who settled in America.

Hanoi has offered a 20% reduction in taxes and a flat five-percent
tax on profit remittances.  Viet Kieu are given the same rights as
domestic firms to lease property and hire staff unlike other
foreign investors.

But as one Viet Kieu told BNI, " we may look stupid, but we are not
stupid."  Viet Kieu continue to help their relations to the tune of
$600m a year in remittances to fund hotels, restaurants and shops
that remain outside official channels.  Those few who do return
chaff under the country's dual pricing system that makes foreigners
pay more than double what locals pay for hotels and airfares.

While welcoming their money, officials remain suspicious of people
who fled and many Viet Kieu complain of harassment by security
services.  Despite the repeated pledges by the government that it
wants to close the chapter on the past, anxieties about the
political and social impact of Viet Kieu remain near the surface.

Communist Party chief Do Muoi warned in a recent speech that Saigon
was a hotbed of sabotage plots concocted by "hostile forces," a
reference to overseas Vietnamese groups opposed to the government.

CAMBODIA: Cambodia has its own 'bullet' train

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

'Bullet' trains in Cambodia take on a whole new meaning.  Not only
do the Khmer Rouge shoot them up, but when the soldiers who are
supposedly guarding the railway lines get bored they let fly with a
few bullets, too.  Being a passenger on a Cambodian train is often
a death sentence.  The northwest line from Phnom Penh to Battanbang
is subject to attack by the Khmer Rouge which continues to wage an
effective guerilla war along the Thai border.

In addition to rebel and bandit attacks the Royal Railways of
Cambodia (RRC) face horrendous maintenance problems.  The railway
is 70 years old.  For the past 25 years zero maintenance was
undertaken.  Locomotives are a mixture of Russian, American and
Chinese machines and often one finds an old wood or coal burner
chugging through the rice paddies.  Passenger transport is
nonexistent with freight trains being used to haul largely
nonpaying riders.

RRC embarked on a major modernization drive earlier this year
following the launch of a new nonstop freight train service between
Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville.  Travelling time has been halved to 6
hours.  That is still double the road time.  RRC has made track
upgrade on this sector its top priority so that speeds of up to 70
Kph could be achieved - double the current maximum.

The Asian Development Bank has been strongly supportive of RRC's
efforts to modernize, contributing $5m to rehabilitate 16 bridges,
repair culverts and embankments and replace wooden sleepers with
concrete ones.  While much work on the southern line remains to be
done, the train now runs on a regular daily basis.  The track
through Kampot, halfway between Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, is
still in bad shape despite emergency rehabilitation.  The new
freight service from the coast is being mainly used to move
containers.  Sihanoukville is virtually an all-container port these
days and the train provides a cheap and relatively secure means of
getting cargo to the capital and empty containers back to the port.

RRC's director, Pich Kimsreang, would like to see Cambodia
connected to Thailand in the west and Saigon in the east.  He
commented, "The railway is very important for the tourism industry.
 We want to upgrade the existing lines and look into expansion of
the domestic network and at the same time link Cambodia to the
international railway network."

That, of course, depends on the defeat of the Khmer Rouge.  Only
then can RRC bury its reputation for 'bullet' train service.

VIETNAM: Viet cinemas get a boost

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

Three years ago Vietnam had about 300 cinemas.  Today, only a handful
are left as owners rushed to convert them into more profitable
bars, restaurants and KTV dens.  Hanoi has only two cinemas for its
3 million people.  Those cinemas that remain open for business
usually only show Vietnamese films.  These have lost out in
popularity in recent years to imported movies from Hong Kong
watched at home or shown in street-side video bars.  Several US
films, including the Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie True Lies,
have been screened at cinemas over the past year.

A cinema renaissance is about to begin with the arrival of an
American and a Thai company that hope to renovate several crumbling
Vietnamese cinemas and build new multiplex centres that will show
the latest US movies.

Vision Net International (VietnamI) has signed with state movie
distribution company Faflim to renovate cinemas in Hanoi, Saigon
and Da Nang, VietnamI would build 20 multiplex cinemas with up to four
screens, each with audience capacity of 300.  Fafilm, a state firm
known for its conservatism, will maintain control over the films
that are chosen for release.

VietnamI joins Kantana Group, a major Thai entertainment company that
intends to invest $40m in Indochina using satellite theatres, or
miniplexers as the Americans prefer to say.

In Laos, Kantana is operating three conventional cinemas.  It hopes
to establish 10 and 30 of its conventional cinemas in Cambodia and
Vietnam respectively.  This at a time when cinema attendance in Vietnam
has
dropped to almost zero and that country's number of operating
conventional cinemas has dropped to only 3.

Kantana believes that if conventional cinemas are received
positively without too many operational problems, Indochina could
well see the launch of 300 plus satellite theatres.  Kantana would
open them at the rate of 5 a year in the first phase and the
remainder in place and operating by 2005.

The main thrust of Kantana's cinema strategy in Indochina is to
introduce satellite theatre complexes.  But this first requires
operators who are familiar with the conventional theatre business.
Hence the initial emphasis on conventional cinemas.

The problem that Kantana and VietnamI will face is not so much in the
attractiveness of its cineplexes which is a given, but on whether
Indochinese can afford them.  Vietnam, the richest and most developed of
the Indochinese countries, has an average GDP of only $250, rising
to $850 in Saigon.  That doesn't leave much for more than one or
two visits a year to the movies.

BANGKOK: Giant remains cautious on VN

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Bangkok:

Thailand's biggest cement maker, Siam Cement (SCC), is in no hurry
to establish a cement plant in Vietnam.  It cited inaccurate demand and
supply forecasts for its hesitancy.  This is in spite of it being
in Vietnam for the last four years sheparding investments as diverse as
roof tile manufacture and property development.  It has a $10m roof
tile venture in Song Be, near Saigon, where it also hopes to
produce sanitaryware.  But its real reason for being in Vietnam remains
the sale of its cement.

SCC was lured to Vietnam by Hanoi's forecast of annual cement demand of
20 million tons within the next four years versus annual production
of only 7.2 million tons.  Vietnam's construction boom has attracted
foreign investors to plunge into capital intensive cement
production, with five joint ventures licensed to date and another
awaiting approval.  That one involves Taiwan's Universal Cement and
two Vietnamese groups: Ha Tu Limestone Cement Enterprise in Quang
Ninh province and Vietnam Coal Corp (Vinacoal).  It would invest
$240m to produce 1.28 million tons a year of clinker and 1.5
million tons of cement.

By the end of this year Vietnam will have 25 cement factories.  Although
attractive to investors, the large scale of such projects and the
complexity of doing business in Vietnam have driven many to look for
government or multilateral guarantees for financing.  Especially
when they are all up and running there is a strong possibility of a
glut in the market.  Domestic cement production is expected to hit
nearly 20 million tons by 1999.  A surplus that would have to be
relieved through export or the lowering of operating levels.
Annual per capita consumption of cement in Vietnam is less than 100
killogrammes compared with Thailand's 420 and South Korea's 1,300.

At present SCC exports 80-100 container loads of its Elephant brand
cement to Vietnam each month.  It is looking at supplying related
produts such as premix concrete, paper pulp and paper-packaging.
It is also looking at other ASEAN markets to determine the best
logistical location for cement production.

LAOS: China cargoes transit Mekong

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vientiane:

With China's southern province of Yunnan, Thailand, Burma and Laos
already part of a cooperative economic quadrangle, the next logical
step is to use the common waters of the Mekong River to transit
cargoes from China through to Thailand.  A private Thai company,
Lan Chang International (LCI) intends to do just that.  It hopes to
obtain permission from Laos to carry Chinese goods down the Mekong
to Thailand's port of Laem Chabang.

LCI already transports goods and tourists through the Yunnan Water
Transportation Company.  Its Chinese partner has 49% of the
company, LCI 41% and the balance split between Burma and Laos.  The
most popular route for tourists is from Chiang Saen in Chiang Rai
Province to Xisuangpanna in Yunnan.

A successful test transportation run for cargo along the Mekong
River was first carried out last year, with a vessel carrying
apples from China to Thailand through the Chiang Saen port in
Thailand's Chiang Rai province.

BANGKOK: Neighbours chase investment

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Bangkok:

BOTH LAOS and Cambodia are keen to get their hands on the regional
investment dollar.  A recent seminar in Bangkok saw speaker after
speaker from Cambodia and Laos plead for more foreign funding of
their market economies.  If an investment could generate hard
currency, all the better.

For Laos, emphasis is being placed on investments in
hydroelectricity, mineral extraction and processing, agribusiness,
wood products, export-oriented light manufacturing, small-scale
tourism, and financial and transport services.

At present there are 230 projects in Laos that have been funded by
foreign investors, but only 168 are still operating.  It is still a
more encouraging figure than that found in Vietnam where only one third
of licensed projects are actually established.

Cambodia wants foreigners to invest in its still shaky tourist
industry which, for many investors, remains the easiest way to get
their hands on foreign currency.  Where Laos wants to shepard
investors into the state sector, Cambodia has no preference and
appears equally happy when an investor works through his private
contacts as with the country's national tourism board.

Dear Editor: Correcting facts on ECCs

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Antonio G. M. La Vina

This refers to today's (Sept. 12) issue of BusinessWorld which ran an
item entitled "DENR sitting on the ECCs of four major energy projects."

We would like to correct the impression brought about by the
abovementioned title in view of the following facts: 1. The ECC for the
Sunrise Power Corporation was granted by the DENR just yesterday, Sept.
11, 1996. The project involves the construction and operation phases of
a 23-megawatt diesel/bunker power plant to serve the Petrochemical
Products Corp. of the Pacific, a locator within the PNOC-Petrochemical
Products Corp. of the Pacific, a locator within the PNOC-Petrochemical
Development Corp. Industrial Estate in Brgy. Batangas II, Mariveles,
Bataan. 2. The application of the Tarlac Power Corp. is for the
construction of a 30 MW bunker fired power plant expansion of the
existing 6.4 MW Heavy Fuel Engine Power Generating Plant in Bgy. Sto.
Nino, Tarlac, Tarlac, to augment Tarlac's power needs. The EIA review
Committee, on 5 September 1996, forwarded its recommendation to the
DENR Central Office and is now being reviewed for  consideration/approval
by the Secretary. 3.

The San Pascual Cogeneration Project, which involves the construction
and operation of a combined cycle cogeneration plant at the Caltex
Batangas Refinery in San Pascual, Batangas has been recommended by the
EMB on 29 July 1996 for issuance of ECC.

However, some clarifications with the proponent and the Review Committee
are necessary with respect to land ownership and land classification. 4.
The proposal for the Lake Mainit Hydroelectric Project of the Agusan Power
Corp. is a 22-MW Hydroelectric Power Plant in Jabonga, Agusan del Norte.

On 6 September 1996, the DENR Central Office returned the papers to the
EMB and the EIA Review Committee in view of necessary information on the
project's impact area, considering that the project will involve among
others the boring of a 3.2 km. tunnel under the Malimono Ridge from
Lake Mainit.

The Department wishes to clarify that the Environmental Impact
Assessment System involves the submission by the proponents of Impact
Statements which are subjected to the evaluation of an independent
group of experts. Considering the variability of local conditions and
the extent and variety of projects we receive, it is expected that
information in addition to the standard set of documents submitted will
be required as evaluation takes place, leading to the impression that
the DENR does not act expeditiously.

In view of this, we have been trying to fast track evaluation and tried
to improve on the system. We are presently revising the EIA guidelines
with the objective of streamlining the procedures.

We hope the above explains the issue. ANTONIO G.M. LA VINA
Undersecretary for Legal, Legislative Affairs and Attached Agencies, &
OIC, Undersecretary for Environment and Programs Development

Dear Editor: Nuclear test ban

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Maria Athena Ronquillo

Greenpeace welcomes the overwhelming approval by the United Nations
General Assembly (UNGA) of a "zero-yield" Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
resolution last September 10 in New York. We now urge the five nuclear
powers (US, UK, Russia, France and China) to sign the treaty as soon as
it is opened for signature, and to commit themselves to pursuing
complete nuclear disarmament.

Twenty-five years ago this month, Greenpeace was launched to peacefully
protest nuclear weapons testing. We view this treaty as a milestone in
the history of the nuclear age and an extraordinary way to mark our
anniversary.

We must now channel the overwhelming worldwide momentum toward the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty into efforts to eliminate all nuclear
weapons.

The Philippines, together with Indonesia, Malaysia and other ASEAN
countries helped small countries propel the overwhelming signing of the
UN resolution.

The overwhelming vote at the United Nations is a moral victory for the
peace movement, for the little people everywhere and for all Asian NGO
colleagues who have campaigned for an end to nuclear testing for the
past 50 years.

The treaty can take effect only after the signature and ratification of
44 specific countries, including India, which so far refuses to sign.
It is, therefore, essential that the US and the four other nuclear
powers ratify the treaty soonest and affirm their commitment never to
test nuclear weapons again.

On behalf of Greenpeace International, MARIA ATHENA RONQUILLO Regional
Energy Campaigner, Southeast Asia #49 Matatag St., Bgy. Pinyahan, QC

Dear Editor: Clarification

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Jesus Matubis Jr.

BusinessWorld carried the story about Sec. Robert Z. Barbers'
memorandum delineating the responsibilities of the two undersecretaries
of the Department of the Interior and Local Government, Messrs. Alvin
G. Dans, for Peace and Order, and Manuel R. Sanchez for Local
Government.

While we are thankful for the exposure, we wish to correct however
certain inaccuracies in the story, among them the incorrect
interpretation conveyed by the accompanying headline (DILG's Barbers
dumps Dans for Sanchez) that Undersecretary Dans was "dumped," or, as
such a term normally implies, "removed," and the reference in the story
to a supposed rift between Dans and Director Serafin Benaldo as the
probable cause of Dans' transfer.

To set the record straight, Dans himself was the one who requested that
he be made responsible for the Interior or Peace and Order sector of
the DILG. This request Secretary Barbers acceded to.

Thus, while Dans may have had a policy difference with Benaldo on the
funding of the proposed Community Development Assistance Project, as
mentioned in the story, this was not at all the basis for Secretary
Barbers' decision.

We hope this will clarify matters. JESUS MATUBIS JR. Director
Department of the Interior and Local Government

Dear Editor: He"ll smoke "em

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Joel B. Ramos

Congratulations! Through your columnist, Daniel F. DeLong, someone has
decided to stand up to all of the abuse thrown on us smokers. In his
column last week, Mr. DeLong pointed out the restrictions and he
destroyed the myths spread by the ill-informed members of society.

If you think that you can help yourself by giving up cigarettes, then
you need to do so. Leave the rest of us alone!

Next time you commute, please look at all the people who are forced to
cover their noses so that the exhaust fumes of the buses and jeepneys
don't kill them. These are the killers of this society.

I do have 'em and I do plan to continue smoking 'em. JOEL B. RAMOS

Across the Board: Graft watch - 2

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4

By Ismael G. Khan, Jr.

Two columns ago (BW, Sept. 5, 1996) I wrote about a nascent movement
that is designed to mount a constant "graft watch" on those activities
of government that readily lend themselves to graft and corruption.
Former presidents of the Personnel Management Association of the
Philippines (PMAP) and that organization's Society of Fellows are in
the vanguard of this effort.

In a meeting yesterday, the former PMAP presidents, led by Greg
Imperial and Wency Malabanan, began to map out doable plans to assist
the Ramos Administration - assuming that it would welcome this
proffered assistance - in sustaining its avowed campaign to go hammer
and thongs against officials and employees who betrayed or are
betraying the public trust.

Much on the administration's political will and sincerity to ensure the
success of this campaign.

Despite the fact that the Philippines has probably the toughest laws
against public malfeasance and misfeasance, there has been no serious
prosecution under any of those laws. Both the PCGG and the Ombudsman
are proving to be no match to the ingenuity and resourcefulness of
these criminal civil servants and their co-conspirators in private
business.

While hidden wealth may take some doing, unexplained wealth should not
be too difficult to pin down if our so-called "graft-busters" truly set
their minds and hearts to it. A citizens' "Graft Watch" may just light
a fire in their behind and put it in their belly.

Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and
Singapore's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) are two of
the world's most successful anti-corruption agencies, either of which
can serve as a very useful and workable model for the Philippines.

It is not by happenstance that both Hong Kong and Singapore are
paragons of a graft-free society where laws are actually enforced
regardless of who gets hurt, and crooked officials are actually put
behind bars. It is interesting to know, for example, that the
establishment of Hong Kong's ICAC in 1974 was precipitated by rampant
police corruption in the Crown Colony.

Dr. Raymond Pomerlau of the San Francisco State University has made a
career of studying graft and corruption in Asia, particularly in Korea,
Taiwan, and China. He has identified a number of strategies which he
maintains are imperative in the battle against institutionalized
corruption in government. Among them: "1. Corrupt activity must be
treated seriously and not dressed up in the rhetoric of morality.
Political will and an avowed policy of implementation must be secured.
Adequate budgetary and independently established human resources must
be pressed into service. Compre-hensive investigative and innovative
legal measures must be consistent with due process laws. "2.
Appropriate administrative infrastructure must be invoked. Fundamental
changes in public attitudes must be encouraged and an ethical value
system must be prompted. Application of punishment for corrupt
practices must be exercised swiftly, equitably, and without exception.
"3. Boundaries between government and business must be distanced.
Contributions to political campaigns must be legalized under stringent
guidelines. Social encounters must not turn into money-denominated
exchanges. "4. Pursuit of private gain must never be at the expense of
public duty. 'Honest graft' and 'dishonest graft' must be called
corruption. Laws must remain the most important means of combat
corruption. Principles of transparency must be institutionalized in the
body politic. "5. And ,finally, national integrity must be avowed as
the linchpin of the nation's well-being."

If the foregoing moral "infrastructure" could be put in place in our
country, there will be hope yet that we can prevail in the war against
graft and corruption.

Upshot: For 30 pieces of silver

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Bernardo V. Lopez

For a lousy 30 pieces of silver, Okinawan Governor Masahide Ota decided
to retain the controversial US bases. The Japanese government offered
oodles of development aid so that Ota would capitulate and reverse his
stand to get rid of the bases. He could not resist the offer,
nullifying an overwhelming plebiscite where about 90 per cent of
Okinawans voted to get rid of the bases. That's the way the cookie
crumbles.

Bases withdrawal was replaced with "bases reduction," which really
amounts to nothing, just a few square meters lopped off to appease the
angry crowd. The strong protests of the Okinawans stems from the rape
last year of a school girl by three American GIs, which shocked the
conservative Okinawan community.

Ota led the protest but gave up when 30 pieces of silver, or a whopping
$45.8 million, was laid at his feet. Okinawa is one of the poorest
places in Japan with average income of half of Tokyo's.

The base leases held by about 3,000 landowners mostly opposed to the
base expire in May 1997. This may just make the Ota decision useless.
Some of the biggest in the eastern hemisphere since Subic was lost, the
Okinawa bases are home to 47,000 American soldiers, the largest
concentration of US troops in the entire Asia Pacific.

The strong anti-base feeling among the Japanese is also due to the
lesson of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Japan has one of the most resilient
anti-nuclear movements in the world. Many feel that Japan may just be
sucked into a regional nuclear confrontation because of the bases.
Ironically, Japan also has one of the most conservative military-minded
rulers who believe an alliance with the American superpower is the key
to peace in the Pacific.

Learning a lesson from Filipinos who got rid of the Subic naval base
without batting an eyelash, the Americans made sure this would not
happen in Japan, a crucial military partner in any confrontation with
China or Russia. The strong bilateral pressure from the Americans on
Japan's central government to retain the bases was, of course, realized
by the 30 pieces of silver, which is a drop in the bucket considering
how much the Americans spend to maintain 47,000 in the base. It is easy
for the US to bribe the 3,000 landowners or use force to renew the
leases in the future.

A Japanese journalist last year reported on a syndicate involving
Filipinos and Americans which has been secretly exporting Filipino
children to a neighborhood near the base, reportedly for the R&R of
American GIs.

The rape of the Japanese school girl is nothing compared to the mass
pedophilia that may be happening clandestinely in Okinawa, if the
allegation are true.

It was a useless trip last week to Subic for Okinawan officials led by
Mashiko Takara, chair of the Special Committee on Development of
Evacuated Military-Used Lands. They were eager to have their own base
withdrawal in their country. They came to study the base conversion
model at Subic with Filipino executives giving a lecture on the how-to
of base conversion.

Okinawa holds 40 of the 100 US bases scattered throughout Japan,
including its version of Clark Field, the Kadena Air Force Base. Over
and above the American bases, Japan has the most powerful and modern
air force in the entire Pacific, which has forced China to modernize
its air force in response.

Ninety per cent of the escalation of strategic weapons in the Pacific
is due to an overly superior Japanese air force with the Americans
benefiting in terms of billions of dollars worth of sale of the most
sophisticated airplanes.

Japan is the biggest arms spender by far in the entire Pacific,
believing that its future as a world economic power depends on it. Some
observers believe however this will cause its downfall.

Ironically, this thinking in the military and government centers
contrasts greatly with the essential anti-military and anti-nuclear
mentality of the Japanese public due to the trauma of World War II. The
problem is, the public has very little clout in the decisions upstairs
in spite of the effective mass sit-down strikes against the Yokosuka
naval base where the US "neither confirms or denies" the presence of
nuclear weapons.

With the loss of Subic, the strategic value of the Japanese US bases
has tripled as there is a gap between the bases in Diego Garcia in the
Indian Ocean (now participating actively in attacks against Iraq) and
Guam and the Japanese bases. Geopolitics dictate that the Americans
keep the Chinese sleeping giant at bay at intervals across its massive
coastal area. The geopolitical wisdom of containing a rival giant is,
however, questionable.

The Americans and the Japanese are the hawks of the Pacific who will
cause the next major confrontation because of their massive escalation
of weaponry. The chances of a bases withdrawal in Japan is practically
nil if the Japanese bureaucrats keep their medieval shogun mentality
contrary to the will of the public, which is the only only force that
can stop them.

The View from Taft: Effective leadership in a changing environment

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4

By John Malliris

In today's complex business environment - increasing global
competition, deregulation, political and economic protectionism - the
companies which implement continuous changes have competitive advantage
for survival.

Leadership is the most critical factor to implement such changes and
the driving force that causes an organization to stretch beyond its
normal range of performance.

The behavioral characteristics of a leader may be broadly categorized
into (1) charismatic and (2) instrumental.

The elements of charismatic behavior are knowledge, vision and energy.
A leader possessing these qualities is able to elicit employee support
and commitment. He is able to direct individual objectives, values,
aspirations and aggressiveness toward organizational benefits.

The elements of instrumental behavior are structuring, controlling and
appraisal. A leader is said to have these qualities if he is able to
define standards, clarify degree of authority and responsibility,
establish systems and processes to monitor behavior and results,
prescribe corrective actions and give meritorious rewards.

The combination of charismatic and instrumental behavioral
characteristics comprises effective leadership, which is necessary to
get meaningful changes and the best results.

The combination of these leadership characteristics is manifested in an
organization in its (1) dynamism, (2) personal interaction, (3)
integration of individual and group goals, and (4) structural fluidity.

Dynamism

In contrast to traditional management, leadership does not always
create consistency. It produces movement, action and change tough: a) a
high degree of directional intensity - new objectives, a vision for the
future and the commitment of people to power and purpose; b) alignment
and communication - direction to achieve the vision; and c) motivation
- adoption of new values and discarding of old habits.

Personal Interaction

A successful organization calls for the leader's personal participation
and interaction with people. It means asking the right people the right
questions and listening to their opinions as well as to facts. For
example, instead of simply relying on statistics in submitted reports,
a leader can directly ask a service engineer to determine the time
spent in the field against the time spent in the office.

Integration of Individual and Group Goals

Effective leaders give meaning to the people in their organization by:
a) making them understand what a particular vision means to them; b)
assisting individuals across the organization to find a greater purpose
in their working environment; c) empowering people to become involved
in the change effort and be responsible for getting extraordinary
results; d) adopting a certain style so others can be comfortable with
them.

Structure Fluidity

Effective leadership is also dependent on the leader's ability to
develop high-level management groups or leadership teams whose members
interact principally to share information and make decisions. This
relieves the leader of part of his work load and at the same time
provides an excellent cross-disciplinary training ground for future
chief operating officers.

Many organizations have such management teams, composed of a collection
of senior level managers who more or less function together.
Unfortunately, a member occasionally throws his weight around to
conceal his inefficiencies.

High-performance organizations have "real" leadership teams with
members who are equally committed to a common purpose or goal, who
trust one another, and who hold themselves mutually accountable for
decision making.

In summary, an effective leader should be able to harness both his

Sen. Miriam Defensor-Santiago has not been attending the chamber's
sessions for over a month now because she's said to be suffering from
hypocalcemia, a chemical imbalance in the body due to lack of calcium.
A medical expert explained the illness causes personality change,
attacks of depression, loss of memory and physiological imbalance.

The labor department seems to have turned its back on its own campaign
against child labor. Sources said Labor Secretary Leonardo Quisumbing
has actually asked his people to take it easy in clamping down on
establishments hiring minors as workers, particularly those situated in
the Quezon City area. Do you still wonder that nothing is happening to
stop the exploitation and abuse of minors.

Even before the Thalia fervor has cooled down, her Sergio, nee Eduardo
Capetillo, is in town and with him the canine crowd favorite Fulgoso.
Capetillo speaks English fluently. That's a relief. At least, we don't
have to groan through the incompetent translations fed to us in
Thalia's case. To recall, at the Araneta Coliseum concert, Thalia was
moved to tears when a giant birthday cake was wheeled onto the stage in
advance celebration of her birthday (Aug. 26). She told the crowd that
her tears (lagrimas) were like "perlas de amor," that she was offering
to the Filipinos. And the translation? She was offering "pearls of the
Orient"!!! Stupid. Why couldn't Channel 9 have tapped their homegrown
talent, Angelique Lazo, for the Thalia assignment?

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4

Reader Kenneth Yu is fuming mad. His telephone works sporadically and
"yet, PLDT has the gall to bill me for the period my phone was not
working." He said the first time he complained, a lineman came and said
the problem was a defective line and that this would be checked.
However, when nothing happened after a few days, Mr. Yu called up PLDT
service and was told the problem was not with the line but with the
conduit line inside his building. This went on for two to three weeks.
Finally, Mr. Yu said he was told by a lineman that PLDT service wanted
its "statistics" to be manageable, meaning complaints about defective
lines should be within a specific number. Any complaint beyond the
accepted statistical boundary is logged under another category. If
true, can the public be further enlightened on this technicality?

ShopTalk: Mismanaged

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4

The Department of Agriculture faces the possibility of losing
fertilizer grants from Japan and Canada. Negotiated by then National
Food and Agriculture Council chief Domingo F. Panganiban in the early
'70s, the grants were supposed to be bidded out to fertilizer companies
which would then sell them to end-users, paying the government the cost
of the chemical plus a margin. When Mr. Panganiban left government
service with the entry of the Aquino regime in 1987, he said he turned
over about P780 million in proceeds from the fertilizer grants. During
the Aquino regime, the bidding process was junked and the National
Agriculture and Fisheries Council, the grant's implementing agency,
opted to award the grant to basically three groups. As of last
accounting, these groups owe the government about P300 million. Of this
P300 million, about P120 million is owed by Sanduguan, a farmers'
organization. Canada is apparently disturbed by these developments and
is now considering coursing its fertilizer grants through private
fertilizer companies. Petty graft it can live with, but not the
magnitude of corruption in the handling of the grant. Tokyo has also
expressed concern and has required projects to benefit from its grant
to get its prior approval. Again, tsk, tsk...

Time was when talk of constitutional changes were never even given a
second thought. Recall how lawmakers allied with the administration
were up in arms when a Palace initiative to introduce amendments to the
1987 Philippine Constitution was leaked to the press. Now, the same
people have made a 180-degree turn: they are virtually crying out to
the world that there will be changes in the Constitution and that
President Ramos himself appears to be sending out the message. For one,
several Lakas-NUCD congressmen had observed that many unnecessary
provincial trips are being undertaken by the chief executive. Another
congressman claimed it was Malacanang which authored all the ruckus to
discredit Congress and the judicial system. Yes, even the opposition
had reluctantly admitted, the Constitution will be amended via the
circuitous route of a people's initiative. And it is expected to begin
in next May's barangay elections.

Unlike in Manila where taxi drivers take 12-hour shifts, taxi drivers
in Cebu are usually on 24-hour duty. Only a handful of operators do not
follow this practice. As it is virtually impossible to stay awake
during the whole shift, it is normal, according to our informed source,
for Cebuano taxi drivers to take shabu. And the riding public knows it.
And what do you know, there is also no effort on the part of drivers to
hide that they are taking this upper. Tourists without cars and who
want to check out night spots in the Queen City of the South must be a
little more careful. Taking a cab may not be the safest way to get

Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino continues to face some
obstacles in his bid to become the next secretary-general of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). While four out of the
seven member states of ASEAN are throwing their support behind Mr.
Severino's bid, the organization's current chief, Datu Ajit Singh of
Malaysia, is persistently lobbying for a second five-year term when his
ends in 1998. Sources told BusinessWorld the majority of the ASEAN
members want to see some changes in the organization. They want the
Malaysian diplomat to give way to Mr. Severino, who they believe could
inject some vigor and new ideas to the laid-back attitude of the
secretariat. Apparently, ASEAN's chief caretaker is afraid of facing
early retirement from the diplomatic service. Sources said the
Malaysian diplomat can no longer go back to the Malaysian foreign
service because he is of retirable age. The Philippine government wants
to secure the commitment of its colleagues in ASEAN this December
during the informal summit in Jakarta for Mr. Severino's bid. ASEAN is
expected to formally announce its decision for the new

One Voice: What is love?

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Vicky P. Garchitorena

She is small for her age and not given to much talk, at least not in
front of strangers: Rhona Mahilum, the 8-year-old girl who went into
their burning hut time and again in order to bring out her little
siblings. Her shoulders are hunched up as a result of the scarring of
the tissues from her neck, contracting the connecting muscles.

Her mother is a small woman and just as quiet.

She had to walk 15 kilometers carrying Rhona over her shoulders like a
lamb in order to avoid further destroying the burned flesh on her back.
She ignored her husband's command to just bury the child, whom he
thought was already dead. She walked thus to the nearest hospital to
seek treatment for her little girl.

Two small women. Two great heroines.

What is it that made them do what they did? What drove Rhona to
overcome her natural instinct for self-preservation and to brave the
heat of the flames in order to save her brothers and sisters? How could
she ignore the agony of her burning back? Whence came that courage come
in one so young?

Perhaps the maternal instinct of the mother was more understandable.
She refused to give up hope. She refused to give up her child. Rhona,
on the other hand, risked her own life. Not once but four times. And
she's only eight years old.

When I went to visit Rhona at the Ospital ng Maynila, two
representatives from the Readers' Digest happened to be there, too. One
of them asked me where I thought that act of courage of Rhona came
from. I could only say that it must have been her great love for her
brothers and sisters that made her do it.

I believe that God has given each of us the capacity to love. That love
manifests itself in different ways in our different relationships in
life. But, perhaps, some have been given a greater capacity than
others. Rhona certainly had it in large measure. As did her mother.

I can only imagine that the mother must have shown Rhona and the family
a quality of quiet love and caring that was deeply impressed in the
little girl's mind and heart.

Perhaps she was reflecting that same love and concern when she forgot
herself and her own safety totally and completely in order to save the
lives of her loved ones.

It has been said that "a greater love than this no man has, that he lay
down his life for another."

Rhona has shown us that pure and selfless love such as that Christ
showed us still exists in this world.

Her example should be held up for all Filipinos, indeed for all
mankind, to see and appreciate so that we do not lose hope for our
nature. Her example should silence the cynics who insist that looking
out for number one is the only valid lifestyle for our modern day.

Rhona was to have been operated on this week to remove the scar tissue
and to release the muscles that had contracted along her neck and
shoulders. After a few more months to ensure her good health, she will
be released from the hospital where she has been staying with her
mother and two younger sisters.

The trust fund that Mayor Alfredo Lim of Manila started has grown to
about P1.7 million. Its earnings are intended to ensure the health and
education of the children.

They are fortunate that such a Trust Fund has been set up. All too
often, we see similar donations that are simply frittered away by a
family that is not used to handling and managing such large amounts of
funds.

There is, of course, the concern that Rhona may become spoiled by all
the attention and all the largesse that is being heaped upon her. It
has also been reported that a movie is being planned on her act of
great daring and heroism and selflessness.

We can only pray that her mother will have the character and the
courage to see to it that she remains a loving and simple child.

Rhona's act of great love reaffirms our humanity. She has shown us what
all of us are capable of. She has shown us how to be heroes. She has
shown us the true meaning of love.

My Turn: Caught in traffic on a rainy night

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4

By Daniel F. DeLong

It's probably a matter of sheer, stupid luck. When it rains, somehow I
manage to find reasons not to go out.

But the man who coined the phrase, "It's better to be lucky than good,"
didn't have driving in the rain here in Metro Manila on his mind when
he uttered those words.

Because, as we all know, luck has a tendency to run out.

I had to go to the New World Hotel in Makati on a recent afternoon for
a story. It turned out there wasn't a story.

On the way home, it began to rain. I knew I was in trouble sitting at
the corner of Ayala Avenue and EDSA, waiting to turn left so I could
return to New Manila.

To begin with, it took the light nearly 10 minutes to switch to green.

We all moved like greyhounds through the pounding rain, for one block.
From Buendia to the house, a distance of 10 kilometers, it took another
96 minutes.

By now, the tape I was listening to had already finished one side and
it was running to the conclusion so that the machine could flip it to
the other side.

The cars were moving like something out of a nightmare. Slow, slower
and S-L-O-W-E-S-T. Finally, no movement at all.

I had the air conditioner turned on so that I didn't have to breathe
the horrible exhaust fumes coming from the buses to the right that
seemed intent on blocking progress for all of mankind. The windows were
beginning to steam up.

"We're all blind!" I thought. "How can anyone see anything?" So I
rolled each one down and back again to improve vision. It still looked
the same as it did before.

About 20 minutes later I cleared up the windows again and I happened to
look off to the left at a bunch of signboards that were grouped tightly
together.

Two of the advertisements were for shoes. "Yes," I thought to myself,
"walking would probably be better - even in this confounded rain that
doesn't seem to want to stop."

The bottom signboard was from a major distributor of condoms.

"That board should have been there 20 years ago," I mumbled to no one.
"If it had, perhaps traffic tonight would be better."

Despite the fact that we were moving, if you want to call it that, so
slowly that I was passed three times by the same vendor - yes, street
vendors walking on EDSA - I continually found myself in between lanes.

I try as much as possible to pick a lane on the road and stay there
throughout my trip. Sometimes, however, what we want and what we do are
not the same things.

A dear friend of mine has a fantasy about driving here. He would like
to build a car with reinforced steel that could absorb impact, and then
driving with a photographer and his insurance man, go out on the roads
and operate his motor vehicle like they do in the US.

In case you don't know, a man's place in a lane is something that
cannot be violated. If, for some strange reason it is, there will be
trouble.

My friend theorizes that he would be a one-man teaching crew, showing
the locals how it is supposed to be done.

So what would life be without fantasies?

On EDSA, it's the buses. They ruin it for everyone. Why doesn't the
government take control? It would be better to put up with inefficiency
than to suffer the current conditions.

Also to blame is Henry Sy, Sr. While he keeps building malls, he isn't
doing it fast enough for the population to spread out.

Once I asked him why doesn't he build more roads so that the people can
get to his malls to spend their money faster?

He simply smiled, shrugged his shoulders and simply moved on.

As I approached Megamall, I noted that the beginning of the end is
coming for the Ortigas Center, which is up in arms over a 300% increase
in property tax valuation.

"What," I asked my steering wheel, "will happen when they build out all
of the open space and there is nowhere to park a car?"

Already there is no water there because all the high-rise buildings
have sucked the precious commodity out of the ground.

Why do the developers here always worry about the most important things
after the damage has been done?

On Ortigas itself, heading through Greenhills, the problem is now
oversized trucks. There are container trucks, Coke trucks and trucks
hauling building material to construction sites. Why can't these things
wait until the commuters get home?

The trucks hauling materials to construction sites should wait until
after 10 p.m. No one is going to do anything with their load until the
next day anyway.

I've got a fantasy, too. But I can't share it with anyone because it's
probably illegal.

GrandAir to begin US flights starting February "97

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 19

By Marifi S. Jara

Grand International Airways, Inc. (GrandAir) is gearing up to begin
flights to the United States by February next year notwithstanding the
opposition lodged by flag-carrier Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL).

Eliseo Hizon, executive assistant to GrandAir's president and chief
executive officer, said in an interview that the airline has already
secured a permit from the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and that
they are just preparing several requirements.

"We have the permission from the US this December but probably it may
not push through because we have to meet certain requirements from the
FAA. We are working on those right now," Mr. Hizon said.

These requirements include the company's business plan, aviation safety
documents, and an environmental impact study, among others.

For its initial US operations, GrandAir plans to cover the
Manila-Honolulu-Los Angeles route with daily flights.

Mr. Hizon also said that once they begin their US services, they will
be looking at possible tie-ups with US carriers. "Not strategic
alliances, not yet. Maybe we will go for interline agreements which are
similar to code sharing and other forms of bilateral agreements. This
will all be possible as early as February 1997 as soon as we complete
our requirements."

Mr. Hizon said their permit for US flights, also known as the
transpacific route, was issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)
"about two or three months ago."

Officials of CAB could not be reached for confirmation as of press time.

Last June, PAL wrote a letter to the CAB asserting that GrandAir has no
right to fly more international routes until it receives a Certificate
of Public Convenience and Safety (CPCS).

The CPCS, issued by the government, serves as a permanent license for
operating in a service-oriented industry like aviation.

GrandAir is currently running under a temporary operating permit.

PAL also said in its letter that GrandAir should first secure from
government an official designation as the country's second national
carrier.

The Office of the President, which has to power to make such
designations, has yet to act on CAB's recommendation that GrandAir be
named a national carrier.

Earlier, GrandAir chief operating officer Angelo V. Balverde stressed
their planned international routes will cover the Philippine's air
traffic slots left unserviced by PAL. On the other hand, PAL has filed
an application before the CAB seeking to cover all of the country's
entitlements to the US under the RP-US Air Services Agreement.

GrandAir's current international operations consists of thrice a week
Manila-Hong Kong-Manila and Subic-Hong Kong-Subic flights.

Grand Air was granted a temporary operating permit to cover domestic
routes in December 1994 and October last year for international
destinations. Using a Boeing 737 aircraft, Grand Air's first
international flight bound for Hong Kong took off last April 3.

CAB recently approved GrandAir's application for Manila-Seoul-Manila
and Manila-Taipei-Manila flights. The airline is preparing to start
covering these routes before the end of the year.

The Panlilio-owned Grand Air, which has proven to be PAL's toughest
competitor since it started operations in March 1995, is also planning
flights to other Asian countries like Japan and Singapore which are
considered among the most lucrative routes.

In the domestic front, Grand Air currently serves flights to Cebu,
Davao, Tacloban and Cagayan de Oro with planned expansions to Iloilo,
Puerto Princesa, Kalibo, General Santos and Bacolod.

In another development, GrandAir has opposed the application of Air
Philippines Corp. for international flights, asserting the company is
financially and technically unfit for such services.

In a letter filed before the CAB last week, GrandAir, through its legal
counsel Roberto Rafael Lucila said, "The applicant is not fit and
qualified to engage in the business of international scheduled air
transportation services."

"The articles of incorporation of Air Philippines, Inc. provides that
the authorized capital stock of the corporation is P16 million - Hence,
this application fails to state the legal and financial fitness of the
applicant," the letter said.

The Panlilio-owned GrandAir, currently the only airline aside from
Philippine Airlines operating international flights, also cited the
recent grounding of Air Philippines as a sign of technical incompetence.

"Applicant does not possess the technical capability and fitness to
undertake the services applied for as its present domestic services
have been reportedly suspended by the Air Transportation (ATO)
recently, on the grounds of aviation safety requirements," Mr. Lucila
said.

The Subic-based Air Philippines was grounded by the ATO early this
month following a series of minor landing accidents. The ATO later
declared the airline unsafe. Upon compliance with requirements, ATO
lifted the suspension and allowed the airline to continue its services.

Air Philippines has resumed operations but it will still be under
government observation for a period of 30 days.

GrandAir further said Air Philippines failed to establish in its
application the need for a third international carrier for the country
as indicated in Executive Order No. 219.

Under EO 109, the law liberalizing the air transport industry, two
international carriers shall be designated as official carriers.

Additional airlines will only be designated if the first two fail to
meet passenger demand and are unable to use all the country's flight
entitlements under Air Service Agreements (ASA) with other countries.

"The application does not allege the urgent need for a new
international air carrier along the routes already being serviced or
applied for by GrandAir and Philippine Airlines. Specifically,
applicant failed to allege that the present designated carriers do not
service the total frequency entitlements of the Philippines under ASAs
or similar arrangement," Mr. Lucila said.

Air Philippines is majority-owned by plastics magnate William
Gatchalian and in part by three foreign groups. It currently flies to
Subic, Puerto Princesa, Davao, Tacloban, and Cagayan de Oro. It plans
to operate flights to the United States and countries within the Asia
Pacific region.

Philippine Ports Authority calls for selective liberalization

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 18

Relaxing the rules on interisland shipping to allow the participation
of foreign-owned vessels should be implemented on a regional basis, the
Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) said.

In a letter, PPA general manager Carlos Agustin told the Maritime
Industry Authority (Marina) that lifting the cabotage law should be
done in stages since a unilateral declaration will only favor foreign
shipping lines to the disadvantage of the local sector.

A memorandum of agreement (MOA) is pending approval by officials of the
Marina and the Bureau of Customs (BoC). It will allow non-Filipinos to
engage in coastwise trade which is being vigorously opposed by local
shipowners.

The PPA said that before implementing the proposal, both offices should
conduct intensive consultations with industry experts to determine its
constitutionality.

A similar appeal was made by the Domestic Shipping Association which
asked the Marina and the BoC to secure the official opinion of the
Department of Justice. However, the two are still inclined to go ahead
with the MOA, saying they have direct jurisdiction.

The PPA said a reciprocity clause wherein the same arrangement can also
be availed of by Filipino firms should be explored by the two agencies,
adding that not all ports in the country may be able to meet the
requirements of prospective clients.

Local firms have raised apprehensions that the move will cut them out
of the competition since foreign vessels can charge domestic rates
without paying the same taxes required from domestic ships.

Currently, foreign ships can only pick up and unload cargoes at the
Manila International Container Terminal and South Harbor. This setup,
officials said, slows down the flow of cargo traffic and stifles the
growth of exporters.

Based on the MOA, foreign vessels that will engage in coastwise trade
will have to secure two clearances, one from the BoC and another from
the Marina. A vessel authorized to unload import cargoes at a local
port will be allowed to pick up export cargoes destined for the
vessel's port of call abroad or to another local port.

Officials said the MOA will merely provide an alternative since the
final choice will depend on shippers.

Financing woes plague bus firms

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 18

By Conrad M. Carino

Are bus companies becoming unattractive to banks and financing
companies? Industry sources said the bus industry, already hurting from
multiple factors, is finding it difficult to finance the acquisition of
new buses. Likewise, creditors are having a hard time collecting loans
from bus companies.

Alex Yague, president of the Provincial Bus Operators Association of
the Philippines (PBOAP) said banks are becoming very selective in
financing bus acquisitions since many companies are already hurting.

"Tingnan mo, ang daming mga bulok na bus na tumatakbo sa (Look around,
there are a lot of dilapidated buses plying) Metro Manila," he declared.

Other bus companies said the industry is hurting from factors such as
the recent wage increases, diesel price hikes and the unified vehicle
reduction program (UVRP).

They said that unlike jeepney operators, bus companies employ office
staff and a regular maintenance work force which are paid fixed wages.
In addition, prices of spare parts and new buses are no longer cheap. A
12-meter air-conditioned bus now costs around P4 million, while an
11-meter air-conditioned unit sells at around P2.7 million.

Financing companies are willing to shoulder up to 70% of the
acquisition cost with an interest rate of around 18% to 20%. The most
acceptable collateral for bus acquisitions is real estate. The maximum
period for installment payments is three years.

Unlike automobile buyers, bus companies are not offered of
zero-interest loans, low downpayment and easy installment plans.

"Hindi iyan uso sa industriya (that is not practiced in the industry),"
a source who requested anonymity told BusinessWorld.

A check with SOH Technologies Corp., one of the top three manufacturers
of brake drums for heavy vehicles, also points to hard times for the
bus industry. Company president Leon Ang said this is evidenced by the
slow cash collections from his customers.

Most maintenance parts of buses are locally fabricated. These include
brake drums, brake shoes, suspension leafs, suspension mountings and
air cleaners.

Of the problems confronting the bus industry, the UVRP may have the
most telling effect. Metro Manila bus operators contend that the scheme
has resulted to an average loss of almost P2,000 per vehicle per day.

On the other hand, provincial bus operators say they incur a loss of up
to P5,000 per vehicle per day because their units cannot exit nor enter
Metro Manila-based terminals.

Mr. Yague said losses of bus companies from the UVRP are expected to be
reduced since the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) agreed to
issue exemption stickers to 10% of bus operators' fleets. The stickers
are yet to be issued to the bus operators.

If worse comes to worse, bus companies will start shutting down and the
big ones are not exempted. Mr. Yague said one bus company with more
than 250 units stopped operations early this year due to bankruptcy.

He said the industry hopes no other bus company will suffer this fate
since this will make banks become more wary in providing loans.

Share prices dip on profit taking

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 12

By Rosemarie V. Francisco

Profit takers took advantage of the correction in the US blue chips
marker Dow Jones Industrials last Tuesday to collect their gains in the
local market after its two-day uptrend.

"People took it as a cue to harvest profits," said Monique Lecaros,
analyst of Armstrong Securities, Inc.

The composite index fell 11.13 points, or 0.34%, to 3,248.59. The
market was weak throughout the session, sagging 25.66 points at the
most to 3,234.06 during intraday trades.

Value turnover narrowed 19.94% to P2.49 billion. If the block sales
totalling P373.87 million were taken out, peso volume will amount to
P2.11 billion, still within the P2 billion mark. This reflects some
level of foreign participation in the market.

Volume of shares eased 9.49% to 18.51 billion. Of the total 171 issues
traded, decliners routed advancers, 66 to 37, while 68 were unchanged.

The local market simply mirrored the movement in the Dow Jones. The US
market closed marginally lower 0.37 point to 5,888.83 last Tuesday due
to a news report which stated that eight out of 12 regional Federal
Bank presidents have asked for an increase of at least 0.25 percentage
point in the discount rate on direct loans to banks. The US bond market
also reacted as the long bond ended weaker.

Investors took this as a sign that the US Federal Reserve is keen on
increasing interest rates during its Sept. 24 meeting even if economic
data released last week showed that the growth of the US economy is
still manageable and will not put pressure on inflation.

However, Ms. Lecaros noted that the Dow Jones did not correct
significantly. "It was merely a hangover after the party," she said.
The Dow Jones posted record highs for two consecutive days earlier this
week. Previously, analysts said the local market will follow the trend
set by the Dow Jones and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT)
listed in New York. But yesterday, the market ignored the uptick in
PLDT of $0.625 to $64.25 and focused instead on the US market's key
indicator. Local PLDT shares slipped 1.18% to P1,675.

Ms. Lecaros believes the local market's slide yesterday was expected
and that investors just used the Dow Jones' correction as a reason to
heed cash calls. "This market has risen too much in the past two days.
The rise is so unsettling," she said. Thus, the trading results
yesterday was partly due to a technical correction, negative sentiments
after the Dow Jones slide, and profit taking, she added.

The Phisix gained 66.04 points in the past two days after weeks of
sluggish trades.

While the bullish sentiments of foreign fund managers towards the
country is not waning, they are taking a cautious view of Asian markets
given the possible hike in US interest rates.

One sector at a disadvantage is the property stocks. "The strategy of
foreign fund managers is to stay out of the property stocks until the
uncertainty in the US market is not erased," Ms. Lecaros said. Property
issues are sensitive to the movement in interest rates. When the US
implements a rate hike, local monetary authorities will have to adjust
local interest rates accordingly to prevent foreign funds from flowing
out of the country.

In turn, high interest rates do not augur well for property companies
as the cost of housing loans will become too pricey for consumers.

"Things will continue to be uncertain until the 24th... As long as
there are uncertainties in interest rates, we will continue to be just
paced by the Dow Jones," Ms. Lecaros said.

Trades will remain cautious. Stocks in the consumer and industrial
counter will be picked up by foreign fund managers as these are the
likely performers next year given their solid fundamentals, the analyst
said. Foreign fund managers are entering the country to position for
1997.

Sectoral averages were mixed. The commercial and industrial index
weakened 33.70 points, or 0.76% to 4,391.26, the mining sector by 14.49
points, or 0.50%, to 2,865.46. The property sector edged up 1.44
points, or 0.86%, to 168.87, the oil counter gained 0.03 point, or
0.47%, to 6.41.

Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. A slid 2.38% to P4,100 while B shares
were untraded. Stockholders of the firm approved the capital buildup
program of the bank which includes an increase in the authorized
capital stock to P8 billion from P800 million.

Bacnotan Cement added 2.94% to P17.50. The firm will be merging with
Central Cement Corp., with Bacnotan as the surviving entity.

Index stock Ayala Land gained 3.08% to P33.50. The firm will list
additional shares totalling 692.53 million to cover its 50% stock
dividend. Listing of the shares will be on Sept. 24.

Filinvest Land eased 4.26% to P9, same with Fil-Estate Land, 2.11% to
P23.25. New listing Ever Gotesco slid 1.69% to P1.16. Uniwide Holdings
remained at P5.30. Solid Group eased 1.64% to P6.00.

Dept of Envt and Natural Resources orders Cebu chemical firm to cease
operations

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 7

By Digna B. Verbo-Velasco

Cenapro Chemical Corp. has to stop operations as the Pollution
Adjudication Board (PAB) of the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (DENR) recently upheld its earlier decision to slap a cease
and desist order (CDO) against the firm.

PAB ruled Cenapro's plant in Cebu had continuously violated
Presidential Decree 984, otherwise known as the Anti-Pollution Law, by
emitting smoke which failed DENR's opacity standard.

PAB had issued the first CDO on the project in February 1993.

Cenapro immediately filed a motion for reconsideration, seeking a
temporary lifting order (TLO) to enable it to rehabilitate
anti-pollution devices.

PAB granted a 90-day TLO 16 days afterwards on condition Cenapro would
rehabilitate anti-pollution devices, pay the performance bond, and
adopt interim remedial measures to minimize pollution.

The TLO also directed DENR Region 7 to serve the order and monitor the
Cenapro's compliance.

Almost three and half years have passed since PAB issued the first TLO
and DENR Region 7 seemed satisfied with Cenapro's compliance with TLO
conditions.

DENR Region 7's recent inquiry, however, showed Cenapro's operations
continued to cause air pollution.

DENR Central Office and PAB concluded Cenapro's "management showed
unwillingness to comply with their commitments... and is deliberately
not complying and has no intention to comply with pollution laws."

PAB promptly ruled Cenapro's defiance merited reimposition of the
original CDO and corresponding fines on Cenapro.

But a source said the "ample time" PAB had given the firm to rectify
its systems may have demonstrated PAB's own "administrative lapses."

New beach resort and golf course to rise in Cebu

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 7

By Dirk J. Barreveld

CEBU CITY - San Remegio town, a small fishing and farming community 110
kilometers away from here, may soon sport a world-class beach resort
and golf course.

Lars Lofgren, chairman of Sun Reno Development Corp. which will start
this project by early next year, said the other day it will take his
firm three years to complete the project.

San Remegio's beach had been inaccessible due to bad roads, until an
Asian Development Bank-funded project had modernized the main road. Mr.
Lofgren said his firm envisions the Sun Reno Golf and Country Club to
attract international visitors, mainly from Europe, and to provide
employment for at least 1,000 local residents. This project includes a
350-room hotel, 150 bungalows, a marina, a beach park and swimming
pools.

The project is still waiting for the Environment Management Bureau to
issue its environment compliance certificate.

San Remegio mayor Artemio Masbate said the San Remegio municipal
council has already endorsed the project. The council has also issued a
resolution converting the site from agricultural to a tourism area.
This is the second tourism project in the area to avail of the
three-year tax holiday the municipal government grants to locators with
capital of at least P5 million.

But observers are cautious, saying this project will succeed only if
plans were well prepared.

They recalled the case of Cebu Green Island, a Japanese investment
group that established a similar facility in Badian on Cebu's west
coast. This project halted after only a few years of operation due to
financial difficulty. San Remegio residents have urged their municipal
council to ensure Sun Reno's project will be properly constructed and
managed.

Gov"t fails to stop illegal quarrying in Or. Mindoro

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 7

By Grave V. de Guzman

Government officials may have allowed illegal quarrying to continue
along the coast of barangay San Antonio, Gloria in Oriental Mindoro.

"Residents of the area have asked their local officials to act on the
matter but... quarrying operations continue. In fact, hollow blocks
molding is also done in the area," Demokratikong Kilusang Magbubukid ng
Pilipinas (DKMP) president Jaime Tadeo told BusinessWorld yesterday.

He said the Mining Act of 1995 prohibits quarrying within 200 meters
from the shoreline because this causes erosion.

Mr. Tadeo said quarrying in the area which began in 1991 has adversely
affected coconut farms. He said these operations have uprooted at least
100 coconut trees.

Mr. Tadeo claimed poor enforcement of the law by the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and "connivance" of local
officials and the Philippine National Police (PNP) had allowed the
quarry's owner to proceed with operations.

"To stop quarrying activities and to confiscate pay loaders and trucks,
DENR Region 4 should order community environment and natural resources
officers to coordinate with the PNP," Mr. Tadeo said.

He also claimed Mr. Capistrano was able to secure permit to operate
from erring local government officials. He explained only local
government units can grant permits to quarry in areas measuring less
than five hectares.

DKMP has asked DENR to investigate this matter.

Fishkill hounds Hopewell plant

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 7

By Miguel M. Cortez

PAGBILAO - Seventy hectares of mangrove became a deathbed for schools
of fish when toxic liquid burst from walls of an ash lagoon of a
coal-fired power plant here last August 30.

A source at the site told BusinessWorld a breach in the dike of ash
lagoon number two of the 700-megawatt $850-million plant here of
Hopewell Power (Phils.) Corp. was responsible for the death of such
varieties as lapu-lapu, banak and samaral. This plant, which is the
country's biggest coal-fired thermal power plant, forms part of the
15-year power development program of the National Power Corp. (Napocor).

The source said plant workers had repaired the breach, which measured
five meters long and five m. deep, after gathering the dead fish. One
worker who cooked some of the lapu-lapu refrained from eating more,
saying the meat tasted "like mud."

Plant station manager George Markin declined to be interviewed, saying
he was not in a position to answer inquiries on the accident.

BusinessWorld called offices of the Department of Environment and
Natural Resources and Hopewell in Manila but their officers were all
attending meetings. One Napocor official, who requested anonymity,
tried to distance Napocor from this issue, saying Hopewell's Pagbilao
plant had begun operations only last June and that Napocor was supposed
to only monitor the plant's operations.

But the same plant's test run in September last year had reportedly
resulted in a fishkill in the area. The Quezon provincial board, which
then attributed the fishkill to the plant's allegedly indiscriminate
dumping of toxic waste in nearby waters, passed a resolution two months
later threatening to close down the plant should inquiries prove the
plant's adverse impact on the environment.

Plant officials had then denied responsibility for the reported
fishkill, saying the plant observed environment laws. One official
said, for instance, the plant's environment compliance certificate
allowed Hopewell to convert the affected mangrove into an ash lagoon.

The same official said a tripartite monitoring group meets every month
to scrutinize the plant's activities, including those related to
anti-pollution efforts. But BusinessWorld discovered the group, which
used to meet at the Pagbilao town hall, has not convened for several
months now.

Pagbilao councilor Jimmy Zaporteza, former chairman of the
multisectoral Buklod Pagbilao which opposes the plant, noted only Mayor
Conrado de Rama represented the municipal government in the monitoring
group. Mr. Zaporteza also scored the group's lack of transparency in
conducting its meetings.

Bear Stearns urges gov"t to issue new money bonds

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

By Maricris C. Carlos

Anticipating continued strength in investors' appetite for the
country's new uncollateralized bonds, a global investment bank has
urged government to invest in New Money Bonds (NMB), said to be
higher-yielding than local bonds.

In a recently released paper, New York-based Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc.
said it foresees yield from the Philippines' Brady bond swap to be at
par with the Eurobonds issued by the National Power Corp. (Napocor).

"Assuming the Philippines succeeds in completing its bond exchange,
there should be a convergence between yields on the remaining Brady
bonds and the (existing) sovereign-rated euro issues," Bear Stearns
said.

Earlier, Napocor issued about $100-million Eurobonds to bankroll its
infrastructure projects. The bonds were guaranteed by the National
Government.

Eurobonds are corporate or government-denominated bonds sold in a
currency other than the national currency of the issuer.

The US investment bank said investors should be offered to buy NMBs
which is seen to have a higher cash flow yield than Napocor at 9% in
2002. On the other hand, it admitted NMBs have "shorter average life."

An NMB is a type of debt instrument issued by government in the 80s to
generate additional funding for government projects.

Early this month, government announced it will retire $1.9 billion of
its Brady bonds by swapping them with new debt.

Finance Secretary Roberto F. de Ocampo said government plans to issue
at least $200 million of 20-year fixed-rate and $200 million of 15-year
floating-rate bonds.

The Philippines has set a 7% US Treasury benchmark rate to be used in
determining the price and yields of the bond swaps, arranger J.P.
Morgan yesterday said.

The rate gives the 2017 bond exchange a yield of 8.3% on a price of
$823.43 per $1,000 of principal. The 2018 exchange bond yield is also
8.3% on a price of $827.18 per $1,000 principal amount. The minimum
fixed rate bond exchange yield is 9.25%.

The bond swap was developed based on a model set by Mexico, the first
to use the so-called Brady plan to restructure defaulted commercial
debt in 1989. Mexico was also the first to swap Bradys for new bonds.

The scheme removes US Treasuries as collateral and allows yield-hungry
investors to obtain straight exposure to the economy and their
high-yielding assets.

International credit rating agencies Duff & Phelps and Standard &
Poor's have assigned a "BB" rating to the bonds, to be issued in
exchange for the Brady Par Bonds, Series A and B.

Government is offering 15-year floating rate bonds and 20-year fixed
rate bonds, with interest yields to be fixed on September 18. With the
move, it also hopes to reduce by 17% the country's outstanding debt
stock. - with report from Reuter

Gov"t to rely more on foreign loans

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1

So as not to crowd out the private sector, the government is leaning
more on foreign borrowings rather than domestic loans.

Budget Secretary Salvador Enriquez Jr. yesterday said the move is meant
to give the private sector increased access to domestic credit and, in
the process, lower interest rates.

He said the change is a "desirable" action since the government will
not crowd out private firms tapping domestic funds.

With the government's limited presence in the domestic loan market,
interest rates are expected to go down which will allow more private
corporations to access additional funds for expansion.

Data submitted by the Department of Budget and Management show the
government in the last three years had been dependent on domestic
borrowings.

In 1994, it borrowed P668 billion from local sources. This increased to
P724 billion in 1995 and P777 billion in 1996. Projected domestic debt
for 1997 is P820 billion.

Foreign debt in 1994 was P397 billion, but dipped to P390 billion in
1995 and P377 billion in 1996. It is expected to further decrease to
P368 billion next year.

Budget assistant secretary Narcisa Santos told a Senate budget hearing
the government intends to bridge the gap between the growth of foreign
loans and domestic borrowings.

"Local borrowings (by the government) really crowd out the private
sector for available credit," she said.

Mr. Enriquez said foreign borrowings would be more beneficial to the
country since these have lower interest rates.

Next year, interest payment on the total foreign loans is pegged at
P74.2 billion while principal amortization is placed at P43.5 billion.

Total borrowings for 1997 are placed at P1.18 trillion composed of P820
billion of domestic loans and P377 billion of foreign borrowings.

Mr. Enriquez said the country will have to continue its dependence on
borrowings despite the existence of the build-operate-transfer (BOT)
scheme meant to increase private sector participation in economic
building.

He said the BOT "can only go so far" and could not be solely relied on
by the government. "We need to unify everything, borrowings, savings
and BOT."

He added there's no need to worry about the balance of payments since
the government has a "good standing" with almost P5 billion.

He pointed out the public and legislators need not worry about the
government's possible abuse of getting loans since there is a law which
limits foreign borrowings to $10 billion at any given time.

Public sector surplus hits P14 billion in first half

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1

Improved revenue performance enabled the government to realize a
surplus of P14.1 billion in its consolidated public sector financial
position (CPSFP) in the first half of 1996, data from the Department of
Finance (DoF) show.

A year ago, a surplus of P4.1 billion was recorded.

The consolidated public sector balance represents the fiscal position
of the National Government, including its agencies and
"instrumentalities."

The DoF cited increased tax collection as well as improved performance
by other monitored public sector entities - the Social Security System
(SSS), the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), the Bangko
Sentral, government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCC), and
government financial institutions (GFI).

According to the DoF, a major factor is the P9.7-billion fiscal surplus
enjoyed by the National Government during the period.

The bulk of the surplus came from the Bureau of Customs, which exceeded
its programmed collection by P3 billion.

Improved net cash flows amounting to P8.3 billion from the SSS and the
GSIS also contributed, as well as the net income of the Bangko Sentral
of P5.5 billion.

The net income of GFIs amounting to some P2.7 billion as well as the
lower-than-programmed deficit incurred by monitored GOCCs helped.

The DoF expected GOCCs to incur a deficit of P10.96 billion but the
actual figure registered was just P9.15 billion.

Finance Secretary Roberto F. de Ocampo said "the surplus generated by
the consolidated public sector has helped dampen inflation and interest
rates."

From 11.8% in March, inflation dropped to 7.9% in August. The
bell-weather 91-day Treasury bill rate also declined from 13.2% last
May to 11.3% in yesterday's auction.

"These developments will help boost the country's growth performance to
the higher range of 7% to 7.5% during the year," he added.

Although the Finance chief sees "an acceleration of infrastructure
spending" during the rest of the year, he said this is not expected to
erode the surplus.

The government is eyeing a zero CPSD for next year.

Huge CPSD had handicapped the Philippine economy for almost two decades
due to the dismal performance of GOCCs and GFIs, which in the past have
transferred liabilities to the National Government.

Earlier, Mr. de Ocampo warned the country faces a P14-billion deficit
in its CPSFP next year if Congress fails to pass the controversial
Comprehensive Tax Reform Package (CTRP).

He said there's that danger considering no firm alternatives have been
identified on where the government should source the P13.6 billion it
expects to forgo without the CTRP.

Malacanang to "force" version of "sin" taxes

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1

By Ronald F. Jabal, Paul N. Villegas and Jemileen U. Nuqui

Malacanang will force its hand and play hard ball when the proposed
excise taxes on "sin" products reach the bicameral conference
committee. And, eventually, it will win.

A high-ranking leader of the House of Representatives, who requested
not to be named, told BusinessWorld Malacanang is not willing to settle
for anything less than what was agreed on in a recent
Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC).

In his weekly press conference yesterday, President Ramos expressed
optimism the Senate will fine-tune Malacanang's version of the
Comprehensive Tax Reform Package (CTRP) when it starts to tackle the
excise portion passed last week by the House of Representatives.

Mr. Ramos said he is banking on the Senate to come up with a better
version of the excise tax system.

"The Senate still has to put out its own version... They (Senate)
cannot go ahead of the House when it comes to tax or revenue
appropriation measures. But now that they have it, then they can go on
putting their own revisions," Mr. Ramos said.

The Ramos government is pushing for a specific tax scheme for "sin
products" under the excise tax portion of the CTRP, which is expected
to generate an annual revenue collection of P13 billion. The Budget
department has incorporated this projected figure in its 1997 budget.

Should the Senate pass a version different from that of Malacanang, Mr.
Ramos said he will remind both Chambers of their promise to harmonize
their versions during the bicameral conference committee.

Malacanang is counting on the promises made by Senate ways and means
committee chairman Juan Ponce Enrile and finance committee chief
Ernesto Maceda to pass the version that will generate the most revenues.

LEDAC members earlier agreed to support an outright shift to specific
tax from the present ad valorem tax on both beer and cigarettes.
However, the Lower House "selectively" followed the agreement. It
approved a shift to specific tax on beer products while it approved a
"de facto" ad valorem tax on cigarettes.

This alarmed the Palace, the source said. If the Senate does not
deliver, the Executive is left with no recourse but to "force its hand"
in the bicameral conference committee, the House source said. "It will
strongly lobby for the passage of a specific tax on all sin products...
Eventually, the President's word will prevail," he said.

The source referred to a letter of Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo
to the House leadership dated May 29, a copy of which was obtained by
BusinessWorld, to bolster his claims. He said Mr. de Ocampo asked the
House Majority Leader, Isabela Rep. Rodolfo Albano, to help in the
passage of a version as close as possible to the Finance department's
proposal and a formula "that the President can accept."

The DoF-backed formula calls for a specific tax as the basis for
computing and assessing tax liability. However, a quarterly computation
of tax liability on an ad valorem basis by the Bureau of Internal
Revenue via market sampling at the retail level will also be
undertaken. Should the ad valorem computation result in a higher tax
take for the government, the difference would be treated as an
additional tax liability.

The source quoted the Finance official as saying, "We must endeavor to
pass a version that adheres as closely as possible to the main elements
of the (DoF formula) and that the President can accept," he said.

"This only means Malacanang will not accept anything that does not
conform with its formula...We can expect then a 'seen' hand in the
(bicameral conference committee discussions)," the source said.

This has always been the fear of Makati Rep. Joker Arroyo who said
whatever legislation Congress approves is always mangled in the
bicameral conference committee. "It (bicameral conference committee)
has become a modern-day Frankenstein," he said. However, he is hoping
House committee on ways and means chairman Antique Rep. Exequiel Javier
does not renege on his commitment not to allow anybody to mangle the
House version.

This developed as House Speaker Jose de Venecia, Jr. yesterday
instructed the ways and means committee to fast-track the consideration
of the last component of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Package - the
income tax reforms and the tax administration reforms.

He sought the immediate passage of the tax measure increasing the
exemption of wage earners and exempting families living below the
poverty line and overseas contract workers from paying income tax.

The CTRP calls for an increase of exemption to a uniform P20,000 from
the present P9,000 for single individuals, P12,000 for heads of the
family and P18,000 for married individuals.

Meanwhile, House Minority Leader San Juan Rep. Ronaldo Zamora yesterday
pushed for an increased income tax exemptions for separated women and
single parents. He, however, failed to state up to what level the
increase in exemptions should be. At present, single parents can claim
only a P12,000 deduction as head of the family. He also called for the
exemption of the first P150,000 annual income of couples with four
dependents.

In a related development, the approval of the proposed P476.2-billion
national budget for next year will not be delayed even if the CTRP is
not in place, said Senate Majority Leader Alberto Romulo.

He said Congress can deliberate on the budget and the CTRP at the same
time since the two measures "go together."

Sen. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, economic affairs committee chairman,
added Congress can approve the budget based on projected revenues.

She told BusinessWorld legislators do not expect any delay in the
passage of the 1997 budget because Congress or the Executive can
exercise the authority to cut expenditures.

Mr. Romulo said both Houses have enough time to approve the CTRP and
the budget as long as solons have political will.

"Since the budget relies on revenues, the two proposals go together and
will be passed on time," he added.

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1

By Veronica C. Silva

First of two parts

All eyes were focused on the elections in the Autonomous Region for
Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) last Sept. 9. Though the region represents less
than 3% of the country's total voting population, the elections were of
national importance.

Some say for newly proclaimed governor Nur Misuari, who ran
unchallenged, last week's elections were a baptism of fire: a test of
whether or not the Moro National Liberation Front's covenant with the
government heralds the coming of peace in the region. If the reports of
election-related violence were used as a measuring stick, he would pass
with flying colors. Both the Commission on Elections (Comelec) and the
National Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel) reported "minor"
incidents of such violence, even describing the ARMM elections as
"boring" and "dull."

Equally significant is that the computerized election system the
government is planning for the national polls in 1988 was pilot-tested
in ARMM. Republic Act No. 8046, enacted in June 1995, authorized the
pilot testing of the system which will facilitate the holding of clean,
honest and orderly elections.

Almost all those who closely monitored the ARMM elections agree the
pilot test was successful in terms of speeding up the counting and
canvassing of votes. Mr. Misuari and his running mate, Guimid Matalam,
were proclaimed winners after 48 hours. But, then again, they needed
only one vote each to win since there were no other candidates.

There is still room for improvement, said Rizal Rep. Emigdio S.
Tanjuatco, Jr., chairman of the House of Representatives committee on
suffrage and electoral reforms, and a member of the pilot-test
oversight committee.

"The automated counting system, which minimized almost to nil human
intervention and then speeded up the counting, really addresses the
problem of dagdag-bawas - the manipulation or falsification of election
returns and statement of votes," he told BusinessWorld. "However, the
functioning of the (counting) machine can stand some improvements." He
also sees the need to streamline procedures.

Some of the problems observed during the pilot test, such as wet
ballots, were not technology-related but nonetheless affected the
performance of the machines.

Much is expected from the computerization of elections, but many agree
the electoral system needs more than a technological face-lift. While
technology helps automate some steps, relying on it to solve
election-related problems is only accomplishing half the task.

The project to computerize elections has had its share of criticisms.
Issues such as the high cost involved, voters' attitude and security
risks were raised.

When RA 8046 was enacted last year, the next task was to look for the
appropriate technology to do the job.

During the tenure of Comelec chairman Christian Monsod, consultants
from the information technology (IT) industry, local and foreign, were
tapped to evaluate the available technology.

But when current chairman Bernardo P. Pardo took over, the Comelec did
the evaluation itself. Executive director Resurreccion Z. Borra said
the poll body even insisted on its independence from the National
Computer Center, an agency under the Office of the President.

For its purposes, Comelec chose the American Information Systems, Inc.
(AIS) counting machine which uses an optical scanning device to "read"
the ballots fed from a paper tray.

Comelec acquired 40 units of the AIS Model 150 which can read 150
ballots per minute.

The machine eliminates problems related to erroneous entries in vote
tallying since little human intervention is involved, said Alwin S.
Sta. Rosa, Comelec director for Management Information Systems.

In the ARMM elections, one counting machine was provided for every two
municipalities. Only authorized personnel were allowed to operate it.
It recorded the number of votes counted in a 3.5" diskette. A printer
produced a hard copy and this document was used by the Namfrel in
conducting an unofficial tally of the votes through its Akbay Bilang
Center.

The Comelec used a personal computer (PC) to consolidate municipal
results and produce the provincial count. A computer program developed
by AIS - Election Reporting System (ERS) - was used to consolidate the
votes. A hard copy of the results was also produced.

One of the major issues raised about the computerization of elections
was security.

Namfrel's earlier concern was the use of the 3.5" diskette, fearing
that since this diskette is commercially available, it is easy to
switch diskettes and tamper with the data.

RA 8046 specifies the use of "memory packs," in this case, a diskette,
to store data or the election tally.

Comelec officials assured security measures were put in place to
guarantee the sanctity of the ballot.

Mr. Sta. Rosa said each diskette was pre-coded and encrypted to ensure
no switching would go undetected by the system. Should the PC user
insert a diskette whose code could not be read, the computer program
will reject it. Should diskette switching take place, the results will
be invalidated.

Should this happen, whether or not special elections would be allowed
is not yet clear.

Comelec officials said the computer printouts provide the audit trails
for the new system. Officials said should there be a discrepancy
between the diskette and the printout, the latter will be used as the
official document.

In an interview before the ARMM elections, Mr. Borra told BusinessWorld
Comelec personnel anticipated bad weather and the lack of
transportation as potential problems. Some areas in Marawi City and
Tawi-Tawi, for example, are 18 to 20 hours away from the provincial
capital where the counting machines are located. He said these could
delay the centralized counting of the votes.

Mr. Borra also then said some ballots to be transported across the seas
have to be carefully handled because if these get wet, the counting
machine would not be able to read them. Mr. Sta. Rosa, on the other
hand, assured the Comelec staff were prepared for possible technical
problems, saying technicians were trained to do troubleshooting on
site. He added that should one counting machine bogs down, there were
backup machines.

More than one counting machine and PC were located in a provincial
counting center where the votes were to be consolidated. Lanao, the
largest voting province in the region, had the most number of machines
at 19, Mr. Sta. Rosa said.

No matter how prepared the Comelec and its deputies were, the ARMM
pilot project was beset by problems, many of which were not
technology-related.

With the new technology, the Comelec projected the voter turnout at the
ARMM elections at between 80% and 85%. Mr. Borra said the commission
was hoping the voters would go out and vote, the new system
guaranteeing the security of their ballots. However, over a week has
passed and the Comelec still has to announce the official voter
turnout. Mr. Borra said the earliest the Comelec can announce the
official number is tomorrow.

Counting in some areas has been quite slow because of moist ballots
which could not be fed to the counting machine.

Mr. Tanjuatco observed humidity caused the ballots to stick together,
causing frequent paper jams.

"If this happens often, then your rate per minute will go down instead
of attaining 150 ballots per minute," the solon said.

Moisture from heavy rains and turbulent seas seeped into the windows of
the ballot boxes, noted Mr. Borra. Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao
experienced heavy rains on election day and the first day of counting.
The ballots had to be dried first before these could be fed to the
machines.

Mr. Borra said the Comelec had wrapped the ballots with cellophane or
plastic before distribution to polling centers but they still got wet.
For the next elections, he suggested windowless ballot boxes or other
protective covering to better protect the ballots.

Another problem noted was the long queues both at the polling centers
and the reception areas for the ballot boxes. For this, Namfrel
chairman Jose S. Concepcion, Jr. blamed "controls in the bureaucracy."

He said some election officials did not know Namfrel volunteers were to
be given copies of the printout for the group's quick count. Some
election officials insisted on the bureaucratic procedure: some asked
their supervisors for permission while others insisted they compile the
printout before giving Namfrel the copies. He said this defeated the
whole purpose of conducting a quick count.

Mr. Concepcion also mentioned an election official putting all copies
of the printout inside the ballot box. Under RA 8046, the copies of the
printout should be distributed to the majority and minority parties and
the election officer. Only one copy of the printout and the diskette go
into the ballot box.

Members of the Board of Election Inspectors were required to sign the
printout. However, Mr. Concepcion noticed the signatures were mere
formalities because the teachers who were supposed to witness the
functioning of the machine do not appear to be computer literate. They
did not know whether there were any errors in the procedures.

Mr. Concepcion also related that when the counting machine bogged down,
one of the board of election inspectors, a teacher who was assigned to
the machine, cannot or maybe has forgotten how to operate it. This
confusion contributed to the long lines outside the counting centers,
he said.

Technical problems compounded by bad weather delayed the regional
canvass of the ARMM elections.

The regional board of canvassers, headed by Mr. Borra, convened at the
Comelec office in Manila on Sept. 10, but no certificates of canvass
and diskettes arrived until early the following day. Mr. Borra,
however, expected this, saying the board was supposed to consolidate
the results as soon as the diskettes arrived.

Mr. Borra said these problems were anticipated and did not affect the
schedule of the counting and proclamation. He said Messrs. Misuari and
Matalam were proclaimed governor and vice-governor of ARMM on Sept. 11,
still within the 48-hour schedule the poll body has set. The 21
assemblymen for the seven districts of ARMM were all proclaimed two
days after.

Without the computerized system, observers said it could have taken
more than a week to complete the canvass of votes for a region with
close to a million registered voters like ARMM.

FVR denies involvement in Charter changes plan

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

President Ramos is keeping his distance from recent moves in the House
of Representatives to amend the Constitution to allow him to extend his
term beyond 1998.

During his weekly press conference yesterday, Mr. Ramos denied changing
his mind on the matter.

"My position is that my time, the time of the people, the time of
Congress, the time of all responsible Filipinos should be devoted to
getting our legislative program finished so that we shall have a
sustainable economic development," he said.

The Chief Executive said recent moves in the Lower House to change the
Constitution is not the sole domain of lawmakers belonging to the
administration party Lakas-NUCD. He noted a Nacionalista Party
congressman from Iloilo is one of the main proponents of Charter
changes.

"If some Lakas are involved there, they are just supporting or
responding or reacting to earlier initiatives by some members of
Congress," Mr. Ramos said.

The President has repeatedly said he will not seek reelection when his
term expires in 1998.

But he dismissed the possibility that Lakas will institute disciplinary
actions against partymates who continue to initiate moves in amending
the Charter.

"These are not criminally punishable acts on the part of the party
members," he said.

Meanwhile, House Speaker Jose de Venecia yesterday said the House
leadership does not support plans to amend the 1987 Constitution.

"It has been put in the back burner and it will remain there," said Mr.
de Venecia in a statement.

But Lakas-NUCD party whip for Mindanao and Bukidon Rep. Jose Zubiri
confirmed that several congressmen are soliciting public support for
the plan to amend the Constitution.

Meanwhile, Malabon-Navotas Rep. Tessie Aquino Oreta challenged her
colleagues and President Ramos to enter into a written "covenant" with
the people that they will all step down in 1998.

"If the President cannot accept the challenge of showing sincerity on
his pronouncements that he will give up Malacanang in 1998, we, in the
Lower House, should show the way that Malacanang may follow our
example," she said.

Gov"t consultants get P700,000 monthly

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Senators were asked yesterday to check on the reported hiring of
foreign consultants at very high salaries by several government
agencies. Senator Juan Flavier yesterday said it is necessary to look
into the situation since the fees, which range between P300,000 and
P700,000 per month for every consultant, appears questionable. "We may
not have all the expertise for government programs but I find it hard
to accept that they (foreign consultants) are being paid so much," he
said. Data from the office of the senator showed a foreign consultant
in the Health department received as much as P700,000 per month
excluding per diems and travel allowances. A consultant of the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), meanwhile,
receives a monthly salary of P390,000. In another DENR project, 116
foreign consultants were hired on "call basis" with salaries ranging
from P2,000 to P9,000 a day. A project to rehabilitate Pasig River
allotted P30 million for the salaries of six consultants or P5 million
per consultant for the entire program. Mr. Flavier said the practice of
hiring foreign consultants has to be regulated because it could lead to
abuse and misspending. "We need a clear government policy on this
matter." He disclosed the agencies should not hire consultants left and
right since the money, usually loans, utilized for projects has to be
repaid by the government.

Dept of Health warns hospitals on wastes

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Government and private hospitals are in for a rough time once the
health department finds out which ones are not complying with proper
waste management disposal practices. Health Secretary Carmencita
Reodica yesterday issued a stern warning to erring hospital
administrations that their service licenses will be revoked should they
fail to meet the minimum requirements set for sanitation facilities. In
a briefing with reporters, Ms. Reodica stressed the importance of a
hospital incinerator as part of the overall health program of the
country. However, due to the high cost of purchasing an incinerator,
the lady chief said hospitals should instead encourage a waste
management disposal networking scheme wherein groups of hospitals may
avail of the services of a common contractor. An incinerator costs
about P4 million. Based on a 1994-1995 report of the Environmental
Health Services of the Department of Health (DoH), majority of the 45
government hospitals failed to meet the requirements for sanitation
facilities. It likewise revealed that hospital personnel practices on
hospital waste management is "far from ideal." Of the 45 hospitals,
only six have their own incinerators: National Kidney Institute, San
Lazaro Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Center for Mental
Health, Vicente Sotto Hospital in Davao and Cullon Hospital in Palawan.
Private hospitals with incinerators are East Avenue Medical Center,
Rizal Medical Center, Orthopedic Hospital and Jose Fabella Memorial
Hospital.

Charge corrupt prosecutors, public urged

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Justice Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. yesterday urged the public to
file formal complaints against corrupt prosecutors. This is after the
Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) promised to submit a
list of corrupt prosecutors to the justice department yesterday. Mr.
Guingona also asked the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to look
into reports that "fix-cals" abound, particularly in the provinces.
Meanwhile, DILG Secretary Robert Barbers yesterday asked Mr. Guingona
to take action against two prosecutors who allegedly mishandled two
cases. Mr. Barbers said Quezon City assistant prosecutor Hilda
Fantastico-Ibuyan issued "a highly irregular and contradictory
resolution" in the extortion case against a policeman. Also irregular
was the dismissal by Pasig City prosecutor Eduardo R. Garcia of the
case against a suspected drug dealer operating in the Taguig, he said.
But Mr. Guingona said the DILG should first submit evidence against
prosecutors Ibuyan and Garcia before he can order an investigation.
Meanwhile, Mr. Barbers also requested Chief Presidential Legal Counsel
Renato Cayetano to ask the Supreme Court to review the life
imprisonment penalty imposed by a Manila court Monday on Malaysian drug
trafficker Allan Khor Monday. The DILG chief said the convict should
have been sentenced to death. Also yesterday, he directed Police Chief
Supt. Reynaldo Wycoco to check on the issuance of a firearm to Khor by
the Police Firearms and Explosives Division (FED). The convict is an
illegal alien, thus he cannot be granted a license to own and carry a
firearm, said Mr. Barbers.

US thanks RP for terrorists arrest

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Washington has expressed its appreciation to the Ramos government's
contribution to the conviction in New York in September 5 of terrorists
Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, Abdul Hakim Murad, and Wali Khan Amin Shah. In a
letter to President Ramos, US ambassador to the Philippines Thomas
Hubbard congratulated Philippine law enforcement agencies for their
close cooperation which led to the expeditious resolution of the
criminal cases filed against the three terrorists in New York. Mr.
Yousef and his two companions were found guilty by a US court for
plotting to bomb American airlines. The other convicted terrorists were
arrested by law enforcers in Manila in January 1995 while Yousef fled
to Pakistan where he was later arrested. "We look forward to continuing
this cooperation," Mr. Hubbard wrote in his letter.

President Ramos yesterday approved the request of the Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) for more time to revaluate bids submitted
by three port container firms for the development and operation of the
container terminal at the Subic Bay Freeport Zone. The SBMA was
supposed to have come out with its decision on the winning bidder
yesterday. It sued for more time given difficulties in evaluating bids.
The SBMA was earlier ordered to reevaluate the bids of International
Container Terminal Services, Inc. (ICTSI), Hutchison Ports Philippines,
Inc. and Royal Ports Services, Inc. after ICTSI questioned the award of
the contract to Hutchison despite having made the highest bid.

Gov"t not to blame for dike breach - DPWH

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Public Works Secretary Gregorio Vigilar yesterday said government
engineers who designed the P1.4-billion Pampanga megadike should not be
blamed for breaches in the structure. He instead pointed to private
contractor Altantic Erectors, Inc. which he accused of failing to
follow government specifications of the engineers while building the
structure. "There must be proof that the design is wrong. We don't feel
these people (in DPWH) have to be convicted," said Mr. Vigilar in a
Senate hearing. The megadike was designed the Bureau of Designs of the
Department of Public Works and Highways. He said the DPWH would admit
responsibility for faulty design only if specifications were met and
the dike still collapsed.

Police officials allegedly purchased 30 defective Kawasaki 750 cc
motorcycles for security escorts during the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) meeting in November, said a source at the Traffic
Management Command (TMC) yesterday. Motorcycle policemen are
complaining of defective clutches, oil leaks, loose screws, loose
blinkers and weak sirens, the source said. Also, the motorcycles are
only for hobbyists and are not suited for patrolling streets. "It looks
like the manufacturer just added police accessories to the P225,000
bike," the source said. The police spent in June an estimated P6.8
million for the bikes, including helmets which did not pass police
specifications.

Nothing final on gov"t-Moro Islamic Liberation Front talks

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

There is nothing final with the planned peace negotiations between the
government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), said President
Ramos during his weekly press conference yesterday.

Also, a ceasefire agreement between the two is not expected to be
signed today.

Mr. Ramos said negotiations with the MILF, a splinter group of the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF), are being coursed through back
channels since the government has yet to map out formal talks.

"What we are doing now is preliminary talks through the back channel,
nothing official. But I can assure you that there is a lot of friendly
back channeling efforts being done by peace advocates as well as local
officials," he said.

The Chief Executive also said the government's peace strategy with the
MILF is similar with its strategy with the MNLF.

"Of course, we hope that one with the MILF will not last that many
months or years. After all, we have started already with the MNLF. The
difference, however, between formal talks or negotiating talks must be
made," Mr. Ramos said.

The MILF has been critical against the government's peace accord with
the MNLF, particularly on the creation of the Southern Philippines
Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD), which will oversee peace and
development projects in 14 provinces and nine cities in Mindanao.

It may be noted the MILF wants complete autonomy for Mindanao.

Mr. Ramos also said he has issued a memorandum on the creation of a
special task force to oversee peace negotiations with the MILF and
other enemies of the state.

Meanwhile, MNLF officials yesterday asked the Senate to conduct an
investigation into the alleged involvement of four politicians and
former military men with Christian vigilante groups in Mindanao.

This is after the MNLF accused businessmen and politicians with
business interests in Mindanao of spearheading moves against the
establishment of the SPCPD.

In a forum at Club Filipino in Greenhills, MNLF legal counsel Blo
Adiong claimed these businessmen and politicians also floated a "white
paper" which said the SPCPD will "Islamize" Mindanao.

The white paper was reportedly circulated in Zamboanga and Cotabato.

Mr. Adiong claims these politicians and businessmen "are the same
personalities that have big business in Mindanao."

Earlier, South Cotabato Rep. Daisy Avance-Fuentes, Department of
Interior and Local Government undersecretary Alvin Dans, Sultan Kudarat
Mayor Gonzalo de Pedro and former South Cotabato mayor Eddie Juanche
were named in a military report as supporters of militia groups in
Mindanao.

But Ms. Avance-Fuentes and Mr. Dans denied the allegation. Military
officials also said the report was unconfirmed.

Military and police operatives, meanwhile, are now looking into the
alleged involvement of a prominent businessmen in Zamboanga City with
the Mindanao Christian Unified Command (MCUC).

Meanwhile, former MNLF spokesman Datu Ibrahim Uy Alhadj, now chairman
of the Bangsa Moro Holdings Inc., also said Christian militia groups
are harmless compared with the MILF and the Abu Sayyaf.

"They (militia groups) are not capable of creating violent attacks and
take arms against the government and other Muslims," he said.

Meanwhile, MNLF chairman and new Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao
(ARMM) governor Nur Misuari is expected to join negotiations with the
MNLF.

Presidential Management Staff chief Alexander Aguirre yesterday said
the MNLF will be consulted the MILF peace talks since a large
concentration of Islamic Front is in the ARMM.

Earlier, Mr. Misuari reportedly planned to distance himself from the
proposed talks, saying that is "solely the initiative of the
government."

Meanwhile, senators yesterday vowed to block the proposed P230-million
budget for the integration of MNLF members into the Philippine National
Police (PNP) unless the government can provide a clear program for
rebel disarmament.

Senate Minority Leader Edgardo Angara said the lack of a disarmament
plan for MNLF forces, particularly those excluded from the integration
scheme, is a source of apprehension among people in Mindanao.

Death penalty legal

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Although it is not necessary to pass upon the constitutionality of the
death penalty, the Supreme Court should pass judgment on the
correctness of death sentences imposed by trial courts.

Thus recommended Jesuit priest and lawyer Joaquin Bernas,
vice-president of the 1987 Constitutional Commission, in a 23-page
memorandum submitted yesterday to the High Court.

He also asked the High Tribunal to formulate guidelines for trial
courts to follow in imposing death sentences.

The Supreme Court had asked Fr. Bernas to give his recommendations
after death row convict Pedro Malabago questioned the constitutionality
of the heinous crimes law. A lower court had sentenced Malabago to
death after it found him guilty of killing his wife.

Fr. Bernas said Congress did not violate the Constitution when it
enacted Republic Act 7659 which paved the way for the reimposition of
the death penalty by classifying several crimes as heinous. But it is
the duty of courts to examine the validity of the classification.

"The fact that Congress has listed a crime in the books as heinous does
not settle everything. Congressional definitions are not always
conclusive. It is the same when Congress labels a crime as heinous.
Crimes do not exist in books. Crime exist in life. And life is not
univocal," said Fr. Bernas.

He also said Congress did not impose the death penalty but merely
provides for a penalty which the courts, where proper, may impose.

"It is the courts which decide whether it is legally and
constitutionally proper to impose the penalty, and impose it not on an
abstract criminal coldly described in books but on warm bodied accused
individuals who possess the very fundamental and precious right to
life," he said.

Political advertising ban on showbiz folk proposed

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Media and showbiz personalities planning to run for office should take
a "leave of absence" to avoid the possible "misuse of media" by
candidates, says House Bill 7462 which will amend the law banning
political advertisements.

The bill seeks to amend the Omnibus Election Code by allowing the use
of mass media and other campaign materials by candidates running for
office.

"The bill seeks to equalize the political playing field by reducing the
undue advantage enjoyed by candidates who are media or show business
personalities ," said Rizal Rep. Emigdio Tanjuatco, Jr. in a
sponsorship speech recently.

He includes in the ban media and showbusiness personalities who are
campaigning for candidates. Mr. Tanjuatco also suggests that their
films, commercials and endorsements be banned.

This is to "level the playing field and rationalize media use," he said.

Dept of Transportation and Communication seeks more penalties for cellphone
cloning

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Transport and communication officials yesterday recommended stiffer
penalties against cloning and the illegal use of frequencies.

The Department of Transportation and Communication (DoTC) as well as
the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) proposed higher fines
and longer imprisonment under the telecommunications anti-fraud bill
pending in Congress.

DoTC and NTC said the penalties for cloning should include a minimum
fine of P1 million as well as imprisonment for not less than 12 years.

Under House Bill 2430, cloning and the illegal use of frequencies are
punishable with six to eight years imprisonment or a fine of not less
than P200,000.

Transportation and Communications undersecretary Josefina T. Lichauco,
in a letter to Senator Sergio Osmena, III, chairman of the committee on
public services, said the proposed stiffer penalties were reached in
consultation with the private sector.

The Senate versions of HB 2430 are Senate Bills 1386 and 1505.

Under existing laws, cloning, subscription fraud, and other similarly
illegal acts are not considered criminal offenses.

The bills also cover illegal connections such as unreported extension
telephone lines, third number billing fraud (where a caller charges a
long distance call to a telephone number without the consent of the
owner), and destruction of telecommunication facilities like public
telephone booths.

Economic Indicator: Per capita GNP improves by 5%

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 10

By Rene A. Mallari

With the economy's 7.1% growth in the first semester, real per capita
income correspondingly improved.

Data culled from the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB)
show per capita gross national product (GNP) - or the estimated income
each Filipino receives - at constant 1985 prices was placed at P5,916
in the first half of the year. This registered a 4.6% hike from P5,655
in the same period last year. A rising income means Filipinos are
better off than before.

Real per capita GNP is calculated by dividing GNP by the population
during a given period. Ideally, the output produced by the economy
should be faster than population growth. For the past two years, the
economy has been growing more than twice the population growth. In
particular, GNP expanded 5.5% in 1995 and 7.1% in the first half of
1996. Based on the 1990 Census of Population and Housing, the number of
Filipinos was estimated at 71.9 million as of the second quarter of
1996, increasing steadily by roughly 2.3% annually. Per Capita GDP

Per capita gross domestic product (GDP), on the other hand, amounted to
P5,641, up 2.6% from P5,496 the previous period. This was slightly
better than the 2.3% growth posted in 1995. Per capita GDP is deemed
more reliable measure of one's income level than per capita GNP.

The growth in per capita GDP can be traced mainly to the favorable
performance of the agricultural sector which registered a 3.8% upswing
in the first six months, or a rebound from almost 1% in the preceding
year. The NSCB reported that strong production of palay, corn and
sugarcane kept the sector moving.

However, the gap between per capita GNP and GDP during the period under
review has widened. In 1996, the difference was at P275, bigger than
P159 in 1995 and P134 in 1994. In recent years, net factor income from
abroad (NFIA) which includes remittances of overseas contract workers
(OCWs) remained a major contributor to GNP. OCW remittances have been
on an uptrend, accelerating 76.5% in the first semester.

Despite the widening gap, economists are confident per capita GDP will
soon catch up since investments have been leading local growth.

As real per capita GNP improved, purchasing power further expanded.
Personal consumption expenditure (PCE) per head was valued at P4,337,
up 2% from P4,251 the previous year. PCE refers to consumer spending
for goods and services.

PCE for the past quarters has generally slowed down. This can mean more
Filipinos have been saving or pouring their surplus funds to longer
termed investments.

Economic Indicator: Increasing number of contractors shows upbeat
construction sector

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 10

By Leotes Marie T. Lugo

Reflective of the upsurge of construction activity in the country, more
and more contractors have been granted licenses by the Philippine
Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB). In a span of five years,
population of the local contracting sector reached 8,225 or nearly
double the 5,476 registered in 1991.

Contractors are primarily responsible for gathering all the necessary
resources required in putting up the desired facility. Proponents of
the contracting sector also coordinate and supervise the entire
construction process. An increase in the number of contractors attest
to impressive showing of the industry.

PCAB is the government agency tasked to issue, limit, suspend and
revoke contractors' licenses as well as upgrade the classification of
licensed contractors. The Board issues regular and special licenses.
The first is granted to Filipino sole proprietorships, and partnerships
or corporations with at least 60% equity participation. The latter is
issued to joint ventures, consortiums, foreign constructors or a
project owner engaged in the construction of a single specific
undertaking.

Increasing disposable incomes, lower interest rates and favorable
demographics contributed to the boom in both residential and
nonresidential construction. Rising demand for support facilities in
stride with the country's economic expansion also enticed more
companies to join the real estate bandwagon.

In the first quarter alone, the sector was joined by 1,973 new approved
contractors. More than half of the total fell under category D.
Contractors are categorized with respect to their minimum capital base.
Firms under AAA have a minimum capital of P10 million; AA, P5 million;
A, P1 million; B, P500,000; C, P300,000; D, P100,000 and Trade, P5,000.

A closer look at the PCAB data show the industry is composed mainly of
small contractors. Firms under category D, C and B captured the first,
second and third places respectively, in terms of number. Even
aggregate entities under the Trade classification exceeded the combined
total of type AAA and AA contractors. Trade contractors are limited to
repair works and undertakings of up to P500,000 contract or project
cost.

Moreover, only 199 companies fell under the AAA grouping. These are the
companies capable of handling large scale projects worth P50 million
and above. Commonly referred to as the big guns in the industry, these
include D.M. Consunji Inc., EEI Corp. and F.F. Cruz and Company, Inc.,
among others.

The present composition though may prove a disadvantage to the
industry. Faced with the entry of foreign players, "local contractors
must join forces and be ready for competition," a high ranking
Philippine Constructors Association (PCA) official said.

The official further noted that joint ventures are fast becoming a
practice in the sector, which PCA hopes will lead to the formation of
consortiums and in the long run, mergers among construction companies.

Approvals of licenses is expected to be on the uptick given the
consistent positive showing of the industry, Sonia T. Valdeavilla,
Philippine Overseas Construction Board-International Projects
Monitoring Division chief told BusinessWorld in an earlier interview.

Ms. Valdeavilla pointed to the increasing government budget for
infrastructure as well as the Countryside Development Fund as
additional come-ons for construction firms. Build-operate-transfer
projects in the pipeline are estimated to cost P212.53 billion.
Likewise, the Construction Industry Authority of the Philippines (CIAP)
estimates real construction output to move up 13.5% this year and
accelerate at an annual average rate of 14% until 1998. Tourism and
real estate development are also counted on to bolster the industry's
growth.

CIAP computed real demand for construction this year to reach P99.2
billion, of which P55.8 billion will come from private construction
which covers residential and nonresidential projects. Addressing the
3.72 million housing backlog through the construction of low cost and
socialized housing will answer the demand side. Meanwhile, the growth
of urban centers and the continued development of industrial centers is
counted on to sustain the boom in the nonresidential sector.

Government construction, on the other hand accounts for P43.4 billion
of the total. This covers infrastructure development in power, energy
and electricity, transportation, water resources, social infrastructure
and communication.

Licensed contractors are further classified into general
building, general engineering and specialty contractors.
General building companies are involved in the development of a
wide range of structures and buildings. Contractors who perform
civil engineering works requiring specialized engineering such
as construction of irrigation, drainage, water supply
sewerage, flood control, highways and roads, harbors, docks and
wharves, shipyards, ports and heavy industrial establishments are
classified under general engineering. Specialty contractors are
those who undertake work requiring specialize building trades.
Majority of contractors belong to the general engineering/building
class.

DECS, DoST agency launch school, forest park program

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 16

Filipino schoolchildren can better appreciate the importance of
protecting the environment through a program which has been created.

Called "School Forest Park Program," it will support the government's
clean and green initiative and consequently, create consciousness among
children on the value of environment protection and conservation of its
biodiversity.

The Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) and Philippine
Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and
Development (PCARRD) joined hands through a signing of the memorandum
of agreement (MoA) to fully implement the program.

Signatories to the agreement were DECS Secretary Ricardo T. Gloria and
PCARRD executive director Wlliam D. Dar. Los Banos-based PCARRD, an
agency of the Department of Science and Technology (DoST), monitors,
coordinates, and evaluates research and development (R&D) activities in
agriculture, environment, and natural resources in the country.

In the agreement, DECS will identify the area within the school
premises to be designated for the program, allocate the necessary funds
and resources, and supervise overall implementation.

PCARRD, on the other hand, will provide technical assistance to the
identified schools, help identify and source forest tree species and
materials indigenous to the area, and encourage/involve other agencies/
organization in the project.

Secretary Gloria said the new program will complement DECS's existing
"School-in-a-Garden" project.

In the last few years, specifically during the Aquino administration,
both public and private schools have strengthened their curricula by
adopting environment-related subjects.

The concept of sustainable development has also been integrated in
various subjects in both primary and secondary levels.

Driven by the global concern on environmental protection and wildlife
conservation, specifically through the Earth Summit in 1992, several
local colleges and universities are now offering special courses on
environmental management.

IT"S ONLY MONEY: Sustaining the sustainable

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 16

By Mario P. Chanco

The International Monetary Fund (IMF), like any financial institution
deserving the name, is worried. In a story bylined by BusinessWorld
reporters Maricris C. Carlos and Elisha R. Garcia earlier this week,
the IMF expressed more than a bit of curiosity about the rate of
national economic growth and wondered out loud - as anyone in their
position appears well entitled to wonder - if the Philippines had
enough growth sustainability factors to keep up with its spending.

Of course, this whole exercise is about money. It's only money.

It's money that interests the money merchants and the money spenders,
but the IMF is quoted as worried about the country's money inflows. The
bulk appears to come, not from the hot shots riding the rails on the
Bicol-North super expressways, but from overseas contract workers
(OCWs).

Either kind of legal tender will pay for life's real or imagined needs.
But when overseas income starts surging 76% higher in the first six
months of 1996 compared to that of a year ago, it's time to look at the
color of one's money.

When one considers that there has been a continuous downtrend in the
number of Filipinos employed overseas in these last years, the innuendo
turns absolutely tantalizing. One wonders: Did those overseas workers
we have left somehow marry into rich families on the desert sands? Or
is there a new kind of corporate capital sharing now at work that we
will never hear of in the country?

I remember, some five or six years ago, watching at a big Quezon City
car exchange where a transaction involving a large passenger van was
going on. The deal may have been several days in the making, but when I
chanced on the scene money was already changing hands. The buyer was a
shapely Filipina who could have been a stewardess, nurse or just an
overseas spellbinder. But she was tough and spoke in knowledgeable
Tagalese that she intended to get value for her money.

She took out so many high-denomination bills from a large suitcase I
thought she had a direct pipeline to a next-door bank. Finally, when
all the accessories, tires, papers, etc. had been dumped inside the
van, she and two other companions got in and drove away in a cloud of
dust.

At another time, I watched at a money changer's shop while two
foreigners dickered for centavos on the standard peso-dollar exchange
rate - and ended up changing $20 per head. Behind them, a short, squat
Filipino OCW walked up and waited patiently at the counter. He
deposited a thick wad of hundred-dollar bills big enough to choke a
dinosaur. He had a proper escort, this man had; when they zoomed off
into the sunset, he made the old cowboy John Wayne look Lilliputian by
comparison.

So there you have it - big bucks and big money from fewer Filipino
workers overseas. But they still float enough high-octane gas to fuel
the consumerist boom in cars, housing, food, appliances, durables. The
very breath of life, the IMF seems to say, which makes even us ask
plaintively - how long is this bubble going to last? How long before it
blows up on our faces, and another IMF set of conditions is imposed to
make Filipinos live within their means?

Filipino overseas workers, it is said, are not likely to return home
soon, so their source of funds will not be quickly cut off. So if that
is OK, what's this talk about growth sustainability all about?
Something to keep the boys better treated for all the tough years
they've been having? Or is it simply because, with so many small
Filipinos doing their bit to keep the nation afloat and sustainable, we
still need to justify ourselves before yet another level of judges?

Dept of Envt and Natural Resources okays social forestry rules

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 16

By Digna V. Velasco

New rules on social forestry were approved last week by the Department
of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

Started during the early years of the Aquino administration, social
forestry was promoted as a livelihood scheme for upland communities.

The new rules, spelled out in DENR Administrative Order No. 96-24,
series of 1996, are aimed at ensuring "equitable access and sharing of
rights to natural resources development and utilization by giving the
people, particularly the poorer sectors of society, the opportunity to
participate actively in forest plantation development."

DENR will grant Socialized Industrial Forest Management Agreement or
SIFMA to qualified program participants and will include a provision on
security of tenure.

The concept was derived from the Industrial Forest Management Agreement
or IFMA which taps corporate participants.

Under the SIFMA, each family can develop and manage forest areas from 1
to 10 hectares. For associations and cooperatives, sizes of awarded
areas range from 11 to less than 500 hectares.

A non-refundable application fee of P500 for every hectare awarded will
be collected by DENR.

Filipinos of legal age and preferably residents of the municipality
where the project will be located are qualified to apply for concession
areas.

Associations and cooperatives applying should have offices located in
the province where the SIFMA is located and are duly registered with
the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Cooperative Development
Authority.

Moreover, they must be financially and technically capable of
developing the area. Applicants should not have had any agreements,
permits or licenses to use forest lands or resources cancelled due to
their inability to comply with DENR requirements nor are they holders
of any existing forest permit, license, lease or management agreement.

A qualified SIFMA applicant is entitled to the following:

* harvest, sell or use all planted crops, mostly trees for wood
production, non-timber species and other cash crops that may be
interplanted, except those retained for environmental protection;

* export logs, lumber and other forest products harvested according to
the government's allocation system;

* exemption from paying forest charges derived from the plantation;

* reasonable compensation if the SIFMA is cancelled without due cause;

* high priority if future rules allow a more permanent tenurial
arrangement;

* no restrictions on use of the SIFMA as collateral for loans to
improve the area, provided this is approved by the issuing IFMA
authority; and

* free technical assistance for SIFMA holders wanting to confederate
into a larger organization.

SIFMA is valid for 25 years and renewable for another 25 years.

DENR Secretary Victor O. Ramos said SIFMA will promote an adequate and
steady supply of timber and other forest products for the domestic and
export market; accelerate reforestation and rehabilitation of the
country's open and denuded forest lands and effectively protect and
conserve existing natural forests, soil, water and biodiversity; while
at the same time give more equitable access to forest resources and
help uplift the economic situation of people, particularly in the
uplands.

Gov"t seals wastewater tunnels of Mandaluyong sugar refinery

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 16

By Digna V. Velasco

Wastewater tunnels of a sugar refinery in Mandaluyong City were closed
last week by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

The Pollution Adjudication Board (PAB) of the DENR ruled the sealing of
the Noah's Ark Sugar Refinery's drainage tunnels with cement fillings
and steel plates.

A laboratory analysis of the refinery's wastewater showed a solid
matter density higher than what the government allows. For DENR, solid
particles emitted into a water system should take an hour to settle at
its bottom.

The closure order was first served on October 17, 1995 because Noah's
Ark failed to install an adequate wastewater treatment plant (WTP).
Five days after, the firm filed a motion for reconsideration which the
board denied for "lack of merit."

On November 22, 1995 however, a six-week temporary lifting order (TLO)
was issued but subject to three conditions including the construction
of an adequate WTP.

PAB extended the TLO for 60 days on January 24, 1996 with instructions
to the DENR-National Capital Region (DENR-NCR) to test the firm's
wastewater regularly.

On June 13, 1996, the TLO was again extended for another month "to
allow the respondent to further adjust its WTP and for resampling
purposes."

Last August 6, PAB ordered the reimposition of the standing
close-and-desist order (CDO) which was served 10 days later by DENR-NCR
officials led by Environment Management Engineer Danilo Galagnara.

They noted one of the three tunnel outfalls was below the surface of
the river so they had to come back in the afternoon at low tide to seal
it. They reported the firm's administrative manager, Luis Ramos,
prevented them from carrying out the said order.

PAB made its first endorsement to DENR Secretary Victor Ramos for the
filing of criminal charges against the firm. Last September 11, the
refinery's drainage tunnels were finally sealed.

Gerardo Reyes, Noah's Ark's public relations officer, denied some of
DENR's accusations. He told BusinessWorld that no wastewater sampling
was scheduled that last week of June when the "organic-laden
wastewater" was taken.

Instead, a DENR-NCR monitoring team went to check on the air pollution
complaints of Mandaluyong City Congressman Neptali Gonzales, Jr.
against the firm. Noah's Ark passed the air pollution test.

"Unfortunately, a companion of the team saw the wastewater flowing into
the bed which has not yet passed through our treatment plant. He took
some samples of it and had it tested. Predictably, we failed. That
became the basis of the CDO automatic reimposition," Mr. Reyes related.

Mr. Reyes claimed that Noah's Ark had an existing WTP when the CDO was
first issued. The firm had failures in operations due to a boiler
breakdown and "we can't assure a 100% operational WTP." Thus, the CDO
was issued.

The CDO was temporarily lifted with the firm subjected to close
wastewater monitoring. The refinery adopted the biological system which
used activated sludge or bacteria to eat up the wastes in the aeration
tank.

From the aeration tank, wastewater passes through the resettling tank
then finally discharged into the Pasig River.

The TLO was extended for three months so DENR could continue monitoring
the firm's improvements.

Mr. Reyes related, "DENR told us that the Biological Oxygen Demand
(BOD) level was the critical aspect so we worked on it." BOD is the
capacity of the water to supply oxygen needed by organisms to survive.

Mr. Reyes added, "We passed the required BOD but we had a high
percentage of solid particles. We were again told to improve on our
WTP."

"But we were nearing the end of the TLO extension. PAB said there is no
need for a written petition for another extension. It was then that the
unfortunate testing came, resulting in the CDO automatic reimposition."

Mr. Reyes also denied DENR's accusation that Mr. Ramos, Noah's Ark's
administrative manager, stopped the closure order.

He added that on August 21, the firm submitted another motion for
reconsideration to PAB, citing that the firm received only last July 16
the one-month TLO extension issued last June 13.

The motion argued that the TLO should have lapsed only last August 17.
The refinery also cited substantial losses due to the "outright closure
of production" as the raw sugar worth P10 million in its production
lines would be wasted.

A separate sampling and laboratory analysis of DENR's River
Rehabilitation Secretariat last July 1 showed "marked improvements,"
with the concentration of solid particles reduced significantly.

"According to our consultants, DENR's standard is based on tap water
such as that supplied by the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage System.
Can that be expected of wastewater?" he asked.

The refinery has also installed a clarifier and screen to further
filter the solids before final discharge into the Pasig River.

Mr. Reyes said the management decided to voluntarily stop its
operations about a week before DENR's actual closure.

As a last resort, the firm might consider ocean-dumping as an
alternative and they have already applied to the Philippine Coast Guard
for this.

The refinery's wastewater, he said, can be good fish food since it is
mostly molasses from the sludge of sugar cane.

The firm also has its own tadpoles and barges to transport wastewater
to the sites to be identified by the Philippine Coast Guard.

But DENR authorities said this is still subject to PAB's approval and
had to be closely coordinated with the DENR-NCR officers and the
Philippine Coast Guard.

On the firm incurring losses due to the closure, PAB argued that other
firms have always raised this reason which is not enough to stay the
CDO. "Economic losses are expected in all firms meted with CDOs," the
board explained.

For Noah's Ark refinery, DENR's closure action was "counterproductive"
to President Fidel Ramos's program of Philippines 2000.

"We in the private sector are working hand in hand with the government.
But we are confused on the role of the DENR. Is it there to close down
firms?

"Shouldn't its role be in helping firms comply with its standards?
DENR's role should be a working relationship with the private sector
and not just a police body out to close firms.

"Will CDO be the remedy? We wouldn't question it if we had been
defiant. But we had spent about P5 million to improve our WTP and
comply with DENR's requirements," Mr. Reyes said.

Congress wants Pagcor to fund Oil Price Stabilization Fund

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2

By Manolo A. Serapio, Jr.

After the Philippine National Oil Co. (PNOC), Congress is hoping to tap
funds from last year's top earner, the state-owned Philippine Amusement
and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor), to wipe out the P2.3 billion deficit of the
Oil Price Stabilization Fund (OPSF).

Early this year, PNOC shelled out P10 billion from its coffers for the
OPSF. However, this was not enough to reimburse all pending claims of
three oil companies.

Now, Congress thinks Pagcor, which earned P5.86 billion in profits last
year, is the next potential OPSF donor.

Taguig Rep. Dante Tinga, chairman of the committee on energy at the
House of Representatives, told BusinessWorld the Lower House hopes to
settle the OPSF deficit before March 1997. This is when the government
is slated to lift all controls, including on pricing, on the oil
industry.

"There are actually many sources of funds to (address) the OPSF
deficit. But Pagcor is the most capable to provide money to the OPSF,"
he said.

Pagcor, a government-owned-and-controlled corporation which runs all
casinos nationwide, is considered the most profitable of all state-run
companies.

The three oil companies - Petron Corp., Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp.
(PSPC) and Caltex (Phils.) Inc. - have turned down requests by the
Department of Energy for them to condone pending claims from the OPSF.

Their claims against the fund is estimated to have reached P2.3 billion
in August.

Officials of the oil firms earlier said they cannot write off their
claims from the buffer fund since this will affect their balance sheets
and thus hinder plans for expansion.

Of the P10 billion PNOC coughed up, only P9 billion was paid to the oil
companies. The DoE decided to keep the P1 billion as buffer fund to
cushion any oil price increase during the partial deregulation of the
oil industry.

But Energy Secretary Francisco Viray had floated the idea of using the
P1 billion, or whatever will be left of it, to pay part of the oil
firms' OPSF claims.

Mr. Tinga said the Lower House will be supportive of Mr. Viray's
suggestion although this will have to be legislated.

The OPSF is a buffer fund used to shield domestic oil prices against
radical movements in crude prices abroad and the fluctuations in the
foreign exchange rates.

The OPSF turned red in May last year given the unexpected increases in
the price of crude oil in the world market.

Even with PNOC's substantial contribution, the Energy Regulatory Board
(ERB) had to increase oil prices by an average of P0.55 per liter last
February to address part of the OPSF deficit.

Officials of the Department of Finance (DoF) said oil prices may have
to be raised by another P0.11 per liter to produce money that will be
paid to the oil companies.

The DoF said the government is cash-strapped to provide any more funds,
thus the OPSF burden has to be passed on to consumers.

National Economic and Development Authority Board approves 10 projects

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2

By Ma. Salve I. Duplito

Ten projects worth P97.5 billion were approved yesterday by the
National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board.

The NEDA Board, a cabinet-level body, is chaired by President Ramos. It
gives the final approval of projects before they are carried out.

The 10 projects will cost the government P33.7 billion in local funding
and P63.3 billion in foreign loans through official development
assistance and grants.

The San Roque Multipurpose Project accounted for the biggest chunk of
the funding, costing P24.9 billion.

The site of the Multipurpose Project is the Agno River Basin in
Pangasinan. The project includes a 345-megawatt power plant and
irrigation for 70,822 hectares of agricultural land.

Documents from NEDA, however, show the project is not financially
viable but the economic rate of return to be gleaned from power
generation and irrigation is expected to make up for the financial
unviability of the project.

The Light Rail Transit III was the second biggest project, costing the
government P18.3 billion in foreign loans. Local funding is not needed
for the project as the project is identified under the
build-lease-transfer scheme.

The LRT III, which has been delayed for almost a year now because of
right-of-way and squatter relocation problems, is expected to be
completed in October next year with construction starting not later
than this month.

NEDA's Infrastructure Staff earlier questioned its viability as project
cost has ballooned to $655 million from the original $300 million. The
Department of Transportation and Communications, however, pushed hard
for the project.

The NEDA Board retained the non-separability feature of commercial
development and the train service itself which the Metro Rail Transit
Corp. (MRTC) had been proposing to remove.

The MRTC, the consortium of some of the biggest developers in the
country, earlier sought to continue with the commercial development of
the depot site in North Edsa and other sites even if the rail component
does not push through. NEDA, however, blocked the act to ensure that
LRT III construction pushes through.

The Sixth Roads Improvement Project, which will be financed mainly
through a P9.5-billion loan from the Asian Development Bank and Japan
Export Import Bank, seeks to rehabilitate the national roads network
through repairs and constructions of bridges and roads in crucial
points nationwide.

The other seven approved, with investments totalling P44 billion, are:
Third Elementary Education Projects I and II, Agrarian Reform
Communities Project, Growth with Equity in Mindanao Program, and three
power projects under the National Power Corp.

APEC UPDATE: APEC needs private sector to solve energy problem

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2

By Leda A. Esguerra

Energy ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) urged
a tie-up between governments and the business sector to address the
region's rising power demand.

The call was contained in a declaration following a meeting in Sydney,
Australia, in preparation for this November's APEC summit in Subic.

The ministers expect a 50% to 80% increase in the region's electricity
demand from 1996 to 2010, requiring some $1.6 trillion in investment
capital.

"If such growth is to be realized, business sector finance for power
infrastructure will be essential," they said.

For a strong partnership with the business industry, the governments of
member economies need to find means to reduce investment risks for the
business community and encourage them to invest in power
infrastructure, the ministers explained.

They stressed, "APEC governments must play a catalytic role in creating
the project approval, regulatory and financial conditions necessary to
mobilize the investment capital required from the business community."

Apart from the need to introduce reforms to mobilize private sector
investments in the power sector, the ministers identified a series of
objectives they will be reporting to the APEC leaders.

The objectives are: the improvement of regional energy security by
opening up the energy markets and expanding current supply capacity and
energy conservation; the need to come up with strategic approach to
reducing the environmental impact of power projects.

Also to be reported are the need for a framework to reduce business
costs through cooperation on energy standards; and the adoption of
energy policy principles to give an impetus to regional initiatives to
reform energy policies for incorporation into domestic energy policy
deliberations of member economies.

APEC members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand
and the United States.

FVR okays blacklist rules for erring gov"t contractors

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2

Erring contractors of the government's infrastructure projects will
have to shape up or else be blacklisted from future construction
projects.

The guidelines on blacklisting erring contractors were given the
Presidential nod during the National Economic and Development Authority
(NEDA) Board meeting held yesterday.

The government intends to finalize an Executive Order (EO) by the end
of the year to implement the guidelines.

NEDA director-general Cielito F. Habito told BusinessWorld the
President bypassed the usual repetitive discussions and approved the
guidelines to fast-track the implementation of the EO.

"The President said it's about time to have a uniform set of guidelines
to weed out misfits in the government's infrastructure projects," Mr.
Habito said. Mr. Habito added, however, the President ordered several
clarifications specifically on conflicts of interest.

"Some contractors are just dummies of local government officials. We
have to set the rule on how to deal with this," the President was
quoted as saying during the meeting.

Before the State of the Nation Address last June, the President visited
the road construction at the Quezon City Circle and was reportedly
disappointed at the project's slow development.

Under the current system, agencies have different guidelines and
sanctions for erring contractors and have no common list of blacklisted
contractors.

This situation allows contractors to escape detection and repetitively
win in project biddings despite their poor performance.

In the new set of guidelines, a uniform set of guidelines and sanctions
has been set. The sanctions range from suspension to perpetual
disqualification.

Contractors can be blacklisted if proven to have used falsified
documents or borrowed license during bidding, rigging of bidding,
inability to comply with requirements like affidavits on time, delays
in construction and low quality of work.

Meanwhile, President Ramos yesterday approved the extension of the 3%
duty on portland cement until 1997 to prevent any sudden increase in
cement prices.

The decision was reached upon recommendation by the Committee on
Tariffs and Related Matters (TRM) of the NEDA Board.

The extension was one of the executive actions targetted by NEDA in its
Action Plan Against Inflation. The move is seen to dampen uptick in
cost of housing and repairs which accounts for 13.3% of inflation.

In the earlier plan, cement duty is scheduled to go up to 10% in
January 1, as mandated by Executive Order 284.

However, since the current cement shortage is expected to stretch until
1998, private sector representatives asked the government to postpone
the increase in import duty to prevent importations from being too
expensive and therefore ease cement shortage.

Data from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) show demand for
cement next year will balloon to 407 million bags from 334 million this
year, even as supply is only expected to reach 401.8 million bags. This
translates to a 5.4 million supply deficit.

In 1998, the situation will even be bleaker despite the operation of
new plants, DTI said. Deficit is expected to shoot up to 42.5 million
bags.

Taxwise or Otherwise: Sellers to Philippine Economic Zone Authority firms

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2

By Romeo B. Cruz

Sellers of goods or services dealing with an enterprise registered with
the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) are often confronted with
the issue on the proper treatment of such transaction for Value-Added
Tax (VAT) purposes. What may appear simple is complicated due to
differences in interpretation of the pertinent provisions of the VAT
Law and related legislations.

The provisions of the new VAT Law and implementing revenue regulations
on effectively zero-rated sale could have provided the ready answer.
Under the regulations, sales of goods and services by a VAT-registered
person to a person or entity who has been granted indirect tax
exemption under special laws are, in effect, zero-rated. In the
regulations and the memorandum circular, the enumeration of effectively
zero-rated sales of goods specifies sale to Subic Bay Metropolitan
Authority (SBMA)-and Cooperative Development Authority (CDA)-registered
enterprises, to PEZA registered enterprises, and to Asian Development
Bank and International Rice Research Institute, pursuant to respective
laws and international agreements. However, this specific reference is
not contained in the enumeration of effectively zero-rated sales of
services to these enterprises.

It is our position that while not explicitly stated, it is the intent
of the rules that sales of services to these specific enterprises and
organizations are to be treated in the same manner as the sales of
goods, and are effectively zero-rated.

The PEZA law states that all privileges, benefits, advantages or
exemptions accorded to special economic zones created under RA 7227
(e.g. SBMA and CDA) shall also be accorded to PEZA firms. One of the
privileges enjoyed by SBMA enterprises is that purchases of raw
materials, capital goods and equipment and services are considered
effectively zero-rated for VAT purposes (Sec. 4 (A) of Rev. Regs. 1-95).

Inasmuch as PEZA firms enjoy this same privilege, the sale of products
and services to PEZA firms should be treated as effectively zero-rated.
Thus, the seller is liable to zero per cent VAT on such sale and is
still entitled to claim input taxes. Since the seller will not pass on
any VAT, PEZA firms will enjoy a 10% savings on purchases made.

The seller is, however, required to submit an application for
zero-rating to the Revenue District Office having jurisdiction over its
principal place of business. Without an approved application for
zero-rating, the sale would merely be considered exempt from VAT,
therefore, the seller cannot deduct the input taxes paid on products
sold against its output VAT.

(Mr. Romeo B. Cruz is a manager at the Tax and Corporate Services
Department of Joaquin Cunanan & Co., a member firm of the Price
Waterhouse Worldwide Organization.)

Local, Japanese groups to slug it out for 20% of National Steel Corp. on
Oct. 2

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Ma. Clarissa S. Batino

At least 13 companies have signified their intentions to buy into the
National Steel Corp. (NSC) when the government bids out 20% of the firm
on October 2 for an expected take of not less than P4.5 billion.

The companies represented in yesterday's pre-bidding conference
conducted by the National Development Co. (NDC) include four Japanese
conglomerates, three investment affiliates representing big clients,
prominent and low-key business names.

Among the Japanese firms are Tomen Corp., Kawasho Corp., Mitsui & Co.,
Ltd. and Marubeni Corp.

ING Barings, Urban Bank and Lunar Holdings of broker Luis Virata were
also present. Sources said they could be representing big names wanting
to elude publicity.

An example could be plastics tycoon William Gatchalian who is said to
be talking intently with the Malaysian majority group in NSC for
significant exposure in the country's largest steel firm.

The interest of now Hong Kong-based Roberto Ongpin in NSC was also
confirmed with the attendance of APC Group formerly Asian Petroleum
Corp.

APC is 50-owned by Mr. Ongpin's Belle Corp. which is part of his AIA
Holdings. Talks are rife at the stock market that Mr. Ongpin will be
converting APC into a holding company which he will use to penetrate
NSC and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS).

Mr. Ongpin has been eyeing the steel firm, even before the Malaysians
entered the picture. In fact, he participated in the privatization but
lost to the Malaysians. He and Mr. Gatchalian have been meeting often
with Wing Tiek Holdings Berhad for possible tie-ups, sources said.

Shipping magnate Doris Magsaysay-Ho also sent a representative through
her National Marine Corp. Other prospective bidders are Cathay Pacific
Steel Corp., another firm represented by the Embassy of Spain, current
NSC supplier Reliance Commodities and an obscure firm, Rico Enterprises.

NDC, the government's holding arm, will be dividing the 448,683,666
shares into four blocks comprising five per cent each of the company.

Arthur Aguilar, general manager of NDC explained this is to broaden the
ownership base of the company and even make it more marketable.

"At an indicative price of P10 each, this will entail a large sum of
money. Instead of doing an all-or-nothing type of bidding, we decided
to split it up," Mr. Aguilar explained.

While it is possible a single bidder will get all four chunks, it can
also happen that an entity may bid for the four and not get any, the
NDC official noted.

A bidder is required to put 10% upfront of his bid price upon
submission of the bid, 50% not later than October 25 and 40% within
ninety days from the awarding.

NDC noted the number of shares to be offered may increase depending on
the decision of Wing Tiek's partner, Marubeni Corp. on its pending $50
million obligation as part of the Malaysian's second tranche.

Wing Tiek is in the process of acquiring 75% of NSC. It has paid for
more than 60% but liquidity crunch has delayed its payment of the $90
million supposedly due in August.

It worked out a strategic venture with Marubeni wherein the latter will
buy 6% of NSC shares the Malaysians earlier committed to take.

But Marubeni is said to be having second thoughts on plunking in $50
million (P1.3 billion) without the resolution of the land issue.

NSC has about P700 million worth of properties it had to spin-off since
it is now majority-owned by a foreigner. The Constitution expressly
stated no foreign entity can own land in the Philippines.

As of press time, nothing has been heard of Marubeni's decision. Mr.
Aguilar said if Marubeni keeps an uncertain stance, then the NDC board
will meet this week to decide whether to include the 6% commitment in
the put-option clause.

With no takers, this chunk will revert to Wing Tiek again. And NDC will
be left to contend with another round of IOUs.

PTT of Thailand, Coastal Petroleum joint venture to build local gas
stations

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Manolo A. Serapio, Jr.

State-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) has firmed up plans
to tie up with United States-based Coastal Petroleum to put up 200
service stations here, sources told BusinessWorld yesterday.

Sources said PTT has secured the approval of the Thai government for
the said project. Officials of the firm are due to arrive this week to
finalize the joint-venture agreement with Coastal.

Coastal which runs a large oil depot in Subic Bay Freeport in Olongapo
will be supplying the petroleum products to the Thai firm.

PTT will concentrate on marketing fuel products in Metro Manila.
Initial investments for the project is estimated at $120 million.

Coastal operates the Coastal Subic Bay Terminal, Inc. which stores 2.4
million barrels of oil. It also runs a similar depot in Clark Field in
Pampanga that has a storage capacity of half a million barrels.

The project will be the first for PTT. Coastal has been operating the
Subic depot since 1993 shortly after the US vacated its military base
in Olongapo.

Coastal has consistently been supplying any shortfall in the domestic
petroleum demand. The firm provides at least 20,000 barrels a day to
augment local requirements which averages 350,000 daily.

A Coastal official said plans are under way to for a $20-million
upgrading bid of the firm's existing pipeline in Clark to facilitate
transport of fuel products.

Aside from the PTT-Coastal project, no other newcomers in the partially
deregulated oil industry have finalized plans to invest in marketing
petroleum products. But Department of Energy (DoE) director Zenaida
Monzada said other firms can actually pursue investment interests
without informing the DoE.

"This is one of the results of a deregulated industry. They (investors)
can opt to come to us when they have their respective projects already
in place," she said.

The government has eased rules on the entry of new players in the
petroleum industry as part of its economic liberalization program. The
partial deregulation phase where pricing remains semi-regulated by the
Energy Regulatory Board will last until February next year. With full
deregulation a month later, petroleum pricing will be market-dictated.

Luis Dizon group files cases vs SEC at the appellate court, Ombudsman

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Larina  G. Perez and Norman C. Aquino

After being prevented from taking control of Dizon Copper Silver Mines,
Inc. (DCSMI) because of a recent temporary restraining order (TRO)
issued by a hearing officer of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), the former management of the company went to the Court of
Appeals (CA) asking that the actions taken during the stockholders
meeting held last September 4 be nullified.

The hearing at the SEC was held to decide whether or not the TRO issued
last September 16, 1996 by hearing officer James Abugan which is
effective for 72 hours should be extended.

At the same time, the former management led by Dr. Luis Dizon also
filed before the SEC a motion to dismiss the case and an opposition to
the extension of the TRO.

The CA earlier issued a TRO preventing the Commission from enforcing
its order directing the officers of DCSMI to hold a stockholders
meeting. The TRO was issued in light of a petition filed by the bloc
led by Dr. Luis Dizon before the CA last September 3 seeking to stop
the stockholders meeting.

However, the stockholders present during the assembly went on with the
meeting claiming they constitute the majority. Moreover, they said they
were not parties to the TRO because it was only the SEC which was
enjoined by the CA from enforcing its order. During the meeting, the
group also elected a new set of directors.

Atty. Armando M. Marcelo, counsel for Dr. Dizon's group, said yesterday
aside from asking the CA to declare as null and void the actions taken
during the stockholders meeting, the group also asked the appellate
court to hold in contempt DCSMI's elected officers led by chairperson
Teresita Dizon.

He said they also asked the SEC to dismiss the case because the matter
has been elevated to the CA. "The SEC can't entertain the case anymore
because only the CA can do that at this point," Mr. Marcelo said.

In yesterday's hearing at the SEC, Mr. Marcelo said the TRO issued last
September 16 is "void" and "nonexistent" because it was issued by a
hearing officer who is not authorized to do so.

Citing SEC's special rules for the issuance of TROs and writ of
preliminary injunction, Mr. Marcelo said only the director of the
Securities Investigation and Clearing Division (SICD) can issue TROs.

The rules read in part: "If the matter is of extreme urgency, such that
unless a TRO is issued, grave injustice and irreparable injury will
arise, the SICD director shall issue the TRO effective only for 72
hours..."

"I would like to stress, there is not even anything (TRO) to extend.
The rules on the issuance of TROs are very clear," Mr. Marcelo said.

Atty. Manuel Singson, counsel for the newly elected board of directors,
said even if the TRO issued by Mr. Abugan is indeed invalid, the SEC
can still issue another TRO.

Atty. Efren Moncupa, counsel for the same group, said they will pursue
their move for the issuance of a TRO because the operations of DCSMI
are adversely affected by the ongoing controversy. He said at present,
the operations of the company are suspended because its office has been
padlocked by the former management.

He said the group will file a motion with the CA to dismiss the other
group's petition so that the new directors and officers can assume
their posts at DCSMI.

Meanwhile, a stockholder of DCSMI yesterday filed graft charges before
the Office of the Ombudsman against SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay, Jr.
and five others.

Also charged were commissioners Fe Eloisa Gloria, SEC lawyers Ruben
Ladia, Juanito Almosa, Benito Cataran and Rosalina Tesorio.

Mr. Sinugbuhan accused the SEC officials of giving undue injury to
DCSMI by giving unwarranted benefits to Teresita Dizon, Lourdes Dizon,
Fortunata Matsuda, Juvencio Dizon, Ramona Feliciano and Deogracias
Datu, also stockholders of the mining company.

He claimed the SEC officials conspired to illegally hold back two TROs
issued by SEC hearing officer Evilio Pomento on September 4.

The first order restrained the holding of a stockholders meeting the
following day until alleged tampering of proxy votes and dissipation of
corporate funds would have been resolved.

The second order barred the group of majority stockholder Teresita
Dizon from being nominated and elected to the mining firm's board of
directors.

Mr. Sinugbuhan said by suppressing the TROs, the SEC officials paved
the way for a romp election by Ms. Dizon's group, causing confusion
among DCSMI stockholders.

He also scored the officials for allegedly meddling in the disposition
of the mining firm's cases.

"It is about time that the corrupt and high-handed acts of these
government officials be exposed and put to an end," Mr. Sinugbuhan said.

Mr. Pomento had issued the TROs based on the claims of DCSMI's
incumbent management that there was massive cheating in the validation
of proxies, the bone of contention between the two groups of
stockholders.

Mr. Ladia, officer-in-charge of SEC's SICD), did not release Mr.
Pomento's orders, claiming he saw the copies of the orders on September
5 or a day late and that such orders need to be reviewed prior to their
release.

Congress to probe Manuela Land and Houses Corp"s ouster in John Hay
bidding

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Ronaldo F. Jabal

Congress has stepped into the controversial bidding of the Club John
Hay conducted by the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA).

Yesterday, sixteen congressmen called for an investigation of the
bidding. Led by House of Representatives ad hoc oversight committee on
bases conversion chairman and Pampanga Rep. Carmelo Lazatin, a group of
solons want to find out if the recent disqualification of Manuela Land
and Houses Corp. (ML&H) by the BCDA in the bidding for Club John Hay in
Baguio City will result in huge losses to the government.

"The committee has been reliably informed that the result of the recent
bidding process will result in huge losses to the government...
Therefore, (we) resolved to direct the ad hoc oversight committee on
bases conversion to thoroughly conduct an inquiry interest of the
government," the group said.

Besides Mr. Lazatin, the other congressmen who called for the probe are
Reps. Bernardo Vergara, Jose Yap, Felicito Payumo, Herminio Aquino,
Jovito Claudio, Zenaida Ducut, James Gordon, Renato Diaz, Roilo Golez,
Victor Ortega, Dante Tinga, Eduardo Ermita, Jose Cojuangco, Amadeo
Perez and Oscar Rodriquez. All of them are members of the committee.

In a resolution, the congressmen noted that in a recent bidding, the
BCDA awarded the right to develop the Club John Jay through a 25-year
lease contract to ML&H consortium composed of Manuela Corporation,
Thailand's Land & Houses Public Co. Ltd.. Asia Pacific Planning and
Evaluation Co., First Asia Eagles Capital Corp. and AB Capital and
Investment Corp.

ML&H bidded P1.588 billion, which is more than three times bigger than
the next bidder, the Fil Estate-Penta Capital Group. The latter offered
only P425 million.

However, the BCDA declared ML&H in default for failing to meet the
deadline to sign a lease agreement for the development of the project
and forfeited the P100-million cash deposit the group posted during the
auction last July. As such, the contract was awarded to the second
highest bidder, Penta Capital-Fil Estate.

BCDA chairman Victorino Basco was earlier quoted as having said the
decision to award the contract to the second highest bidder came
following the opinion of the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel
(OGCC) that ML&H violated the terms of reference of the John Hay
auction.

ML&H reportedly refused to sign an agreement with BCDA due to concerns
over the total land area covered by the contract. It claimed the area
that would be available for development was only 121.77 hectares
because more than half of the 246.99 has that BCDA bidded out were
protected forest lands and untitled lands.

Philippines Retirement & Separation Benefits System offers Riviera Club
shares to raise funds for projects

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Larina G. Perez

Riviera Golf Club, Inc. is offering 2,250 golf club shares to the
public to raise P1.2 billion for its resort and residential project in
Silang, Cavite.

In an application filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), Riviera Golf said the offered shares are broken down as follows:
1,328 class "A" common shares; 210 class "B" common shares; and 712
class "C" common shares. Priced at P550,000 each, the shares are being
offered to the public.

The golf course, which is owned and being developed by the Armed Forces
of the Philippines Retirement and Separation Benefits System
(AFP-RSBS), will provide the main attraction for the entire sports and
leisure complex project. The sports complex, covering 44% of the total
312-hectare land area, will consist of two 18-hole championship golf
courses and a country club.

Riviera Golf Club has commissioned CCA International Ltd. to operate
the golf club. Aside from operating the club, CCA will also provide
pre-opening assistance during the development phase.

CCA will also recommend and review overall club concepts and detailed
facility plans, establish purchasing and control systems for clubhouse
and golf-course related equipment, as well as monitor work progress and
quality standards during the development period. It will also hire and
train the club's staff.

Among the support facilities and amenities to be included in the golf
clubhouse are: a fine dining restaurant, pro shops, tee bar, putting
green; a golf academy, and a driving range among others.

The construction of the golf club started last January and development
has reached 30% accomplishment. It will be completed by December of
next year.

As a fully integrated sports complex, the property will also feature
residential units. The whole complex will be completed within two years.

AFP-RSBS, which started operations in 1977 with a mandate of building
up the pension fund of the AFP, has broadened its scope to include
several real estate projects. Its investment in real estate account for
48.73% of its total investment portfolio of about P9.5 billion. At
present, AFP-RSBS has P11 billion in assets and P8 billion in fund
equity.

Its projects include: San Lorenzo South Subdivision in Sta. Rosa
Laguna; Las Pinas Royale Estates; Chinatown Steel Towers in Binondo;
the Orchard Golf and Country Club in Dasmarinas, Cavite; Eastridge Golf
and Country Club in Binangonan, Rizal; and the Enchanted Kingdom.

VIEW FROM THE TOP: Real competitive advantage

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Ma. Clarissa S. Batino

In today's cutthroat competition, business guru and strategist Michael
Porter comes with his main edict likened to the classic saying that
"the battle is not always to the strong nor the race to the swift."

An author of three books in competitive advantage, Mr. Porter was in
Manila recently to share his insights with Filipino managers.

He said a gung ho zest for operational excellence may fatten up profits
for some years. But without the proper allowance for sustainable
development, the driving force will weaken and like karma, the
shortcomings will eventually catch up with the entrepreneur.

Mr. Porter encouraged firms to innovate and recreate, to step out of
the purely profit-driven mold of today's business into a dynamic,
well-balanced and prosperous industry ready to face the global battle
that has started.

He joined Harvard Business School in 1973 and has advised international
firms including AT&T, First Boston, Procter & Gamble, Hewlett-Packard,
NEC Corp., among others.

In an exclusive interview with BusinessWorld, Mr. Porter shares some of
his insights into gaining a real competitive advantage.

BusinessWorld (BW): What is the formula for competitive advantage you
speak of?

Michael Porter (MP): It's hard to give it in a sentence. The simplest
way of saying it is that competitive advantage grows out of choosing to
be unique in some way in your business. And choosing to be unique means
that you must limit yourself by not doing everything in the industry.
But by choosing to do a few things that you want to be special at.
That's the essence of competitive advantage. Not spreading yourself too
thin. Like what most companies do. Basically, in the Philippines where
there are so many opportunities and so much growth, there is a very
strong pressure to just pursue all these great ideas.

BW: You say one has to find a niche for the company?

MP: Well its not necessarily a niche. It can serve quite a wide market.
But you got to find a particular kind of value that you are offering to
your customers. It might be many customers. It might be just a few
customers. And I talked today about the different ways of creating a
unique position. But all of them require a choice. All of them require
you to make trade-offs. You gonna do this but not that. You have to
deliberately choose not to serve certain customers, not to offer
certain features.

BW: In one of your articles you expounded on environmental aspect of
doing business. You mentioned resource productivity which many
companies apparently do not want to waste money on. But how do you view
the situation when one firm tackles sustainable development and the
other does not? Isn't this environmental thing supposed to be a
concerted effort? Won't an effort of one cancel out the other?

MP: I think what we believe from looking at many products and services
is that actually environmental improvements lead to greater efficiency
on the part of the company. Sometimes in the short term there is a
transition while the company is learning to do something a different
way. So, its cost may be higher in the short term. But in the long
term, less pollution usually needs lower cost. Because pollution is
waste. So, I believe that its just good business for companies to be
thinking about how to eliminate or reduce their emissions, and their
discharges and their dumping. Because if they do that, they will be
taking steps that will also improve the utilization of raw materials.
And make them more efficient. Now, there is an issue of one company
competing in an environmentally unsound way and not face any sanctions.
And another company is forced to meet certain standards. And there
being not a level playing field. I do think cases like that exist. But
what we found more and more is that the company that is being
environmentally unsound actually won't be successful in the long-run.
And even in developing countries, countries shouldn't delay the
introduction of environmental standards because they simply reinforce
the process of economic development. Just like karma, you get it in the
end.

BW: Aside from environment, what other issues should companies today
seriously consider in doing business, those they have been ignoring for
a long time?

MP: I think that companies in the Philippines need really developed
strategies. They've been opportunistic. They've been doing a lot of
deals. They've been moving in a lot of fields. They need clear
strategies we're talking of. Number two, I think it's gonna be
increasingly necessary for companies here to at least compete in the
region not just in the country. Thirdly, as I said in the seminar, it's
gonna be necessary to change the nature of the strategic alliances that
companies do. I think historically companies in countries like the
Philippines have relied too heavily on their foreign partners. They're
gonna have to move to develop more internal capability and better
technology. I also believe that almost every company that's diversified
probably is gonna need to get more focused. That, for me, are the big
four issues.

BW: Do you discourage alliance with foreign partners?

MP: I'm arguing that those alliances need to be shifting in their
character. They need to be more selective. They need to give the
Philippine company the opportunity to sell its own brand. In some
international markets, they need to create more room for Philippine
companies to start to move to more sophisticated strategies. Alliances
are still gonna be indispensable tools for bringing in technology,
bringing in skills, getting access to an international marketing. What
I'm really saying is that the alliances of five years ago are gonna
have to be changed.

BW: How do you view this situation wherein developing countries are
racing with much-developed economies and they are faced with prospect
of depleting much-abused resources. How do you strike a balance?

MP: Again, I believe that the process of successful economic
development requires the country to learn not to deplete its resources.
So, for example, one of the problems the Philippines has is in a
variety of industries, because of poor regulatory climate and so forth.
You're depleting assets like fishing grounds. That kind of strategy
don't support increasing economic development. What you need to do is
you need to have a regulatory environment that says no, you can't fish
anymore than the fishing stock will permit. And that's a sign the
country is getting more developed. It has policies and regulations that
encourage conservation and renewal of resources. And ensure the
resources are not wasted. The prices set for resources are
market-driven prices so companies don't waste them. In a lot of
countries, the countries give away mineral deposits or timber rights.
But that's a bad policy. If government owns the land they should be
setting prices for timber that are (raw) prices. And that forces the
company to learn how to be more efficient. I don't think its inevitable
that resource-depletion will occur with economic development. In fact,
I think that successful economic development demands that the country
learns how to avoid depleting resources.

BW: I just want to play devil's advocate. Don't you agree with Jurassic
Park where one of the characters - the scientist - said the earth can
take care of itself?

MP: I think the earth can take of itself only if... I think one can
create an environment and... where we humans do unnecessary damage. And
see, I think its good business to not deplete the earth's resources. I
think if we can just get intellectually, the right framework. And if we
can get governments to understand that there's actually quite a bright
future for the earth.

Housing funds released to banks

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) chief executive officer and
president Zorayda Amelia C. Alonzo announced recently the release of
funds to housing loan conduit banks and subdivision developers as part
of HDMF's initiative towards alleviating the country's housing backlog.

Speaking at the regular business meeting of the Subdivision and Housing
Developers Association (SHDA) at the Shangri-La Makati, Ms. Alonzo said
Pag-IBIG Fund has released P60 million since August 23 for housing loan
take-outs in the National Capital Region under the Unified Home Lending
Program (UHLP) window processing system.

She also said Pag-IBIG Fund, with resources of P40 billion as of end of
first semester 1996, is the primary financier of the national shelter
program.

In addition to the P5.4 billion released by Pag-IBIG Fund when it took
over mortgages not taken out by the National Home Mortgage Finance
Corporation (NHMFC) in 1995, Pag-IBIG Fund is committing P5 billion to
UHLP in 1996.

Pag-IBIG Fund's own lending window, the Expanded Home Lending Program
(EHLP), released P1.1 billion between January to July through housing
developers and banks.

Ms. Alonzo also said the SSS committed P5 billion for housing loans for
1996 under Pag-IBIG's lending windows. The Government Service Insurance
System committed another P5 billion.

Meanwhile, target low-income borrowers of socialized housing projects
may now apply for amortization support on their home loans under the
Abot-Kaya Pabahay Fund (AKPF) administered by the National Home
Mortgage Finance Corporation (NHMFC).

During a recent Board of Director's meeting, NHMFC president Manual
Eduardo B. Lunas reported that, "cognizant of the realities of rising
land costs and escalating prices of housing construction, the
corporation has successfully secured the approval of the Housing and
Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) to amend the
qualification standards for availment of amortization subsidy under the
fund."

"To enable more low-income borrowers of social housing projects to
qualify for subsidy, the new AKPF guidelines provide for an increase in
the monthly gross family income cap by as much as 50%," Mr. Lunas added.

The AKPF amortization support component under Republic Act 6846 is a
two-tiered scheme which provides qualified borrowers a graduated
five-year support plan ranging from a high of 35% to a low of seven per
cent.

One of the requirements for availment is the monthly family gross
income of beneficiaries, now increased to P6,000 from P4,000 for Level
A and P7,000 from P5,000 for Level B.

New elevator technology reduces crowding

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

Jardine Schindler Elevator Corp. has announced the local availability
of the Schindler Miconic 10TM system, a revolutionary feature in its
Schindler 700 elevator series.

The Miconic 10TM allocates elevator cars to passengers according to
their destination before they even ride the car, thus reducing crowding
and confusion as elevator doors open.

"The Schindler 700 series of elevators is our premium line of elevators
for high-rise buildings. It was developed to ensure maximum efficiency,
comfort and aesthetic beauty to what will become architectural
landmarks," said Gus Haxton, Jardine Schindler Elevator Corp. general
manager.

"Now the Miconic 10TM enhances the Schindler 700's performance by
telling passengers what elevator they should ride before they approach
the car."

The Miconic 10TM has a hall call control system. Passengers enter the
number of their destination floor on a keypad installed in the elevator
lobby. The system will then assign an elevator and display it on a
small screen.

The assignment is based on the passenger's known destination. Crowding
in the car and lobby is then avoided, as well as rushing to the nearest
elevator door that opens.

Mr. Haxton said, "This system also ensures lesser landing stops during
the journey because the elevator knows how many will be in the car and
where its occupants are headed. Passengers will then get to their
floors faster and more comfortably. Elevator availability increases and
journey times decrease even under heavy traffic conditions."

Real estate body to host regional symposium here

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

Chamber of Real Estate and Builders' Association (CREBA) will host the
first ever regional symposium on "The Search for a Sustainable City for
the 21st Century" in Manila on October 16-19, 1996.

Techie Bautista, conference deputy director said, "In the main, the
quality of life in the cities of the 21st century is what the
conference is all about."

She added the conference is a private sector initiative which aims to
organize an industry-led movement to develop structural references for
an ecologically sustainable city for the next millennium.

New York University professor and CREBA consultant Rudy Cuba defines
sustainable city as a city "developed in ways that are socially just,
ecologically sustainable, politically participatory, economically
productive and culturally vibrant."

He also said the vision of a sustainable city is one that is integrated
with its natural surroundings and the province or region where it is
located.

"We are shedding the traditional concept of isolation. Instead, our
urban ecosystem is viewed as integral part and in concert with the
wider ecosystem," he said.

Gov"t bridge program faces delay

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

By Cecille E. Yap

With the rising number of politicians seeking to be accommodated, a
P1.3-billion government bridge program involving the construction of
207 pre-fabricated steel bridges nationwide, is facing delay.

A government source told BusinessWorld the final list of program
beneficiaries should have been finalized and approved by Malacanang
during the cabinet meeting Tuesday. However, the Department of Public
Works and Highways (DPWH) supposedly failed to submit its list of
to-be-constructed national bridges.

This is after several national and local officials approached DPWH and
the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) clamoring for
the inclusion of several areas in the list of project beneficiaries.

DPWH and DILG were expecting Malacanang's approval of the list of
beneficiaries this month. It may be noted the P1.3-billion project is
to be financed by the United Kingdom which is expected to release the
project loan this September.

In August, UK ambassador to the Philippines Adrian Thorpe and Foreign
Affairs Secretary Siazon signed an agreement involving the first
tranche of the loan totalling P360 million.

Of the P1.3 billion total project cost, 80% or P1.03 billion will be
shouldered by the United Kingdom, 35% of which is deemed a grant to the
Philippine government.

The DILG is taking charge of 134 local bridges under the program while
the DPWH will oversee the construction and rehabilitation of some 73
national bridges. It may be noted the bridge program involves the
installation of some 8,000 meters of pre-fabricated steel bridges
nationwide. It will cover 12 regions and 34 provinces.

Materials for bridges will be procured from Mabey & Johnson Limited, a
steel bridge producer endorsed by the UK government.

Under the original project timetable, the construction of bridges
should be completed by September 1997. Each bridge will be put up
within two weeks.

Construction boom until 1998, says Philippine Constructors Association

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

Players in the local construction industry expect the construction boom
in the country to continue until 1998.

In a statement, the Philippine Constructors Association, Inc. (PCA)
said local public and private construction will accelerate by an
average rate of 12.4% and 15% respectively, for the years 1996-1998.

This is in view of the government's expectation of an eight per cent
annual average growth in Gross National Product (GNP) during the same
period given increases in investments, exports and consumer-led
spending.

"There is a great demand for construction within the Asia-Pacific
region," said Rogelio M. Murga, PCA president.

"The heavier requirements for infrastructure investments to support the
region's growth is tremendous," he added.

He said government construction projects will account for 43% of total
construction demand in the 1996-1998 period.

The PCA president noted under the 1993-1998 Medium Term Philippine
Development Plan, the government's infrastructure program requirement
was placed at P594.7 billion.

Of the amount, 45% will go to energy, power and electrification; 31% to
transportation and 15% to water resources.

He also noted residential construction will dominate the private sector
in the coming years given the expected strong demand for affordable
housing.

In the urban centers, major projects such as Fort Bonifacio, Ortigas
Complex, and several projects in Makati are taking shape.

Business activity in urbanizing places such as Cebu, Davao, Baguio,
Subic, General Santos will also contribute to the sustained demand for
private buildings, he said.

The PCA is recognized by the government as the active voice of the
construction industry, and is often consulted by government on policy
matters.

Quezon City property values up by 100%

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

By Cecille E. Yap

Joining the rush of local government units providing for increases in
property assessment in their respective areas, the Quezon City council
passed recently Ordinance 357 which provides for as much as a 100% hike
in the fair market value of real estate in the city.

The increase is expected to pave the way for an increase in the city's
real property tax collections.

It may be noted Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code allows
local governments to revise property assessments by preparing a new
"schedule of fair market values" for different classes of real estate
in their respective areas.

Provided, however, the new schedule is enacted through an ordinance
passed by the city or municipal council.

Under the ordinance, the new schedule pertains to the fair market value
only of raw land. The city government has yet to formulate a new
schedule for property assessment which covers raw land as well as
improvements thereon.

"The Quezon City government is in need of funds to cover the cost of
the increasing basic and essential requirements for a rapidly growing
population and a highly accelerated urbanization," noted City Ordinance
357.

Under the ordinance, property assessments are expected to rise by 15%
in areas classified as residences and by as much as 40% in areas
falling under commercial and industrial classification.

Also, fair market value of real estate in residential areas is placed
at between P1,500 and P3,500 per square meter. Commercial areas,
meanwhile, is appraised between P4,000 and P6,000 per square meter.

Fair market value of real estate used for hotels and residential and
commercial condominiums is placed between P6,000 and P11,000 per square
meter, depending on the type.

Meanwhile, real estate used for restaurants, schools, funeral parlors,
gasoline stations, motels, gymnasiums and other recreational centers is
valued between P2,000 and P9,000 per square meter.

The ordinance noted the last time the Quezon City government undertook
a general revision of the schedule of real property assessment was in
1981. Thus, such assessment is now considered unrealistic and obsolete.

Data obtained from Quezon City Hall also showed revenue from real
property taxes increased by as much as 300% from 1994 to 1996.

In 1994, real property taxes collected totalled P267.6 million. In
1995, this rose to P665 million.

This year, the city council expects the tax collection to slightly drop
to P626 million due to lesser penalty collections.

Stork Group inks pact to make aircraft parts

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 22

Stork Group subsidiary Fokker Elmo has signed a contract with AVIC
(Aviation Industries of China) subsidiaries China Precision Engineering
Institute (CPEI) and China National Airborne Equipment Corporation
(CNAEC) to manufacture complex electrical wire harnesses for aircraft
for the benefit of both the Chinese and Western aviation industries.

The joint venture (60% Fokker Elmo shareholding), named Lang Fang
Fokker Corp., is also the basis for the development and manufacturing
of electrical systems for future Chinese aircraft programs, such as the
100-seat regioliner. Annual sales will grow to $50 million within five
years.

The contract was signed in the presence of many dignitaries in
Beijing's Great Hall of the People.

Fokker Elmo is part of the Fokker Aviation Group which was recently
acquired by the Stork Group of the Netherlands. In total, the Stork
Group employs over 20,000 people and has an annual turnover of $3
billion worldwide.

Fokker Elmo is located in Woensdrecht, the Netherlands, and specializes
in the design and manufacturing of electrical and electronic systems
for the aerospace and defense industries.

University of Asia and the Pacific set to expand course in advertising

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 22

By this time, everyone must have already heard about the University of
Asia and the Pacific (UA&P). From a think-tank conducting research in
economics and business, it set up a graduate school, and a liberal arts
college, all in just 25 years. More recently, people have been talking
about its unique program-graduating in just five years with a master's
degree.

The former Center for Research and Communication has kept true to its
old name. And just like its flagship, the Institute of Communication is
already setting its sails to establish the School of Communication
(SCM).

The Institute of Communication is just one of the many schools that the
University will set up. Right now, it offers undergraduate studies in
Communication focused on Advertising. Next year, it will already be
offering its five-year program in Advertising.

Surprisingly for a young program, barely six years old, the Institute
is already making a name for itself. Its faculty, for instance, is
composed mainly of notable practitioners from the industry. J.J.
Calero, CEO and chairman of J. Walter Thompson and Antonio Mercado,
chairman of Basic Advertising, have been teaching in the Institute for
almost two years now. Even today, more distinguished practitioners have
come to form part of the faculty. Some are CEOs and presidents of
multinational advertising agencies while others are entrepreneurs and
pioneers of their own agency. So students also learn to have that nose
for business and to value that skill of private enterprise.

The Institute believes in a theoretical and practical approach to
learning. That is why students are given a more first-hand and holistic
approach to education. In fact, the program's curriculum was patterned
after the International Advertising Association, the only global
partnership of advertisers, agencies, media and marketing
communications professionals. So the program is not only practical, but
also meets international standards.

Bankard launches double return promo

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 22

Bankard, Inc., the leading domestic credit card company and issuer of
Bankard One, the world's first installment smart card, offers its more
than 41,000 Bankard One cardholders the chance to win back twice the
amount of money they spent on their installment purchases using their
Bankard One through Bankard One's "Double Your Money Offer" raffle
promo.

With this promo, a Bankard One cardholder who purchases a television
set worth P10,000 will get the chance to win P20,000 in cash.
Cardholders who make their purchases during the "Double Your Money
Offer" promo period from July 1 to December 31 are automatically
included in the six monthly raffles plus the grand raffle draw. They
just have to use their cards and nothing else.

Three winners are picked in every monthly draw. On the last draw on
January 16, the grand winner will get P100,000 and the three winners
P20,000 each. Bankard One cardholders can win a total of seven times
which is equal to six monthly draws and the grand draw. However, they
cannot win more than once per month and of that amount, not more than
P100,000. All prizes are tax paid.

Individuals who do not yet own a Bankard One can apply for one, and if
approved, can start using their cards to qualify for the raffle draws.

The first and second monthly raffles took place last August 15 and
September 12. Succeeding draw dates are on October 10, November 14,
December 12 and January 16. To qualify for the raffle on October 10,
the cardholder will have to make his purchases not later than September
30. Cardholders who make purchases after September 30 qualify for the
November 14 draw, and so on for the remaining draws.

Cardholders who win in any of the raffle draws will still be eligible
to win in all the remaining draws. They do not have to make additional
purchases in order to qualify for the remaining draws if they already
won in the previous draws. All Bankard One cardholders are encouraged
to keep using their Bankard One cards, as the more they charge the more
money they get at double the amount if they win in any of the raffle
draws.

Philippine Press Institute-Philippine Geothermal, Inc in search of best
science stories

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 22

The 1996 Annual Science and Technology Journalism Awards shifts to high
gear as research activity intensifies and more journalists continue to
submit their published articles for evaluation and judging.

The awards program, sponsored by the Philippine Press Institute (PPI)
and Philippine Geothermal, Inc., (PGI), evaluates news and feature
articles on science and technology published between November 1995 and
October 1996.

Cash prizes amounting to P50,000, P30,000 and P20,000 will be awarded
to the first, second and third place winners, respectively. In
addition, P10,000 each will be given to the next five finalists.

The minimum standards set by the organizers are: the news story or
feature article - 500 words or more - must be about science and
technology in the Philippine setting and written by Filipino
journalists.

While the awards program has its own full-time research staff, the
organizers have set October 25 as the last day for journalists who wish
to send in their published work.

The articles may be forwarded to the Screening Committee Secretariat at
the PPI office, Unit 308 B.F. Condominium Bldg., A. Soriano corner
Solano Street, Intramuros, Manila.

Last year, more than 3,000 issues of 147 publications - composed of
national dailies, community newspapers and newsmagazines - were
screened. From this, a total of 1,486 stories on science and
technology, written by 424 authors, were subjected to a rigorous
evaluation and judging process.

FEATURE: Authorities rely on P70 lens to fight assault on the dollar

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

By Elisha R. Garcia

Have you ever looked at a dollar bill and wondered if it was fake?

Roughly 55% of the $360 billion currently in circulation is held by
people outside the United States, according to regional magazine Asia,
Inc. It said nearly $135 million worth of bogus bills were confiscated
outside the US in 1994, up from just $30 million two years earlier.

At the rate demand is rising as a result of increased consumerism and
globalization, don't be surprised if one of these bogus bills lands in
your hand one of these days.

"The sheer ubiquity of the US currency which has had essentially the
same size, color and configuration since 1929, makes it a primary
target for counterfeiters," Asia, Inc. reported. And the $100 bill,
which accounts for around 60% of the US currency in circulation, has
been the most frequently faked.

Color copiers, laser printers and high-tech graphics software make
banknotes easier to copy. Computer programs can be designed to generate
random or sequential serial numbers in the bills.

Growing concern over rampant counterfeiting prompted the US Federal
Reserve Bank to come out with new tamper-resistant bills, starting with
the $100 bill early this year.

In a brief on the new dollar bill, the Fed said "the noticeable change
in appearance of the dollar bill represents ongoing commitment to
protect the US currency."

Among the 14 features incorporated in the new design were an enlarged
off-center portrait of Benjamin Franklin, a polyester security thread
running through the paper, a translucent watermark, and inks that
change colors when viewed from different angles.

Despite these efforts, many say the US dollar bill continues to be
under threat.

In the Philippines, Bangko Sentral has launched an information
campaign. It holds training seminars for bank tellers, cashiers, branch
managers and even auditors, and promotes the use of simple, easy-to-use
instruments to check the authenticity of the dollar bills freely
entering the financial system.

Training sessions on basic information like the identification of
counterfeit money can last for a day, while sessions on the commonly
used modus operandi of counterfeiting and measures to counteract them
can last for a week, said Bangko Sentral bank officer Maja Gratia L.
Malic.

"We do not just provide training sessions to anybody interested. They
must have proper endorsement," Ms. Malic said.

"We are careful in giving out information as this may be passed on to
counterfeiters themselves... We request participants not to talk about
the finer details of their training," she explained.

In the training sessions, trainees are also taught how to use basic
instruments in detecting the authenticity of banknotes.

These include hand-held lens for examining fine prints and machines
with ultraviolet light which brings out the fluorescent parts of the
dollar bills.

"These are very easy to acquire and benefits outnumber the costs on the
part of the banks. There are also more advanced instruments available
to them which they can acquire at a higher cost," said Henry N. Eisma,
Bangko Sentral deputy director for cash.

An eyepiece or a simple lens costs around P70 while a desktop
ultraviolet light can be had at P300 a piece. On the other hand, a more
sophisticated machine may cost several thousands of pesos, Mr. Eisma
said.

Officials said there has been a substantial drop in the volume of
counterfeit money the central bank has retrieved.

In 1991, there were 5,920 pieces of counterfeit dollar bills estimated
to cost $583,266 that were accumulated, Bangko Sentral documents show.

Last year, the volume dwindled to 837 pieces worth $73,630. As of
August 1996, Bangko Sentral's cash department, soliciting the help of
the US Secret Service, accumulated 497 fake bills worth $39,000.

Requests to establish the authenticity of the bills usually come from
individuals, police authorities and owners of large establishments. The
central bank then issues a certificate verifying the authenticity of
the bills.

Among the establishments which regularly approach Bangko Sentral are
hotels, the Shoemart and Rustan's department store chains, duty-free
shops, the Philippine Amusements and Gaming Corp., and Laguna-based
theme park Enchanted Kingdom, Mr. Eisma said.

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

By Dulce J. Castillo

Fresh from its acquisition of First Philippine International Bank
(First Bank), PDCP Development Bank is targetting a net income of P155
million this year.

"We are working hard towards that direction and presently we are still
on target," bank president Carlos Torres recently told BusinessWorld.

Under the bank's expansion program, Mr. Toress said PDCP plans to have
a network of 80 branches by year-end. Its network grew to 76 from only
19 before the merger.

He said the bank is in the final stages of integrating the two banks'
physical infrastructures.

Late last year, PDCP Bank bought 90% of the assets and liabilities of
cash-strapped FirstBank in exchange for 33% of FirstBank's shares of
stock.

This, however, does not include FirstBank's the P390-million obligation
to Bangko Sentral which the central bank extended when the bank was hit
by heavy withdrawals about two years ago.

"The liabilities we assumed were just selected. There were certain
obligations to Bangko Sentral which we did not buy. I think, that has
been settled," Mr. Torres said.

FirstBank's debt is payable over 29 years. It has tapped Dutch-based
ING Bank which has arranged for a 28.5-year peso-denominated bond to
cover the debt.

PDCP Bank's shareholders include the Metro Pacific Corp. and
DEG-Deutsche Investitions-und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH.

MegaLink, ExpressNet to ink merger agreement

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

Two of the country's top consortia of automated teller machines (ATM),
Bank of the Philippine Islands' (BPI) ExpressNet and MegaLink, have
formally agreed to link up their networks by first quarter of next year.

The consortia will sign a memorandum of agreement on Sept. 24,
according to a BPI statement released yesterday.

The move will enable more than six million cardholders from both
networks to carry out banking transactions in over 1,500 ATM networks
in Metro Manila and the provinces, the statement said.

Aside from BPI, members of ExpressNet are Banco de Oro, BPI Family
Bank, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp., Land Bank of the Philippines
and Solidbank Corp.

Comprising MegaLink are Active Bank, Asian Banking Corp., Asiatrust
Bank, Banco Davao, Bank of Commerce, Bank of South East Asia, Capitol
Development Bank, Development Bank of the Philippines, Equitable
Banking Corp., Far East Bank and Trust Co., Insular Savings Bank,
International Exchange Bank, LBC Bank, PhilAm Savings Bank, Philippine
National Bank, Philippine Veterans Bank, Pilipinas Bank, Premiere
Development Bank, Prudential Bank, Queen City Development Bank, Traders
Royal Bank, Union Bank of the Philippines, United Coconut Planters
Bank, and Urban Bank.

MegaLink had earlier linked up with the country's third ATM network,
BancNet. The disparity between the computer systems of BancNet, which
uses a six-digit personal identification number (PIN), and ExpressNet
and MegaLink which both use a four-digit PIN, has been cited as a major
stumbling block in the possible merger of all three ATM consortia.

BANK ACCOUNTS: Not the same Friday

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

Last Friday's party of the Money Market Association of the Philippines
(MART) wasn't the kind of Friday Club that became infamously known for
being a sleazy venue for traders at the height of the Bancap scam.
Soon-to-be MART member International Exchange Bank hosted the evening's
affair which filled the second floor of Vincent's San Mig at Jupiter
St. in Makati City. The crowd was typically yuppie, with traders
exchanging pleasantries about the yield curve, the peso and their
banks' portfolio. Spotted hobnobbing with traders were Bangko Sentral
treasurer Boy Edeza and Bureau of Treasury deputy treasurer Eduardo
Mendiola.

BANK ACCOUNTS: Model employee

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

Another story circulating about the same bank is about its branch
manager who allegedly stashed away P90 million of the branch's funds in
Switzerland. Bank insiders say the manager was even a recipient of the
bank's loyalty award, having been in the bank for 25 years now.

BANK ACCOUNTS: Inside job

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

A big universal bank recently found its hands full of mounting
complaints from its credit cardholders after a key officer in the
bank's card division left in a huff. Industry sources say it was
already too late in the game when the bank discovered the officer had
faked billing statements and had personally pocketed payments. Heads
consequently had to roll when management discovered the officer had
managed to pull off the caper single-handedly for five years. Charges
can't be filed against the officer who came out in clean and is now
living somewhere in the US probably getting a tan in a beach in
California.

BANK ACCOUNTS: Hatta as the new BTr chief?

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

Bangko Sentral's accounting and information technology managing
director Teresita Hatta is being seriously considered to take the post
of National Treasurer Caridad Valdehuesa who is due to step down from
her office this September 30. While Ms. Valdehuesa's resignation may be
welcome news to some, especially to her deputy for internal affairs who
is at the forefront of an ouster move against the Treasurer, a number
of bank treasury officers feel the no-nonsense Ms. Valdehuesa has done
a good job in the BTr. They say it's during her stint when the capital
market deepened with the issuance of longer-tenored bonds and the
computerization of government securities trading. Never mind if she's
in a tiff with monetary authorities once in a while.

BANK ACCOUNTS: "Publicly listed" bank kuno

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

People at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) must have discussed
some things in their stockholders' meeting that would pose a threat to
national security. Members of media and brokers went home in disgust
last Monday after they were barred from covering the RCBC meeting.
Stockholders' meetings are traditionally open to reporters and
analysts. "The instruction from management was that the stockholders'
meeting will be exclusively for stockholders because the venue is quite
small," Griselda Barrot, a lawyer with RCBC, was quoted in Bloomberg as
saying. Prior to the incident, the bank informed the Philippine Stock
Exchange (PSE) it plans to discuss a 10-fold hike in its authorized
capital to P8 billion. The meeting may have been held closed-door
because the bank is anticipating some shareholders to oppose a plan to
sell P2.5 billion of shares to the public to raise an additional P2
billion via a stock sale to current owners, an RCBC official told
BusinessWorld. In a disclosure yesterday to the PSE, the bank said the
plans have been approved by its board. The bank is controlled by the
family of Philippine Ambassador to Japan Alfonso Yuchengco.

Chefs on Parade opens today

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 23

Chefs on Parade (COP) '96 is just one of three food related events
which will be held at the Philippine International Convention Center
(PICC) starting today until Sept. 21.

Being held concurrently are Hotelexpo '96, which is the 6th
International Trade Exhibition on Hotel and Restaurant Equipment, and
Bakexpo '96, the 3rd International Trade Exhibit on Equipment and
Supplies for the Bakery and Confection Industry.

Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor will lead the opening rites of the COP at
10 a.m. at the PICC Plenary Hall, followed by the opening rites of the
other two expositions at the PICC Reception Hall. She will be assisted
by the chairman of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of the
Philippines (HRAP) Larry Cruz, HRAP President Leo Prieto, Jr., COP '96
chairman Bobby Carpio, and Alexander Limjoco, the chairman of World
Exhibitions and Conventions, Inc., which organized Hotelexpo '96 and
Bakexpo '96.

For his part, Mr. Prieto said, "Chefs on Parade '96 is expected to
secure the country's place in the international culinary scene while
strengthening trade relations, exchanging cuisine, culinary products
and food service technology among APEC's 18-member economies."

Representatives from 70 local hotels and restaurants are expected to
participate in this year's COP, which is a culinary competition
organized by the HRAP. Also participating are students from Hotel and
Restaurant Administration and Hotel and Restaurant Management schools
in the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Now on its 21st year, COP
will gather at least 3,000 professionals in 1,000 entry line-up for 35
major competitions for professional and student categories. The
competitions will showcase the best talents in the varied ways of food
and drink preparation, from cold food to cocktail preparation, hot
dish, Filipino cuisine, cake decoration, wedding cakes, pastries, fruit
and vegetable carving, ice carving and butter sculptures, table setting
and menu folder competitions.

As the COP this year adopts the theme "A Salute to APEC," eight of the
competitions will carry the APEC theme.

One of the sponsors, Asia Brewery Inc., this year will be adding the
following competitions to the usual line-up of events: the Q-Shandy
Table Display/Butter Carving Contest (open to professionals in the food
service industry); on-the-spot cocktail mixing contests - The Most
Creative Q-Shandy Mix for COP '96 and The Most Creative Beer Mix for
COP '96 (open to professionals and students).

Hotelexpo '96 will showcase new products, trends and technologies from
the Philippines, the US, Australia, Taiwan, Italy, Spain, Germany, and
other European countries. Admission to the trade exhibition is free.

During Bakexpo '96, the Philippine Federation of Bakers Associations,
Inc. will be conducting baking seminars, demonstrations and
consultations. Admission to the trade exhibit is also free.

The three events are expected to draw over 18,000 visitors this year.
Tickets to the COP may be purchased at the HRAP counter.

Pickwick"s Capers: Something from China

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 24

As you all are reading this, I shall be enjoying myself wandering
around this year's Chefs on Parade, once again marvelling at the
intricate sculptures made from butter and chocolate. All of these are,
thankfully, in the traditional form of sculpture. One can actually know
what they are meant to be. We have yet to witness anyone attempting
modern art by welding together those frightful airline butter packs.

Of course, it is the active competitions that I enjoy. Watching any man
practicing an art that he has spent many years of his life in
perfecting is always a joy. Watching these chefs in action is actually
exciting. One wonder as to when one of our restaurants will emulate
that now proving popular in London aptly named "Chef's Table." As you
are all aware, London and some of its "top people" can display a
certain snobbishness, especially in restaurants. To be known by the
Patron and shown to the best table displays one's importance to the
rest of the world. The best table used to be the one in the corner or
by the window, where one could see and more importantly be seen by
everyone. That has all changed. To really be "in" one is now offered
the one and only table that is set up in the kitchen. Here, the chef
will recommend and personally prepare the food and have the correct
wines served. All the while, you and your guests can watch him in
action and receive his personal service. Nobody can see you, however,
but they all are aware that you are there. A lovely idea though, if one
can afford it as I understand the bill tends to match the meal. At
least at COP one can watch the chefs in action, even if only the judges
get to try the end result.

I read a rather amusing but true story this week about one amateur cook
who had a distressing experiencing. In 1987, a lady, a cottage dweller
in Dartmoor, Devon, popped some scones into the oven and completely
forgot about them.

An hour later, just as she was stepping into the bath, she suddenly
recalled them. Without even grabbing a towel, she dashed stark naked
into the kitchen and while gripping the oven handle, she heard a knock
on the back door. Being in the country, she knew that if it was the
baker and if she didn't answer, he would automatically let himself in
and put the bread on the table. In a panic, she nipped into the broom
cupboard.

Hiding in the darkness, she heard the latch click and footsteps
crossing the kitchen, whereupon the cupboard door was opened by the
gasman who had come to read the meter. "Oh," said the woman, "I was
expecting the baker." When she got out, the scones were burnt as well.

Some newspaper columnists have of late indulged in attacking
restaurants for their practice of charging the full 10% VAT on the
final account. Their argument is that the customer should only pay the
same as that remitted by the restaurant owner to the BIR, which is
approximately 6%. This is, of course, nonsense. The reason that the
patron is only remitting the 6% to the BIR is that he has already given
4% to his supplier. If he treated this 4% as a cost, we, the consumer,
would be considerably worse off. As a simple example to prove the
point, he pays the supplier P100 plus P10 VAT. He now adds his wages,
overheads and profit and sells this to us at P200 plus VAT. We have
paid him P20 in VAT. He deducts the P10 he has already given the
supplier and remits P10 to the BIR. Thus, the full P20 has been
remitted. His mark up is 100% on cost. Should he treat his total
supplier's invoice as cost, then his selling price to ourselves would
be P220 plus VAT. Instead of our total bill being P220 as under the
present system, it would now become P242. I suggest to all campaigners
that it is a subject best left alone.

Most columnists delight in starting rumors. Pickwick, however, delights
in ending them. For months, rumors have been flying that probably the
most famous and popular watering hole for both foreigners and Filipinos
alike was, after 15 years, about to close its doors. Indeed, part of
the rumors were true, that being that as so many other businesses in
Makati, the owners were being subjected to rapacious and unrealistic
demands for lease renewal. While the property market contains so much
heat, as is currently the case, we will witness many food and beverage
outlets closing their doors in the coming years, especially in the
Makati district. Property owners are failing to understand that
restaurant customers will only frequent an establishment if its prices
are considered reasonable. Thus, there is a ceiling to what can be
charged and still attract customers. There is a mathematical percentage
of gross turnover that is the maximum one can pay for the business to
remain viable. Demands in excess of this mean closure.

It is true that prolonged negotiations over the lease of this
establishment did put the business in danger of closure and thus no
further investment was made by the owners. This danger is not only now
over, but the establishment is now ensured of a further ten years
tenure. Regular customers may experience some inconvenience however as
some extensive refurbishment will be undertaken to bring it to the
standards demanded by today's market. A new general manager has been
appointed whose plans for both cuisine and entertainment are really
quite exciting. For those of us who have used the facilities for many
years, it has become part of our personal history and we can now be
assured of it remaining so. Thus endeth the rumor!

Well, the best made plans for mice and men so oft they go astray. Some
weeks ago, during the daytime, my driver had taken me through an area
near Cubao which seemingly contained a number of restaurants that
appeared could well be of interest. I have ventured to my good lady
wife that we should visit this area one evening to sample the offered
cuisine. Whether the gods are interfering with my plans, I know not. It
would seem, however, that every time we plan for this outing, the
heavens open and the earth is deluged with rain. Full knowing that the
ill-drained streets of this metropolis will provide the inevitable
floods that not only cause inconvenience but drain many hours from an
otherwise useful life, we thus become reluctant to undertake such a
journey. We are thus committed, until the dry season commences, to only
explore within striking distance of our home. As we have covered this
beat for well over a year, it is becoming increasingly difficult to
find an establishment at which we have not dined. It was a relief,
therefore, to find a relatively new restaurant right in the heart of
Greenbelt, albeit offering Chinese cuisine, that of South Villa.

South Villa is not only new, it is bright, very, very bright. The
lighting is almost intense and with large uncurtained windows on two
sides, is not an establishment to be considered for an intimate meal
with one's paramour, not as though Pickwick would indulge in such
activity, I hasten to add. The tables are well set, sparkling white
tablecloths, excellent linen and available condiments such as soy and
hot sauce available.

The menu is not extensive, but interesting. I am unable to tell you as
to the province of China from which the type of dishes emulate. It did
not appear to be Cantonese and definitely not that area that I can
never spell correctly but phonetically sounds like, "Says one." (That's
Szechuan. - Ed.) I did ask the Filipino waiter as to where the food was
from and he answered, "China." An observant young man, one would think.

The range of soups offered was indeed extensive. My good lady wife
selected her favorite Chicken and Corn soup. A good portion presented,
but what can one say about Chicken and Corn soup except I admonished
her for failing our readers in the face of such alternatives. As
Shakespeare might of said on a decidedly off day, "The soup was good."

I had decided on the Beef and Tomato soup and was very pleasantly
surprised. The liquid was thin, but tasty. Quarters of peeled, fresh
tomatoes were aplenty, amongst which were thin strips of very tender
beef. The whole was both tasty yet delicate, one of the better soups
that I have had for a long time. Very, very good.

As usual, for our main dishes, we, like all others, selected far too
much. The menu lists prices for three sizes. I had started to select
the "Medium" when the waiter politely suggested that for just the two
of us, the small would probably be sufficient. How correct he turned
out to be. The portion of the "Small" is indeed generous.

We ordered the Beef with Macadamia Nuts. A delightful combination that
also contained well prepared vegetables. I adore macadamias, as long as
someone else has opened them. During our sojourn in Australia, at one
place, we were staying, a tree was in the garden. We would collect the
nuts, but the shells are the toughest thing in nature. Normal
nutcrackers just snap, hammering them is dangerous as they shoot off,
unbroken at any angle. If you do succeed with the hammer, the nut tends
to also be smashed and mixed with bits of shell. The solution turned
out to be the vice in the garage.

I digress. The beef was tasty chunks and very tender. The nuts were
delicious and probably the hardest thing that I have ever attempted to
pick up with chopsticks.

We had ordered the rice Fookien style. I would suggest that if you are
accompanied by a lady from the general area of Pampanga, as I was, with
my good lady wife, then you order this by pointing it on the menu. A
look of absolute shock came over her face as she misinterpreted my
words. (Only Filipinos with a knowledge of filthy language will
understand this comment.) The rice, which is what we would refer to as
fried rice, was particularly good and tasty. Good texture and moist,
with various vegetables finely chopped. For me, the good thing about
this was that it was also served in individual bowls. This allowed me
the luxury of spooning the beef dish on top, thus not only enjoying the
dish but even adding more flavor to the rice.

We had ordered Seafood Rolls, and again, be warned, the "Small" portion
contains eight quite large pieces. The rolls have a crispy, deep-fried
cover. Inside, they contain chopped squid and shrimp, with some finely
chopped carrot and probably celery. Unfortunately, they have also
included mayonnaise, a sauce of which I am not particularly fond, whose
creaminess overwhelms the seafood flavor. A dish of mayonnaise is
provided as an extra dip. Our American cousins, who tend to have a
penchant for this type of dressing, would probably enjoy them, but they
are not for me, nor even my good lady wife.

We had also requested the roast pigeon. A pigeon chopped into quarters
was delivered with crisp noodles. A rich dark meat which I enjoy. I
feel a little revenge when eating pigeon, revenge against all of that
breed of bird that has throughout my life indicated that they would
like to purchase my motor vehicle. Well, they at least leave a deposit
on it and it is there in black and white. My good lady wife found the
meat very tough. I thoughtfully informed her that in England pigeons
were allowed to hang in the garden until it was maggot-ridden and this
made the meat very tender. She, with an unusually pale face asked how
one removed the maggots. Upon being informed that one didn't bother as
they had been consuming the meat and therefore tasted the same, she
decided upon a visit to the comfort room. Being married to me has
decidedly improved her general knowledge.

I had consumed two glasses of the Paul Masson Chablis wine during the
meal, which was not that bad at all. It definitely goes well with
Chinese cuisine.

While I indulged in Chinese tea, my good lady wife tasted the Mango
Puree which she declared delicious. To the delight of our driver, the
fairly good portion of the meal that we had failed to consume was
packed for takeaway and we paid our bill of just over P1,500. Very good
value.

Overall, we had a pleasant meal served by polite and friendly staff. To
be fair to other cuisines though, Chinese can really never be described
as fine dining, so an award of two top hats is a reasonable assessment.

Quezon City"s little secret

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 23

By Vladimir S. Bunoan

Although it boasts of a popular restaurant row in Tomas Morato Avenue,
home of several old-time favorites like Mario's and Alfredo's Steak
House, Quezon City doesn't enjoy the same reputation as Makati - and
now the Ortigas Center - when it comes to fine dining.

Its restaurants, although doing great business among the many residents
in this part of the town, are generally old-fashioned, which means
having menus filled with such classic Filipino fine dining staples as
steaks and Caesar Salad. Generally, restaurants in Makati are more
adventurous when it comes to their menus, and with the growing
sophistication of Filipino diners, many establishments in Quezon City
seem dated.

But there is one restaurant in Quezon City that is breaking all the
preconceived notions about eateries north of Makati. Established less
than a year ago, Blue Bacon and Green Eggs has proven that the Quezon
City crowd is just as discriminating as the expense-account foodies of
Makati.

While positive word-of-mouth has tempted diners from as far away as
Antipolo and Alabang to check out the restaurant, this
deli-cum-restaurant has built a loyal following among those who either
live or work in Quezon City, including celebrities like Pops Fernandez,
Ogie Alcasid, and Gelli de Belen, who proudly calls it her "secret
little place."

Increasingly, however, more and more are let in on this secret. Food
critics like Doreen Fernandez have been generous with praise and are
personally recommending it to their friends. In the latest edition of
the Fodor's Guide to Manila, Blue Bacon and Green Eggs made it to the
list of restaurants for tourists to try.

That the restaurant is not located on a major street (it sits off
Balete Drive, on Lantana Street corner Boston, almost right across the
Boston Gallery) makes its success even more noteworthy. In a business
where "location, location, location" is considered a mantra, Blue Bacon
and Green Eggs seems to be more attuned to the "If you build it, they
will come" school of thought.

For owner Mike Prado, that seems to be an apt motto. A businessman who
made his fortune in exporting furniture and home accessories, Mr. Prado
believes that his entry into the food business is providential.

A member of the Catholic Charismatic Movement, Mr. Prado noticed that
his exports were not doing as well as before, and in fact seemed to be
on the decline. At the point, he prayed and asked God if he should
start looking at other businesses.

Mr. Prado had dabbled in businesses other than exports. He once
produced a musical called By George!, a musical tribute to American
composer George Gershwin, which was directed by his good friend, Behn
Cervantes. It was staged at the Metropolitan Theater in 1991. Although
he said he didn't lose money on that venture, he feels the theater
scene then didn't have the momentum it seems to be enjoying these days.

Mr. Prado admits that his biggest dream was to one day open a
restaurant. His friends attest to his skills in entertaining guests at
his home. He had the interest although he candidly admits that he
didn't know a thing about opening and running a restaurant.

He was asking for a sign from God, although the idea of putting up a
restaurant had become increasingly tempting. He knew that the sign
would be in the form of flowers, and one day a nun gave him a bouquet
of white roses for the little chapel within his residential compound.
He knew this was the sign he was waiting for ("Let's face it, a man
doesn't get flowers," he said). Immediately, he called up his architect
and had the restaurant built.

Everything, he said, just fell into place, as if indeed it was being
guided by a greater power. He had no problems in staffing, the supplier
for the delicatessen even agreed to give a two-week seminar for the
employees, and he got chefs who were trained in Le Souffle. ("I didn't
pirate them," he stressed.)

Sans the usual publicity blitz that accompanies restaurant openings,
satisfied customers spread the word and quickly the restaurant with the
funny name and the unusual location became a surprise hit. From a small
30-seater restaurant inside the deli, it has since been expanded to
accommodate around 100 guests, scattered in three areas. The original
dining area beside the deli, an al fresco garden setting with views of
lush greenery and a small waterfall (also the smoking area), and
another air-conditioned area, which was rushed to accommodate the
volume of Valentine's Day reservations.

(About the name, he explained he didn't know of the Dr. Seuss book,
Green Eggs and Ham, until after he opened the restaurant, and denied
that he is affiliated with La Salle and Ateneo. "Bacon and Eggs" was
already decided on, but he literally added more color to the way it
sound.)

Mr. Prado believes there are two important elements in the restaurant's
success - creativity and consistency. As the restaurant is connected to
a deli, the chefs have more ingredients to play around with. For
instance, Mr. Prado is proud that his is the only one in Quezon City
that offers goose liver (done pan-fried with scallops and served with
goat cheese, Parma ham, lettuce and Madeira dressing). A new addition
to the menu is Penne al Gorgonzola, a pasta dish flavored with the
strong Gorgonzola cheese plus Parmesan, with strips of garlic Italian
sausage, sundried tomatoes and fresh cream.

The menu is quite extensive, offering the usual deli sandwiches and
cold cuts, a long list of pasta dishes, and chef's specialties, plus a
variety of desserts, imported beer, souffles and coffee.

Mr. Prado, whose office is just next door to the restaurant, is now
making sure of the consistency. He is aware that the usual pitfall of
restaurant owners is expanding too fast, and he is careful not to be
tempted by this success.

He states confidently that he will continue with his export business,
which has since rebounded, thus calming the fears of his export clients
that he has not turned into a full-time restaurateur. He is, in fact,
planning to put up an IKEA-style furniture shop to cater to new
homeowners.

He is also thinking of converting another section of his compound into
a ballroom for shows and family-style entertainment.

Who says you can't have the best of both worlds?

Cambodia: Inside the KR: Innocent people tortured into confessing to
'crimes' and executed by the Pol Pot regime

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Chiep Mony

Many innocent people were tortured into confessing to various "crimes"
against the state during the four-year genocidal regime under the Khmer
Rouge.

After confessing, these people were summarily executed. Among those who
had fallen victim were officials of the Sangkum Reastr Niyum era of the
then-Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Republican regime of Lon Nol, anyone
believed to be an intellectual, such as students and teachers, as well
as all the civil servants of the previous governments.

Others who were considered "unimportant" people to the Pol Potists were
not even interrogated after being arrested by the authorities. They were
just executed immediately, said former Khmer Rouge information officer
Nhem Ein.

Nhem Ein met with the Cambodia Times again last week and revealed the
stories of the Khmer Rouge rule between 1975 and 1979.

He said that to monitor the many interrogations and executions
through-out the country, the Pol Pot government had set up the Toul Sleng
torture centre in 1977.

"The chief of the centre was Duch, his deputy was Hea while the person
in charge of translating documents from Vietnamese to Khmer was Chan,"
he said.

He said the three men led the executions carried out at the centre by
receiving orders direct from the central Khmer Rouge leadership.

Toul Sleng, measuring a square km, was the main Khmer Rouge interrogation
and torture centre and could be considered the ministry of interior
during the guerilla regime.

Nhem Ein said the men at the centre were assigned a special mission to
"destroy the internal enemies" of the Khmer Rouge.

He said these "enemies" were normally people who were suspected of being
CIA or KGB spies or Vietnamese agents deployed in Cambodia. There were
also other "secret agents" who were "attempting to act against the Pol
Pot regime".

He said the Khmer Rouge personnel at the Toul Sleng centre were also
assigned to look for officials who had worked for the Prince Sihanouk
regime or the Lon Nol government and to file charges against them.

Nhem Ein said that under the maoist and dictatorial leadership of Pol
Pot, the Khmer Rouge had also created a "formula" to determine who were
intellectuals and to execute them.

"As a result, students and teachers, as well as officials who had worked
for the Prince Sihanouk and Lon Nol governments were arrested and
executed.

He said the Khmer Rouge devised various methods to interrogate prisoners.
"Some victims had their nails removed, others were electrocuted, some
were forced to drink fish brine, or had water poured into their noses,
while yet others were starved," he said.

"In fact, the interrogations were so cruel most of the prisoners ended
up confessing to crimes they did not commit," Nhem Ein said. "They could
not stand the suffering any more."

He said those who were regarded as unimportant persons were also arrested
but they were not interrogated. "Photographs of the victims would be
taken and they would be sent for execution immediately," he said.

Nhem Ein said the victims could be killed in any one of the prisons in
Toul Sleng, Prey Sar, Prek Hou or Choeung Ek.

He said that when youths were arrested, they were sent for execution
without their photographs being taken. However, if they were government
officials or military officers, their pictures were taken and sent as
evidence to the Khmer Rouge leadership.

Nhem Ein said the Khmer Rouge officers worked day and night to torture
and question the victims.

He said that in mid-1978, 30 Thai fishermen and three Europeans were
executed at the Toul Sleng centre.

He said random executions were also carried out against popular singers.
One was a famous singer Chhorn, who was ordered to sing the Democratic
Kampuchea songs together with Mai, a woman artiste.

Nhem Ein believes that another well-known singer Sin Sisamuth, known for
his "golden voice" was executed in either Prey Sar or the Tonle Bati
prison in 1976.

He said the singer had been executed for singing songs from the Sangkum
Reastr Niyum era while working in the padi fields. These songs had been
banned by the Khmer Rouge.

Also purged and killed were the commanders of Divisions 18 to 24, namely
Huo Nim, Vorn Vet, Hock, Chek An, Nat and a general Som. These were the
people who led the resistance movement in the 1970s. A former information
officer close to Huo Nim was also killed.

"Also executed were several commanders accused of being CIA or KGB spies
or Vietnamese agents such as Sok, Ya, Chakry, Nhem Phoem and Sy," Nhem
Ein said.

He said another objective of Pol Pot was to screen all students and
intellectuals and information on them was documented.

"The data and pictures of these students could fill 20 bus-loads," he
said.

"The students were called the "newly-liberated" people or the "17 April"
people. They were regarded as important and were sent to prison in Phnom
Penh.

"Those who were found to be involved in education were executed
immediately because they were thought to be in the way of the regime to
achieve its dream of a nation of agrarians," Nhem Ein added.

Cambodia: Govt appeals for help as floods worsen

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

The Royal Government of Cambodia has sent out an urgent appeal for
assistance as the floods continue to worsen in several parts of the
kingdom.

This year's floods, the worst in several years, have since taken 16
lives, and up to 1.3 million people are believed to have been affected.

Seven people have been reported missing and at least 500,000 people, who
are in the worst hit areas, require emergency assistance.

The government estimates that it needs more than US$5 million to carry
out relief operations and it is appealing for donations in cash, kind and
services to help the victims.

The deluge has since affected six provinces that lie in the Mekong basin,
namely Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, Kratie, Kompong Cham, Kandal and Prey
Veng, as well as the outskirts of Phnom Penh.

In addition, at least 232,000 hectares of rice fields have been flooded
and the government reported that about 120,000 hectares have been
destroyed in the floods.

A total of 25 cases of diarrhea and vomiting have also been reported in
one village.

Cambodia: Floods hit 1.3 million people

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Cheang Sopheng

A total of 1.3 million people from six provinces have been affected by
the floods this year, and at least 500,000 of them require emergency aid.

The victims are from the provinces of Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, Kratie,
Kompong Cham, Kandal and Prey Veng, which are located along the Mekong
River.

Also affected are those living on the outskirts of the capital city,
Phnom Penh.

Most of the victims have been evacuated to higher ground or have made
their own way to areas which are still not flooded.

However, the worst may already be over. Reports received from the
affected areas showed that the water level is already receding, albeit
slowly, though the situation is still grave.

Vast areas cultivated with padi have also been badly affected by the
floods. Based on reports received from the affected provinces, the
government estimates that a total of 232,000 hectares of padi fields have
been affected.

Of the total area, an estimated 120,000ha of padi fields, located closest
to the Mekong River, have been destroyed.

Figures that have reached Phnom Penh from the affected provinces show
that in Kompong Cham province, 25,212ha of padi fields have been
destroyed. In Kandal province, farmers lost 9,200ha and in Prey Veng,
another 50,000ha have been destroyed.

Details on the damage caused in the other provinces are expected to be
made available by the government this week.

The governor of Kompong Cham, Hun Neng, said the floods had affected at
least one third of the population who live in 12 of the 16 districts in
the province.

He said 274 dwellings in the province were already under water, and
28,960ha of padi fields have been badly damaged by the floods.

He estimated that about 2,400 tonnes of rice seeds would be needed for
next year's planting season.

Hun Neng said a stretch of 150m on the National Route 6, between Phnom
Penh and Kompong Cham, as well as a bridge, have already been damaged by
the floods.

Stretches along National Route 7 which runs through Kompong Cham town,
have also been severely damaged.

The governor of Prey Veng, Tep Nonary, said five districts in his
province have been seriously affected by the floods and more than
50,000ha of padi fields have been destroyed. Between 80 and 90 per cent
of the remaining four districts are also flooded.

As of last week, he said, 11,399 people have been evacuated and 3,149
dwellings were already under water.

Five areas along National Route 11 have been cut off by the floods. The
first deputy governor of Kratie province, Ven Sokhy, said 24,000ha of
padi fields have already been flooded.

He said 13,000ha of the padi crop have already been destroyed.

The Minister of Public Works and Transport, Ing Kieth, said more than 4km
of road from Phnom Penh to Sway Rieng have been damaged while the roads
from the capital city to Kompong Cham and Kompong Thom had been
destroyed.

Ing Kieth, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said his ministry officials
would inspect the roads and bridges after the floods and in areas where
there is an immediate need, the government would pay for the repairs of
the roads and bridges.

Cambodia: US$5 mil needed for flood relief operations

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

The Royal Government needs US$5.1 million in cash, kind or services from
international and local donors to meet the immediate needs of 500,000
people who have been hit by the floods.

The emergency assistance is needed to evacuate the flood victims and to
provide them with alternative accommodation, food and clothes.

The Co-Prime Ministers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen had
launched the appeal for aid last month by urging foreign and local
companies, international organisations, non-governmental organisations
(NGOs), the United Nations and friendly countries to chip in with
donations.

Several countries and organisations have, in fact, already sent aid in
cash and in kind.

Deputy Prime Minister Ing Kieth said a meeting would be held this week
with representatives of the foreign embassies and aid agencies to discuss
the supply of aid to the flood victims.

The co-premiers have also been appealing for assistance as they toured
the various provinces affected by the floods.

"I would like to call on the various NGOs, the United Nations,
international organisations as well as local and foreign companies to
help meet the urgent needs of the victims of this disaster," Prince
Ranariddh said during a trip to Kompong Cham.

Hun Sen, who was also in Kompong Cham last week, described the situation
as a "great disaster" and said emergency aid was urgently needed.

The cabinet of Prince Ranariddh also issued a statement requesting
immediate assistance for the victims.

In response, the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), the International Federation of the Red
Cross and Unicef met the National Committee for Disaster Management to
assess the situation and the assistance required.

The representatives said after the meeting that they would submit their
proposals which would be reviewed by the international donors and aid
agencies to come up with an aid plan.

Meanwhile, the government estimated that a total of 8,000 tonnes of rice
seeds would be needed over the next month in the areas most seriously
affected by the floods when planting begins after the floods.

Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Tao Seng Hour said 4,000
tonnes of rice seeds had been prepared and would be supplied to victims
in the six badly affected provinces.

He said the ministry was also preparing to provide more than one million
litres of fuel for water pumps that are used in the padi fields.

He said the ministry would supply 300 tonnes of the rice seeds to Prey
Veng, the most badly affected province, once the floods have receded.

Nhim Vanda, who heads the disaster management panel, said aid agencies
have provided emergency funds and 2,300 tonnes of rice to the victims.

Speaking to flood victims in Prey Veng province last week, Prince
Ranariddh said the government had instructed the Ministry of Commerce to
prepare 1,600 tonnes of rice and other kinds of food for them.

He said local and foreign humanitarian organisations had donated tonnes
of rice through him, Hun Sen and president of the National Assembly
Samdech Chea Sim.

As the flood waters were rising, hundreds of victims also gathered
outside the Royal Palace to seek aid from King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen
Monineath.

In a broadcast on TV, the king expressed his sorrows over the sufferings
of the people and the damage to property and loss of animals caused by
the floods.

Cambodia: When it rains, it pours

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Disasters such as floods tend to affect the poor and needy more than
anyone else.

For 18-year-old Neun Run, forced by his parents to look for a job in
Phnom Penh, it was a period of starvation, fainting spells and the loss
of his hard-earned money.

After four days without food, and several fainting spells, Neun Run had
collapsed along Mao Tsetoung Boulevard last Thursday.

A motodop driver and staff of the Cambodia Times, who found him lying on
the roadside, brought him to the newspaper office where he was given
food, a drink and some medicine.

Neun Run, who is from Memot district, Kompong Cham province, said his
village was badly hit by the floods two weeks ago.

He said that when the water overflowed his village, hundreds of families
moved to the highlands while some found refuge along the highways. His
family lost everything except two sacks of rice which they managed to
carry with them.

A week later, when the food supply was running out, his parents told him
that he had to leave for Phnom Penh to try to get a job.

He said he then decided to leave for the capital city with a neighbour,
22-year-old Chon Ra, who told him that he could get a job washing cars
in Phnom Penh.

"Chon Ra told me we could earn 12,000 riels per month," he said. "He said
he could get a job in Phnom Penh but he needed an advance from my family.
Finally we agreed to give him 12,000 riels."

However, Neun Run said, when they reached Phnom Penh, Chon Ra ran away
with all the money and he was left for four days without food. "I slept
on the roadside and drank water from the potholes. I was living like an
animal," he added.

Neun Run said this was his first trip to the capital city and he does not
have any relatives there.

"I have no alternative now but to go back to my family to help them plant
rice after the floods have receded, but I do not have any money for
travelling," he added.

Meanwhile, in Prey Veng province, victims told the Cambodia Times that
several families were experiencing a shortage of food and medicine.

They said 25 people from the village of Angkor Ang had been hit by
diarrhea and were vomiting after eating stale food and drinking dirty
water. However, they have been treated at a local clinic.

"We will die if there is no emergency supply from the government. We need
food and medicine now," said 48-year-old Chhun Hear. "This is a bad
situation for us."

Cambodia: Willy brings the rain that causes the floods

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

The severe floods in Cambodia this year have been caused by heavy rains
over the upper reaches of the Mekong River, brought on by the hurricane
Willy.

In the past two weeks, heavy rains have been recorded in the highlands
in southern China, Laos and north-east Cambodia, areas through which the
Mekong River flows.

Hurricane Willy also caused storms and downpours in Laos and parts of
Cambodia, causing the water in the Mekong River to rise up to an
extraordinarily high level.

The director of the Hydrology Department, Lim Kean Hour, said that in
Laos alone, up to 200ml of rainfall had been recorded during this period,
making the situation worse for Cambodia.

However, he said, the flood is not expected to affect Phnom Penh,
although several areas on the outskirts of the capital city have also
been flooded.

He said the water level of the Mekong River would be lower downstream.
Furthermore, he said, the water level in Tonle Sap lake has still not
reached its maximum and thus could take in more water.

The Tonle Sap lake, located in the north-western part of the kingdom,
acts as a safety valve for nature's drainage system.

The Tonle Sap river flows from the lake and joins the Mekong near Phnom
Penh. However, when there is excess water in the Mekong, the water flows
back into the lake, thus preventing areas downstream from being flooded.

Lim Kean Hour said Phnom Penh would only be flooded if the water level
in the Tonle Bassac river rises above the 11.2m mark.

As of last Friday, the level had reached 10.9m, so excess water could
flow back into the Tonle Sap lake, thus averting floods in the city and
areas downstream of the Mekong River, including southern Vietnam, he
added.

Cambodia: Reprieve illegal workers

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Chheang Sopheng

Cambodians will be allowed to work in Thailand under an agreement to be
signed between the governments of the two countries soon.

This move will mean a reprieve for the more than 30,000 Cambodians who
are currently working illegally in the neigbouring kingdom.

The relaxation on the import of foreign labour by the Thai government
will also cover those from Myanmar and Laos - the other two countries
which share common borders with Thailand.

The new regulation will also cover those workers from Cambodia, Laos and
Myanmar who are at present illegally employed in Thailand.

Prasitt Caitong Pan, the director-general of the Thai Department of
Employment in the Ministry of Social Welfare explained that the
government had decided to allow the illegal workers from these countries
to work legally in Thailand because of the geographical proximity between
them and their cultural and traditional similarities.

Besides, the governments of the four countries have a history of
cooperation and good relations, he added.

The Thai government and its Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour have
come up with regulations on how to deal with the illegal workers from the
three countries.

An agreement is expected to be signed between the Cambodian authorities
and their Thai counterparts pertaining to the Cambodians who are now
working illegally in Thailand.

To expedite matters, the Royal Government of Cambodia will be setting up
an inter-ministerial committee to study the problem of the Cambodian
workers who are living and working illegally in Thailand.

Suy Sem, the Secretary of State for the Cambodian Ministry of Social
Welfare, Labour and Veterans said that it has been decided that once the
committee's study is completed, the agreement will be signed between the
Thai and Cambodian authorities to legalise the status of all the illegal
workers from each country working in the other.

The regulations will allow Cambodian workers to stay in Thailand for a
two-year period. Thai workers will also be allowed to be employed in
Cambodia for a similar length of time.

After the two years is up, the workers will be sent back to their own
countries.

However, those who wish to stay on in Thailand will have to go through
the correct procedures for obtaining a permit to remain legally in
Thailand.

Prasitt explained that in the case of Cambodian workers who want to
remain in Thailand after the two-year period is up, both governments are
in the process of drawing up further regulations so that these workers
can continue working in Thailand in accordance with Thai law.

These conditions will require all the Cambodian workers in Thailand to
register with the Ministry of Social Welfare within a 90-day period from
Sept 1, 1996.

The Thai authorities will issue "living permission cards" and working
cards to these individuals. The workers will also be required to pay 500
bahts to the Thai Ministry of Social Welfare, 1,000 bahts a year for the
working permission card and another 1,000 bahts as "guarantee fee" which
is refundable after the two years is up.

Prasitt added that most of the illegal immigrants in Thailand were from
Myanmar, numbering about 400,000. There are 10,000 from Laos and about
200,000 from India, China and Sri Lanka.

On the other hand, there are about 1,000 Thai workers in Cambodia, of
which only 189 have registered with Cambodia's Department of Labour.

Suy Sem said however that all foreign workers who come to Cambodia have
to register with the kingdom's Ministry of Social Welfare. This, of
course, includes the illegal Thai workers in Cambodia.

Suy Sem explained that there are many legal and illegal workers in the
kingdom, most seeking employment with foreign companies, while there are
others who only stay for short periods while waiting for jobs in third
countries.

The Thai government has said that over 30,000 Cambodian workers have
entered Thailand without the necessary travel documents and are thus
illegally employed.

Of the total number of illegal workers, about 3,000 are in the
construction sector, while 2,000 are involved in the agricultural sector.

According to the Thai authorities, most of the illegal workers are
employed in the ports or as construction workers, especially in Bangkok
and Pra Chun Bory province.

Jobs are more easily available in these areas and the workers can earn
at least 160 bahts a day.

Thai government officials claim that the actual number of illegal
Cambodian workers could very well be far more than the statistics show.
The problem of the illegal workers was discussed last month by Suy Sem
and Prasitt.

According to Prasitt, Thai law now provides for the immediate deportation
of illegal workers, whether or not the Cambodian government is aware of
the situation.

Suy Sem, meanwhile, said he will brief the Royal Government on the
matter.

He added that he personally cannot accept that there are over 30,000
illegal Cambodian immigrants living in Thailand.

He explained that in any event, his ministry alone cannot deal with the
issue and needs the inter-ministerial committee to decide whether or not
the so-called Cambodian illegal workers are indeed Khmer.

Cambodia: US may help rebuild highway

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

The United States has expressed interest in helping rebuild a national
highway to Pailin, an important trading town that until about a month ago
was a stronghold of Khmer Rouge guerrillas and off-limits to most
Cambodians.

"The US ambassador told Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen that his
government would like to help repair the road to develop the area," said
Om Yu Tiang, an adviser to the co-premier.

The 85km stretch links Pailin and the north-western provincial capital
of Battambang. Pailin is under the control of the Khmer Rouge dissidents
who broke away from hard-liners loyal to Pol Pot in August and are
negotiating peace with the government.

Cambodia: Abortions a major cause of death

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Ros Sokhet

Complications arising from abortions, both legal and illegal, have become
one of the major causes of death among Cambodian women.

While statistics from the Ministry of Health show that about 2,000 women
die every year from abortion related problems, studies by the Family
Planning International Assistance (FPIA) claim that the number is more
like 200,000.

According to the FPIA study, a large number of abortions are conducted
under deplorable conditions and underscores the desperate circumstances
pregnant women are faced with such as the lack of efficient and reliable
family planning services.

Abortion, being illegal in Cambodia (with a few exceptions), has created
legal obstacles for women who want to terminate pregnancies. Thus, in
desperation, women are forced to resort to the services of the untrained
and unskilled, often with fatal results, the FPIA study said.

Kien Sereyphal of the Cambodian Women's Development Association (CWDA),
explained the local problem.

"The abortions are often performed by trained birth attendants, in
ill-equipped homes. When complications arise, these attendants do not
have sufficient expertise or training to salvage the situation and save
the mother," she said.

The solution to the problem, according to the study, lies in family
planning.

"No law, no religion has proven to be effective when it comes to
decreasing the number of abortions. Only increased access to reliable
family planning services, combined with high quality information can do
this," the FPIA revealed.

Successful planning programmes take time to be formulated and then
implemented and could not emerge within a matter of months. Accordingly,
for the programme to be truly effective, the attitude of parents towards
children - the number they intend to have and the age gap between each
child - and the opportunities they may have later in life, must all be
examined. "This all begins at birth," the study pointed out.

The FPIA study also revealed that the problem is not restricted to
Cambodia.

An estimated 25 million abortions are performed each year in developing
countries, most under unsafe conditions.

Among married women, who do not want to get pregnant, at least 100
million face an unmet need for contraception. Most of these women live
in the third world.

Every year, about 500,000 women die from pregnancy related causes.

"This means that every minute of the day a women dies as a result of her
pregnancy or in childbirth," Paul Hamilton, a country representative of
the FPIA, said.

Other students, who were not given bicycles, received cash amounting to
100,000 riels each from the king and queen.

King Sihanouk advised the students to study hard in the new school year,
not just for their own good, but also for the future good of the nation.

The bicycles were donated by the Japanese government.

Cambodia: 'leng Sary had no power'

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan, once believed to be the second and third
most powerful men in the Khmer Rouge, were, in fact, powerless.

Every ministry and institution of the Democratic Kampuchea government was
under the control of Pol Pot, the shadowy leader of the Khmer Rouge, said
Nhem Ein, the former information officer of the Maoist group.

The only other people allowed to make decisions and implement them were
Noun Chea, who was the president of the National Assembly, and Son Sen,
the deputy prime minister and defence minister.

Nhem Ein said Ieng Sary, who was the foreign minister, had no authority
to decide on anything. He described the activities in the ministry at
that time as "sluggish".

He said Khieu Samphan, who was the head of state, was also a powerless
man.

"Many Cambodians liked him (Khieu Samphan) but they did not like Pol
Pot's way of ruling the country," he said.

"However, he had no power so he had to follow Pol Pot," Nhem Ein added.

Cambodia: No more lessons on genocide

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Ros Sokhet

The break-up of the Khmer Rouge promises to change the political scenario
in Cambodia. The break-up of the Khmer Rouge has also changed what
children learn in school.

For a start, there will no longer be any references to the genocidal
regime of the Maoist group.

All illustrations and text of Khmer Rouge atrocities have been removed
from the textbooks for pupils in the first, sixth and seventh grades.

In addition, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports has instructed
teachers to discontinue lessons on the subject in all other grades even
though such references have yet to be expunged from the textbooks.

In place of this subject, pupils will be given instructions on the
environment, human rights and moral instructions.

Stories of the genocide carried out by the Khmer Rouge regime, led by Pol
Pot, Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan, were contained in the textbooks
published by the State of Cambodia government, which ousted the maoist
regime in 1979.

These textbooks contained criticisms of the Khmer Rouge's reign of terror
and pupils studied the atrocities committed by the Pol Potists. In the
textbooks, Pol Pot, Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan were also portrayed as
traitors of the country.

The vice-director of the research institute of the education ministry,
Ly Somony, said one of the subjects, Social Studies, carried lessons on
the Khmer Rouge's atrocities. It explained how the Khmer Rouge tortured
and starved Cambodians during their rule of the country from 1975 to
1979.

Under the Cambodian education system, there are six grades - 1 to 6 - in
the primary school level. At the secondary school level are Grades 7 to
9 and the high school level are Grades 10 to 12.

Ly Somony said textbooks to be given to pupils in Grades 1, 6 and 7 will
no longer contain anything on the Khmer Rouge. The new school year
started last month, but the pupils are only expected to get their books
this month.

"The word `genocide' will no longer be seen in the newly published
textbooks," he said.

However, the move to remove all references to the Khmer Rouge in school
textbooks has also drawn some criticisms.

Ly Somony said he had been approached by several intellectuals who held
the view that subjects on the genocide should remain in the school
syllabus.

He said the intellectuals, some of whom were also from the ministry, had
reminded him that many Cambodians were killed and the country was ruined
during Pol Pot's reign and that "we should not forget the horrible
regime".

He said his institute had conveyed the message to the minister but there
has yet to be any response. "We are only the writers of the books, and
we always abide by the government's policy," he said.

The minister, Tol Lah, could not be reached for comment as he is out of
the country, but a ministry official said the government was not likely
to go back on its decision to discontinue lessons on the Khmer Rouge.

"The Royal Government is carrying out a policy of national reconciliation
and thus would like to see that such subjects on Khmer Rouge atrocities
be removed from the education syllabus," the official said.

Meanwhile, the deputy director of the ministry's publishing house, Koeu
Nay Leang, said the new books for the three grades would be printed by
the third week of this month.

He said a total of 1.28 million books in eight subjects would be printed
for pupils in the first grade. In addition, there are 410,000 books in
five subjects for pupils of Grade 6 and 210,000 books in 12 subjects for
those in Grade 7.

All books are given free of charge to the pupils.

Ly Somony said that next year, the ministry would publish new books for
pupils in the second and eighth grades while those in the fourth and 10th
grades would get new books in 1999.

In the year 2000, new books will be published for pupils in Grades 5 and
11 and in 2001, a new edition of the books will be published for pupils
in Grade 6 while pupils in Grade 12 will also be given new books without
the subject on the Khmer Rouge.

Cambodia: Charting the nation's course

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Mehran Chinniah

It is not easy locating the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace
(CICP).

Squeezed between the rows of pre-fabricated cabins at the Government
Palace at Wat Phnom, the office is a legacy of the United Nations
Transitional Authority in Cambodia - a memorial to the Third World.

You have to manoeuvre past numerous potholes and puddles of water before
arriving at the CICP workplace where the wooden pathway creaks with each
step.

Founded in June 1994, the CICP's objectives are to help the government
in its public policy and nurture regional and international cooperation.

The institute thrives on cutting corners: it operates with a skeletal
staff of four. Materials that need to be photocopied have first to be
verified and personal phone calls are limited to two three-minute
conversations per day.

"If you have to talk to your girlfriend or boyfriend, don't do it on
company time," reads a terse memo on the wall.

The CICP's frugality is as a good a metaphor as any for CICP's place in
Cambodia's lengthy list of non-governmental organisations. It is a small
think tank that has grown in a manner more spectacular than most would
have imagined.CICP executive director Kao Kim Hourn has a decidedly
simple explanation for all this.

Sitting at his cluttered desk, dressed in his trademark white,
short-sleeved shirt and tie, he says: "We are small because small
sometimes means beautiful. We are small so we can work effectively and
move faster."

It is no mere puff. In the short two years since CICP was established,
it has organised five major conferences and seminars in Cambodia,
produced more than 10 papers and journals and has presented more than 20
working papers in conferences throughout the region.

In Kao's words, the research papers, seminars and conferences "will help
us to re-think what we have been thinking". "That's what we have been
doing. Whether it is conferences, seminars, workshops or lectures, we
provide a forum for consultation and dialogue for policy makers and
academics on one hand, and students and the younger generation, on the
other, to bridge the gap," he said.

The research, Kao said, is not for research's sake. "The research we do
is to give some new ideas and perspectives to our public policy. It is
the future that we are worried about."Its recent publication - the
Cambodian Journal of International Affairs - is the first publication of
its kind by any non-governmental organisation in the kingdom.

But the feather in its cap is, by far, CICP's appointment as the seventh
member of Asean-ISIS (Institute of Strategic and International Studies),
a prestigious group of policy-oriented think tanks.

The other six are ISIS Malaysia, ISIS Thailand, the Singapore Institute
of International Affairs, the Institute of Strategic and Developmental
Studies Indonesia and Institute of International Relations Vietnam.

The CICP will be Cambodia's official representative in the South-East
Asian economic grouping in March next year.

It is, fellow NGOs concur, a fitting testimony to CICP's efforts in
Cambodia's foreign policy in the international arena.

Says Kao: "It means that we are part of an important regional process.
We will be able to assist the government better in terms of ideas and
vision."

Clearly, the future lies with Asean, as far as the CICP is concerned. The
world is working towards regionalism and Cambodia has to be part of the
group to develop quickly, Kao said.

Although Cambodia will become a full member of the regional grouping in
July 1997, the CICP's work is far from finished.

"CICP's work is now at the next level. We have to reach out to more
people in our meetings, seminars and conferences. We have to look beyond
Asean, to our relations with the United Nations, with the European Union,
Apec and WTO.

"The role of forward looking diplomacy is vital if Cambodia wants to
protect its interests. We cannot be left out. We have to be part of a
region that is changing and developing quickly," Kao said.

Cambodia: CICP mission statement

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

The Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace, founded in 1994, is
a non-profit, non-partisan, and non-governmental policy-oriented
institute.

It is dedicated to cultivating greater understanding of national,
regional and international issues that are of concern to
Cambodia.Cambodia is re-entering the world community at a time of
unprecedented opportunity and complexity.

The institute believes that internal and external stability are necessary
for the future peace and prosperity of Cambodia. Thus, there is an acute
need to comprehend domestic issues in isolation as well as in relation
to regional and international conditions.

To fill this need, CICP fosters both a domestic and a South-East Asian
constructive dialogue among government officials, international
organisations, scholars and the private sector on issues of security,
foreign policy, conflict resolution, economics and national development.

Cambodia: Destruction of mines on record

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

A British photographer Tim Page, has started documenting the destruction
of Cambodia's mine fields to help highlight the situation at the
international conference on mines.

Four of Page's images will be carried on the Internet home page of the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

This will coincide with the up-coming Canadian government-sponsored mine
conference.

The Ottawa conference Towards a Global Ban on Anti-Personnel Landmines
will gather representatives from the 43 countries that have supported a
global ban on the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of
anti-personnel landmines.

"This is the first time the Red Cross has gone public on an issue, a
spokesman of the ICRC, Gordon Bates said.

He added that the impetus came from ICRC medical teams weary of
contending with the grisly damage done by mines.

"It was a mutiny from our own surgeons who told us that we could not go
forward unless we took some kind of ethical stance," Bates said.

For Page, who was a war-time photographer injured by a mine in Vietnam
in 1969, the campaign has a personal significance.

"When I come back here, I am terrified," he told the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Cambodia.

"To take pictures of people with their limbs blown away, everyday it gets
more difficult," Page added.

Cambodia had drafted a law banning the use and purchase of anti-personnel
landmines, but the legislation is not expected to be passed soon.

There are an estimated four to six million landmines in Cambodia, making
it one of the most heavily mined countries in the world.

Cambodia in nuke ban treaty

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Cambodia became a signatory to the comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT)
in New York on Sept 26 1996, when Minister of Foreign Affairs and
International Relations Ung Huot signed on behalf of the kingdom.

Cambodia's position on the question of nuclear weapons has always been
that complete prohibition of nuclear weapons and the destruction of
existing ones is crucial to world peace, a press release from Cambodia's
permanent mission to the United Nations said.

Cambodia was one of the sponsors of the resolution that was presented by
Australia on Sept 10 to the United Nations.

Cambodia: It's only natural

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Leak Ratna

There are no additives or chemicals. It is cheap and it is easily
available. It is the Cambodian roll-up, a non-filtered, 100 per cent
tobacco cigarette and it can be found just about anywhere in the capital
city of Phnom Penh, wherever a roadside vendor seats herself.

Last week, Lifetimes went looking for these cigarettes and found that
most of the vendors are women.

These women deal with the tobacco suppliers, they buy the paper, they
prepare the flour-based paste to stick the cigarette paper together, they
spread the tobacco on the paper and roll them up into foot-long
cigarettes and then cut them into pieces of four or five, and then they
sell them.

These women always look very busy. Several of them can be seen sitting
at their makeshift stalls under the trees on the corner of Samdech
Monireth Boulevard and Jawaharlal Nehru Boulevard, near the Olympic
Stadium, and they will be rolling the cigarettes.

One of these vendors is 53-year-old Sok Ouy who has been selling the
roll-ups for six years already. Everyday, for 15 hours a day, from 6am
to 9pm, she sits under the tree selling the hand-rolled cigarettes.

Her fingers may seem gnarled, but they are nimble. She call roll 500
cigarettes in an hour. At 100 riels for five cigarettes, that means
50,000 riels worth of cigarettes.

Sok Ouy sells anything between 500 and 2,000 cigarettes per day. After
deducting her costs, she makes between 3,000 and 15,000 riels. In a week,
she can sell about 50kg worth of tobacco.

Contrary to popular belief, smokers of the Cambodian roll-ups come from
all walks of life.

"It is not true that only the poor people smoke these cigarettes. I also
have some very wealthy customers," Sok Ouy said.

"They say the cigarette has a distinctive flavour, is strong and smooth.
They can get full satisfaction with just a few puffs," she added.

Although she has never had someone instruct her on rolling cigarettes,
with regular practice over the years, Sok Ouy has made it into an art
form.

"I watched and I learnt. The old hands were always there doing it and
after having seen it done a few times, I did it too," she said
matter-of-fact.

Despite the fact that she only has a makeshift stall at the roadside, Sok
Ouy also has to worry about overheads.

To keep her spot on the roadside, she has to pay a daily "rental" of
1,000 riels to the owner of the house in front of which her stall is
located. She also has to pay 100 per day to the contractor who keeps the
streets clean and a weekly tax of 500 riels to the local authorities.

The tobacco is delivered to Sok Ouy by the supplier. She buys in bulk -
500kg of tobacco at a time, at 6,000 riels per kilogramme.

The paper can be bought from the markets, already cut into the correct
size, at 5,000 riels per 10,000 pieces of paper.

The cooked flour costs 600 riels per 500g. The flour is boiled until it
becomes thick like a porridge. This gluey concoction is then used to
stick the cigarette paper together. The "rolling instrument" cost about
15,000 riels.

Selling cigarettes has proven to be more lucrative for Sok Ouy. Before
she embarked on this venture, she used to sell banana fritters.

"It was too difficult selling banana fritters. I had to do everything by
myself," she complained.

However, its does not seem very much easier selling the roll-up
cigarettes. During the 15 hours at work, Sok Ouy is bent over rolling
cigarettes.

In addition, she has to see that her tobacco supplier is paid every week.
The amount of money she pays the supplier, of course, depends on the
amount she earns each week. She only takes delivery of her next
consignment of 500kg of tobacco when she pays in full.

These days, however, life is a little easier for Sok Ouy. She now has two
assistants to help her roll up the cigarettes.

"I have found that I cannot do this for long anymore. Bending up and down
while rolling the cigarettes has given me a backache and a pain in the
wrist," she said.

She pays her two workers a salary of 30,000 riels per month. In addition,
they are provided meals. The work in Sok Ouy's house, located not far
away from her stall. Her husband also helps.

"I need to work hard for the sake of my family. I have four children -
three boys and a girl. My eldest, aged 26, is a policeman but his salary
is very low. My other children are not working," she said.

Her youngest child is already 18 years old. Her three younger children
are still living with her.

Another one of these women entrepreneurs is Phim Sokoun, 46, who comes
from Kompong Cham province.

Phim Sokoun is still new to the trade as she took over the business from
her daughter who retired after her marriage six months ago.

She buys about 50kg of tobacco a time. Everyday she rolls cigarettes from
7am to 2.30pm. Phim Sokoun, still relatively inexperienced, can roll only
about 100 cigarettes per day.

She is further hampered by the fact that her cigarette roller has the
capacity for only one cigarette at a time. She earns between 2,000 and
10,000 riels a day.

"The best type of tobacco comes from Kompong Cham province," she said.

Phim Sokoun lives with her daughter in Steng Meanchey district, Phnom
Penh. She has nine children, five of whom live in Phnom Penh while the
other four live in Kompong Cham with her husband. The oldest is 28 and
the youngest is 10.

Phim Sokoun seems to accept her lot in life. "I do not have the kind of
money to venture into the world of big business. That is why I chose to
be in this business. It is more profitable than selling sweets in Kompong
Cham," she said, smiling.

Cambodia: No let-up on illegal logging: Govt officials and military
personnel also involved, says minister

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Reaksmey Kongkea

In addition to waging a guerrilla war against the Royal Government in the
past three years, the Khmer Rouge was also causing a major environmental
problem - the depletion of the kingdom's forest cover.

However, the mass defection and rebellion of the guerrilla fighters
against the Maoist group's hard-line leadership has not eased the
pressure on Cambodia's natural heritage.

Areas formerly under Khmer Rouge control are still losing their forests
through illegal logging and the culprits now are local government
officials and military personnel, according to officials in the Ministry
of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

These provincial officials and military officers are, in fact, conspiring
with foreign traders and loggers to exploit the Cambodian forests for
profits, the minister Tao Seng Hour told the Cambodia Times.

These illegal activities are rampant in the north-western provinces of
Preah Vihear, Kompong Thom and Koh Kong and as a result, vast areas of
forests have been destroyed, the deputy director of the Provincial
Forestry and Fisheries Department, Kim Samol said.

He said the illegal loggers, who used to work with the Khmer Rouge,
continued to fell trees and transporting the logs across the borders to
Thailand and Laos.

These areas, he said, were formerly under the Khmer Rouge, but came under
the Royal Government's control near the end of last year.

Kim Samol said that in some cases, soldiers of the Royal Cambodian Armed
Forces (RCAF) were cutting down the trees and transporting the logs to
foreign timber traders.

"Thousands of dollars are collected each day from the sale of the logs
and the money goes into the pockets of corrupt government officials, he
said.

A foreign forestry expert in the ministry alleged that the illegal
loggers were, in fact, RCAF soldiers who were conspiring with provincial
officials to cut down new trees and transporting the logs across the
border.

"Their actions are illegal and causing the destruction of the forests.
It is also against the decision of the government not to export anymore
new logs," the expert, who declined to be named, added.

(Earlier this year, the government had stated that it would not allow
anymore exports of logs once the existing stock of one million cubic
metres have been sold. Eight Thai companies have been given permits to
export the logs, which had been cut earlier but not exported yet.)

He said the areas which had been badly affected by the illegal logging
activities were forests in Kompong Thom and Koh Kong.

Sources in Preah Vihear province have alleged that each night, the logs
would be transported in four or five trucks to the border where they were
loaded into waiting boats to be sent to Thailand.

The sources added that hundreds of hectares of forests have been
destroyed as a result of the illegal logging operations.

A report from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries shows
that about 30 logging concessions, covering a total area of 6.4 million
hectares, have been given out by the government.

The foreign forestry expert estimated that this was roughly equivalent
to the kingdom's remaining forest cover.

All sides in the Cambodian civil conflict have, in the past, sold timber
to help fund their military operations.

The Khmer Rouge reportedly earned millions of dollars every month, part
of which they used to buy arms, from selling logging and gems mining
concessions in areas under their control to Thai companies.

However, the forestry expert blamed the Khmer Rouge for most of the
country's deforestation, especially around Pailin where their
headquarters is located.

"The Khmer Rouge are the main factors in the destruction of the forests
around Pailin. They also cooperate with foreigners to exploit gemstones
and these activities cause environmental deterioration," he said.

However, the expert admitted that the ill-disciplined elements in the
government forces were also responsible for the illegal logging
operations. He alleged that sometimes they also deal with the Khmer
Rouge.

Tao Seng Hour said the Thai and Cambodian governments had agreed to
cooperate in efforts to stamp out the illegal export of timber to
Thailand.

He said his ministry was taking action to stop the illegal logging
operations by local officials and military personnel. He said action
would also be taken to stop the export of logs and sawn timber from Preah
Vihear, Kompong Thom and Koh Kong provinces.

However, he did not outline the measures that the ministry was taking.

"If we find proof that local officials are involved in these illegal
activities and conspiring with foreign traders, we have to fine them and
put them in jail," Tao Seng Hour added.

Funcinpec wants Sirivudh to return to Cambodia

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Chheang Sopheng

The announcement by the co-premiers that the former Khmer Rouge number
two man Ieng Sary will be pardoned has renewed calls for the return of
Prince Norodom Sirivudh.

The steering committee of the Funcinpec party has urged its president,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, to invite his half-uncle to return to Cambodia.

Prince Sirivudh, a former secretary-general of the party, was exiled to
France after being accused of involvement in a plot to assassinate Second
Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen in December last year.

The Phnom Penh Municipal Court tried Prince Sirivudh, a half-brother of
King Norodom Sihanouk, in absentia. He was found guilty and sentenced to
10 years in prison.

At a two-day meeting of the party's national council, the Funcinpec
steering committee urged Prince Ranariddh, who is the First Prime
Minister, to write a letter to Prince Sirivudh to invite him back to the
kingdom.

Committee member Lu Lay Sreng also proposed that the exiled prince be
allowed to rejoin the party's steering committee.

He also expressed hope that King Sihanouk would grant an amnesty to the
prince considering that Ieng Sary, who had been found guilty and
sentenced to death on charges of killing people during the four-year
genocidal regime, would also be pardoned.

"Compared to Ieng Sary, Prince Sirivudh's case is less serious. If we
want national reconciliation, the prince should be granted amnesty," Lu
Lay Sreng said.

He said that although the National Assembly had stripped Prince Sirivudh
of his immunity, he was officially still a member of the house and
remained a very important person to the Funcinpec.

He said that in a letter to the prince recently, the party had urged him
to write to the king to ask for amnesty.

Prince Ranariddh said it was now up to the prince to request for a pardon
from the king.

"If there is a request from Prince Sirivudh in his own handwriting, I
believe the king will pardon him. The Funcinpec will support him," he
told reporters at the Funcinpec headquarters in Phnom Penh after the
meeting last week.

To questions from newsmen, he said the decision to pardon Ieng Sary would
ensure that his half-uncle would also be granted amnesty.

"Whether Hun Sen agrees or not, it is up to him, but I will support
Prince Sirivudh and it is my understanding that King Sihanouk will also
agree to the pardon," he added.

"A pardon for Prince Sirivudh will be justice for him and for the
Funcinpec party. If Ieng Sary can be pardoned, why not Prince Sirivudh,
who has not even killed anyone?" Prince Ranariddh asked.

He said the prince could resume his duties as member of parliament and
rejoin the Funcinpec steering committee, but he would not be reappointed
party secretary-general.

"We have already appointed Loy Sim Chheang to the post," he added.

At the meeting, the members also unanimously approved the appointment of
an additional 13 members to the steering committee, bringing the total
membership now to 33. The move is to strengthen the party for the next
general elections in 1998.

The new members are Princess Marie Ranariddh, Hong Sun Huoth, Tao Seng
Hour, Chum Chheang, Man Bunthon, Chea Rithy Chhuth, Keang Vang, Ho Sok,
Ek Serywath, Kheat Vandy, Khan Saveourn, Ly Seng Hong and Sum Nipha.

First deputy secretary-general Chhim Seak Leng said the party needed more
active officials to carry out its activities and to prepare for the
elections.

He said the decision to enlarge the steering committee was made to
overcome the problem of the lack of quorum when meetings had to be held
to discuss important internal issues.

The party also adopted several resolutions. They are:

- to adopt a political platform outlining the principles and guidelines
in the implementation of political, economic, social and cultural
programmes;

- to nominate Prince Ranariddh to continue his "noble mission" as premier
of the government for a second term after the general elections of 1998;

- to determine that the general elections will take place in 1998 as
stipulated in the constitution;

- to appeal to all international organisations, in particular the United
Nation, and all friendly countries to send personnel to observe the
preparation and conduct of the elections, the counting of ballots and to
provide the necessary technical assistance, and

- to appeal to all Cambodian political parties to appoint and make known
to the public their candidate for the post of premier.

Cambodia: Protest against release

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Kong Vara

PHNOM PENH: The request made by King Norodom Sihanouk for the release of
prisoners has came under protest from University and Faculty students.

The protest is in the form of a petition dated 23 October and addressed
to the King, a copy of which was made available to Cambodia Today.

"Recently, we heard and read your message on the request made to the
Justice Ministry for a list of prisoners to be released.

"The message has aroused our concern over security and safety of people
in the whole society of Cambodia," stated the two-page petition signed
by 8 students, representing eight institutions of higher learning here.

"The amnesty could lead to the increase of robbery, terrorism, murder and
other offenses, for perpetrators would assume that after their
prosecution, there will be a pardon granted by the King," continued the
petition.

On 19 October, King Sihanouk sent a letter to Justice Minister Chem
Snguon to request the draft of a Royal Decree to render amnesty to those
who are being imprisoned across the Kingdom.

However, the third paragraph of the letter, bore inflexible contents on
the nature of the criminals to be freed.

"Concerning criminals that could not be freed from imprisonment, for they
might pose enormous danger to the national and international societies
please, Your Excellency, request the two Prime Ministers for the names
of these criminals," the King said.

In an unrelated issue, the students are also opposing the granting of an
amnesty to Prince Norodom Sirivuddh.

"We have read and heard about this.

"If the request is true, we would like to state that he should not be
pardoned," the petition stressed.

However, several politicians share the opinion that amnesty should be
granted to Prince Sirivuddh given the fact that Ieng Sary, the former
Brother Number 2 of Pol Pot's regime has been granted amnesty.

"If the King wants to pardon Prince Sirivuddh, no one can object to this
as we are all committed to follow His Majesty's advise," said MP Kem
Sokha, from Son San's BLDP faction,when speaking to Cambodia Today.

"Between Ieng Sary and Prince Sirivuddh, who has carried out more
destruction to the national interest and humanity?" the MP questioned.

Prince Sirivuddh was prosecuted by the Phnom Penh Court and sentenced to
10 years imprisonment in absentia on charges of illegal arms possession
in February this year. He was sent into exile in a deal arranged by King
Sihanouk.

Cambodia: UN celebrates 51st Anniversary

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

The 51st anniversary of the United Nations Day was held yesterday at the
Council for Development of Cambodia (CDC).

The celebration was attended by Benny Widyono, Representative of the UN
Secretary General, and representatives of UNDP, UNFPA, UNESCO, UNICEF,
WHO, UNHCR, ILO, FAO and WFP.

The documents of the great achievements recorded in the past 50 years by
the United Nations were also handed out to visitors on the occasion.

The UN Secretary General in his speech read here said that the United
Nations remains as the place to solve problems beyond reach of any single
state.

He commented that the United Nations must continue to build on its
success and must not be deterred by setbacks. The UN have to fulfill its
tasks of reform and rationalization to strengthen an improve
international cooperation.

He added that the UN will help all people, men, women and children in
bringing about peace, development and democracy.

The United Nations was established on 24th October 1945 with only 51
member states. Now, the UN have 185 members. The key role of the United
Nations is to bring peace through reconciliation and peace keeping
mission as well as fighting against violence through upgrading the human
rights, providing shelters and humanitarian aid to war victims, said the
press release.

The release further said most governments in the world recognized that
economic and social development is the key factor to consolidate peace.

Since its establishment, the world body has been concentrating on the
development of economy of the developing countries.

In Cambodia, the United Nations have an important role in national
reconciliation and peace consolidation.

The United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) is a
historic mission in Cambodia in organising the general election leading
to the setting up of a democratic government. After the end of UNTAC's
mandate on 24th September 1993, the UN has been cooperating with the
Royal Government of Cambodia in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of
the country.

In 1996, the United Nation pledged to provide US$54 million to Cambodia
for continuing its national reconstruction efforts.

The UN also donated US$1 million in an aid package, comprising financial
and material assistance to the flood victims in Cambodia recently.

Cambodia: Marubeni urged to construct industrial zone

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Sok Pov

PHNOM PENH: The Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy has called on the
giant Japanese company, Marubeni Corporation to consider the development
of the country's first industrial zone in Sihanoukville.

Minister Pou Sothirak, when speaking to a 24 member Japanese delegation
said that there was an urgent need for such a zone but to date, no
corporation or organisation has come forward with concrete plans for the
development of such a zone.

"Marubeni could seriously consider this. Previously, Thai based Ban Chang
Group had carried out a feasibility study on the proposed industrial
zone.

"However, they have yet to confirm whether they are going to go ahead
with the project or otherwise," Sothirak said.

He said that there were ample opportunities for Japanese corporations to
develop Cambodia's agro-based and fisheries sector.

"There is ample arable land for agricultural development and since Japan
is a huge importer of food products, it could use Cambodia as a supply
base."

He added that current laws enabled foreign investors to lease land for
periods up to 70 years. He also pointed out that there were large
quantities of logs which have been left abandoned since the Royal
Government ban on log exports.

"Japanese corporations could consider the establishment of furniture or
other wood-based factories to take advantage of the availability of
timber," Sothirak stressed.

As for urging Japanese assistance in power generation, the Minister of
Energy said that though there was insufficient power supply at present,
the situation is expected to improve in the coming year, facilitated to
a large extend by a US$70 million ADB loan.

The head of the delegation, Marubeni's Masaru Mizuno said that the
Minister's proposals and comments would be discussed both at the
corporate level as well as the Government level.

"We will attempt to persuade our Government to support the carrying out
of a feasibility study on the proposed Sihanoukville Industrial Zone,"
Mizuno said.

Cambodia: Request for return of 1993 ballot papers

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

PHNOM PENH: The United Nations Representative here, Benny Widyono said
yesterday that a request for the return of the 1993 ballot papers to
Cambodia has been conveyed to New York.

Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen made the request officially last
Tuesday during the Symposium on the Paris Peace Accord.

"I am awaiting the reply from the United Nations Headquarters in New York
and I do not know what or when the reply will be," he said.

Widyono added that he was unsure as to what happened in the capital
during the last elections as he was based in Siem Reap.

He clarified during a press conference to mark the 51st Anniversary of
the United Nations that the presence of two Prime Ministers was not a
system proposed by UNTAC, the UN authority here at that time.

"That is through the wisdom of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varman
who wanted to see peace and unity return to the Kingdom of Cambodia," he
stressed.

Om Yin Tieng, an advisor to the Second Prime Minister, Samdech Hun Sen
said that the return of the ballot papers were necessary as accusations
of violence, intimidations and deaths have been made.

"The papers are necessary to verify the facts as some of the electoral
results are probably questionable," he said.

First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh said earlier in the week
that the system of two Prime Ministers should be abolished to facilitate
efficient governance.

This view is also believed to be shared by Second Prime Minister Samdech
Hun Sen.

Though elections to elect a new government is only scheduled in 1998, the
two main political parties, FUNCINPEC and CPP have been involved in
serious campaigning through work-shops, meetings and public appearance
in many forms.

The commune elections scheduled for 1997 is widely expected to be used
as a yardstick to predict the results of the 1998 general elections.

Cambodia: Nobody can move our people, says Y Chhien

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Sok Pov

PAILIN: The Vice chairman of the Democratic National Union Movement
(DNUM), in charge of military affairs, Y Chhien said that Second Prime
Minister Samdech Hun Sen's assurance on the status of the people here
showed that "nobody" could move the people to other areas.

"Nobody can move them to other camps and nobody can seize our people's
territory which is their own property," Y Chhien, the commander of break-
away Khmer Rouge Division 415 said during the visit of Hun Sen to Pailin.

He added that the people residing in Pailin, Phnom Malai, Samlot, Koh
Kong and Sisophon had to clear the land and these had caused numerous
injuries which later resulted in disablement.

"Numerous others had died because of mines and exposure to killer
diseases such as Malaria and furthermore, the people in these territories
had to sacrifice their lives to preserve their territory during the war,"
he pointed out.

Y Chhien added that given these facts, the Royal Government would surely
protect the people's land and crops, especially since the people had
agreed to abide by the National Constitution promulgated in 1993.

"The ceasefire between the DNUM and the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces
(RCAF) has been in place for two months and the people are delighted as
they no longer have to fear the roar of weapons and gunfire.

"I am sure that our people here and the RCAF are both happy as there is
no more war and killing and Khmers do not have to kill Khmers anymore.

"There is no happiness greater than this one," Y Chhien stressed.

He added that the DNUM and the people here would strive to consolidate
the two month cease-fire to enable it to evolve into a permanent peace
with no losers or victors as Khmer people would be living in harmony.

"In this, we must recognize that the tasks in bringing about national
reconciliation, national unity and putting and end to the war is still
a heavy task.

"Though all our people desire peace, it is unfortunate that the country
has been destroyed to a large extent because of the many years of war and
this has brought to a standstill, development," he said.

Y Chhien added that though there were various ways of ending the war, he
nevertheless was confident of the final result as well as the progress
attained thus far.

He pointed out that these efforts could only push the country forward and
that the momentum will be maintained with no turning back.

"The decisive factor is the will of the whole Khmer nation to stop
spilling the blood of Khmers," he said.

Second Prime Minister Hun Sen said that there was no question of people
living here and elsewhere being moved from their homes and their land.

"Our policy of national reconciliation has drawn many critics, both
locally and abroad.

"However, what is important is for Khmers to resolve their problems among
themselves," Hun Sen said.

He added that politicians should not be branding their fellow Khmers as
puppets of Vietnam, China, Australia, USA and so forth.

"This is an act in futility as it benefits no one and will only fuel
unnecessary hatred among Khmers," Samdech Hun Sen said.

He also added that there may be conflicting views on how to resolve the
problem but what mattered most,was the end result, in this case, the end
of hostilities between Khmers.

"The people in Anlong Veng will be liberated. The hard-liners would have
no where to go and they could not hide for ever as the winds of change
are now blowing through Cambodia," the Second Prime Minister said adding
that the people in the country had suffered enough because of war and
that they were tired of the prolonged suffering.

A member of the break-away family, Mrs Chan Thorn said that she was
delighted that peace is finally settling in Pailin and that family life
could return to normal.

She said that the family has been separated for long as her husband had
to defend their home and the children were fearful of going to school as
war could have broken out at any time.

"I am looking forward to travelling outside Pailin and I hope National
Road 10 would be cleared of mines soon to enable this," Mrs Thorn said.

Her comments were shared by many of the people who had converged on the
area to witness the arrival of the Second Prime Minister and the historic
exchange of greetings between the Second Prime Minister and DNUM leader,
Ieng Sary.

"The once bitter enemies have decided to forgive in the larger interests
of the Cambodian people," a senior RCAF general said, adding that this
was a gift to the country.

Cambodia: 40 RCAF lives for a month's leave

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Sok Pov

PAILIN: Each Khmer Rouge soldier must kill as many Royal Cambodian Armed
Forces (RCAF) men as possible to be entitled to lengthy periods of rest
and leave.

"In the event a Khmer Rouge soldier could kill as much as 40 RCAF men a
month, the successful Khmer Rouge soldier is granted one month's leave.

"Our orders are to kill at least one RCAF man a day. The more the merrier
as we can gain longer rest periods.

"If we failed to kill any RCAF men, we would be sent further and further
away to areas where there is a higher chance of fighting and hence
killing, "a Khmer Rouge soldier said.

Shying away from the camera and refusing to reveal his name or home
province, the former Khmer Rouge soldier, now a member of the break-away
faction of division 415 here told this reporter that he did not like
killing fellow Khmers but an order was an order.

"We were at war. We did not have a choice as we have been told repeatedly
that in war, all is fair.

"I had to do the same as I did not want to be separated from my family
or home as we had lost everything during the 1994 RCAF offensive when
they managed to occupy our land for a short spell," the Khmer Rouge
private said.

He again refused to divulge who gave the orders and what the other
penalty for not carrying out their tasks were.

He however said that when he managed to gain some free time, he would
spend it on the many mines in the area, panning for gems and other
precious stones or cultivating rice and other fruits which were all sold
to the Thais, if not consumed by the family or confiscated by the senior
officers.

"I am happy there is no more fighting. I am delighted to note that we do
not have to kill each other anymore and that I and my family can live a
normal life without fearing the "metal rain", diseases and other
threats," the private said.

Cambodia: Deputy Governor dismisses allegations

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Thet Sambath

PHNOM PENH: The First Deputy Governor of Battambang Province, Serey Kosal
has dismissed continuing allegations that he had misappropriated two
statues.

The reports first appeared in local papers about three months ago and
have continued intermittently since then.

"I refute these allegations as they are baseless, irresponsible and
defamatory. I challenge those who made the allegations to prove that I
had misappropriated the two small statues.

"The statues were handed over to the Governor, Ung Samy well before the
allegations started and I am wondering about the motive of those who are
making the allegations," Kosal told Cambodia Today at the Logistics
Department of the Ministry of Defence yesterday.

He said that he had no knowledge as to where Governor Samy was keeping
the statues as it has already been handed over to him and as such, was
not his (Kosal's ) responsibility anymore.

"It is an insult to my position and rank to face such cheap allegations
and I challenge these people to provide the proof," Kosal stressed.

Cambodia: Ties with Malaysia essential says First PM

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

PHNOM PENH: A Malaysian delegation led by Datuk Abdullah Haji Ahmad
Badawi, Minister of Foreign Affairs has been told that Cambodia's
relation with Malaysia was essential as it (Malaysia) had played a key
role in the country's economic development.

"Cambodia highly values the close cooperation and bilateral relationship
existing with Malaysia, especially the assistance granted during the
country's difficult times," said First Prime Minister Prince Norodom
Ranariddh.

He added that as far as the overall political and security situation in
the country is concerned, these had improved significantly as cries for
national reconciliation has increased while the cooperation between the
two prime ministers is also on a better footing.

Prince Ranariddh also urged Malaysia to consider providing scholarships
to Islamic Cambodians to study in Malaysia and added that similar
requests have been made to Indonesia and Brunei.

Datuk Abdullah Badawi said that he would consider the First Prime
Minister's request carefully as it was in line with Malaysia's
aspirations to help provide scholarship to Cambodian students.

"I am happy to see that Malaysian investors are continuing to come to
Cambodia and the facilitation of these investments augured well for the
country," he said.

Later, at a luncheon hosted by Club Malaysia Cambodia, Datuk Abdullah
Badawi said that he was impressed with the developments and progress made
since his last visit here several months ago.

"The Royal Government is moving in the right direction and we will try
and assist in whatever way we can as a peaceful and united Cambodia would

Samdech Hun Sen and was also granted an audience by His Majesty King
Norodom Sihanouk.

Cambodia: French tourist goes berserk

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Sok Pov

PHNOM PENH: Police officers confirmed that Rodriguez Garcia, a French
national had suffered a nervous break-down after being cheated by his
fellow countryman who took his money.

"The Frenchman went berserk last Wednesday, just after he had confronted
his friend over the missing money "said Sok Bunly who is chief of Sangkat
Wat Phnom Police.

Garcia, 38, had checked into a Guest House on Sisowat Quay of Sangkat Wat
Phnom last Sunday.

He was seen climbing onto the rooftop of a nearby house opposite Post
Office on the corner of Street 13 and 102.

"At about 5 o'clock in the morning, we heard footsteps on our roof and
we suspected that it was burglary attempt.

"As such, I fired few shots to scare away whoever was on my roof, "said
a resident when revealing the probable root cause of the incident to
Cambodia Today.

"After the shooting, the stranger hopped from one rooftop to another as
far as the roof of the building opposite the Post Office," added the
resident.

Garcia was seen tearing several pieces of US and French currency and
tossed the torn bills, together with the untorn ones onto the street
which was jammed with travellers and onlookers.

Cambodia Today witnessed the incident and saw many people including
children vying with one another to grab the cash.

Several minutes later, several French nationals, some of whom are
believed to be from the French Embassy here arrived at the scene with
police.

An ambulance was called in and a ladder was brought to the scene while
some other nationals climbed up the roof to persuade Garcia to come down.

After about four hours of persuasion and talks, a nervous Garcia decided
to climb down. He was wearing pants, bare-bodied and a pouch-belt hung
around his neck.

Nobody could confirm the amount of the money he threw away but several
US$ 10 and 20 bills and some French Francs were collected by onlookers.

"I did not know how much money was destroyed and how much was lost to the
onlookers," said Sok Bunly.

At press time no medical confirmation to substantiate the nervous
breakdown theory was made available.

The police official said that the case was clear cut.

"He was cheated of his money and he was depressed enough to lose control
of himself," he said while others suggested that the Frenchman was a
back-packer who was here to enjoy himself.

Cambodia: First nine months net US$72 million in exports

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

PHNOM PENH: The first nine months of this year, has seen Cambodia
exporting goods worth US$72.1 million through the Generalised System of
Preferences (GSP).

A Ministry of Commerce official said that US$55.8 million of the US$72
million was made through the export of garments. September alone has seen
the export of US$8.3 million worth of goods comprising garments and
related products such as caps and gloves, handicrafts, processed wood,
tobacco leaves and rice of which US$5.4 million were through export of
garments, the official said.

He added that  "the majority of our products was purchased by three
countries - the United Kingdom with US$2.9 million, China with US$1.8
million, and Germany with US$1.2 million".

He added that granting of MFN status to Cambodia will see these exports
figures increasing dramatically in the future as the MFN would enable
Cambodia to export at least 4,000 types of products to the United States.

"Minister of Commerce, Cham Prasidh has also applied for the granting of
GSP status by the United States in addition to bilateral trade
agreements, OPIC and a bilateral investment agreement.

"All these will be a boost for local exports to the United States,
especially agricultural and other assembled products such as garments,"
the official said.

A garment manufacturer who declined identity said that the absence of a
quota for garment exports to the United Kingdom and elsewhere is an added
advantage to enhance exports.

"Other countries enjoy GSP status but have a quota imposed. Cambodia does
not have a quota and we must take advantage of this while it lasts," he
said.

The manufacturer's company is one of the largest exporter of garment
products in the country.

Cambodia: Cottage industries provide 57,000 jobs

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

PHNOM PENH: Cottage industries and small scale industries are providing
some 57,000 employment opportunities to locals.

To date, there are at least 25,350 of such industries in the country and
this has been enhanced by the government's policy to encourage such
labour intensive investments here.

The Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy said that the increase in the
number of cottage industries in the country is important as it
contributed significantly to national development.

It added that such industries are basically involved in the production
of consumer goods such as food stuff, metal utensils and agricultural
tools as well as ironworks.

The Ministry added that its main objective is to encourage the dramatic
development of such industries by about 15 percent every year as it is
one of the ways to accelerate industrial development in the country.

The majority of the workshops are in the provinces of Kampong Cham,
Takeo, Kampong Thom, Kandal and as well as the capital city with 6,181,
2,701, 1,961, 1,835 and 1,941 establishments respectively.

The Ministry pointed out that it would further encourage the growth of
such industries and its expansion to cover wood-based products and
foundries to produce grills and other iron based products.

"Just because they are termed as "back-yard"industries by some does not
mean that they do not contribute towards economic growth, employment
creation and the proliferation of downstream industries," the Ministry
said.

It added such industries were the catalyst for the gradual introduction
of similar industries on a larger scale.

"Investments in such industries are coming in and it is a matter of time
when the cottage industries become a major contributor as there is ample
room for expansion and growth in their sector," it said.

Cambodia: Hotels gearing up for competition

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by T. Mohan

PHNOM PENH: The scheduled opening of a five-star hotel early next year,
extensive works to complete a long abandoned project and renovation and
extension works on existing hotels is expected to lead to a price war in
the hotel industry.

A hotel industry official said that the up-market hotel industry will see
keen competition, especially among at least three new entrants, the
Inter-Continental, the Raffles and another hotel, expected to named
Allson (replacing the present Allson) and the existing Sofitel Cambodiana
and the Royal Phnom Penh hotel.

"Sofitel Cambodiana will retain its lustre due to its strategic location
and its position as the only chain hotel which has been in operation for
a long time.

"Location, service and the country's political, economic and security
stability will decide the performance of the hotels," the official said.
He added that in any event, customer loyalty and preference will also be
playing an important role.

The Sofitel Cambodiana hotel is currently undergoing a phase by phase
renovation and refurbishment exercise while the Royal Phnom Penh has
already completed its extension project.

Cambodia: 5th Anniversary of Paris Accord celebrated

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Thet Sambath and Sakmay

PHNOM PENH: Cambodia celebrated the 5th Anniversary of the Paris Peace
Accord on Wednesday with renewed calls for reconciliation, unity and
development.

President of the National Assembly, Samdech Chea Sim, who presided at the
celebrations attended by the two Prime Ministers, members of the
diplomatic corps and foreign dignitaries said that October 23 was a
historic day as it had paved the path towards peace and national unity
and the end to destruction and war.

"The Paris Peace Accord notably brought peace and national unification
and also saw an international treaty that recognized Cambodia as an
independent, sovereign, neutral and nonaligned country with territorial
integrity.

"We must always commemorate this day in order to help our young
generation to remember their own history which has been filled with
tragedy and heroism so that they will remain conscientious of their duty
towards their country," Chea Sim said in his address.

Adding that the children of the country would definitely have a bright
future, Chea Sim pointed out that the nation was eternally grateful to
the International Community and the United Nations which had brought
about the peace in the country.

"The combined forces of FUNCINPEC Party, the CPP, BLDP, Molinaka and
other political parties, following the high desire of His Majesty the
King and the constitution, the supreme law of the state, has become a
vivid driving force behind the exercise of the policy for national
reunification, peace and national reconstruction," he said.

"In just three years, social developments in various aspects have
flourished throughout the country though some hard-line Khmer Rouge
rebels continue their action to destroy the people.

But this group, either on its own or some other form, will still be
moving towards self-destruction as the Cambodian people want peace,
rehabilitation, reconstruction and development and will no longer allow
themselves to be cheated," he said.

Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Ung Huot said
that despite the many challenges faced by the Royal Government, the
achievements thus far, since the historical day in 1991, has gone far
beyond the hope of the architects of the Paris Peace Agreement.

"Cambodia not only returned to a state of normalcy but also succeeded to
go from the phase of national rehabilitation to the phase of national
reconstruction and development.

"The country is also making plans to carry out the local elections in
1997 and the general elections in 1998," Ung Huot said. The Secretary
General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros Ghali said that the peace
accord served as an eloquent testimony to what the international
community could achieve when there is unity of will.

"The international community continues to help Cambodia build upon the
gains made during UNTAC and the emphasis of our role has rightly shifted
from that of being Cambodia's guardian to that of being the country's
friends.

"Without doubt, the biggest contribution to the country's rebirth has
been the Cambodians themselves who are setting in place and strengthening
the elements of a civil society whilst beginning to reap the dividends
of an ever-strengthening economy," the UN Secretary General said.

He added that challenges lied ahead but the UN was confident that the
Royal Government and the people are prepared to tackle them.

Boutros Boutros Ghali added that the United Nations will provide help in
the coordination of technical assistance for the forthcoming elections
and that several member states had already agreed to assist in the
process.

"In short, the future will depend upon Cambodia's ability to build upon
the achievements of the past half decade: namely its economic
rejuvenation, national reconciliation, universal respect for human rights
and the maintenance of political pluralism," he said.

Foreign dignitaries who gathered in front of the Royal Palace to
participate in the celebrations were representatives from Malaysia,
Australia, United States of America, Brunei, Lao PDR, Thailand and
Vietnam.

Ranariddh says reconciliation comes first

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

PHNOM PENH: First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh said that
national reconciliation must be achieved before all else as it was the
key to political and security stability. Speaking to an Asia Foundation
delegation led by Lucian Pye he stressed reconciliation with the Khmer
Rouge would lead to a complete ceasefire in fighting and this augured
well for national development.

"However, the criminals responsible for the death of millions of
Cambodians in the seventies must face an international court for their
actions," he said.

Prince Ranariddh pointed out that reconciliation with the Khmer Rouge and
trial for those responsible for the genocide were two separate issues.

"We can forgive but not forget," he said.

The First Prime Minister went on to brief the delegation on the various
challenges being faced in the country such as rejuvenating the education
sector, preparing for the forthcoming commune and general elections as
well as human rights issues.

He said that education is the key to resolving the human rights issue as
it would help strengthen democracy, social values and this in turn would
lead to greater respect for human rights.

"Our police, armed forces and the members of the military police must be
trained in these aspects so that they can uphold the law, justice and the
freedom of the people," Prince Ranariddh said, adding that human resource
development was another area where attention is needed immediately,
stressing that Cambodia's imminent entry into ASEAN would require
immediate upgrading of human resources and capacity development.

As far as the election is concerned, the Prince said the communal and
general elections must be held in 1997 and 1998 respectively as provided
in the constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

He highly appreciated the Asia Foundation's efforts and assistance
granted over the years, and especially for sending Cambodia's senior
government officials to study the elections in Bangladesh as it is an
important experience for holding the elections in Cambodia in 1997 and
1998.

Lucian Pye said that Asia Foundation would continue to assist the Royal
Government in various aspects, particularly in human rights development
and capacity building.

Ranariddh warns against poll violence

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

PHNOM PENH: First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh on Tuesday said
his party would win the next general elections in 1998 but warned against
intimidation and violence ahead of the polls.

Analysts believed the words of the head of the royalist FUNCINPEC party
were aimed at the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen, a battlefield foe turned coalition government partner.

The two parties formed a fragile alliance after FUNCINPEC narrowly edged
out the incumbent CPP in a landmark 1993 election organised by the United
Nations.

Their partnership turned sour in March when the royalists demanded a
greater share of power.

"FUNCINPEC won the 1993 election and I am pretty sure that in 1998
FUNCINPEC is going to win the election again. It will not fail, "the
Prince said at his party headquarters.

"We must take the bitter lessons of the 1993 election and apply them for
the 1998 election, "he said.

"I would like to say, as president of FUNCINPEC, that during the 1997
(local elections) and 1998 election, we will not allow anyone to suppress
FUNCINPEC as in 1993," he said.

He reiterated, at a seminar earlier this week to discuss the fifth
anniversary of the October 23,1991 Cambodian peace pact, that the next
elections should end the current system of two premiers and introduce a
single Prime Minister.

The coalition rift earlier this year saw Hun Sen at one stage warning he
would use force to prevent any attempt to break up the government after
Ranariddh had threatened to pull out.

The tension has abated in the past three months but the two leaders
continue to snipe at each other, normally in closed doors meetings whose
outcomes are often leaked. Analysts see the bickering as early
electioneering.

Cambodia: Marines prepare for Marlboro Cup

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Iem Sakmay

PHNOM PENH: The Korng Neaveachor (Royal Navy) soccer team is practicing
hard to prepare themselves for the forthcoming Marlboro Cup football
tournament in December.

Coach Chinsive said that the team is now training at the Institute of
Technology soccer pitch as their original training ground at the Kien
Kleang military garrison was flooded.

"The trainees, numbering 18, are divided into two teams and being members
of the military, they have ample time to train six times a week.

"The players are aged between 19 and 30 and many of them have had
Marlboro Cup tournament exposure," the coach said. He added that the team
had competed in numerous tournaments throughout the country and finished
fourth in the Samdech Krom Preah Cup tournament.

"In the last Marlboro Cup, we finished sixth but this time, we are
confident of doing better and we may even win the championship with some
luck as we are training hard," Chinsive said.The Marine soccer team had
also competed with visiting soccer teams from the Malaysian Navy and
others and has emerged victorious.

"We have defeated the Malaysian naval team in March this year," said To
Socheat, the assistant coach.

He pointed out that with regular tournaments, the marines hope to have
several of their leading players playing for the national team.

"As we are from the military, fitness is not a main problem to us.

"We are perfecting our technical and tactical skills as fitness alone
will not enable us to emerge as winners," Socheat stressed.

He added that privately organised soccer tournaments would enable
Cambodians to develop their football talent as the prize money is
attractive.

 ANTI-DRUG COOPERATION THE MAIN CONCERN AT CARICOM SUMMIT MEETING

 When President Cheddi Jagan of Guyana was asked what progress the Caricom 
summit in Barbados had made towards regional inegration, his answer was 
succinct: nothing. His view was shared by many observers, who noted that the 
Caribbean leaders had gone into the four-day meeting on 4 July with high 
hopes of settling some long-standing issues, but emerged disappointed.

 The single market was, as ever, at the top of the agenda but, as always,  
little or nothing was achieved. Islands fear their domestic production will 
be damaged unless safeguards are built in to any accords, and the unanimity 
rule means that the 14-strong community as a whole can only go at the pace 
of the slowest member. Proposals to speed things up by revising the founding 
Treaty of Chaguaramas got nowhere.

 Some ground may even have been lost: Trinidad and Barbados engaged in a 
heated dispute on alleged protectionism by the latter, which had imposed 
controls on imports of milk, juices and pasta from Trinidad.

 One concrete achievement was the establishment of the Caribbean Investment 
Fund (CIF), which is designed to channel investments into the region, mainly 
as replacements for the dwindling economic aid from the developed countries. 
Total aid from the United States, for example, was only US Dollars 22m last 
year, compared with US Dollars 226m in 1985.

 An agreement to arrange a meeting with Latin American banana producers, in 
an attempt to forge a united position on the US challenge to the European 
Union banana market regime (see Page 7, inside) was also welcomed by 
delegates.

 Another plus point was an agreement on cooperation against drug-
trafficking, which was the US's main concern at the meeting. About 40% of 
the cocaine reaching US markets goes via the Caribbean, with Puerto Rico 
acting as the last staging-post for much of it.

 A number of bilateral accords are already in place, or being negotiated, 
which give the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) the right to patrol 
islands' territorial waters and airspace. 'I think we have to err on the 
side of limiting sovereignty to some extent, in order to facilitate a 
greater attempt to catch these people,' said Antigua and Barbuda's Prime 
Minister, Lester Bird.

 Basdeo Panday of Trinidad and Tobago agreed: 'If we are not prepared to 
sacrifice some of the eighteenth and nineteenth century concepts of 
sovereignty, then we will lose our sovereignty to the drug lords,' he said. 
But other countries, such as Guyana, Belize and Jamaica, are less willing to 
hand over control to Washington.

 CUBA: DIPLOMACY: HELMS-BURTON PUTS PRESSURE ON EU LINK: CLINTON HESITATES 
OVER PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER

 President Clinton was due as we went to press to announce whether he would 
be exercising the presidential waiver on parts of the Helms-Burton law (see 
RC-96-05 & 03) that would allow US nationals to sue in US courts foreigners 
'trafficking' in assets confiscated by the Cuban government since 1959. 
Pressure from trading partners (and US businesses) to tone down the 
provisions of the law had been mounting -with threats of retaliation- but 
Clinton was known to be reluctant to do anything that might alienate the 
Florida Cuba lobby in an election year.

 ING pulls out. The law, which is designed to discourage third countries 
from trading with and investing in Cuba, had already scored one important 
success. On 4 July the ING banking group, of the Netherlands, announced that 
it was pulling out of financing the Cuban sugar industry because of the 
Helms-Burton legislation.

 ING, which has been expanding its presence vigorously in Cuba in recent 
years, was one of the foreign banks whose financial support was vital to 
Cuba's efforts to recover from last year's disastrous sugar harvest (see RC-
96-01), by enabling it to import fertiliser, spare parts and other inputs.

 But the group has now said that it will not renew US Dollars 30m in loans 
to the Cuban state sugar marketing company, Cubazucar, because its 
subsidiaries in the US could be exposed to legal action there. The ING's 
decision must cast doubt on the financing of the 1996-97 sugar harvest, for 
which the target is over 5m tonnes.

 The Cuban government maintains that hardly any of the foreign companies 
active in Havana are at risk of prosecution in the US courts under what is 
formally known as the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, and ING 
insists that it will continue all its other operations in Cuba.

 Recognising the possible impact of the Helms-Burton law, Vice-President 
Carlos Lage, who is in charge of the economy, said on 6 July that Cuba would 
have to rely more on a combination of greater efficiency and domestic 
savings for investments in future.

 EU doubts. Helms-Burton has also cast a further cloud over the European 
Union's economic cooperation with Cuba, which was already faltering because 
of the slow pace of democratic reforms (see RC-96-05).

 The Italian government, which occupied the presidency of the Union until 
the end of June, insists that the EU will defend its interests if Washington 
attempts to apply the law against the companies of member countries. But a 
seminar in Sitges on 10 July, organised by the Institute of European-Latin 
American Relations (Irela), concluded that the prospects of an economic 
accord with the island were becoming more remote.

 BOTH SIDES CLAIM  AIR INCIDENT VICTORY: HIJACK ENABLES HAVANA TO SEIZE BACK 
THE INITIATIVE

 The outcome of the international civil aviation organisation's inquiry into 
the downing of two light aircraft in February by the Cuban air force -an 
event that hastened the approval of the Helms-Burton law by the US Congress- 
had good and bad aspects for Cuba.

 On the one hand, the resolution issued on 27 June did not explicitly 
condemn Cuba, and did not confirm the US contention that the planes, 
operated by a Miami-based Cuban exile organisation, Hermanos al Rescate, had 
been shot down over international waters. On the other, it did condemn the 
use of force against unarmed civilian aircraft.

 Cuba's public position was that the resolution was a vindication of its 
arguments and a setback for Washington. The Castro government insisted that 
the inquiry report only accepted the US version of events and distorted what 
had really happened, and the resolution had tacitly recognised this.

 Cuba maintained that the aircraft had violated its airspace several times 
and had been shot down after repeated warnings. It further noted that the 
resolution urged states to control flights that violated other countries' 
airspace, and was preparing to challenge the US at the United Nations 
Security Council as we went to press. The meeting was expected to begin on 
or around 22 July.

 Guantanamo hijack. Any triumphalism in Washington over the report proved to 
be short-lived. At the end of June a Cuban gunman hijacked a domestic 
airliner to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay and claimed political 
asylum. This immediately put the Clinton administration in an uncomfortable 
dilemma: to grant asylum to a hijacker would be in contravention both of 
international accords against air piracy and of bilateral agreements between 
the US and Cuba. It would also give Cuba the opportunity to go back on the 
diplomatic offensive.

 However, to hand the hijacker over to the Cuban authorities, or take him to 
court, as Havana was demanding, would outrage the same exile groups that 
Clinton has been so anxious to keep onside.

 To make matters even more complicated, the hijacker identified himself as a 
senior officer in the Cuban security forces: Lieutenant-Colonel Jose 
Fernandez Pupo. The Cubans maintained that he had been an officer in the 
interior ministry forces, but had been dismissed earlier this year on 
suspicion of embezzlement.

 Under the May 1995 migration agreements between Washington and Havana, 
which put an end to the outflow of 'raft people' from the island, all would-
be migrants attempting to enter US territory (including Guantanamo) without 
a visa should be returned to the island.

PILOT BAN REDUCED

The indefinite suspension of the pilot's licence of Hermanos al Rescate 
president Jose Basulto by the Federal Aviation Administration was reduced to 
150 days by a US federal judge on 5 July. The court ruled that Basulto had 
only violated Cuban airspace 'slightly and unwittingly' in July last year. 
His was the only one of three planes to return to Miami on 24 February this 
year.

LIST OF 'SUSPECTS'

A Miami law firm, Nicolas Gutierrez, has notified the State Department of a 
supplementary list of foreign companies suspected of trafficking in 
confiscated property. They include Pemex (Mexico), the Sol-Melia hotels 
group (Spain), Sandoz pharmaceutical laboratories (Switzerland), Pernod-
Ricard distilleries (France), BM Industries, an Israeli citrus fruits 
producer, and Monte Carlo Real Estate Investments of Monaco.

ECONOMIC GROWTH 'TO CONTINUE'

Carlos Lage said in mid-June that, despite Helms-Burton, he expected first-
half figures to show the economy maintaining the 7% growth rate recorded in 
the first quarter.

 He put the 1995-96 sugar harvest at 4.45m tonnes, and said nickel 
production for the year would probably reach a record 50,000 tonnes, 40% 
more than in 1995. In addition, tourism had grown by 40%, tobacco production 
by 25% and agricultural output in general by 22%.

 The official target for GDP growth this year is 5%, compared with 2.5% in 
1995 and 0.7% in 1994. Between 1990 and 1993 the economy contracted by 34.3% 
in relation to 1989 levels. Economy and planning minister Jose Luis 
Rodriguez said on 7 July that economic recovery was 'irreversible.'

 Canadian entrepreneur Wally Berukoff announced at the beginning of July 
that he was entering a joint venture to build 11 tourist hotels with the 
Cuban state hotels company.

NO MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM

Apparently confirming the impression that there has been a political clamp-
down in the island since the Helms-Burton law was passed in March, Communist 
Party first secretary Esteban Lazo said at the end of June that the 
introduction of a multi-party political system would 'fragment' the unity of 
the Cuban people. In present circumstances, he said, that would be 
'suicidal' and 'unforgivable.' He said the overwhelming majority of Cubans 
had no wish to see any more parties.

 HAITI: HUMAN RIGHTS: OUTRAGE OVER RELEASE OF CONSTANT: WASHINGTON RELUCTANT 
TO HAND OVER FRAPH LEADER

 The government of President Rene Preval has demanded the extradition from 
the US of Emmanuel 'Toto' Constant, 39, leader of the right-wing 
paramilitary organisation Fraph, who was released from a Maryland detention 
centre in mid-June. Washington is reluctant to hand Constant over to the 
authorities because of what a State Department spokesman described as the 
weakness of the Haitian judicial system.

 US ambassador William Swing has, however, assured the Haitian government 
that Washington has no wish to keep Constant, who describes himself as a CIA 
informer, a moment longer than necessary. He is wanted in Haiti in 
connection with hundreds of atrocities committed by Fraph members in the 
wake of the military coup that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 
September 1991.

 Constant was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service after 
entering the US illegally in 1995. His release was described by Haitian 
human rights activists in the US as 'an unforgivable insult to the dignity 
and honour of the Haitian people.'

 ST KITTS & NEVIS: POLITICS: NEVIS SEEKS TO LEAVE FEDERATION: SMALLER ISLAND 
COMPLAINS OF 'DOMINATION' BY NEIGHBOUR

 The Premier of Nevis, Vance Amory, announced on 24 June that the island was 
taking steps to secede from the federation with St Kitts, its larger 
neighbour in the Leeward Islands. Amory said he had instructed lawyers to 
prepare a separation bill, under section 113 of the constitution.

 Long-standing resentment. Amory claimed there was no alternative to 
separation. Nevis has long complained of being dominated by St Kitts, and 
Amory took particular exception to the federal government opening an office 
in the Nevis capital, Charlestown. He described the move as unconstitutional 
and an affront to the rights of Nevisians.

 To make matters worse, the government of Prime Minister Denzil Douglas, 
elected last year (see RC-95-06), has also introduced legislation requiring 
all outside investments in Nevis to be channelled through St Kitts.

 The federal government insists that the opening of an office in Charlestown 
is merely intended to improve communications between the two islands, and 
will not undermine Amory's position.

 The constitutional procedure for dissolving the federation apparently 
includes a referendum, which means the process will be protracted. A two-
thirds majority in favour of secession is required.

 Nevis has a population of about 10,000, an area of 93sq km (half that of St 
Kitts) and considerable autonomy within the federation. It has three seats 
in the 11-seat federation parliament, as well as an assembly of its own.

 Both islands' economies are based on sugar cane, and increasingly on 
tourism. Trans-shipment of drugs is a growing problem, bringing with it 
violence and a succession of scandals in recent times (see RC-96-05).

 FOCUS: CARIBBEAN TOURISM AFTER THE HURRICANES: DISASTERS EXACERBATED TRENDS 
ALREADY UNDER WAY

 With the new hurricane season already upon us, there is a good deal of 
understandable apprehension in the Caribbean countries whose tourist 
industries were hard hit by last year's high winds.

 With more statistics now available, it is now possible to assess the impact 
-at least in terms of visitor arrivals, if not yet always in terms of the 
associated economic impact.

 The countries which suffered most were Anguilla, with total arrivals down 
14.9%; Antigua & Barbuda (-8.9%), the Bahamas (-8%) and St Kitts-Nevis (-
3.2%).

 If the focus is shifted towards the most lucrative portion of that trade, 
the stop-over arrivals, the picture changes somewhat. The hardest hit was 
Antigua & Barbuda (-18.5%), followed by Anguilla (-16.5%), St Kitts-Nevis (-
10.4%), Montserrat (-3.5%) -and Grenada, where stop-over arrivals declined 
by 2.5%, while total arrivals increased by 25.2%.

 The Bahamas appears as an anomaly: though total arrivals fell, the 
lucrative stop-over arrivals increased by 4.3%.

 The economic impact of these developments varied quite considerably, as the 
tourist industry does not have the same weight in the various economies. It 
was greatest in Anguilla and Antigua & Barbuda, where tourism earnings in 
1994 accounted for 83.4% and 79.6% of GDP, respectively.

 In the Bahamas it accounted for just over 40%, in St Kitts and Montserrat 
for 36-38%, and in Grenada for just under 22%.

 Antigua & Barbuda, which had seen its GDP grow by 5.5% in 1994, registered 
a 3.8% contraction in 1995. The picture for Anguilla is less clear: in 1994 
the economy grew by 8.1%, but all that the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) 
records for last year in its recently published annual report is, 
'Preliminary indications are that GDP contracted in Anguilla in 1995.'

 At least a slowdown, perhaps even a contraction, took place in Montserrat, 
which had grown by only 0.8% in 1994. In St Kitts & Nevis the effect ws a 
slowdown in the rate of growth, from 3.2% in 1994 to 2% in 1995.

 On the other hand, in both the Bahamas and Grenada there were slight 
accelerations of the growth rate; from 0.6% to 1.5% in the former, 2% to 
2.3% in the latter.

 It is well worth noting that the hurricanes cannot be blamed for 
everything; in fact, as the CDB underlines, they seem to have exacerbated 
trends which were already visible before 1995. The most important one of 
these is 'the increasing importance of the cruise segment of the industry', 
to the detriment of the higher-spending stop-over segment.

 The one stop-over bracket that has been showing positive signs is that of 
the all-inclusive resorts (on the model of Club Med), though their impact 
has been chiefly to erode the appeal of the traditional hotel trade.

 The CDB notes in its annual report that a number of Caribbean countries 
have tried to act upon this main trend by investing heavily in duty-free 
facilities for visitors, and that 'these operations appear to have enjoyed a 
successful year, despite competition from on-board facilities on cruise 
liners.'

 Coping successfully with the trends within the tourist industry has become 
critical because of a broader macro-economic trend noted by the CDB: the 
continuation in 1995 of 'the shift away from traditional merchandise 
production to services and tourism, particularly in the smaller BMCs 
[borrowing member countries].'

 The economic performance update on the following page incorporates the 
latest data from the CDB and other sources: please note that in many cases 
the figures for 1994 have been revised.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: ELECTIONS: BALAGUER-BOSCH ALLIANCE TRIUMPHS: BUT 
FERNANDEZ PROMISESNATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT

 The 'stop Pena Gomez' strategy devised by President Joaquin Balaguer and 
his old enemy Juan Bosch, outlined in our last issue, was completely 
successful. Leonel Fernandez, Bosch's youthful (42) protege, duly defeated 
Pena Gomez in the run-off on 30 June.

 Fernandez received just over 51% of the votes against Pena Gomez' 48.75%. 
In the first round on 16 May, Pena Gomez had won 46% to Fernandez' 39%. It 
was Balaguer's support that made the difference.

 Fernandez' Partido de la Liberacion Dominicana (PLD) has only one seat in 
the senate and 12 in the 120-seat lower chamber (see box), which means that 
the new President will be forced to rely on the backing of Balaguer's 
Partido Reformista Social Cristiano (PRSC) to get his legislative programme 
through -at least until the next congressional elections in 1998.

 Fernandez has talked of wanting a 'government of national unity,' which 
suggests that he does not relish the prospect of being completely beholden 
to the octogenarian former President -whose support, he said, was given 
'without conditions'.

 Whether and how Pena Gomez will agree to take part in the new 
administration remains to be seen. His prompt recognition of his opponent's 
victory, and pledge to constitute a loyal opposition, were at least a good 
start. But it is certain that Balaguer will retain a strong influence over 
whatever government takes shape.

 One area where the incoming President's resolve will be tested is that of 
privatisation. He, like Pena Gomez, pledged during the campaign to speed up 
a process that was begun only reluctantly by Balaguer, who found state-owned 
enterprises useful instruments of patronage, not to mention revenue.

 But foreign capital will have to be pumped into the electric power utility 
if the country's chronic energy crisis is ever to be resolved. The Balaguer-
controlled congress has been sitting on the enabling legislation for the 
past two years. And the sugar marketing monopoly is such a disaster that 
there is no alternative to divestment.

 Fernandez has also promised to tackle the corruption that was endemic under 
Balaguer, and to remove the state budget from the President's personal 
control.

 If Pena Gomez is to have some part in the new government, he will insist on 
electoral reforms, to ensure that opposition candidates have equal access to 
the media in future, and do not have to fight against the state apparatus as 
well as the government's candidate.

PROFILE: LEONEL FERNANDEZ

Leonel Antonio Fernandez Reyna is a 42-year-old lawyer, who spent six years 
of his childhood in New York. He joined the PLD when it was founded in 1973 
by Juan Bosch. He worked his way steadily and silently up the party 
hierarchy, and was Bosch's running-mate in the 1994 presidential elections. 
A year later he was selected as presidential candidate with 93% support 
within the PLD.

 As a relatively young man in a gerontocracy, Fernandez is particularly 
popular with Dominican youth and -they say- with women (he is divorced).

 TRINIDAD & TOBAGO: POLITICS: PNM LOSES GROUND IN LOCAL ELECTIONS: BUT 
RULING COALITION FAILS TO CONSOLIDATE ITS POSITION

 The opposition People's National Movement (PNM) won a narrow victory in the 
local and regional elections on 24 June, but lost some ground overall. The 
party maintained its dominant position in the urban areas, and retained 
control of Port of Spain city council. It subsequently chose John Rahael, 
who owns a chain of clothes shops, to succeed Ethelbert Paul as mayor on 4 
July.

 UNC wins two more councils. Despite winning 63 of the 124 seats at stake in 
five municipal districts and nine regional councils, the PNM ended up in 
control of only seven of the country's 14 councils, compared with 10 after 
the 1992 elections. The United National Congress (UNC), which is stronger in 
rural areas, now controls six, compared with four last time out. In the 
previous regional elections, the PNM had won 75 seats to the UNC's 40.

 The results did not, however, represent the consolidation of the ruling 
party's position that Prime Minister Basdeo Panday had been hoping for. The 
UNC's fractious partner in government, A. N. R. Robinson's National Alliance 
for Reconstruction (NAR), which only put up 36 candidates, won no seats at 
all.

 Attorney-general Ramesh Lawrence Maharaj commented that the UNC had done as 
well as could be expected, given the PNM's strong regional organisation.

 PNM leader Patrick Manning, under fire after losing last November's general 
election, insisted that his position was not in danger following the latest 
setbacks.

 REGION: BANANAS: PRODUCERS HOPE FOR ACCORD WITH LATINS: CLINTON REFUSES TO 
WITHDRAW WTO COMPLAINT OVER EU REGIME

 The Caribbean producers' lobbying of Washington, in an attempt to persuade 
the US to withdraw its complaint to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) about 
the European Union's banana market regime (see RC-96-03), is growing 
increasingly desperate and forlorn. Some sort of agreement with Latin 
American growers may be their last resort.

 Clinton sympathetic, but ... When Jamaican Prime Minister P. J. Patterson, 
speaking for all the regional producers, appealed to President Bill Clinton 
to give the small island producers a break, he received a dusty answer. 
Despite Clinton's promise that the US does not seek to damage the economies 
and societies of the Caribbean, it seems unlikely that it will back off from 
the WTO action. His letter spoke of 'discriminatory and unnecessarily 
restrictive regulations' in the EU regime.

 The recent Caricom summit approved plans to convene a meeting with Latin 
American producers, in Belize in October. The running is being made in 
Central America by former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. Guatemala, 
Honduras and Mexico joined Ecuador (the world's biggest banana producer) in 
supporting the US complaint to the WTO.

 But bringing the two camps together will not be easy. The low-cost Latin 
American producers feel that the EU regime, under the Lome Agreement, 
unfairly discriminates against them as much as it puts US marketing 
companies, such as Chiquita Brands, at a disadvantage.

 Lome rules. Under the Lome Agreement (Lome IV), the EU allows 857,000 
tonnes a year of Caribbean bananas into its market, while imposing both 
quotas and duties on Latin American ('dollar') bananas. A framework 
agreement with four of the Latin American producers -Costa Rica, Colombia, 
Nicaragua and Venezuela- grants them preferential quotas.

 Belizean Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel, at least, is optimistic. He says 
the October meeting 'will allow the two major players in this issue a 
greater understanding of the problems we face and, perhaps, show us a way 
forward where we could confront this issue ... from a common understanding 
rather than the current situation, in which some Central and Latin American 
producing countries are on one side ... and some others and ourselves are on 
the other.'

 The Caribbean producers fear that the EU is wilting under US and Latin 
American pressure. For the last quarter of 1996, the EU has increased the 
'dollar' bananas quota from 2.2m tonnes to 2.55m. This, they say, will both 
contribute to driving prices down further and take market share away from 
struggling Caribbean producers.

 Quality problems. The Windward Islands, in particular, have been struggling 
with quality-control problems, and recently had to buy fruit from Latin 
American producers to enable them to fulfil their EU obligations. The 
Windward Islands Banana Development and Exporting Company (Wibdeco) admitted 
that it was receiving a premium price from British supermarkets for only 60% 
of its sales.

 St Lucia's Prime Minister, Vaughn Lewis, who has good contacts in the US, 
has now taken on much of the Windwards' lobbying efforts there. He has also 
been leading discussions with EU representatives on European aid for 
'rehabilitation' of the banana industry.

 At the same time, Grenada's Prime Minister, Keith Mitchell, visited Japan 
in mid-July in an attempt to persuade Tokyo to use its influence on the 
Caribbean's behalf at the WTO. Grenada, St Vincent and St Lucia back Japan's 
demands for a relaxation of international controls on whaling.

 The burden of this effort, as ever, is to persuade the outside world that 
the islands depend on bananas for agricultural, economic and social 
stability -with the threat of increasing problems with drug-trafficking and 
illegal migrations if that stability is destroyed. Banana exports to Europe 
account for 50% of the Windwards' foreign exchange earnings.

 Jagan warning. Guyana's Cheddi Jagan put it in a nutshell at the Caricom 
meeting when he warned that marijuana was an obvious alternative to bananas 
for farmers throughout the region.

 While Clinton's reply to Patterson offered to 'meet informally with 
Caribbean countries to search for mutually acceptable alternatives to the 
current EU system,' such vague expressions of good will cut little ice in 
the Caribbean: the Jamaica Gleaner called it 'double speak'.

 'We are comfortable with the EU regime, and if they have an alternative ... 
which will not damage us, then they must come forward with that ... but they 
are not doing that,' said Dominica Prime Minister Edison James.

GUYANA MILITARY STAND-OFF

The Jagan government found itself in an unexpected confrontation with the 
military in June, when the dismissed second-in-command of the army (GDF) 
threatened 'serious instability' unless he was reinstated. The People's 
Progressive Party (PPP) government held firm.

 Colonel Goodwin McPherson was suspended after allegations of 
misappropriation of funds in 1995, while he was temporarily in command of 
the GDF. The move led to mutterings in the ranks about 'political 
opportunism'. Some officers say McPherson is being victimised because he is 
regarded as a supporter of the opposition People's National Congress (PNC), 
which ruled the country for 28 years.

 The PPP regarded the predominantly black GDF as an arm of the PNC during 
the long Forbes Burnham regime, but has praised its 'professionalism' since 
Jagan's election victory in 1992 -when the military voted overwhelmingly for 
the PNC.

 POSTSCRIPT

 BAHAMAS/ Cubans repatriated. Thirty-eight Cuban refugees were sent home in 
June, under a bilateral agreement signed in January on the repatriation of 
illegal immigrants. A total of 80 people have now been deported since then. 
Immigration minister C.A. Smith says the process will continue until all the 
200 Cubans still in the Bahamas have been returned home.

 BARBADOS/ Jobless fall. Unemployment in the last quarter of 1995 registered 
16.4%, down from 21.7% in the first quarter of the year, according to the 
latest figures from the central bank. 

Labour movement. The government has removed work permit requirements for 
skilled workers from other Caricom member states. The amendment, which 
fulfils a 1989 agreement by Caricom leaders to move towards the free 
movement of labour throughout the region, follows similar legislation 
adopted in Trinidad and Tobago. 

 BERMUDA/ Burger blockade. The government's controversial decision to allow 
McDonald's restaurants to open a branch on the island has been overturned by 
a censure motion passed by the opposition and a group of five government 
rebels, including former tourism minister Jim Woolridge. 

 CUBA/ Island online. The government has approved public access to the 
internet and other information facilities. Businesses and institutions 
involved in 'national development' will have priority, and users will have 
to register with the science and technology ministry, reports the official 
newspaper Granma.

Drug seizures. So far this year the authorities have made 24 drug-busts, 
seizing one and a half tonnes of cocaine and a tonne of marihuana, the 
national antidrugs commission announces. Though it says it is concerned 
about the increased use of the island by smugglers, it insists that drug 
consumption is not a problem in Cuba.

Infant mortality falls. Infant deaths in the first six months of the year 
fell to 8.2 per 1000 births, from 9.4 in the same period of 1995, according 
to the public health ministry. The World Health Organisation places Cuba 
among the 25 countries with the lowest rates.

Student labour. Nearly one million students belonging to the 'Fuerzas De 
Accion Pioneriles' and the 'Brigadas Estudiantiles de Trabajo' youth groups, 
as well as 108,000 teachers, were mobilised on 8 July for a two-week work 
stint on farms and sugar plantations. According to the organisers 10,000 
more students volunteered to help this year than in 1995. 

 GUYANA/ Gold investment. Government officials say the Canadian mining giant 
Placer Dome is once again interested in gold mining in Guyana, following a 
meeting between company director Robert Franklin and President Cheddi Jagan 
during the latter's recent 12-day visit to Canada. Six years ago the company 
halted its operations in the country saying the Omai mine was insufficiently 
profitable. 

 HAITI/ EU aid boost. Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the European Development 
Commissioner, has promised a 'clear increase' in financial aid for the 
island over the next five years. He told visiting President Rene Preval that 
the EU is determined to strengthen democracy and economic development in the 
Caribbean nation. Haiti has received US Dollars 180m in aid from the EU 
since 1989.

Mixed results. GDP grew by 4% during 1995, following the lifting of the 
international trade embargo against the former military regime, though 
unemployment was 50% and the budget deficit increased considerably, Eclac 
reports. It says most sectors registered growth, with the exception of 
agriculture, which shrank by 8.5%, partly due to hurricane damage.

 ST. LUCIA/ Opposition alliance. Julian Hunte, the former leader of the St. 
Lucia Labour party, will form an alliance against the present government at 
the upcoming general elections with his one time rival George Odlum, leader 
of the National Front. Hunte, who recently announced his resignation from 
politics, said he had a change of heart, and would be standing for the Gros 
Islet seat.

 SURINAME/ Parties unite. Three of the main political parties, the New 
Front, Democratic Alternative 91 and Pendawalina, have begun talks on 
forming a coalition government, following inconclusive results in May's 
general elections. The three parties won 32 of the 51 seats in the national 
assembly.

 TRINIDAD & TOBAGO/ Trade figures. A trade surplus of US Dollars 133.5m was 
recorded in the first quarter, a 61% fall on the US Dollars 336m surplus 
registered in the same period of the previous year, according to the 
statistics office. The United States is still the major recipient of the 
islands' exports, receiving 43.6% of the total, though exports to Caricom 
countries have risen to 27.8%.

 REGION/ Hurricane strikes. Hurricane Bertha, the first of the Atlantic 
season, brought winds of up to 160km/h to the region.  Worst hit so far has 
been Puerto Rico and the British and US Virgin islands, with flooding, 
downed power lines and damage to property. In Puerto Rico the hurricane left 
three dead, including one man who drowned while surfing. The island was 
saved from further damage by a high pressure front which forced the 
hurricane northwards. A Venezuelan ship got into difficulties off the coast 
of St. Thomas in the US Virgin islands, and 20 of the 42 crew members went 
missing, feared drowned.

 LACAYO FAILS IN BID TO OVERTURN BAN ON HIS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF 
Nicaragua

 The decision by the Consejo Supremo Electoral (CSE) to rule out the 
presidential candidacies of Antonio Lacayo, Alvaro Robelo and Eden Pastora 
was hailed by Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo on 7 July as a sign that 'the 
law is beginning to be obeyed in Nicaragua.' After much vacillation, and 
with violence continuing in many parts of the country, the stage at last 
appears to be set for a reasonably orderly electoral process in October.

 The elimination of Lacayo from the contest was no more than an application 
of the constitutional ban on relatives of the President standing for the 
office -he is President Violeta Chamorro's son-in-law. But he had hoped 
until the last moment to mount a successful legal challenge to the ruling. 
Lacayo, who is 48, will now have to wait until the year 2001 before he can 
run again for President.

 His failure, whatever the merits or otherwise of the constitutional 
provision, introduced last year, is a triumph for the rule of law. The other 
two hopefuls were ruled out on the grounds that they had adopted foreign 
citizenship: Robelo, candidate of the right-wing Alianza Nicaraguense, is 
regarded as an Italian (which he denies) and the former guerrilla leader 
Pastora ('Comandante Zero') is Costa Rican.

 Obando y Bravo was encouraged by the fact that the candidates appeared to 
have accepted the CSE decision 'with resignation', a sign of growing 
political maturity.

 Such signs were long overdue, after months of squabbling, delays and 
factional disputes (see RC-96-04). But the armed groups roaming the central 
and northern regions have not demonstrated comparable progress.

 On the contrary, 33 electoral officials were kidnapped and held by one such 
group in mid-June. Their release, after the intercession of both the church 
and the Organisation of American States (OAS), was a reminder that 
Nicaragua's future political stability still rests heavily on the 
intervention of benevolent outside forces.

 The army is doing its best to hold the ring, but has its hands full. At the 
end of June the high command reported that it had been involved in 63 
operations against armed bands since the beginning of the year, inflicting 
more than 80 casualties and detaining a further 200.

 The gangs, many of which operate close to the Honduran frontier, are 
pressing for the army to be withdrawn from their areas of influence, and 
have prevented the electoral authorities from registering voters and 
distributing identity documents.

 The authorities estimate that there are 69 armed bands in the centre and 
north, with a total strength of about 460. Many are former combatants, both 
Sandinistas and Contras, who now make a living from robbery and kidnappings.

 The resignation shown by Lacayo's Proyecto Nacional (Pronal) organisation 
has extended to holding a hastily-arranged convention on 7 July to select a 
replacement for Lacayo as presidential candidate. Banker and construction 
company chief Benjamin Lanzas was the only serious contender. The party is 
not expected to get much more than 2% of the votes on 20 October.

 A total of 19 presidential candidacies have been approved by the CSE. The 
leading contenders are Arnoldo Aleman, former mayor of Manuagua, standing 
for the Liberals, and former President Daniel Ortega, for the Frente 
Sandinista de Liberacion Nacional (FSLN). Both emerged unscathed from 
attempts to have their candidacies ruled out by the CSE.

 PANAMA: DRUGS & POLITICS: PRESIDENT OBLIGED TO EAT HIS WORDS: 'DIRTY' MONEY 
DID FIND ITS WAY INTO 1994 ELECTION CAMPAIGN

 Drug-trafficking and money-laundering, which optimists thought had been 
brought under control since the removal of General Manuel Noriega in 1989, 
have elbowed their way back onto the centre-stage of Panamanian politics. 
President Ernesto Perez Balladares, initially defiant, has been forced to 
make an embarrassing climb-down.

 Campaign contribution. The episode began with a resounding success for the 
Panamanian anti-drugs police when, in cooperation with forces from several 
other countries, they uncovered a drug shipping and money-laundering 
operation in the heart of Panama City. It later transpired that the 
suspected boss of these rackets, Jose Castrillon Henao, a Colombian, had 
contributed to the President's 1994 election campaign.

 When the New York Times, Miami Herald and the British weekly The Economist 
suggested as much, Perez threatened to sue the last-named, but had to back 
off when it turned out that the publication's charges were, if anything, 
understated.

 One positive, if indirect, outcome may be a tightening-up of Panama's 
banking and company registration laws. Castrillon Henao, who had apparently 
been running maritime shipping operations for Valle del Cauca cocaine 
interests out of Panama for at least eight years, had set up dozens of 
phoney bank accounts in Panama's international financial centre, and used 
the funds to accumulate an impressive portfolio of property and other 
interests in Panama, controlled through paper companies.

 The alarm about what might be going on in the banking centre, where 120 
financial institutions have set up shop in the past 25 years under a very 
relaxed regime, had already been sounded in January. The Banco 
Agroindustrial y Comercial (Banaico), a small institution with links to the 
ruling Partido Revolucionario Democratico (PRD), was taken into 
administration by the national banking commission after a liquidity crisis, 
and its managers were subsequently charged with fraud.

 Economy minister Guillermo Chapman explained that the current banking 
legislation, dating back to 1971, gives the government very limited powers 
of regulation and supervision. He said changes were needed to make sure 
there was no repetition of the Banaico scandal. There are currently no 
controls at all on banks' credit policies, and very undemanding liquidity 
and reserve requirements.

 Perez Balladares has insisted that the new legislation must include strong 
anti-money laundering measures. He is no doubt mindful of the remarks by the 
State Department's anti-drugs chief, Robert Gelbard, who said in April that 
'billions of dollars' were being laundered through the Panamanian financial 
centre, and the country ran the risk of falling into the clutches of the 
drug cartels once US forces completed their pull-out at the turn of the 
century (see RC-96-04).

 Castrillon's empire. Investigations into Castrillon Henao's activities in 
Panama revealed that he controlled more than 50 limited companies, and had 
opened dozens of accounts in at least nine banks, Banaico among them, under 
a variety of assumed names. One of these companies, the tuna-fishing 
enterprise Fuji Investments, had paid two cheques totalling US Dollars 
51,000 into Perez Balladares' 1994 campaign funds. The payment was made 
through Felix Estripeaut, a businessman friend of Vice-President Felipe 
Virzi, who was subsequently appointed ambassador to Costa Rica.

 Perez Balladares was forced to concede as much in a TV broadcast on 21 
June, two weeks after the allegations had appeared in the foreign press. He 
insisted he had known nothing of Castrillon Henao's narcotics connection, 
and vowed to get to the bottom of the matter at all costs. Attorney-general 
Jose Antonio Sosa is now carrying out an inquiry, beginning with depositions 
from Estripeaut and Virzi.

 Comparison with Colombia. By insisting that he had nothing to hide, Perez 
Balladares hoped to avoid a narcoescandalo of the sort that has been 
obsessing Colombia for the past year, nearly bringing down President Ernesto 
Samper in the process. The President has also made clear that he wants to 
see Castrillon extradited to the US.

 Another possible outcome of this episode is a reform of the financing of 
election campaigns. The PRD has been pressing for legislation to permit 
examination of party accounts, to head off opposition accusations that it 
has accepted 'dirty' money. As with the banking laws, current legislation on 
campaign funding is extremely lax.

 At least one other party, the opposition Partido Renovacion Civilista 
(PRC), has admitted receiving a donation from a Castrillon Henao front 
company.

COLOMBIANS HELD

Two further Colombian drug suspects, Jaime Revello and Vilma Escobar, were 
arrested in Panama on 4 July, after a six-month police operation. They were 
described as 'high-level South American mafia' figures. Escobar is the wife 
of Colombian drug boss Julian Garcia.

COSTA RICA WARNING

The US ambassador in San Jose, Peter de Vos, said on 5 July that Costa Rica 
was an 'important bridge' in the transport of drugs to the US from South 
America. He said the port of Limon was used for shipments, while light 
aircraft and road transport were also used.

 He added that he was 'very satisfied' with the cooperation of the Costa 
Rican government against such activities, but noted that much remained to be 
done.

TREATY ROW IN HONDURAS

An anti-drug and money-laundering treaty under negotiation with the US has 
provoked objections from government, opposition and military figures that 
some of the US demands would damage Honduran sovereignty. US personnel would 
be permitted to operate freely in Honduran territory and DEA agents would 
enjoy diplomatic immunity under the agreement.

 Honduran police had confiscated more than 3 tonnes of cocaine by mid-June; 
some 90% of the cocaine heading for the US market is believed to pass 
through Honduras.

 COSTA RICA: POLITICS: FIGUERES RESHUFFLES HIS CABINET PACK: PRIVATE SECTOR 
APPROVES BUT PUBLIC LESS IMPRESSED

 The sudden cabinet reshuffle at the beginning of July by President Jose 
Maria Figueres was variously described as 'profound' by the President, as 
'window-dressing' by the opposition and as something in between by 
respondents to opinion polls. The new-look cabinet contained only three 
fresh faces.

 More liberalisation. Figueres explained in a radio and television broadcast 
on 1 July that he had asked for the collective resignation of his government 
to enable him to deepen the processes of economic and trade liberalisation 
already initiated, and thereby to hasten the insertion of Costa Rica into 
the new, 'globalised' world order. His aim, he said, was to achieve these 
aims with the minimum 'social' impact and without harming the environment.

 He promised to concentrate, during the remaining 22 months of his four-year 
term, on four issues:

 Modernisation of the telecommunications system;

 Improvements to the road network;

 Reinforcement of health and education programmes; and

 Progress towards a national pensions system. 

 The President's plea for a national consensus on these issues came at a 
time when his own party was riven by dissent and congress was deadlocked. 
Members of the ruling Partido Liberacion Nacional (PLN) had brought 
legislative work to a halt in mid-June in a dispute over the election of a 
new comptroller-general and his deputy.

 Figueres and PLN deputies were outraged when their colleague Walter Coto, 
the chairman of congress, allied with the opposition Partido Unidad Social 
Cristiana (PUSC) to ensure the election of Luis Fernando Vargas and Jorge 
Corrales, the latter from the PUSC.

 The President had backed his close friend Rodolfo Silva for the top job, 
but his appointment was blocked by the opposition, while Corrales was 
unacceptable to the PLN, who blamed him for failing to head off the collapse 
of the Banco Anglo-Costarricense in 1994.

 Unpopular President. The opposition pointed out that Figueres' move smacked 
of desperation, at a time when, partly as a result of all this wrangling, 
his popularity had slumped to an all-time low (see RC-96-05). More than 50% 
of respondents to opinion polls in June described his performance as bad or 
very bad, and more again thought there was no prospect of an improvement.

 At least Figueres succeeded in winning the approval of the private sector 
for his bold move, with the Union Costarricense de Camaras y Asociaciones de 
la Empresa Privada (Uccaep) saying that economic reactivation would be 
impossible as long as rumour and uncertainty gripped the country.

 Business approval increased when Figueres appointed the former president of 
the Camara de Industrias, Jose Leon Desanti, as economy minister on 4 July -
the last appointment to be announced. The President said he hoped the 
appointment would symbolise an alliance with the private sector to improve 
output and competitiveness.

 Desanti had been an outspoken critic of the government's lack of a coherent 
industrial policy, singling out tax increases and poor infrastructure for 
particular attention.

 The replacement of only three ministers was taken by the opposition to mean 
that new initiatives would be strictly limited, and public opinion seemed to 
be unimpressed: 80.9% told the Demoscopia polling firm that the changes were 
superficial.

 The disappointment extended to the ruling PLN: Walter Coto complained there 
had been no change of attitude or style in the government team. Lorena 
Vazquez, general secretary of the PUSC, said Figueres was guilty of a 
political swindle.

 They noted that Figueres had kept faith with his inner circle of friends 
and advisers: security minister Juan Diego Castro, censured last year by 
congress, had been moved to justice, while his replacement at security was 
former transport minister Bernardo Arce -a graduate, like Figueres, of West 
Point.

 Marcos Vargas, Figueres' campaign treasurer, was transferred from the 
economy ministry to the presidency, and another crony, Ricardo Garron, was 
given the agriculture portfolio. Garron used to manage the Figueres family 
estates.

 The most striking new appointment (see box) was that of Rodolfo Silva as 
transport minister, as a consolation for failing to get the comptroller-
general's job.

 POSTSCRIPT

 COSTA RICA/ Industrial decline. Costa Rica's manufacturing industry, after 
growing at 40% a year in the 1980s, is slowly being replaced by high-tech 
industries, which benefit from the country's skilled workforce and proximity 
to the US market. The textile industry, accounting for 70% of manufactures, 
has particularly suffered, being undercut in the US by duty-free Mexican 
textiles since Nafta came into force. The tourism sector is also in 
recession, with 70% of hotels expected to end this year with losses.

IMF agreement. The new finance minister, Francisco de Paula, travelled to 
Washington in early July to explain to IMF officials his government's 
failure to keep the fiscal deficit to 0.5% of GDP as agreed. The more 
realistic prediction of 2% was put down to external factors, despite the 
comptroller-general's report which condemned the government for its lack of 
fiscal discipline, especially the issuing of bonds well beyond the limits 
authorised by congress.

EL SALVADOR/ Prison protest. President Armando Calderon Sol announced 
several measures to tackle the growing prisons crisis, including the 
construction of a new penal centre. Seventy inmates of Santa Ana prison have 
been taken to hospital after a month-long hunger strike in protest at 
overcrowding, long sentences and slow judicial procedures. Almost 74% of the 
country's prison population still await sentencing, and prisons are at over 
double their capacity.

Death threats. The extreme-right Furoda (Fuerza Nacionalista Roberto 
D'Aubuisson), named after the alleged creator of the 'death squads', has 
reiterated its death threats to 15 prominent public figures. President 
Calderon Sol has denied any involvement of his Arena party, and has promised 
a thorough investigation. Meanwhile, two of the four students arrested in 
mid-June after bomb attacks on property belonging to former president 
Alfredo Cristiani have been released.

GUATEMALA/ Death penalty. Two men convicted of the rape and murder of a 
four-year-old girl in 1993 are to be sent to the gallows after the 
constitutional court turned down their appeal. President Alvaro Arzu's 
subsequent refusal to pardon Roberto Giron and Pedro Castillo has provoked 
consternation in human rights groups at what will be the first judicial 
execution in Guatemala for 13 years.

 Amnesty International deeply regretted 'this step backwards' and criticised 
Guatemala's contravening of the 1978 American Convention on Human Rights, 
which stipulated that the death penalty could not be extended to cover 
additional crimes. Last year however, kidnapping was added to the offences 
punishable by death, and following a police operation in June in which two 
gangs were arrested and charged with kidnapping, the interior minister, 
Rodolfo Mendoza, called for the death penalty to be applied as a deterrent.

Military exemption ends. A new law, passed unanimously by congress, has 
effectively ended a century of privilege for the military, who are now to be 
tried in the civilian courts for all but strictly military crimes.

 This assault on military impunity was followed by President Arzu's decision 
to remove six colonels and a general from their posts, as part of his 
continuing 'cleansing' of the armed forces. The next step is to be a three-
phase disbanding of the civilian self-defence patrols (PACs), a key element 
in the army's counter-insurgency strategy.

HONDURAS/ Corruption. A former minister and a labour leader were the latest 
figures of the Callejas administration (1990-1994) to be accused of 
corruption in President Roberto Reina's 'moral revolution' campaign. Former 
President Rafael Callejas, also accused in spite of his parliamentary 
impunity, complained of Reina's 'purely political persecution'.

 Meanwhile, a further 13 military officers, charged with murdering two 
civilians in 1982, are on the run, joining the three fugitive officers 
accused of human rights violations who are suspected of hiding out in Chile, 
the US or Spain for the past eight months.

Coffee rise. Coffee exports will have increased 30% by the end of this 
harvest-year to reach 2.8m bags, generating some US Dollars 300m, and 
confirming coffee as the country's main export. Other sectors are suffering 
from the economic crisis provoked by a US Dollars 4.1bn debt burden and a 
growing trade deficit.

NICARAGUA/ Tax reform. President Violeta Chamorro has asked the national 
assembly to approve the delayed tax reform law as soon as possible, to free 
US Dollars 115m in new credits from multilateral organisations that await 
passage of the reform.

 But public finances were further squeezed when a special commission of the 
assembly rejected the presidential veto on allocating 6% of the budget to 
the universities.

Delincuents clampdown. The Managua police are to launch a campaign to 
contain the growth of armed youth gangs in the capital over the last year. 
There are estimated to be around 66 bands in the city, with members ranging 
between the ages of 11 and 15, armed with firearms and knives. A significant 
number of the gangs' members appear to have recently returned from the 
United States. Four teenegers were killed at the end of June as a result of 
gang infighting. 

PANAMA/ Tax climbdown. The government looks set to reverse a decision to 
impose an additional income tax on businesses in the Colon free zone, 
following several managerial-level strikes. The free zone, which generates 
revenues of US Dollars 11bn from imports and re-exports, has seen a 21.3% 
drop in commercial activity over the past five months, reflecting the 
nationwide recession.

 However, the Panama Canal authorities are expecting record toll receipts 
this year, after last year's figures showed a 6.7% increase over 1994. A 
total of 13,631 ships paid US Dollars 462m.

Arms for guerrillas. Police confiscated 11 AK-47 assault rifles and 28,000 
ammunition cartridges from a Panamanian man en route to the port of Colon, 
from where the authorities believe the weapons were to be shipped to the 
Colombian Farc guerrillas.

REGION/ Military peace. The top brass from across Central America agreed at 
a Unesco-organised forum held in San Salvador at the of June to work towards 
building a stronger 'culture of peace' and to assist government efforts to 
insert the subregion into the global economy.

ITRI OPENS BERLIN OFFICE


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Bonn, Sept. 13 (CNA) The Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI),  Taiwan's  largest independent research institute, has set up
an  office  in  Berlin  in  a bid to expand exchanges and cooperation
between Taiwanese and German enterprises and academic bodies.

    ITRI  Vice  President  Chen  Ling-yuan made the announcement here
Thursday at a conference sponsored by ROC economic missions and trade
groups based in central Germany.

    In   line  with  the  government's  internationalization  policy,
domestic  research  institutes  also  need  to  establish strongholds
abroad  to boost international technology interflow with Taiwan, Chen
said,  pointing  out the ITRI has so far opened offices in the United
States, Japan and Russia.

    The initial target of the Berlin office, Chen said, is to upgrade
Taiwan-Germany  cooperation  in  machinery, and then expand bilateral
exchanges to optical-electric and energy sectors.

    The  ITRI  office  in  Silicon Valley in California is focused on
recruiting high-end electronics know-how, while its Russian office is
aimed at aerospace technology, he added.

TAIWAN-JAPAN JOINT VENTURE FORGED FOR MANUFACTURE OF CIRCUIT FOIL


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA) The state-run Taiwan Sugar Corp. Friday
sealed  a  joint-venture agreement with three Japanese enterprises to
build a circuit foil plant in Taiwan.

    The  plant, estimated to cost NT$2.25 billion (US$81.81 million),
is  scheduled  to  come on line before the end of 1997, with a yearly
output of 5,100 metric tons of circuit foil.

    The  production  facility will be located in the Toliu Industrial
Park, central Taiwan, occupying an area of 3.1 hectares. Construction
of  the  plant  is slated to begin in July. The investment project is
pending the final approval of the Economics Ministry.

    Taisugar  will  hold  a  45  percent  stake  in the joint-venture
project  while  Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd. will control a 25 percent
interest  and  Nichimen  Corp.  and  Circuit  Foil  Japan will own 20
percent and 10 percent, respectively.

    "The  design  of  the  plant and manufacturing technology will be
provided  by  Circuit  Foil Japan," Taisugar President Chien Pin-tsai
said,  adding  that  except  for  some  machines,  the  bulk  of  the
manufacturing equipment the plant needs is available in Taiwan.

    According  to Chien, Taiwan consumes about 25,000 tons of circuit
foil a year, 12,000 tons of which relies on import. Circuit foil is a
key  material  used in circuit boards and a wide range of electronics
products.

    Masaya  Imayi,  standing  board director of Furukawa Electric and
who  was  present  to ink the agreement, said the investment decision
was  prompted  by the booming development of the electronics industry
in Taiwan and elsewhere in the Asian region.

    "Taiwan is expected to play a pivotal role in Furukawa Electric's
global operation strategy," Imayi said.

    Furukawa  has been manufacturing and marketing circuit foil since
1961 and has emerged as the largest supplier of foil used in printing
circuit boards in Japan.

    Furukawa has NT$160 billion (US$5.81 billion) in annual revenues,
while  Nichimen,  one of the top eight trading firms in Japan, boasts
NT$2 trillion. Of the 10,000 tons of circuit foil Taiwan imports from
Japan each year, 50-70 percent is transacted through Nichimen.

TAICHUNG EPZ EXPORTS UP IN FIRST 8 MONTHS


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  The  Taichung  Export  Processing Zone
exported  US$536  million worth of products in the first eight months
of  this  year,  up from US$526 million in the same period last year,
according  to  statistics released Saturday by the EPZ Administration
under the Economics Ministry.

    The  zone  imported  US$287  million  worth  of materials between
January  and August, down from US$293 million in the same period last
year, the statistics showed.

    The  precision  machinery  industry  led  others  with exports of
US$265  million,  accounting  for  49.41  percent of the zone's total
outbound shipments.

    Electrical/electronics machinery manufacturing ranked second with
exports of US$216 million, or 40.42 percent of the total.

    Most  of  the zone's exports went to Japan, which absorbed US$253
million,  or  47.21 percent, of the zone's total exports, followed by
Hong  Kong  with  US$104  million,  or  19.56 percent, the statistics
showed.

    Japan also was the leading source of imports. Taichung EPZ bought
in  US$228  million  worth  of  goods  from  Japan in the eight-month
period, accounting for 79.42 percent of total imports in the zone.

    A  total  of 45 enterprises were operating in the Taichung Export
Processing  Zone  at  the  end  of August, with cumulative investment
topping US$221 million, EPZ Administration officials said.

    Booming  exports  and  imports in the zone indicate manufacturers
have   full   confidence  in  the  zone,  which  is  developing  high
technology, high quality, high value-added products.

LOUISIANA HOPES TO RESUME CROCODILE MEAT EXPORTS TO TAIWAN


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Houston,  Sept.  13  (CNA)  The  Louisiana state government hopes
Louisiana  can  resume  exports  of  crocodile  meat  to  Taiwan, Roy
Johnson, director of market development under the state's Agriculture
and Forestry Department, said Friday.

    Johnson said Taiwan once imported 10 containers of crocodile meat
from  the  United States in 1992, but the meat was banned from import
in 1993 because of wildlife protection issues.

    He  said  crocodile meat produced in the US comes from farms that
also raise chickens and cows, so the crocodile meat, like chicken and
beef, has nothing to do with wildlife protection.

    Hong Kong, Britain, Belgium, and Germany also import US crocodile
meat,  while  South  Korea,  Hong  Kong, Singapore, Italy, and France
import crocodile leather.

    American  businessmen  once  tried  to  export  crocodile meat to
Shanghai, but the deal fell through because of price differences.

    Resumption  of  crocodile meat exports to Taiwan was raised while
Lin  Yung-loh,  director-general  of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Boston, was visiting Louisiana.

'NEW TAIWAN EXPERIENCE ERA' HAS BEGUN, SAYS LEE


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept. 14 (CNA) President Lee Teng-hui said Saturday that
a  "new  Taiwan  experience  era"  began  when  the Republic of China
completed  the  first popular presidential election in 5,000 years of
Chinese history in March.

    The pivotal task for Taiwan now is to ensure a solid existence of
the  Republic of China in the face of a volatile future, Lee said. To
reach  that  goal,  he noted, "We must stabilize society, broaden our
international   horizons,  and  accelerate  exchanges  with  mainland
China."

    Addressing  the  Third  National  Management  Forum  which opened
Thursday  at the Grand Hyatt Taipei, Lee called on the Taiwan public,
particularly  the  business  sector  to  "avoid  jumping  the gun and
exercise  patience"  in the face of a renewed economic offensive from
mainland China.

    Lee  said Beijing has recently stepped up its economic offensive,
a  strategy designed to gain political aims through commercial means.
While luring Taiwan civilians and businessmen to press the government
to adopt policies in its favor, Beijing is also trying to agitate the
society of Taiwan, he pointed out.

    Lee  told the forum, which pulled together more than 400 business
and industrial leaders of the country, that the government will spare
no effort to improve Taiwan's investment climate.

    He said he will ask related government agencies to see to it that
all   investment   barriers,   including   the   difficulty  in  land
acquisition,  are  addressed within six months to expedite investment
here at home. A special desk will be established soon exclusively for
handling land-related problems, and the processing for each case will
be handled in no longer than two months, Lee promised.

    Outdated  and  inefficient regulations must go to create a better
investment  environment,  he  added.  Taking Japan as an example, Lee
said  that  despite  government's  efforts to cut interest rates, the
Japanese  economy  has not been able to break out of its recession in
seven  or  eight years because superannuated regulations and statutes
there have blocked the way and choked off investment willingness.

    During  the  three-day  forum,  Taiwan's  business and industrial
leaders  expressed  confidence  in the country's future and agreed to
pitch  in  more  than NT$100 billion (US$3.6 billion) in the next two
years for investment projects on the island.

TAIWAN 'KAMIKAZE SQUAD' VOWS TO BLOW UP DISPUTED LIGHTHOUSE


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  Six men with criminal records Saturday
formed  a  death  squad  and  pledged  to destroy the lighthouse they
claimed  was  erected illegally by a Japanese right-wing group on one
of the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands.

    The  six  men,  all of which received diving and bombing training
when  they  served  in  the  army,  met  the  press and displayed the
testament they signed.

    The  group  guaranteed  they  would  blow  up  the  solar-powered
lighthouse  set  up  on one of the Tiaoyutais in the middle of May by
the Japan Youth Federation.

    The uninhabitated islands, known as the Senkakus in Japan, lie in
the  East  China Sea about 200 kilometers northeast of Taiwan and 300
kilometers west of Japan's Okinawa Island. Taiwan, mainland China and
Japan all lay sovereignty claims over the islands.

    "Should  any  one  of  them  die of natural disaster or any other
reason  on  their  voyage  to  the  Tiaoyutais,  their families would
receive  NT$600,000  each,"  said  Tung Nien-tai, head of a center to
provide  services  to  former  inmates.  Tung said he would raise the
money from the public, if needed.

    The  blitz  plans  are  underway,  Tung  said,  adding  that  the
operation would be launched soon.

    Tung said that under his draft plans, the group would swim ashore
after  being  brought  by a boat to waters about a nautical mile from
the lighthouse.

    No government officials were immediately available for comment.

    Saturday's  announcement  came  as the international dispute over
the  Tiaoyutais  was  escalating.  After  the  lighthouse was set up,
another  Japanese  ultra-right  group,  the  Senkaku  Islands Defense
Association, in mid-August planted a wooden Japanese flag and erected
a war memorial on the largest of the islands.

    The  provocative moves  have  triggered  a  strong  response from
Chinese  communities  in the United States, mainland China, Hong Kong
and  Taiwan.  While  some  groups  protested  to  Japanese government
officials stationed in their area, others have called for an alliance
of  the Chinese throughout the world to stand tough against what they
called a "Japanese invasion" of Chinese territory.

    In  Taipei,  the  government  of the Republic of China, saying it
wants  to  settle  the  dispute with Japan peacefully, has repeatedly
urged  the  Japanese  government  to  restrain its people from taking
further provocative actions.

NO CONSENSUS IN US-TAIWAN MEDICAL EQUIPMENT CONSULTATIONS


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  While Taiwan has just been told by the
United  States  that  it  will  be  removed  from  the  "Special 301"
blacklist  for  having achieved satisfactory progress in intellectual
property  rights  (IPR)  protection,  it may face a fresh threat from
Washington over its new medical equipment pricing policy.

    No  consensus was reached Saturday in a US-Taiwan consultation on
Taiwan's pricing policy for medical equipment, and whether Washington
will  list  Taiwan  under  its  "Super  301" bill for trade sanctions
remains to be seen.

    David  Burns,  chief officer in charge of Asia-Pacific affairs at
the  office  of  the  US Trade Representative (USTR), on Saturday met
with  officials  from the Department of Health (DOH) and the National
Health  Insurance  Bureau (NHIB) on NHIB's pricing policy for medical
equipment and related products.

    The  two  parties  failed  to reach any consensus, and decided to
meet again on Monday for another round of talks.

    The  USTR  office  was  reported earlier this week to have listed
Taiwan  as a "priority country" under its annual "Super 301" bill for
trade   sanctions   after   the   US  Health  Industry  Manufacturers
Association filed an accusation saying Taiwan's new medical equipment
pricing policy is "non-transparent and discriminates against American
suppliers."

    Burns   said  Taiwan's  implementation  of  the  national  health
insurance  program  is  highly  commendable.  But it takes effort and
expertise  to  ensure  the  public's  access  to quality medicine and
medical  equipment.  He  said  American  medical equipment comes with
quality,  and  Taiwanese  patients  have  the  right  to  use quality
products.

    USTR  officials will continue to exchange views with DOH and NHIB
officials  in  the  next two weeks on the pricing policy, Burns said,
adding  that  his office will not make any decision until Sept. 30 on
whether to recommend a "Super 301" listing for retaliation.

    Yeh Chin-chuan, general manager of the NHIB, said the new medical
equipment  pricing  policy  is consistent with the national treatment
principle  set by the World Trade Organization, as it applies to both
local and foreign suppliers.

    Foreign  suppliers  can  file  their complaints to Taiwan if they
want  to  challenge  the  policy, and the NHIB will review the policy
periodically, Yeh added.

    Yeh  hoped  that all misunderstandings will be solved in the next
round of talks on Monday. If not, he said, NHIB officials will travel
to the United States later this month for further talks.

CHANG ASKS JAPAN TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT IN TERRITORIAL DISPUTE


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  Foreign Affairs Minister John Chang on
Saturday  reiterated  his  call  for  Japan  to exercise restraint in
handling  the  territorial dispute over the Tiaoyutai Islands, or the
Senkakus to the Japanese.

    Chang,  however,  would  not  comment  on the report that Beijing
authorities,   faced  with  mounting  pressure  from  its  people  to
safeguard  the  Tiaoyutai Islands, have asked activists to cool their
activity.

    Chang made the remarks after attending a reception in celebration
of  the  175th  Independence  Anniversary  of  the  five countries in
Central America.

    Vice  Foreign  Affairs  Minister  Cheng  Chien-jen  said  the ROC
government's position on the issue is crystal clear. "The ROC insists
on  sovereignty  over  the islands, but is hoping to settle the issue
through  peaceful means and is not planning to cooperate with Beijing
on the matter."

    Observers  from  here  and  abroad have urged Taipei and Beijing,
which  are  still  technically at war since 1949, to work together in
negotiating with Japan.

    The  Tiaoyutais  lie  in  the East China Sea about 200 kilometers
northeast  of  Taiwan  and  300  kilometers  west  of Japan's Okinawa
Island.  Taipei,  Beijing  and  Tokyo  all claim sovereignty over the
uninhabitated islands.

    Chang  also  declined  to  comment on  the  report  that  a local
rightest  organization  is  planning to send a death squad to blow up
the  lighthouse erected by a Japanese group on one of the islands. "I
have no knowledge of the report," Chang said.

    Cheng  said  he  could understand the patriotism some people have
toward  the  country,  but  he  stressed  that calmness is definitely
needed to settle the issue.

    He  also  urged the public to have faith in the government. "From
the  government's  point of view, the priority we always have in mind
is what is in the best interests of the country and people."

    Cheng said Tokyo is expected to propose a date for a second round
of  talks  on a fisheries agreement. The two sides held a closed-door
meeting in Taipei on Aug. 3., but did not arrive at an agreement.

5 CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES CELEBRATE INDEPENDENCE DAY


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  Five Central American countries held a
cocktail party and opened a painting exhibition in Taipei Saturday to
celebrate the 175th anniversary of their nations' independence.

    Many  ROC  government  officials  and foreign envoys attended the
celebration activities sponsored by El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua,
Costa Rica, and Guatemala.

    ROC  Foreign  Minister  John  Chang said at the party that Taiwan
shares  close  and  friendly relations with the five Central American
countries,  and ROC President Lee Teng-hui will visit Central America
next year.

    Despite  difficulties each of the Central American countries have
faced,  their  pursuit  of  democracy  and constitutional politics is
admired around the world, Chang said.

    Chang  said  the ROC and its diplomatic allies in Central America
have  the  same  political  ideals  and goal of peace, adding that he
hopes  freedom,  democracy, and equitable distribution of wealth will
arrive as early as possible.

    The  painting  exhibition,  which  featured  100  works by modern
painters  from  Central  America,  as  well as 29 masterpieces from a
Costa  Rican  museum,  will  help  boost  cultural interflows between
Taiwan  and the five countries. The art show is being held at the Sun
Yat-sen Memorial Hall Sept. 14-25.

    Also  present  at  the  party  were  Control  Yuan President Wang
Tso-jung, Deputy Secretary-General to the President Chen Hsi-fan, and
art figures from home and abroad.

China: Paris symposium to look at China"s policy on foreign investment

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

A symposium on China's foreign investment policy, sponsored by the
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC),
opened in Paris on Monday.

Chen Xinhua, deputy minister of MOFTEC, briefed French participants on
the economic situation and foreign investment in China in his keynote
speech at the opening ceremony.

"Foreign funded enterprises have actually invested a total of 155
billion U.S. dollars in China and the majority of joint ventures and
solely foreign funded enterprises are well managed," Chen said.

With the continuous growth of Sino-French economic and trade relations
in recent years, France had become the fourth largest European investor
in China, he said.

Yves Galland, minister delegate to the French Ministry of Economy and
Finance in charge of finance and foreign trade, said developing
relations with China was a priority of the French government.

France was determined to seize the "huge opportunity" of the Chinese
market, he said.

France encouraged its businessmen to invest in China, because China had
created sound conditions for foreign investment, he said. He noted that
China had brought inflation under control while ensuring the continuous
and fast expansion of the economy.

Galland said China's foreign currency reserves and the purchasing power
of its consumers were quickly increasing.

He hoped the Chinese side would do a better job in helping foreign
enterprises obtain more accurate market information in China and learn
more about the Chinese laws and regulations.

More than 170 delegates from China's provinces attended the symposium.
They brought with them a long list of 640 projects that are open to
foreign investment.

China: Hi-tech industry leads in Yantai"s economy: official

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Hi-tech industry in China's port city Yantai has become a leader in the
local economy, a government official there said recently.

Yantai, in east China's Shandong Province, has established 406
enterprises that develop or manufacture hi-tech products, accounting
for a quarter of the city's total.

Hi-tech enterprises generated a total output value of 6.2 billion yuan
(about 747 million US dollars) and 1.6 billion yuan ($192 million) in
taxes and profits last year.

In recent years, Yantai has implemented the strategy of "invigorating
the city's economy through science and technology," and has given
favorable treatment to hi-tech enterprises in land use, funding, power
supply and intelligence.

Large state-owned enterprises have pioneered the development of hi-tech
industries. The city has selected 100 enterprises to upgrade
traditional industries and old products.

The Yantai Wanhua Synthetic Leather Group Company has broken the
monopoly of foreign technology in the development of high-grade
imitation synthetic leather.

By keeping up-to-date with the latest global developments in
technology, the Polaris Clock Corporation has become the largest clock
company in China.

Technology-intensive joint ventures have also sprung up in the city.
Most of the 150 projects boast state-of-the-art technology, the
official said.

Yantai presently has one of the four largest manufacturing bases of
transparent electric conduction glass in the world, which was formed in
cooperation with an American company.

By cooperating with another US company, the city has produced a special
sealing gum, which satisfies 90 per cent of the demand of the country's
market.

Yantai has also cooperated with a Japanese company for the production
of automobile air conditioners. The city also joined hands with a
company from the Republic of Korea to make excavators, a project that
is expected to generate an output value of one billion US dollars
annually.

Township enterprises also play an active role in the development of
hi-tech products. Household appliances developed by the Hongxiang
Company sells well in the overseas market. Last year, the company
turned out a production volume of 1.3 billion yuan ($156 million).  And
Zhichu Group, a village-run company, has developed 28 hi-tech products.

The city has set up 450 hi-tech industries, covering the fields of
electronic information, integration of machinery and electronics, new
materials, bio-engineering, mechanics, medicine, and household
appliances.

Shanghai to develop environmental protection into a pillar sector

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

As Shanghai tries to simultaneously improve its economy and
environment, experts in both fields predict that the environmental
protection industry will become one of the city's pillar sectors early
next century.

The Shanghai Municipal Government is encouraging big State-owned
enterprises to enter this market, which has been expanding due to the
launching of many large environmental projects, such as the sewage
treatment and water diversion project on the Yangtze River, a report by
the local Business News said.

During the Ninth Five Year Plan (1996-2000) period, Shanghai's
investment in environmental protection will total 48 billion yuan ($5.8
billion). Investment in the field in the whole country will be 189
billion yuan ($23 billion), according to the report.

In contrast to the market's potential, Shanghai's environmental
protection industry is relatively underdeveloped.

There are about 600 firms in the field, employing 40,000 people, and
industrial output last year was 1.5 billion yuan ($180 million),
according to the Shanghai Bureau of Environmental Protection.

Market enthusiasm is on the rise. Multinational companies, as well as
firms in other provinces in China, are planning to enter the Shanghai
market, and local companies, not willing to be left behind, are also
considering investment options.

Shanghai Environmental Protection Machinery & Engineering Co is one of
them.

The company's core business, Shanghai Metallurgical & Mine Machinery
Plant, is one of the earliest firms in China to produce environmental
protection machinery for dust cleaning, desulfurization, water and
garbage treatment.

The company has acquired long term, interest-free loans from the
overseas capital market and a 70-million-yuan ($8.4 million) loan from
Chinese banks for expansion, the report said.

China: Shenzhen to separate government organs from market agencies

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

All market go-between organizations in special economic zone Shenzhen,
are to be separated from government institutions in a campaign to
rectify market order.

Also as part of the effort government employees will not be allowed to
be involved as market agents.

As a pioneer for China's socialist market economy, Shenzhen
neighbouring Hong Kong, now boasts over 3,300 market go-between
organizations, employing over 35,000 people, latest statistics show.

While playing an increasingly important role in bridging ties between
the market with enterprises and the government, problems have been
found among as well as the malpractice of taking advantage of
government ties, resulting in unfair competition.

In its determination to maintain market order, the municipal government
has decided to carry out an over-all check on the go-between market,
covering job introductions, real estate dealing, assets assessment, and
law firms.

Existing relevant rules and regulations will also be subject to
re-examination.

China: FM spokesman warns Japan not to cause ""new incident""

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Japan should understand that the Chinese people's determination to
defend China's State sovereignty and territorial integrity is
unshakable, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday in Beijing.

Spokesman Shen Guofang warned Japan to be fully aware of the
seriousness of the matter and not to provoke any new incidents.

His remarks came in response to the report that Japanese coast guard
and police vessels expelled Hong Kong vessels which tried to approach
the Diaoyu Islands.

Japan has created disturbances continuously on the Diaoyu Islands
issue, seriously infringing upon China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, Shen said.

This of course arouses strong indignation among the entire Chinese
people, including compatriots of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, he said.

When asked to comment on Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda's
claim at the UN General Assembly of the United Nations that the islands
are Japan's territory, Shen said that China's position on this issue
has never changed.

It is indisputable that the Diaoyu Islands and its adjacent islands are
an inalienable part of China, he said.

He urged Japan to take steps to stop activities which infringe on
China's sovereignty and said that Japan is responsible to make sure
that no new incidents will take place.

Referring to Australian Prime Minister John Howard's upcoming meeting
with the Dalai Lama on coming Thursday, Shen reiterated that this
constitutes an interference into China's internal affairs.

Whatever the outcome, a shadow will surely be casted over bilateral
relations, Shen said.

China has made many representations with the Australian government and
hopes that it will take a correct attitude, he said.

Commenting on the report that Taiwanese leader Lee Teng-hui has asked
to hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Shen said
Asian-Pacific countries have conducted fruitful dialogues on security
issues, which can only be held among sovereignty countries.

Taiwan, which is part of China, is not at all qualified to take part in
such activities, Shen said.

Also at the briefing, Shen said that, looking back at history, the
country which had constituted a threat to the Asia-Pacific region was
none other than Japan.

"Peace in the Asia-Pacific region should be maintained by this region's
countries and peoples," Shen said.

These remarks were made when Shen was asked to comment on the
US-Japanese security communique released last week.

He said if this agreement, which is a bilateral arrangement, exceeds
bilateral range and is aimed against a third country or involves other
countries' interests, complications will result in the development of
the matter.

He expressed the hope that Japan will have a clear understanding of the
issue.

China welcomes US investors and traders: Vice Premier

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing yesterday told the Illinois State Trade
Delegation, headed by Governor Jim Edgar, that China welcomes American
companies to invest in the country and conduct trade here.

China welcomes investment in China from big businesses, such as
Motorola, as well as cooperation with small and medium-sized
enterprises, Li said in a meeting yesterday afternoon with the group.

According to Li, the economies of China and the US are complementary,
and show great potential for economic cooperation.

He said he hopes the two sides will work more closely with each other
to fully explore their opportunities.

The vice-premier stressed that only when the two countries respect
dissimilarities in each other's culture and history can cooperation be
effective.

Edgar echoed Li's views by saying that differences in political
opinions should not influence economic cooperation. In fact, he said,
the establishment of stronger trade ties between US and China might
help solve political issues.

Li also briefed the US guests on China's major areas for foreign
investment. He said he believes that the forthcoming visit by Wu Yi,
minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, to the Unites
States will enhance trade ties between the two countries.

China: Song Jian emphasizes on environmental protection

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Environmental protection is the key to sustainable development, said
State Councillor Song Jian in Beijing Tuesday.

Speaking at the fifth meeting of the China Council for International
Cooperation on Environment and Development, Song said China, as a
developing country, is always burdened with economic development and
environmental protection issues.

In order to realize the sustained, rapid and healthy development of the
national economy, China should solve both the environmental pollution
problems that have been left over from past, as well as the new
environmental problems that crop up in the process of development.

The council is a non-governmental advisory body consisting of Chinese
government officials, internationally-recognized figures, high-ranking
foreign officials, noted experts and professors. Suggestions made by
the council have been well received by the Chinese government.

Song said that people have reached a common understanding of the
importance of sustainable development, and that planning of economic
development must be done in connection with population, resources and
environment.

He said that China has made significant progress in the protection of
environment, but the country's environmental situation is still grim:
environmental pollution, especially in cities, continues to be
aggravating, and the areas suffering from ecological destruction are
expanding.

In some areas, environmental pollution and ecological damage have
obstructed the healthy development of the economy, and even pose direct
threats to people's health, he added.

Song said that at present, environmental protection should focus on
dealing with the comprehensive relationship between environment and
development, legal construction, expanding financial resources,
increasing input, using science and technology, expanding international
cooperation and implementing international conventions on environment.

China among 1st to sign Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

China was among the first countries to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) at the United Nations headquarters this morning.

Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, representing
China, signed the treaty.

Also among the first group to sign the treaty were the United States,
France, Russia and Britain.

U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in a key note speech
before the signing of the treaty that it was "a major milestone" that
has been reached on the road to making the world a safer and more
secure place for generations to come.

In a statement on the occasion, the Chinese government declared that
China has all along stood for the complete prohibition and thorough
destruction of nuclear weapons and the realization of a
nuclear-weapon-free world.

The statement said that it is in favor of a comprehensive ban on
nuclear weapon test explosions in the process towards this objective.
The Chinese government is deeply convinced that the CTBT will
facilitate nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, it added.

Therefore, it said, "China supports the conclusion, through
negotiation, of a fair, reasonable and verifiable treaty with universal
adherence and unlimited duration and is ready to take active measures
to promote its ratification and entry into force."

Meanwhile, the Chinese government appealed that major nuclear weapon
states should abandon their policy of nuclear deterrence. States with
huge arsenals should continue to drastically reduce their nuclear
stockpiles, it said.

The statement said, "All countries that have deployed nuclear weapons
on foreign soil should withdraw all of them to their own land. All
nuclear weapon states should undertake not to be the first to use
nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstance, commit
themselves unconditionally to the non-use or threat of use of nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones,
and conclude, at an early date, international legal instruments to this
effect."

China called on all nuclear weapon states to pledge their support to
proposals for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, respect
their status as such and undertake corresponding obligations.

The statement said no country should develop or deploy space weapon
systems or missile defense systems undermining strategic security and
stability.

And an international convention on the complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons should be concluded through
negotiations, it added.

The statement said that the Chinese government endorses the application
of verification measures consistent with the provisions of the CTBT to
ensure its faithful implementation and at the same time it firmly
opposes the abuse of verification rights by any country, including the
use of espionage or human intelligence, to infringe upon the
sovereignty of other countries and impair their legitimate security
interests in violation of universally recognized principles of
international law.

It said that in the present day world where huge nuclear arsenals and
nuclear deterrence policy based on the first use of nuclear weapons
still exist, the supreme national interests of China demand that it
ensure the safety, reliability and effectiveness of its nuclear weapons
before the goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons is achieved.

China: High-tech code system developed to combat fake goods

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

A high-tech system that uses secret codes to combat fake goods in China
is to go national after a successful trial operation.

The system, invented by Chinese experts, uses a telephone network and
electronic codes to identify genuine articles. A national work
conference held in Haikou of Hainan Province to discuss the system has
been told it is to be spread nationwide after been proved successful.

Its trial operation in parts of the country since January this year
received positive response from users.

China Anti-Fakes Association is entrusted by the State Bureau of
Technical Supervision to popularize it throughout the country.

Hainan Tenglong Anti-Fake Technology Company, which is based in Haikou,
capital of Hainan in South China, is responsible for implementing the
project.

The system, based on computerized data banks and the national
computerized telephone information retrieval network, will provide
manufacturers of quality products with special data codes and secret
codes.

Commodity dealers or buyers can check up the goods they have purchased
by telephone, after tearing off the cover on the codes.

Since it is a hi-tech system, it is impossible for anyone to produce
fake codes, according to experts.

The Hainan-based company has invested 40 million yuan ($4.8 million) to
set up a data bank capable of holding 50 billion different electronic
codes. Terminals will be built in major cities across the country.

Some experts say the network will help protect quality and brand-famed
products in the country.

China: Nujiang River Canyon gains growing popularity among tourists

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

China's Nujiang River Canyon, known as the "Grand Canyon of the Orient"
 has become a hot tourist attraction as increasing travelers and
adventurers swarm in.

Located in the west of Yunnan Province, southwest China, the Nujiang
River Canyon is grand and steep because of the swift Nujiang River, the
perilous Biluo Mountain and the Gaoligong Mountain on each bank of the
river.

The Yunnan section of the Nujiang River Canyon is 621 kilometers long
and 3,000 meters deep, as compared with the Grand Canyon in Colorado
which is 440 kilometers long and 1,839 meters deep.

Tourists visiting the Nujiang Grand Canyon can not only see the canyon
itself, but can also be exposed to the rich ethnic culture and folklore
of the local Lisu, Bai, Nu, Dulong, Jingpo and Tibetan ethnic groups.

The primeval forests, waterfalls and rivers are also tourist
highlights.

Thanks to modern highways, it takes 10 hours for tourists to get to the
canyon from Kunming, the provincial capital.

Last year, over 194,000 Chinese and overseas tourists visited the
canyon.

Shanghai to import German escalators for Metro Line No. 2

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Shanghai Metro Corp and a German firm have agreed to import 120
escalators for the first phase of the city's Metro Line No 2, which is
scheduled to be completed in 1999.

The 120 computer-controlled heavy-duty escalators cost 24.5 million
Deutsche marks ($16 million) and will be designed and manufactured by
Otis Escalator Factory in Stadthagen, Germany.

These escalators will be installed by Shanghai Otis Elevator Corp in 10
subway stations -- four West Shanghai and six in Pudong (East
Shanghai), said an official from the company.

The 3-year-old Shanghai Otis has installed numerous state-of-the-art,
computer-controlled elevators in major projects throughout Shanghai,
including the Oriental Pearl TV Tower.

The escalators for the Metro project will begin arriving in April, the
official said.

Germany will also provide four escalators for the extension of Metro
Line No 1 from Jinjiang Amusement Park to Xinzhuang.

The extension will open at the end of the year, said Chen Mingtu, chief
of the Foreign Economic Division under Shanghai Metro Co.

This is the second project by Otis for Shanghai metros, the Otis
official said, adding that Otis installed 48 heavy-duty escalators for
Metro Line No 1.

Chen said the metro company will soon sign a contract with the United
States to import subway ticket machines worth $24 million. The machines
will be installed on Metro Lines No 1 and No 2.

The city borrowed $50 million from the United States Government to
import subway ticket machines, signal and anti-fire systems.

The city also will import 210 carriages. Most will be for the first
phase of the second subway, and 16 will be used on Metro Line No 1 to
increase the frequency of train trips from every seven minutes to every
five minutes.

China: Ministry to help upgrade machine plants in northeast China

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

China's Ministry of Machinery plans to finance the technological
upgrading projects of major machine-building plants in northeast of the
country.

The aim is to boost the growth of an important sector that employs a
quarter of all the area's workers.

The companies to receive government assistance will include
manufacturers of power generation, transformers and transmission
facilities, lathe-builders and suppliers of important fittings and
parts in the bearing industry.

The funding will also be granted to manufacturers of light and heavy
automotives, according to Deputy Minister Sun Changji, who was recently
interviewed by reporter in Liaoning coastal city Dalian.

According to the official, 104 such projects have been approved by the
ministry, involving a total investment of 5.3 billion yuan ($630
million).

The northeastern region normally covers Heilongjiang, Jilin and
Liaoning, as well as the eastern part of Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region. The area is an old industrial base of the country.

The machinery industry makes up 25.73 percent of the region's total
industrial production value.

The ministry has urged the machinery sector in the northeast to carry
out managerial reforms to revive the old industrial base.

China: Qian Qichen urges EU to support China"s entry into WTO

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qicheng Monday urged the
European Union to take more active steps to support China's efforts in
entering the World Trade Organization.

He made this remark during his meeting with his counterpart of the
European Union in New York.

Qian pointed out that in recent years the overall relationship between
China and EU is developing in a good direction.

He said China values the important role the EU and its members are
playing in the international affairs and wishes to develop friendly and
co-operative relationship with them.

On economic and trade relations, Qian said there is great potential for
development since the two sides are economically complementary.

He said China will continue the process of opening up to the outside
world and liberalizing its trade practices.

He called upon the EU countries to take more positive steps in
eliminating protective trade barriers against Chinese products and to
take positive and concrete measures on the questions of China's entry
into the World Trade Organization.

Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, the current EU president, told Qian
that EU is determined in pursuing the long-term policy of developing
strategic relationship with China.

Noting the dialogue between China and EU has already had a good
beginning, Dick said that the EU is willing to continue such a dialogue
so as to enhance understanding and reduce differences.

Spring told Qian that the EU supports China's entry into the World
Trade Organization, hoping the question can be solved on an equal and
just base.

On the human rights issue, Qian reaffirmed China's consistent policy
that is to carry out dialogues with other countries on the basis of
equality and mutual respect.

China believes that dialogues and confrontation cannot be mixed
together. If any country wishes to seek dialogues with China, it should
discard the stance of confrontation, he added.

On behalf of the European Union, Hans Van Mierlo expressed his
gratitude for the flexibility and constructive spirit China had
demonstrated in the negotiations for settling the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT). He said China had made important contribution to the
successful adoption of the treaty earlier this months.

The Chinese vice-premier said that China had been actively involved in
the CTBT negotiations, holding that it would be the first step taken
toward the final target of a comprehensive ban and complete destruction
of nuclear weapons. He said the international community should continue
its efforts in this regard.

China: No 1 Department Store wins top int"l laurels

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Shanghai No 1 Department Store, one of the most prestigious department
stores in the city, has become the first retailer in the country to win
the ISO9002, an international award for management and service.

The International Standard Organization gives the certificate to
businesses which it considers are among the best in the world.

``As Shanghai opens its retail markets, the competition grows keener.
The advent of foreign retailers has put our traditional management and
service under challenge,'' Zhang Yinqi, general manager of the store
said at the award ceremony held recently.

``Although we are experienced in the retail sector, we are in need of
modernization. So we decided to commit ourselves to setting up a
quality management and guarantee system in line with international
standards,'' said Zhang.

Founded in October 1949, the Shanghai No 1 Department Store is one of
the leaders in the world of commerce in China. Its seven-story shopping
facility at a premier location on bustling Nanjing Road, along with a
number of branch stores in and out of the city, chalked up sales of
2.33 billion yuan ($280.7 million) and a profit of 123 million yuan
($14.8 million) in 1995. For 11 years in a row, it was the country's
busiest store in terms of sales.

For the first half of 1996, it registered sales of 1.22 billion yuan
($147 million), up 12.9 per cent over a year earlier.

The preparation for ISO9002 accreditation was initiated in December
1994 at the store. The store got all of its senior and middle-level
staff re-trained and worked out a series of quality management
regulations.

According to Zhang, customers shopping at the No 1 Department Store are
guaranteed with satisfaction. One area where the store should win good
response is its policy of offering refunds or exchanges on bought
goods.

``Rather than resting on its laurels, the No 1 Department Store will
seek further expansion and make itself a world-famous shopping
paradise.'' Zhang said.

China: 50 reporters granted awards for fighting copyright piracy

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

China's State Copyright Administration yesterday rewarded 50 reporters
who have helped fight copyright piracy over the past few years.

The reporters work for Xinhua News Agency, "The People's Daily", China
Central Television, and many other news organizations throughout the
country.

"Mass media is playing a major role in promoting people's awareness of
copyright protection," said Yu Youxian, director of the administration.

He said that the Chinese media has published tens of thousands of
stories to demonstrate the significance of copyright protection and
spread information in this regard.

Many people reported copyright cases to the authorities after reading
newspapers, according to Shen Rengan, deputy director of the
administration. He added that it was unusual for a country to mobilize
all its public sectors, including the media, to engage in the fight
against copyright piracy.

Yu Youxian explained that the improvement of people's legal sense by
making use of the media has become a basic guarantee to implement the
copyright law.

The prize-winning stories themselves are a showcase that China has
achieved great progress in protecting copyright, he noted.

He cited some articles, including one describing how farmers become
familiar with the copyright law, one about the Walt Disney's case in
Beijing, and another on copyright protection in a fast food restaurant.

Some reporters lashed the US for its unfair charge that China violated
foreign copyrights. One journalist even told a story about a senior
Chinese copyright official whose works were pirated in the US without
authorization.

China: Shanxi plans to harness half of its soil erosion by year 2000

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

North China's Shanxi Province plans to harness 50 per cent of its soil
erosion area by the year 2000.

Thanks to years of efforts to harness the Loess Plateau, Shanxi has so
far contained 51 million mu (3.06 million hectares), or 32 per cent of
its total eroded area.

Shanxi, located near the middle reaches of the Yellow River, occupies a
large part of the Loess Plateau. Soil erosion area accounts for 70 per
cent of its total 156,000 square kilometer of ground.

In the late 1970s, the annual amount of sand washed into the Yellow
River stood at 366 million tons -- one-fourth of the river's total.

A large-scale campaign to harness the Loess Plateau first began in the
1980s. Over the following several years, 350,000 local rural households
participated in the drive.

By planting grass, trees and crops, and building dams and terraced
farmland, the residents revived hundreds of thousands of barren
gullies.

Meanwhile, the central government and the Shanxi provincial government
also worked to prevent the spread of erosion in the Loess Plateau.

The central government has invested 75 million yuan to tackle erosion
of the banks of the Sanchuan River and Yongding River, two large rivers
on the plateau. Eroded areas which have been controlled there account
for 40 percent of the total drainage area of the two rivers.

A total of 150 million yuan ($18 million) has been used in harnessing
the upper reaches of the Fenhe River, the second largest tributary of
the Yellow River.

Erosion-harnessing projects were carried out on an area of 1.95 million
mu (117,000 hectares) there. In the region, grain output increased by
50 percent, farmers' income rose two-fold, and the volume of sand which
washed into reservoirs was reduced by 49 per cent.

China: Multi-billion yuan petrochemical project planned for Qaidam Basin

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. n 1996

China is to build a 4.3 billion yuan ($510 million) petrochemical
project in the Qaidam Basin, Northwest China's Qinghai Province.

This was disclosed by Zhou Yongkang, deputy general manager of the
China National Petroleum Corporation.

Zhou explained that during the current Ninth Five-Year Plan Period
(1996-2000), the country will carry out large-scale exploitation of the
natural gas reserves in the Qaidam Basin. The construction of the
project is aimed at promoting the economic development of the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

He added that according to an initial plan, the project will have a
designed annual production capacity of 120,000 tons of polyvinyl
chloride, 100,000 tons of caustic soda, 200,000 tons of synthetic
ammonia and 350,000 tons of urea.

Zhou said that the project had already passed assessment and appraisal
from China International Consultancy Company, and his corporation has
been negotiating over the investment possibility with US company, Amoco
Petroleum.

Qaidam Basin has an area of 240,000 square kilometers, equivalent to
the size of Great Britain, and it is also one of China's four major
basins.

China has discovered 22 oilfields in the Qaidam Basin after more than
four decades of prospecting.  Of the 22 oilfields, six fields, with
combined natural gas reserves of 54.1 billion cubic meters, boast sound
conditions for full-scale development.

In another development, the installation of a 189 km pipeline from
Sebei Oilfield to Golmud City, also located in the basin, which will
form part of the new petrochemical project, has just been finished.

A 16,000-kilowattt power station using natural gas as fuel has also
been built.

Beijing plans expansion of overseas labor service

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Beijing plans to send thousands of experts and skilled people to other
countries as part of a 15-year plan to boost its share of overseas
contracts.

The city has announced an expansion of its overseas labor services and
construction co-operation, with an increase of 10 to 15 per cent
annually, a top municipal official said.

He said by the year 2000, the total turnover of overseas labor services
is expected to reach up to $600 million US dollars, and by $1.4 billion
US dollars by the year 2010.

A number of effective measures are to be taken to achieve the goal,
said Yi Xiqun, director of the Beijing Municipal Foreign Trade
Commission. The most important is to extend overseas contracts and
labor services in accordance with international standards.

By the end of 1995, Beijing had signed contracts for overseas projects
and labor services totalling $2.57 billion US dollar, with a turnover
of $1.13 billion US dollars.

More than 20,000 doctors, scientists and engineers have been sent to
over 50 countries and regions around the world, the official said.

A total 11 enterprises in the city have now been licensed to enjoy the
right to sign overseas contracts for labor services.

Among them, the Beijing Urban and Rural Construction Group Corp is the
biggest, he said.

Last year, the city signed contracts for overseas cooperative projects
and labor services worth $780 million US dollars, earning millions of
dollars in profits for China.

China: Hebei focuses on airport development

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

North China's Hubei Province is embracing a rapid developing aviation
industry, according to a report from Shijiazhuang, the provincial
capital.

Until recently the province saw a slow development in aviation
transport, only starting its first civilian flight in 1984.

But since last year the province has stepped up development of air
travel with the opening of Shijiazhuang Airport. The airport is listed
as one of the alternative airports for Beijing Capital International
Airport.

According to provincial aviation officials, Hebei has opened 17
domestic air routes linking the province with 19 major Chinese cities,
and also an air route to Hong Kong.

By the end of October, Shijiazhuang Airport will open four more
domestic air routes to Kunming, Nanjing, Xiamen and Qingdao, and
chartered flights to Russia are expected to begin later this year.

Situated not far from Beijing and Tianjin, two largest cities in the
country, Hebei is one of the major agriculture production bases and
rich in mineral and tourism resources.

By the end of this century, Hubei will transform Shijiazhuang Airport
into an international airport and build or expand four other major
airports in the province.

Investment Report, which says the outflows of Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) from the region amounted to $25 billion US dollars last year.

A good part of the outflows goes into China, says the report released
yesterday in Geneva by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD).

The inflows of FDI into Hong Kong, $2.1 billion US dollars in 1995,
fall far short of the outflows.

"It does not imply a loss of confidence in Hong Kong," said Professor
Edward K.Y. Chen, President of Lingnan College at a news conference in
Hong Kong yesterday, who gave a general introduction to the annual
report, the fifth published by UNCTAD since 1992.

In his view, the figures simply reflect normal commercial activities to
rationalize production and accumulate wealth. Hong Kong is a funding
center which draws money from other places of the world and then pours
into China, so the big outflows are not all from Hong Kong investors,
said Chen.

Touching on Hong Kong after 1997, the reports says the city should
continue to be a separate customs territory and an independent member
of the World Trade Organization (WTO). According to Chen, there is good
evidence that the whole world has confidence in Hong Kong so long as it
maintains the current economic independence as stipulated in the Basic
Law, the de facto constitution of the future Special Administrative
Region.

UNCTAD plays an important role in promoting trade and investment
throughout the world.

China: Chemical industry shows off

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 5

THE latest chemical industry products, equipment and technology are on
show and investment co-operation is being sought at an international
industry fair which opened in Beijing yesterday.

"Current development has already been restricted by problems in funds
and technology, which indicates we must continue to firmly implement
the policy of opening up to the outside world, and fully use the
resources, funds and markets available both at home and abroad," said
He Guoqiang, vice-minister of chemical industry at the fair's
opening.

According to He, the fair, which runs from September 23 to 27 in the
China International Exhibition Centre, has so far drawn 95 overseas
chemical industry enterprises from 20 countries and regions, as well
as about 2,000 domestic enterprises.

Domestic participants are profiling about 120 projects for
co-operation and highlighting nearly 160 types of technology and
equipment for export.

"I am very happy to see there are new trends in co-operation between
foreign chemical circles and China's chemical industry over the last
couple of years," He said.

He cited four obvious changes, including the shifts: from simple
import of technology to all-round co-operation in scientific
research, production, personnel training and environmental
protection; from investments in individual projects to participation
in regional development of economic zones; from small projects to
those on a larger scale with a substantial amount of investment and
high technology content; and from co-operation with only a few large
companies to co-operation including medium and small-sized
enterprises.

In the ongoing Ninth Five-Year Plan, the industry will stress three
priorities: agrochemicals, such as fertilizer and pesticides, will be
further developed to meet the growing demands of agricultural
production; the petrochemical industry will be vigorously developed
by accelerating the production of organic raw materials, organic
intermediates, synthetic materials and fine and specialty chemicals
to support other pillar industries like the mechanical, electronic,
automobile manufacturing and building industries; and production of
high-tech and high value-added products will be expanded.

China: Scientists to document earliest dynasties

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 9

EDITOR'S note:

Starting this year, a State project to determine the chronology of
early Chinese history in the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties will be
carried out by the country's top historians and scientists. The
project, which is meant to give a clear, coherent picture of China's
beginnings, is the first of its kind supported by the government. It
is also considered an unprecedented co-operative effort between two
fields -- science and history.

Feature writers of China Daily have talked with the project's
initiator, State Councillor Song Jian, as well as project leader Li
Xueqin, archaeologist Li Boqian, astronomer Zhang Peiyu, Chinese
language professor Qiu Xigui and other scientists concerned. The
following is a series of articles on the interviews in today's and
tomorrow's page 9.

By Li Xing and Gong Qian

CHINA'S top historians and scientists will put their heads together to
develop a cohesive chronology of early Chinese history.

The project, which will be concluded in about three years, is intended
to create a dynasty outline dating to the Xia and early Shang eras,
noting the dates of each king's reign from Shang to Zhou dynasties.

The project is the brainchild of State Councillor Song Jian, a
scientist who specializes in astronautics and system control.

"We work together and apply modern science to the study of history,
provide convincing scientific bases, and give a more clear history to
our children," he said.

The project faces several hurdles because of differing historical
views.

For example, some ancient documents cite the 21st century BC as the
origin of Chinese history. But the documents don't corroborate with
archaeological and scientific evidence.

Furthermore, some early 20th century accounts may have been distorted
by revolutionary views that often discounted traditional ideas. For
decades, individual historians clung to their own views and couldn't
agree on early history.

But Song is determined to sort it out.

"We can't go on saying that we have a 5,000-year-old history while
denying its existence," he said.

Similar efforts to substantiate history have been successful elsewhere
in the world, so Song believes his project is possible.

He developed the idea after a trip to Egypt two years ago, when he
visited an ancient papyrus mill and marveled at the Rosetta Stone,
which bears the decree of an Egyptian king in hieroglyphics. He was
impressed by the sophistication of Egyptian studies, the result of
concerted research by Egyptian and European scholars.

When Song returned to China, he sent his opinions to historians and
archaeologists and found that some of them agreed with him.

Among them was archaeologist Kwang-chih Chang. He responded that no
single scholar was capable of such a big project, but that it could
be accomplished through teamwork and strong leadership.

Too often, Chinese scholars have concentrated on an obscure area or
specific subject. While the practice produced endless details, it did
little to give a complete portrayal of Chinese history.

Song believed historians could apply the same methods used by
scientists who measure geological time. He suggested that historians
specializing in the same time periods should join together to discuss
divisions in that era. The results of their consensus would then be
published as a reference document, which could later be revised.

"It's like building a basic co-ordinate," Song said. "To ascertain a
king's rule ended in this year or the next has little significance,
but obvious events that reflect political or dynastic changes must be
in accord."

Most experts welcomed the idea, but a few have reservations. Song
believes that their different recommendations are valid, but that the
application of modern science must take precedence.

With the rise of modern astronomy, which can reconstruct ancient
celestial phenomena, and the use of advanced dating techniques, Song
believes the two fields should be combined to study history.

He also sees great potential in archaeological work. Unfortunately,
Chinese houses and tombs, made from earth and wood, often failed to
endure harsh weather and time.

Despite the project's intimidating scale, Song is confident.

"With more money flowing into field work and research, I believe it
will bear some result," he said.

Song also believes the project can help boost the nation's morale.

"Respect for our national culture is crucial to the country's
progress," he said. "In this respect, historians should be the first
to do their part."

China: Uncovering the start of history

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 9

MODERN archaeology has helped push back the earliest known dates in
Chinese history at least 1,000 years by authenticating the existence
of the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th century BC) through the discoveries
of its capitals below modern Zhengzhou and Anyang.

Will archaeologists create history again in a huge chronology project?

Archaeologist Li Boqian, one of the leading experts working on the
project, believes the evidence points to an even earlier starting
point for Chinese civilization, but says that this will be hard to
prove.

Before modern archaeology was introduced to China, historians based
their theories on such ancient books as "Records of the Historian"
written by Sima Qian and "the Bamboo Annal." These texts suggest
Chinese history begins with a dynasty called Xia, which dates back to
the 21st century BC.

But here lies the snag: there is no evidence of this ancient kingdom.

If Xia ever had a written language, no traces of it have been found.
Virtually everything that scholars know about them is based on the
ancient books.

It is therefore not surprising that while experts have plenty of
theories about the origins of the Xia, few are universally accepted.

From early this century, a group of scholars began to attack the
authenticity of these written records, dismissing them as mere
legends. Some even regard the investigation of the dynasty as a waste
of time.

As this view gradually came to prevail, the more cautious experts have
pushed back their estimates of the beginning of China's social
history by more than 1,000 years.

Then, in the early part of this century, the increasing use of
archaeological techniques located the Shang capital in Anyang in
Central China's Henan Province. This proved that what the books say
about this dynasty is largely true. Pictograms inscribed on cattle
bones and tortoise shells found in Anyang provide firmer proof.

The discovery once again raised hopes in the minds of some historians
that the account of the Xia given by the "Records of the Historian"
may also have some truth in it.

Artifacts and images have been found which are sufficiently older, and
markedly different from those of later civilization. For instance,
the earliest Chinese cooking utensils were jars or ding -- cooking
vessels with two loop handles and three legs. Shang people used li
(cooking tripods with hollow legs) and yan (steamers with a bowl-like
upper part and a ding-tripod lower part).

These objects came from a series of ancient sites found since the
1950s. Known as the Erlitou sites, they are scattered across central
and western Henan and northwest Shanxi, on the fertile plains
overlooking the Luohe River and Yihe River -- exactly where the Xia
people lived according to the old books. Carbon-14 techniques date
the Erlitou culture as existing between the 21st century BC and the
17th century BC.

Two large excavations in the '60s and '70s resulted in the discovery
of a palace foundation.

A rammed earth base, 80 centimetres thick, and remains of walls and a
colonnade have been identified. The whole structure and layout
prefigures the structure of later Chinese palaces. The scale and
complexity of the engineering would demand a large group of people
under rulers able to direct the labour project -- probably a state.

"Understanding the Erlitou culture is the key to the chronology of the
Xia," said Li Boqian. "Most experts now tend to believe Erlitou
culture belongs to the late Xia Dynasty."

Li said that even if the Xia language has not been unearthed, there
are other elements that might well prove the existence of the Xia
Dynasty. Archaeologists will take samples from the different stages
of the Erlitou excavation and compare them with samples from the same
time-band elsewhere.

"The results may not be final, but they are certain to be more
unanimous," said Li.

The beginning of the Xia kingdom -- if it existed -- is even more
elusive than its end. Some scholars believe it shows affinity with
the older neolithic Longshan culture, a culture characterized by
black pottery dating between 3000-2000 BC.

Archaeologists have found Longshan household objects, such as pottery
wine cups and a kitchen range buried in big tombs and walled cities.

Longshan rulers turned to priest-advisers for predictions on
government matters and the outcome of hunts and battles. The priests
applied red-hot rods to the bones of cattle until they cracked, then
interpreted the cracks as auguries from the spirits.

Some of the symbols found on the pottery have caused argument among
scholars. Some believe they are artistic designs, others take them as
early pictograms.

"They are not decorative designs, for sure," said Li. "It's only that
there are not enough of them for us to decipher them and understand
their meaning."

Another fact may help to pinpoint the early Xia. Historical records
have it that the third king of the Xia, Zhong Kang, was once unseated
from the throne by a leader called Hou Yi from Shandong in East
China. Archaeologists believe that this important political event
would certainly leave its traces. If any evidence of the invasion
from the east can be unearthed, it will help sketch the early period
of the Xia.

Much will depend on co-operation across academic disciplines. For
example, a solar eclipse was said to have occurred during the reign
of Zhong Kang. If astronomers could give comparable dates, it would
assist the archaeologists.

Compared with the Xia, archaeological discoveries about the Shang are
a lot richer. More than 10,000 tombs have been found so far.

Originally, the Shang kingdom was thought to extend over the wide
plain formed by the Yellow River. They seemed to be militarily strong
and to have a cruel caste hierarchy. Their bronzework shows they were
highly artistic.

But discoveries in recent decades may rewrite the features of the
Shang. The sites in East China's Jiangxi Province and Southwest
China's Sichuan Province are especially fascinating for
archaeologists. The artifacts unearthed there demonstrate the
sophisticated level Shang society had attained. The influence of
Shang culture may have extended as far as Viet Nam.

"These archaeological finds really make us reassess the level of the
social development the Shang reached," said Li Xueqin, director of
the History Department of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

At the heart of the attempt to untangle the chronology of the Xia,
Shang and Zhou dynasties is the uncertainty about when the Shang
ended. It is known that the Zhou King Wu annexed the lands of the
last king of Shang and extended his own dominion. There are currently
about 30 different opinions about when this happened.

Li Boqian said the question will be solved largely through the joint
efforts of astronomers, historians and scientists. In fact, the whole
project depends upon co-operation between scientists, he said.

China: Poverty relief high on Party's agenda

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 1

THE Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee and the State
Council are determined to keep every Chinese adequately provided with
food and clothing by the end of this century.

"This target is unchangeable," Jiang Zemin, general secretary of CPC,
pledged yesterday at a national conference on poverty alleviation.

Premier Li Peng told conference participants that the country's poor
areas should list poverty relief high on their economic development
plan, and assign the task of providing enough food and clothes to the
masses as the first priority.

Presiding over yesterday's conference was Zhu Rongji, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee and the vice-premier of the State Council.

Participants included high-ranking Chinese officials, such as Hu
Jintao, Ding Guangen, Wu Bangguo, Zou Jiahua, Jiang Chunyun and major
cadres from the provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.

The CPC Central Committee and the State Council called upon the Party
to unite and mobilize all Chinese people to work for the common goal
in eliminating poverty in this country, Jiang declared.

From 1978 to 1995, China successfully reduced the country's
poverty-stricken population from 250 million to 65 million.

However, Jiang said, the task remains arduous and time is pressing for
realizing the goal of providing food and clothing for all poor people
in China by the year 2000.

"The CPC Central Committee is determined to win the hard battle,"
Jiang said.

Speeding up the development of poverty-stricken regions is not only an
economic issue, but also an issue concerning sustained national
stability, Jiang pointed out.

He said that with hard work, the goal can be achieved, because the
Party and the government pay paramount attention to poverty
alleviation and have adopted a series of major policies.

He suggested that a combination of State support and the development
of local resources is the basic solution for overcoming poverty.

He urged people in the poverty-stricken areas to pay more attention to
grain production, and to take advantage of local resources to develop
diversified operations that would increase the income of farmers.

Jiang also called for greater efforts to mobilize resources of the
whole society in the move to wipe out poverty.

China: Jiang hails relations with Kiribati

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 1

ALL countries of the world, regardless of size, should enjoy equal
political status, President Jiang Zemin said yesterday, when he met
with his Kiribati counterpart.

Every member of the world community is entitled to participate equally
in world affairs, Jiang told President Teburoro Tito of the island
country in the southern Pacific Ocean .

He met formally with Tito after an afternoon welcoming ceremony for
the six-member Kiribati delegation.

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1986, the countries
have co-operated in trade, health care, science and technology and
culture, Jiang said, and they have yielded satisfactory results and
shown good development trends.

The two countries have also been understanding, supporting each other
in world affairs, he added.

Jiang said that both China and Kiribati are developing countries in
the Asia-Pacific region, have suffered from foreign invasions in the
past and are faced with the common task of developing national
economy.

Therefore, there is no conflict of interest between the two. Good
Sino-Kiribati relations will benefit not only both peoples, but also
Asia-Pacific stability.

China is willing to boost bilateral relations to a higher level on the
basis of mutual respect, friendly trust, and mutual benefit, the
Chinese president said.

Tito, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday for an eight-day State visit to
China, thanked Jiang for his invitation, saying he is happy to visit
China.

Kiribati cherishes its friendship with China, Tito said. He thanked
China for the unselfish aid to his country, which has a population of
80,000, has received in the past decade.

Kiribati hopes that China, as a big country, will continue to play a
significant role in the world, safeguarding peace, equal co-existence
and the common development of all countries, the guest said.

After the meeting, the two presidents attended the signing of a
bilateral economic agreement.

Kiribati is a major exporter of tuna fish.

China: Environment key to sustaining economic progress

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 2

SHANGHAI -- Environmental protection is "the key for China to sustain
economic development," the country's strategic task, State Councillor
Song Jian affirmed yesterday.

Song made his remarks at the fifth meeting of the China Council for
International Co-operation on Environment and Development (CCICED).
The meeting began in Shanghai yesterday and ends tomorrow.

In his report to the conference on China's environmental protection
and economic growth, Song said the State Council has asked government
officials at all levels, and all large enterprises, to increase their
efforts to protect the environment.

Though much progress has been made in environment protection, the
overall situation in China is still grave, Song said. Environmental
pollution, which began in urban areas, is spreading into rural areas.
In some areas, pollution is hampering economic development and even
posing a direct threat to people's health.

To combat pollution and improve the environment, Song said efforts
should be focused in seven areas:

o Policy-making by the central government and the legislative work
needed to draft stricter environmental laws and regulations;

o Increasing investment to finance environment projects through all
possible channels;

o Protection of ecosystems and controls over the exploitation of
natural resources;

o More research and development;

o Publicity campaigns to make people more conscious of the
environment;

o More international co-operation and exchanges to make China a key
participant in international environmental programmes;

o Development of China's environmental-protection industries.

During the Eighth Five Year Plan (1991-95), many old factories that
were high energy consumers and had caused serious pollution were
moved out of urban areas. Several important environmental programmes
were also completed in that period.

For each 10,000 yuan ($1,200) worth of gross domestic product value,
the average energy consumed has been reduced from the equivalent of
5.3 tons of coal to 3.94 tons.

The sewage-treatment rate was improved from 32 per cent to 76 per cent
among industrial enterprises above the county level.

Hygiene and sanitation in urban areas were improved, and the national
forest-coverage rate was raised from 12 per cent in 1980 to the
present 13.92 per cent.

China: Ministry calls for efficiency in heating

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 2

WITH the growing threat of increasing energy consumption by building
projects, mainly in home heating and air conditioning, the Ministry
of Construction is encouraging the erection of energy conserving
housing and the introduction of new technology and products to ease
the problem.

The issue has become more urgent as 5.5 billion square metres of new
housing will be built in the country by the end of the century, while
the 29.7 billion square metres of housing projects that already exist
are consuming increasing amount of energy.

Home heating in winter in the north and air conditioning in summer in
the south have become major energy consumers, Minister of
Construction Hou Jie told the opening of a national working
conference in Beijing yesterday.

Despite the fact that warm housing is far from adequate in northern
China in winter, Hou said, the amount of coal burned for warmth last
year exceeded 127 million tons, or 10.7 per cent of the national
total energy consumption.

The rate is as high as 20-50 per cent in some extremely cold places,
Hou said.

In hot southern areas, 25-40 per cent of urban residents have air
conditioners in their houses, which contributes to the shortage of
electricity in those places.

Hou attributed the problem to old buildings and a growing number of
new construction projects.

Energy consumption does not take into account illumination and the hot
water supply yet.

He urged improvements to buildings to make sure they were warm in
winter and cool in summer while saving energy.

According to Vice-Minister of Construction Ye Rutang, the ministry
plans to build more energy-saving housing projects nationwide.
Experiments have been conducted in eight cities in northern China,
where home heating systems are widely used, he said.

Ye said that the ministry hopes that by the year 2000 the energy
consumption rate of newly-built urban housing projects with heating
systems will drop by 50 per cent, as compared with the standard in
the early 1980s.

During the State's Ninth Five Year Plan (1996-2000), Ye said his
ministry will focus on spreading new technologies and products such
as new thermal insulation building materials for walls and ceilings,
heat conserving windows, a concentrated heat supply system and solar
energy.

China: Highway vices curtailed

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 2

A SENIOR government official announced yesterday that efforts to
standardize the country's highway transport system during the past
two years have been "effective."

Guo Rubin, an official of the State Council, said at a press
conference that the highways in 13 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions have been cleared of the so-called "three vices."

The three vices -- imposition of arbitrary service charges, collection
of illicit fees and installation of random checkpoints -- have been a
problem on most highways in many regions during recent years.

These problems have been controlled on national and provincial
highways in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Liaoning, Jilin,
Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Shandong, Henan, Hainan, Tibet and
Ningxia, said Guo.

Earlier last year, the ministries of communications and public
security and Guo's office co-sponsored a national drive to crack down
on the three vices.

Statistics from 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions
suggest that 7,298 illegal checkpoints were removed between January
1995 and the end of last month.

The cases of illicit collection of fees and imposition of arbitrary
service charges have also been reduced sharply thanks to the
crackdown, said Guo.

This year alone, 2,264 cases of such problems have already been dealt
with and 2,697 people have been punished.

China: Children's book fair to be held in Beijing

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 2

A NATIONAL fair for children's publications will be at the Beijing
Exhibition Hall starting on October 2. More than 20,000 titles of
children's books, newspapers and periodicals will be displayed and
sold during the four-day event.

Organized by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China and the State Press and Publication
Administration, the fair will highlight the country's achievements in
children's publication work over the past several years and help
promote its development, said Yu Youxian, administrator of the
national press and publications.

Children's publishing houses from across the country will bring their
showcase books, audio and video cassettes and other electronic
products to the exhibition.

To enable young readers to afford the publications, a book sale will
be held at the Beijing Exhibition Hall on October 6, and will last
for three days.

The China Puppet Troupe, the China Leather-silhouette Troupe and the
Beijing Milky-Way Teenager Chorus will perform at the Beijing
Exhibition Hall during the children's publication fair as a special
welcome for the young visitors.

Twenty-one publishing houses will also donate some of their books to
children in remote and poor rural areas.

According to exhibition organizers, the country has established 29
publishing houses for children, which have published about 4,000 book
titles.

About 950 titles have been translated into 14 languages and exported
to more than 110 countries and regions around the world.

Since the first children's periodical was published in Beijing in
1930, 25 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have
created over a hundred such periodicals in many minority languages,
suitable for age groups below 18..

China: Poor girls get school aid

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 3

KUNMING, Yunnan Province -- As the upcoming semester approached,
13-year-old Guo Jiachu became more and more distraught. Her family
had sold its only pig to pay for her tuition after she was accepted
to the local middle school.

Guo, born in a small village by Lugu Lake on the border of Sichuan and
Yunnan provinces, was worried that she might not have tuition for the
next semester.

But thanks to the members of the Association of Businesswomen of the
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ABACFIC), Guo will
receive 300 yuan ($36) a year for books, tuition and meals.

"Now I can keep my mind on my studies," Guo said with tears in her
eyes.

Guo is among 20 girls at the Luguhu Middle School who received
donations from the businesswomen's group. The entrepreneurs visited
the region from September 15 to 20 to investigate the status of local
education and the economy.

The programme is part of the Spring Bud Plan, which helps poor rural
girls finish their primary education, especially in poverty-stricken
areas.

"Poor education, transportation and communication are the main
problems that hinder economic development in these areas," said Annie
S. C. Wu, head of the group and Vice-chairwoman of the ABACFIC.
"Local people need more help from all circles, including the
businesswomen of non-State firms."

ABACFIC donated 300,000 yuan ($36,150) to establish a professional
skills school in Sichuan Province's Luguhu Town and in Yunnan
Province's Lijing prefecture.

"All the members of the ABACFIC understand that educating a girl means
educating a future mother, which is extremely crucial for improving
the quality of the next generation," Wu said.

In the last five years, the Spring Bud Plan has aided more than
100,000 girls in 28 provinces and autonomous regions, according to
official statistics.

Last year, the programme received 3.7 million yuan ($430,000) in cash
donations and 5 million yuan ($600,000) in goods.

Students like Guo may not be able to repay their benefactors in cash,
but they will reap huge returns through their successes.

Guo intends to study hard and go to a teachers college. Eventually,
she wants to teach people about her Mosuo culture, which retains
vestiges of a matriarchal society.

China: 38 die as Typhoon Willie wreaks havoc on Hainan

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 3

HAIKOU, Hainan Province -- At least 38 people are dead, scores are
injured and 96 are missing after Typhoon Willie violently swept over
most parts of Hainan, China's southern island province, over the
weekend.

Total damages and property losses due to Willie, the worst storm to
batter the semi-tropical island in 10 years, were believed very high
in many areas, although final reports are not available, local
authorities said.

Thousands of people were left stranded by floods due to Willie's heavy
rainfall, which flooded more than 100 villages along local rivers.

Locally stationed troops and relief forces have beefed up their
numbers to launch joint rescue operations.

Yesterday, it was reported evacuations of villagers from flooded areas
are continuing, with many awaiting rescue.

Damage reports so far indicate Hainan fared worse under Willie than
Xuwen Prefecture, the hardest-hit area in neighbouring Guangdong
Province, experts said.

In Hainan's Chengmai County, more than 400 millimetres of rain fell,
causing local rivers to overflow, flooding most parts of the town and
cutting off electricity, water supplies and transportation and
damaging many other facilities.

Six county residents were reported dead, rescue officials said, adding
more than 10,000 others stranded by flooding are now out of danger
thanks to rescue operations backed by armed forces troops.

In Hainan's Changjiang Li Autonomous County, 45 houses and 53 fishing
boats were washed away as floods weakened and breached parts of the
local breakwaters. As of yesterday, 30 people had drowned, and 96
remain missing.

In Qiongshan City, 26 villages along the Niandujiang River were
flooded and more than 38,300 hectares of farm land swamped. Some
crops were completely destroyed.

Over the past two days, more than 680 houses in the city collapsed and
over 3,100 houses were damaged either by floods or fierce winds
accompanying the typhoon, local officials said.

China: Japan must try to win trust of others

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 4

THE Japanese Government's tolerance of the landing by right-wingers on
the Diaoyu Islands indicates the regression of its policy towards
China, in some aspects, back to the days before the normalization of
bilateral relations, according to some observers in Beijing.

"Whether the Diaoyu Islands issue will be resolved amicably depends on
whether the Japanese Government adopts a wise attitude on the
territorial dispute," said Zhao Jieqi, deputy director of the
Japanese Studies Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

The Japanese Government's abetment of the right-wingers' rampant
encroachment on China's territorial sovereignty has been deepening
mutual misunderstanding and is putting Sino-Japanese relations at
risk.

The explosion of the conflict on the Diaoyu Islands issue is not
sudden but is related to the changes in the macro-environment of the
international community and Japan itself, said Liu Jiangyong,
director of the Northeast Asia Division of the China Institute of
Contemporary International Relations.

Since the end of the Cold War, Sino-Japanese relations have been
facing many challenges.

The disappearance of the "Soviet threat" undermined the basis of the
Japan-US military alliance. Japan had to find an excuse to justify
the presence of the US troops in Japan.

Thus in the early 1990s, the "China menace theory" began to emerge in
Japan and was deliberately spread by some Japanese, including
prominent politicians.

Also with its growing economic clout, Japan began to seek political
and military status commensurate with its economic strength.

Some Japanese government officials not only denied the crimes
committed in World War II by their militarists but also encouraged
the government to put pressure on other countries, using loans and
sanctions as weapons.

This strategy is a divergence from Japan's previous approach of
helping war-afflicted countries develop their economies as some sort
of compensation.

Relying on its financial power, Japan is now taking a less restrained
and discreet attitude towards its war crimes and other sensitive
issues. It is also boldly bypassing the restrictions set by its
Constitution and is strengthening its military forces.

Japan's military expenditure is the second largest in the world in
recent years.

Some Japanese politicians believe that the atonement for the history
of invasion will not only hurt "national pride" but also harm Japan's
image as a "power." Therefore, headed by prominent government
officials, some Japanese blatantly denied the existence of the
Nanjing Massacre, "comfort women" and even Japan's invasion of other
countries.

"A mood of reversion against China is growing among the misled
Japanese because China is constantly urging Japan to re-examine the
past mistakes," said Liu.

Last year, when the whole world commemorated the victory of the
anti-fascist war, Japan, as an initiator of World War II, passed an
indecent resolution against the theme of the anniversary.

In July, Ryutaro Hashimoto, the first Japanese Prime Minister to be
born after the war, paid homage to the Yasukuni Shrine where class-A
war criminals are enshrined, heavily hurting the feelings of other
Asian peoples.

So strong is the non-recognition of crime sentiment in Japan that
politicians or ordinary Japanese who try to reveal the truth of
Japan's history of invasion would become the targets of attacks,
according to Liu.

Thus some politicians who treasure Sino-Japanese relations and
understand the friendship is in line with the interests of both
peoples find it more and more difficult to reverse the dangerous
trend.

Recent Japanese right-wingers' aggressive provocations on the Chinese
Diaoyu Islands further reflect their ambitions in international
politics, military development and territorial expansion.

A few Japanese are reluctant to see China, once a weak and bullied
country in modern history, grow stronger.

"These right-wingers hope to see, and also actively make troubles in
Sino-Japanese relations in order to propel Japan to turn right. The
Diaoyu Islands gives them a stage to perform," Zhao pointed out.

Every country and its people is sensitive about territory. That the
Diaoyu Islands belong to China since ancient times can be proved by
plenty of historical papers and facts, including those from Japan.

Therefore Japanese right-wingers' rampant trampling on China's
sovereignty stirred great indignation of both domestic and overseas
Chinese.

Japanese government officials' claim of sovereignty over the Diaoyu
Islands and threatening to use force will not help resolve the
problem but will worsen the conflict and harm Sino-Japanese
relations, said Zhao.

As for the Japanese government officials' claims that the government
cannot interfere with the activities of its people on its own
territory, Zhao believed it is mere subterfuge.

"International relations which involve ties with other countries
cannot be resolved as domestic affairs," said Zhao.

The Japanese Government should show sincerity in resolving the Diaoyu
Islands issue and take effective measures to prohibit the provocative
acts of the right-wingers.

China and Japan should hold dialogues on this issue and reach
consensus at the highest level. The dispute can be shelved until a
solution acceptable to both sides is found, Liu suggested.

The two countries' common interests dictate that partial disputes
should be resolved rationally and should not harm overall relations.
Sino-Japanese relations are significant for the peace and prosperity
of East Asia. Both of them will find it tough to co-exist as enemies.

For Japan which is seeking an increasingly important role on the
international stage, the primary concern of its foreign policy should
be how to win the trust of neighbouring countries.

But the point is whether Japanese politicians know this clearly, said
Liu.

China: More State firms turn to high-tech

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 4

THE introduction of high-technology is considered a cure for economic
ills by more and more deficit-stricken enterprises.

Before the recent exhibition of China's high-technology achievements
in Liaoning, a province with a high concentration of State-owned
enterprises, there was widespread skepticism that there would be an
audience for the expo since most State-owned enterprises are busy
tackling problems like rising deficits.

On display are high-tech achievement of a State programme dubbed
"Project 863" because it was first advocated in March 1986 by a group
of scientists who suggested that the government put more efforts into
high-tech research and development.

Despite the low expectations of some people, the week-long exhibition
proved a big success, and hosted an average of 7,000-plus visitors
each day. Among the visitors were government officials, enterprise
managers, professors and even peasants.

The exposition was aimed at the revitalization of traditional
industries by means of introducing advanced and new technologies.

The exposition wound up with 309 contracts for technology transfer
valued at 3.29 billion yuan ($396.3 million).

This co-operation between "Project 863" and State enterprises in
Liaoning signals the advent of mutual support between technology and
economy during the process of transition from a planned economy to a
market one, and from an extensive economy to an intensive economy,
according to an article in the Economic Information Daily.

The darlings of the traditional planned economy, many State
enterprises in Liaoning were ill-prepared for reform aimed at making
China's economy more market-oriented. While some firms have survived
the trials of the market, many others are on the verge of bankruptcy.

Now that factory directors and managers have finally realized they can
no longer depend on government coffers, they are starting to accept
that introduction of advanced sciences, and high-technology can be
their economic saviour.

This explains why the exposition was so well received in Liaoning.

The example of the Shenyang Air-blower Factory related at the expo
convinced many local managers that high-technology is something they
can turn to.

A small factory several years ago, Shenyang Air-blower Factory has
become China's largest producer of compressors and blowers thanks to
the introduction of high-tech operations.

After visiting the exhibition, many factory and company officials said
they are keen on technological upgrading to shake off their problems.

The Liaoning provincial government has showed great interest in
high-tech projects.

Before the exhibition had even ended, the local government had struck
an agreement with the State Science and Technology Commission to
usher in a system of joint meetings to promote the application of the
research achievements of "Project 863" in Liaoning.

China: Time to counter negative views on China

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 4

"China Through My Eyes" is sponsored by the State Bureau of Foreign
Experts Affairs and China Daily. It features our foreign readers'
impressions, suggestions and criticisms regarding developments in
China. Contributions are welcome.

By Zhang Yanyan

AS an overseas Chinese, I cannot help feeling insulted and concerned
over the way Western journalists and politicians continuously try to
tarnish China's image.

They do not accept Chinese views which are rational and based on
traditional concepts of philosophy and righteousness, but want to
turn everything concerning Chinese affairs into nasty, negative
nothings.

US's policy towards China is one of sabotaging, bullying and
trouble-making. That is why the US tells China off and spreads bad
propaganda about the lack of human rights in China.

As an overseas Chinese well-read in history and literature, I have
deep sympathy for the Chinese people. There is much that is good and
deep in Chinese traditions and history to learn from and build upon
but also much that is bad and evil to analyze and reflect upon, so
that evil will not be repeated.

To realize the Chinese utopia, a dream of past generations, the
Chinese must stay united. China must have stability.

However, that is difficult, for the Western politicians and
journalists, as well as many naive Chinese, are hacking at it. The
West propagates the uncertainty of stability in the future because
they profit economically in all ways from a weak and unstable
country. Some Chinese regard this to be a fact and unwittingly echo
the damaging intent in their naivety. This is certainly not good for
the Chinese people and for business. That would be like playing into
the enemy's trap.

The Chinese Government should be strong and knowledgeable about how to
strengthen the stability and security of China in all areas of life
and politics. There should be an intelligent body of scholars,
administrators, scientists, soldiers, journalists, professionals and
representatives of the districts and villages including overseas
Chinese and business people.

There are strong grounds in traditional, revolutionary and
post-revolutionary Chinese history, culture and politics to signal
the important contribution China can make towards universal peace and
advancements in all areas of human civilization. This is the only
truly political message that everyone, East and West, will accept and
cherish.

There are many good people and good things in the West and there are
many Western intellectuals who have loved, supported and hoped with
China and for China. Let China live up the best of everyone's
expectations. China will also need the continuation of her past
ideologies and excellent organization that once established a
crime-free, honest, supportive and universal humanitarian society as
in the 1950s.

I believe China should and can expand its influence in peaceful,
useful and intelligent ways for the benefit of its own people as well
as human kind. In China, there must be a good, strong and confident
government open to the views of the Chinese, Western and others whose
role is to ensure peace and unity and the security of all Chinese,
and everyone else in China.

China should have good, strong and effective defence featuring the
latest technological innovations. (This is to ensure that China will
not be bullied by aggressors.)

However, the most universal of human ideals -- happiness, peace and a
good quality of life -- should be the priority in all Chinese
affairs. China should work more intelligently to make and cultivate
friendships with the developed and less developed nations of the
world.

China: Agreement focuses on electrical insulators

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 5

A CONTRACT for establishing a $25 million tripartite joint venture was
signed yesterday in Beijing by Chinese and Japanese companies.

The NGK Insulators Tangshan Co Ltd will be jointly invested by the
Tangshan High Voltage Insulator Works in Hebei Province, and by NGK
Insulators Ltd and Itochu Corp of Japan.

The Chinese side holds only a 5 per cent stake in the investment,
while NGK controls 76 per cent. The remaining 19 per cent is held by
Itochu.

The joint venture, scheduled to start production in 1998, will have an
annual production output of 1.8 million units of suspension
insulators used for electrical transmission lines.

The venture will employ 400 people and is projecting annual sales
income of $30 million by 1999.

Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee, encouraged the Japanese investors during a
meeting before the signing of the contract, saying that development
of the power industry in China will have a bright future.

Hebei Provincial Governor Ye Liansong told the Japanese investors that
in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the power industry will be
the key sector of development in the coastal province.

In the coming five years, Hebei plans to meet growing power demand by
constructing plants with a total electricity generating capacity of 6
million kilowatts.

The country as a whole will increase its electricity generating
capacity by an estimated 80 million kilowatts during the period, Ye
said.

Ye said these trends augur well for the joint venture, whose products
are widely used by power plants and electricity transmission lines.

Products of the joint venture will eventually be exported to the
international market, according to Mike Shibata, president and chief
executive officer of NGK Insulators.

Itochu Corp, one of the largest Japanese trading companies, is the
first Japanese company to open a representative office in China after
1949. Last year, its trade volume with China reached about $5.5
billion.

In addition to trade, Itochu has also been active in committing
investment in the Chinese market.

So far, it has established about 150 joint ventures on the Chinese
mainland, involving textiles, food, metals and machinery.

Itochu says it plans to establish more joint ventures in the coming
years as more than 100 new projects are under negotiation with
Chinese partners.

The End of the "Flying Peace"

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

by Zhang Shuangwu

Recently, a lovely project at the Guangxi Nanning Zoo vanished like
a soap bubble.  In October 1995, in order to create a "new scenic
spot," the zoo invested 15,000 RMB to introduce 850 chick doves
into the zoo from other places.  After two months of meticulous
nurturing and taming, the full-grown white doves were released into
the zoo's green trees and tender lawns to sport freely with the
visitors.  The white doves, green lawn, and blue sky became a major
attraction at the Nanning Zoo.

However, during the time they were allowed to fly free every day,
quite a number of the doves were injured when they were chased by
the visitors.  The worst was that some visitors even stole the
white doves when the zoo keepers were not around.  Once, over one
hundred white doves were stolen in a single day!

The deputy director of the zoo, Zhang Caichang, was forced to
remark: "In fact, one white dove is not worth that much, at the
most 10 RMB.  I assume that the visitors who stole the doves were
not going to sell them for money, but rather to make a side dish
for their drinks."  The public security police of the zoo noticed
that in early July this situation had become worse.  The reason was
that during the summer vacation, the number of children visiting
the zoo had increased; with their parents' tacit permission as well
as connivance, some young visitors repeatedly broke the rules.

According to the count, among the 850 white doves which were first
introduced into the Nanning Zoo, besides the 200 that suffered from
natural deaths, another 500 doves were stolen by visitors.
Starting from August 20, the zoo decided to lock the 130 surviving
doves into a specially built and well-sealed wooden house.  The
project of releasing the "Flying Peace" thus came to a premature
end.

In the Nanning Zoo, the white doves are not the only animals to
have suffered such misfortunes. Sea lions, tigers, and red-crowned
cranes are sometimes injured or blinded by visitors.  The medical
bill of the zoo to protect these animals is increasing every year.

The Water Shortage in Xi'an

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

by Bai Lin & Gao Xiaoyan

Right after the Spring Festival this year, residents in some areas
of Xi'an city began the torment of waiting for the water to be
turned on.  As soon as they received a notice that their water was
being turned on they bustled around to fill containers of all sizes
that they could find in their homes.  They finally became used to
using water this way.  On one occasion, in the summer of last year,
water was the most rare life-sustaining source for people in Xi'an.
Water storage jugs, which cost 35 RMB, were one of the hottest
consumer goods.  Water traffickers also took advantage of the
situation to profiteer.  Even the officials who never had a need to
worry about food would not forget to carry two water buckets in the
trunks of their cars.

Water is threatening the survival of this ancient city.  The
excessive extraction of underground water has already produced
serious consequences: across the city, a total length of 55
kilometers, 13 ground fissures from east to west have destroyed
several thousand houses; the famous cultural relic, the Big Goose
Pagoda, now tilts soberly; and the deterioration of the earth's
surface at the Clock Tower and at three other historic sites has
been exacerbated.

The daily extractable ground water in Xi'an city is 120,000 to
140,000 tons at the most, but this only meets one-third of the
required demand of the city.  So by the time 260,000 tons are
extracted daily, the water level has dropped dramatically.  The
water level is now dropping between two and three meters annually
in the metropolitan area and between three and five meters in the
southern suburbs.  This overextraction has produced a series of
other problems.  First, as the water quality deteriorates, the
shallow water can no longer be used for human consumption because
of the discharge of industrial waste and because of the excessive
use of agricultural pesticides and chemical fertilizers.  Second,
the earth has begun to subside seriously.  From 1986 to 1991, the
earth in the metropolitan area subsided from 30 millimeters to 210
millimeters, and the annual rate increased from 10 millimeters to
70 millimeters.

The drop in the level of the ground water and the deterioration of
the water quality greatly raised the costs of water extraction and
purification for the city water company.  Currently The cost for
water purification has reached 0.47 RMB per cubic meter, while the
water company can only charge city residents 0.45 RMB per cubic
meter of water.  Whereas the 2.3 hundred million cubic meters of
the the total annual natural water supply cannot be changed, the
water supply enterprises are pinched to their limit.

Xi'an was called "Chang'an" in ancient times.  Our forefathers
often described the beauty of this ancient city as "Eight Rivers
Surrounding Chang'an."  But today, of the eight rivers which used
to encircle Xi'an, some have long ago been cut off, and some can
only barely be called "rivers" during the rainy seasons.  Today,
only the Feng River is still flowing year round, but because the
weather has been continuously dry, the water source of the Feng
River has also dropped two meters.  In addition, Chang'an county,
through which the Feng River flows, has built a simply-constructed
dam at the river's upper stream for its own benefit.  This five
million RMB dam pushed the Xi'an water company, which had invested
several dozen million RMB, into a tight corner; even with forty
deep wells, the quantity of water this company could produce
dropped sharply.

In general, when the water supply is insufficient, it is natural to
ration it.  But the Water-Ration Office is plagued by numerous
difficulties.  The same people who sometimes do not have enough
drinking water still do not have a conscience about saving water.
The Water-Ration Office manages 300 work units with self-contained
wells, and supplies 1400 planned water customers each with over 20
cubic meters for daily usage.  Every year, the office readjusts the
water usage quota, and water meters are checked monthly.  The
charge for overquota water is two to six times the normal price.
The Water-Ration Office also sets a quota for water usage for water
for daily living; residents who get water from outdoors receive a
daily quota of 50 liters per person; those have indoor hygiene
facilities receive 120 liters per person; people have bath or
shower facilities get 150 liters per person; students boarding at
colleges get 220 liters (including for the use of labs); grade
school and high school students get 80 liters (also including that
for lab use).  However, because of the lack of funds and the lack
of water supply engineering and due to the unfinished
reconstruction of the old urban pipeline, there is still a gap in
terms of managing water usage in residential areas.  Furthermore,
ground water management within the city is chaotic, as some
departments arbitrarily give permission to dig wells.

With the number of water consumers increasing constantly, the water
supply in Xi'an is becoming more and more short every year.  When
summer comes, it is almost as if eyebrows are about to catch fire.
The peak water supply has become a serious social problem.  In
1991, when there were forty days of summer drought, the daily
difference between the need and the supply of water exceeded 0.4
million cubic meters.  This directly affected the everyday life of
500,000 people living on 20 square kilometers;  202 enterprises
were also affected, and it was estimated that they incurred 42.5
hundred million RMB in losses in industrial output that year.

On July 15, 1991, the city government issued five emergency
policies to deal with the shortage of the water supply: limit daily
use per person to 100 liters; put an end to waste due to running
water, leakage, dripping, and overflowing; ban garden watering and
cooling off with tap water; close down all the city swimming pools
which use tap-water; reduce by 20 percent the supply to customers
using large quantities of water.  By 1995, the condition had
worsened, and Xi'an was inescapably caught in a water crisis.

The daily demand for water in Xi'an is 1.2 to 1.25 million cubic
meters, but now only 0.75 million cubic meters of water can be
supplied.  This shortage of water is 43 percent of the water
supplied.  Now, people are placing their hopes on the Black River
that originates in the Qin mountains.  But until the water from the
Black River can get to Xi'an, there is no way to solve the water
shortage problem.  The total investment in the Black River
diversion work requires 2900 million RMB; although 1000 million RMB
has already been spent, the work has not been finished.

In fact. there are many other cities with water shortages more
serious than Xi'an.  Taiyuan is one such city, but without any
practical scenario to solve the problem, some people have
tentatively suggested relocating the city.  The capital of Beijing
is also short of water, as the average water supply per capita in
Beijing is only 1/30 of the world's average. By the year 2010, the
gap between supply and demand will be over 1000 million cubic
meters.

Leaking Housing Projects

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

Many new housing projects have been built as China's economy has
developed.  But the quality of the houses has become lower and
lower.  According to a survey conducted by the "China Technical and
Development Center of the Building Industry," in the twenty-two
cities surveyed, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, etc., 53
percent of the houses leaked in the very first year after
completion.  According to the official Xinhua News Agency, in the
1950s, leaking began after an average of sixteen years after
completion; in the 1960s, leaking occured after seven to nine
years; in the 1970s, after three to five years.

Due to the poor quality of the housing projects, a great amount of
money has been spent on repairs.  In the survey of the twenty-two
cities, it was estimated that the money spent on repairs in one
year exceeded the original budget by 1.2 billion RMB.

New Party Members

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

Recently, to the elation of Party officials, there has been a new
upsurge in the number of students applying to join the Communist
Party.  But, on closer scrutiny, it was found that the motives
behind the applications were of a dubious nature.

According to a survey, 30 percent of those answering the question
regarding their motives for joining the Party answered that if one
is a Party member he/she is more likely to find a good job.  When
asked whether it is right to say that Party membership is an
important chip in the competition for good jobs after graduation,
70.1 percent answered that this was reasonable.  When they were
asked what they would do when their personal interests clashed with
the interests of the Party, 53.7 percent answered that they would
do their best to consider the interests of the Party, but their
personal interests would also have to be taken into consideration.

A Free Ride

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

Jin Hua, an old lady, recently died of cancer in Ji'nan Central
Hospital.  Fortunately, she was a veteran of the Anti-Japanese War
and all her medical bills could be paid by the state; the bill was
given to her daughter to be transferred to Jin Hua's work unit.

Because her daughter is a very methodical person, she checked the
bill over and found that there were many items on the bill that her
mother had not received.  For instance, her mother was allergic to
antibiotics, but she was charged for more than 200 penicillin
shots; her mother's gallbladder had been removed many years
earlier, but one of the drugs listed on the bill was to treat
gallstones.  During Jin Hua's stay in the hospital, she had four
electrocardiograms, but she was charged for eight; she had not had
any blood transfusions, but 640 RMB was charged for blood
transfusions.  Charges for even more expensive medicine to treat
obesity appeared on the bill.  Later it was found out that some of
the doctors and nurses had included on the bill some medicine which
they themselves needed.  They reasoned that since the bill was to
be paid by the state, then why not get a free ride?

A New Wave of Persecution Against Catholics

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

There are many Catholics in the Baoding region of Hebei province.
Donglu village is one of the most densely congregated areas.  In
the name of "helping to improve the economy," the authorities sent
in a work team of over one hundred cadres at the beginning of this
year and launched a new wave of persecution against the Catholics.
The villagers were forbidden from leaving the village without
permission from the authorities.  Priests were arrested and
worshipping was banned; Catholic students were suspended from
school unless they denounced their religion, nuns were forced to
participate in "pre-nuptial training courses" where "sexual
education" was conducted in a lewd manner. The 38th Field Army of
over 2,000 soldiers surrounded the village to intimidate the
villagers.

Such persecution has also occurred in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian,
and Shaanxi provinces, as well as in other parts of Hebei province.

Bitter Fruit of the One-Child Policy

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

Two incidents have become hot topics of conversation among
educators and parents in China.

The first incident concerns ten children from the city of Harbin
chosen to participate in a summer camp in Russia.  These ten were
chosen from over 100,000 Harbin children, and were supposed to be
"outstanding students," but they also turned out to be very finicky
and pampered.  Once when the children were playing volleyball, the
ball rolled into a swimming pool.  The Russian children immediately
jumped into the pool to retrieve it, but the Chinese children stood
there crying "What's to be done?"  When mountain climbing, the
Russian children rushed up the mountain shouting joyously, while
the Chinese children formed a line, climbed slowly and listlessly.
When the time came for the children to depart, the gifts the
Russian children gave to their Chinese friends were all hand-made,
while the gifts from the Chinese children were all store-bought,
conventional presents.

Another incident concerns the freshmen enrolling at Peking
University.  On the day of enrollment, the number of parents
accompanying their sons and daughters far exceeded the number of
students.  Some parents even planned to stay near the college for
two weeks after enrollment to teach their children how to wash
their own clothes and how to take care of themselves.  Nearly all
the students were only children and had led very sheltered and
pampered lives.

Many educators and parents are worried: what has the one-child
policy done to our next generation?

Spending 20,000 RMB to Win 4,800 RMB

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

An advertisement appeared in Wuhan announcing a guessing game
sweepstakes: telephone the number 9680-0001 and answer a question
about tourism; if the answer is correct, the caller will score a
point.  The person who accumulates the most points will receive the
first prize of 4,800 RMB. The second and third prizes were to be
1,800 RMB and 1,000 RMB respectively.

Finally the results of the sweepstakes were published: the first
prize winner had called 21,817 times, the second prize winner
14,614 times; all winners had called no less than 8,000 times.
People all knew that the minimum fee for calling an 968 number is 1
RMB, so why would anyone spend more than 20,000 RMB only to win
4,800 RMB?  Were they crazy?

No, their minds were perfectly sound.  The operator of the 968 line
explained that nearly all these calls were made using office
telephones.  The winners not only did not have to pay the phone
bills, but also they had not used their own time to participate in
the game.

Fake Medicine from the Red Cross

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

A "panacea" to cure cancer which was sold by the Red Cross of
Hainan Island turned out to be fake medicine which had endangered
the lives of many patients.

This "panacea" is actually powder of glossy ganoderma spore, which
does not possess such curative effects as advertised by the Hainan
Red Cross.  As early as December 1994, the Ministry of Public
Health had announced that this powder could not cure cancer, that
it should be prohibited from being sold as cancer medication, and
that those who did so should be fined.  But, as the old Chinese
saying goes, "The heaven is high above and the emperor is far
away"; Hainan Island, which is the farthest province from Beijing,
thought it did not have to obey orders from Beijing.  This
"panacea" continued to be sold in the compound of the provincial
public health department for 260 RMB per gram (the actual cost was
roughly 300 RMB per kilogram).  It was not until April 1996, when
victims of this fake medicine began to sue, that this fraud finally
came to a halt.

Letter From China: Adventure in a Small Township

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

Dear Brother:

I always remember the letter you wrote to me about your first visit
to 42nd Street in New York.  Now let me tell you something I
experienced in a small border town several days ago.

I went to Dongxing township at the border of Guangxi Autonomous
Region together with my boss and another colleague.  Having heard
that the public security there is not good, we decided that we
would stay in the same room just to be on the safe side.  But as
soon as we settled down and turned on the TV for the 7:OO PM news,
there was a knock on the door and in came a young girl asking to
use our telephone.  We didn't give this much thought and agreed.
She made a call and immediately another two girls arrived at our
room, one of whom was wearing very little clothing.  They sat down
on our beds and said: "You must be very tired, let us give you
massages."  We realized that these girls were prostitutes and our
boss said sternly: "Please leave!  We don't need any massages."
But they refused to budge until we threatened to report them to the
police.

Having learned a lesson, we locked our door, but there were still
repeated knocks.  One time our door was opened with a key and in
came a seductive woman carrying a teapot.  She said: "Aren't you
lonely in this small town without me?"  Despite her curses, we
managed to drive her out.  At ten o'clock, my boss and my colleague
went downstairs to arrange for our transportation for the next day.
As soon as they left, another girl came in and said: "You must have
been away from home for many days, don't you need female services?"
When I pushed her away, she cursed at me saying: "Are you afraid
that I'll rape you, you old scoundrel!"  During that one evening,
altogether there were five groups of prostitutes who knocked at our
door.

The following morning we went to the front desk and demanded to
know how the prostitute had obtained a key to our room.  The clerk
said: "She said that you wanted some drinking water. How could I
know she was a bad woman?  There are too many young girls here from
Sichuan and Heilongjiang - when they can't find jobs, they have to
sell themselves."

Your Brother,
Wu Zhixin

The Red and the Black

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

by Jin Dabai

While the Chinese Communist regime is trying its best to block the
way for democracy in China, the so-called "black gangs" (criminal
syndicates) have successfully penetrated into many mid-level and
grass-root institutions, sometimes even replacing the local
regimes.

As early as 1991, the Ministry of Public Security had exposed a
powerful black gang in Gaoyang county, Hebei province.  Though this
criminal syndicate had only some sixty members, the Ministry of
Public Security had to mobilize forces from Hebei, Heilongjiang,
Jilin, Shandong, Liaoning, Beijing, and Tianjin to crack it.  Why?
Because it had infiltrated into many government and Party
institutions.  Even after the syndicate was cracked, its remnants
still managed to seep into the judicial system, using different
hoaxes, to rescue three of its bosses, finally getting them out on
bail.

The black gangs are growing very rapidly, their power reaching
almost every stratum of the society.  In Nanjing, the capital city
of Jiangsu province, four criminal gangs have divided the city up
into four turfs.  They demand "protection fees" from the businesses
and residents within their turfs and help settle disputes among
residents as if they are government mediators.  Residents who
usually are afraid to go to public security departments or courts
of law prefer to deal with people from the black gangs.

Over the years, the black gangs have gradually wormed their way
into various institutions of the regime; by bribing officials they
have used legal means to obtain power.  With officials to back them
up, the gangsters can do whatever they wish.  Some gangsters are
even officials themselves.  In some provinces in the south, it was
found that quite a few of the local heads of the public security
departments are also black gang bosses.  This is why the Beijing
regime recently decided to rotate local public security heads.

Some officials who find it difficult to solve such problems as
debts, civil disputes, and problems of public order through
officials channels often resort to the black gangs to settle these
disputes and problems.  It is a common practice for managers to
hire gangsters to force debtors to pay up; if the debtor refused,
then he might have to pay with an ear, a hand, or even with his
life.  There is a fixed price-list in Shenzhen for carrying out
such "jobs": chopping off a hand, 8,000 RMB; a foot, 10,000 RMB;
for taking one's life, 30,000 RMB.  Recently the public security
department in Shenzhen arrested two members of a butcher ring.
They had been hired by Mr.Fan, the general manager of a
corporation, to "teach a lesson" to Mr. Wang, the manager of a taxi
company. Fan was willing to pay 30,000 RMB, but, afraid that he
might be caught and face a death sentence, he told the executioners
that he would be satisfied with their merely incapacitating Wang.
However, by mistake a taxi driver was beaten up and the case was
exposed.  When these two butchers confessed, they revealed
information about the price-list; they confessed that they had been
hired several times and that as soon as they were paid they would
go out and "do their job."

Both the officials and gangsters find such cooperation very useful:
the gangsters with official power in their hands become more
powerful; and corrupt officials with support from the black gangs
actually have an "army" at their beck and call.  In a township in
Hunan province, there is a tacit understanding between the local
government and the black gangs: the gangsters will collect
protection fees from the local markets and businesses; and whenever
the public security department wants help in cracking a case, the
black gangs will give assistance.  The township officials see
nothing wrong with this cooperation.  Such cooperation has
developed to such an extent that in some localities the black gangs
regard themselves as the regime itself.

The current trend among the black gangs is to buy out grass-root
Party and government cadres so that they have more valid
protection.  The black gangs in the countryside are making use of
the clans to rope the cadres or to bribe officials in grass-root
elections so that the black gangs bosses are elected to public
office.

The Two Chinas - In the Media and in Reality

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

by Chen Yen

In August, I went back to China to visit my family and to tour the
country.  In addition to brief stays in big cities like Beijing and
Xi'an, I also visited a number of inland counties and villages in
Sichuan and Hubei provinces.  I have to say that it was quite an
experience.  The most intense realization I had was that the China
that I saw with my own eyes is greatly different from the China
portrayed in various overseas media in Europe, America, Hong Kong,
and Taiwan.

I should say that there is another China that is real but that is
being ignored in the media.

The overseas media reports on China often cite numbers, but these
numbers are primarily from China's official statistics.  For
example, in July of this year China's official media made many
claims: the Chinese economy had successfully achieved a "soft
landing"; the growth rate of the economy for the first half of the
year remained at 13 percent, while inflation continued to decline
to an average of 7.8 percent; and 49 percent of the state-owned
enterprises were operating at a deficit.  Except for the latter
statistic, the above officially announced figures are all positive.
However, their accurateness is questionable.  Even the number of
state-owned enterprises operating at a deficit is quite different
in reality.

Among my observations in China, the first is that the condition of
agriculture is very bad.  This year flooding has been very serious
in the south and there was a bad harvest of the summer crops.
Disallowing for the flooded fields, the crops had rotted in 30 to
40 percent of the remaining fields.  In Sichuan, I ran into many
peasants who had fled from the floods in Hubei province.  They
reported that all the rice paddies and cotton fields in their home
areas were flooded.  The cotton problem was the worst.  The
Jianghan plain in Hubei province used to be a famous cotton-
producing area.  But this year the cotton plants grew only stems,
and there were no buds.  Therefore, there would be a diminished
output.

The agricultural depression directly affected the market because in
inland China, business in the middle-sized and small cities mainly
depends on the buying power of the peasants.  I witnessed a
depressed economic scene in a number of counties and cities in
northern Sichuan: all the department storesin these cities had a
surplus supply of goods.  But without even one exception, these
stores had almost no shoppers.  And few people were going to
restaurants.

When we visited a city in Hubei, we were told that 90 percent of
the state-owned enterprises were idle.  Some operated occasionally,
but they could not make a profit so that the workers had to go out
to find other sources to make a living.

The problems within the state-owned enterprises have already caused
serious social consequences.  In one city in Hubei province, I
witnessed 300 workers staging a sit-in in front of the municipal
government offices.  The city officials all had to use the side
doors of the building to avoid the protesters.  The deputy mayor
had originally planned to accompany us on a tour of the city, but
since his car could not exit from the gate, he had to give up the
tour.  The protesting workers came from a local power plant.  The
city had initially collected funds from the workers so that the
plant could generate electricity but the cost of producing the
electricity was higher than purchasing it elsewhere. So the city
government decided to close down this power plant.  However, the
remaining funds collected from the workers were gobbled up by the
officials of the plant.  Although two of the officials were
arrested for this wrongdoing, the whereabouts of the workers' fund,
not to mention also their salaries, had yet to be resolved.  The
municipal government did not know how to respond to the protest.
Privately, city officials thought the workers' protest was
justified; but even if the government temporarily were able to
issue the workers small subsidies, because of its tight budget it
would not be able to ameliorate the workers' resentment.  Such
incidents are common-place in China today, so city officials across
the country are now quite accustomed to such protests.

Although what I saw during this short trip to China naturally was
limited, it was enough to make me feel the seriousness of the
country's current problems.  When I chatted with local officials, I
was surprised that they so honestly told me that local governments
at various levels all survive by submitting fake reports.
Previously there was no income base for the finances of the local
governments because they relied on the higher levels of government;
now the local governments have to rely on extorting fees from the
masses.  For example, schools now commonly ask grade school and
high school students to pay high tuitions, which in turn are
deposited in the government's coffers. Local governments then boast
that their situation is excellent because their economic growth has
taken off at an amazing speed.

A friend of mine has a position in a local government.  He told me
that though the overall situation is very poor, temporarily the
people will be able to tolerate it.  The reasons are: first, people
have an increased degree of freedom and if their own work unit
cannot pay out wages, they can still find other outside income;
second, most people have become cynical as they know that this
system will not last for long.  As a result, he said, there are two
decisive consequences to the current circumstances and these will
have a far-reaching influence.

First, since the reform started over a decade go, the people's
democratic consciousness has increased a great deal.  This means
citizens everywhere, including people in remote areas, have all
started resorting to their legal rights to express their opinions.
Street protests are an often-used technique.

Second, the relationship between the cadres and the masses at the
basic levels has changed substantially; it is now antagonistic and
competitive.  The supportive base upon which the Chinese Communist
Party used to rely among the lower-level masses has already gone
with the wind.

An Event Fueling the Power Struggle

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

by Liu Zian

Recently, an important event, which undoubtedly will intensify the
power struggle within the party central, has been unfolding.

The beginning of this event was quite common place: earlier this
year, the position of the vice secretary of the Liuzhou Prefectural
Party Committee in Guangxi Autonomous Region was vacated.  Liu
Heping, deputy mayor of a city in that prefecture, went all out to
try to secure the position.  He used to say that he had served in
the army for thirteen years and because of his achievements he had
been promoted from a common soldier to the post of the deputy head
of a regiment.  But soon a competitor for the vacated position
exposed to the regional party committee that Liu had lied about his
personal history; instead of being in the army he had actually been
a criminal who had spent thirteen years in prison.  After an
investigation, this allegation was confirmed.

Just as Liu Heping was facing a hopeless impasse, suddenly two
officers from the headquarters of the General Staff in Beijing came
to the Guangxi Autonomous Region Party Committee; they claimed that
they were entrusted by the party General Secretary Jiang Zemin to
inform the committee that Liu Heping had spent the thirteen years
in prison "to carry out a special task."  As luck would have it, Hu
Jintao, a standing committee member of the Politburo, was in
Guangxi at that time.  When Hu heard about this, he was very much
in doubt; so he verified this piece of information with Jiang Zemin
himself.  Jiang flatly denied that he had sent out those officers
on such an errand and asked that this fraud be thoroughly
investigated.

It is obvious that whoever had sent those two officers faced great
political risks.  Unless the exposure of Liu Heping would have
brought him tremendous disaster, he certainly would not have
ventured to make such a dangerous move; and if he did not have
strong support, support from someone whose safety also depended
closely on the safety of Liu Heping, this person too would not have
taken such a risk.

Indeed, the case of Liu Heping exposed a huge criminal gang which
involved many high-level officers.  The person who had sent those
two officers to intercede on behalf of Liu Heping was in a high
enough position: he was Major General Liu Shilun, head of the
Management Bureau of the General Staff Headquarters.  This
Management Bureau is in charge of providing logistic services to
all the high officers, and Liu Shilun has broad and influential
connections both in the top echelons of the military and in the
localities.

Based on many cases of corruption which have already been exposed,
Liu Shilun had acted as the go-between for high military officers
and local officials in illegal business dealings.  Liu Shilun was
also guilty of another crime: using his authority he recruited many
pretty girls from the ranks of the female soldiers and sent them to
luxurious hotels established by the military and to military guest
houses in Beijing to provide sexual services to military and local
officials.

Up to the present, one lieutenant general, three major generals,
and tens of local officials have been arrested.  The highest-
ranking officials in Tianjin municipality and in Sichuan province
were also involved.

Corruption in the army has always been more severe than in the
localities, but such cases have always been carefully covered up.
The anti-corruption campaigns have never really reached into the
military and corruption cases in the military have never been
publicly exposed.  In recent years, Jiang Zemin has been especially
careful to avoid involving the military in the anti-corruption
campaigns.  At this time, as Jiang is wooing the military for
support in the intense struggle for power in the post-Deng era, any
exposure of military corruption cases will definitely put Jiang in
a difficult position.  With so many factions in the military, it
will be very easy for one faction to find some pretext to strike at
another; Jiang certainly does not wish to be caught in the middle.

It is said that the relationship between Liu Shilun and General
Zhang Wannian, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and
chief of the General Staff, is very close.  Zhang Wannian had
several times recommended Liu Shilun for the position of the vice
chief of the General Staff, but his proposal was vehemently
rejected by General Chi Haotian, another vice chairman of the
Central Military Commission and the minister of national defense.
The exposure of Liu Shilun has evidently put Zhang Wannian at a
disadvantage at a crucial moment when Zhang Wannian and Chi Haotian
are both contending for membership on the standing committee of the
Politburo; at the same time, these two generals both carry
significant weight in support of Jiang Zemin in the scramble to
keep his position as the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party.  In view of the fact that Jiang Zemin has always favored
Zhang Wannian over Chi Haotian, the struggle that is now unfolding
surely will be intensely dramatic.

Local firms flood into Europe: 29 information technology companies hoping
to get closer to their clients

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Acer, Mitac and First International are among 29 major Taiwan information
technology (IT) firms that are currently building assembly plants or
expanding operations in Europe, industry experts said on Saturday.

 Jean Yves Yao, a section chief of the Chinese National Federation of
Industry (CNFI), said the ``companies want to be closer to their clients
so they can provide after-sales service.''

 Acer, the biggest local computer maker, began constructing an assembly
plant in Finland in late 1995 and may start operation next year. The
computer giant plans to use the Scandinavian country as a base for
marketing forays into Russia and other republics of the former Soviet
Union.

 It chose Finland because of its proximity and traditionally close
economic ties to Russia.

 Mitac next year will mark its tenth year of operations in Telford
Shropshire, the UK. It has invested about NT$68 million in a computer
peripherals plant in the industrial district.

 Mitac, Tatung, Lite-on and six other IT and electronics firms which have
made the UK their regional hub are benefiting from the longest average
working week in the European Union (EU) - 43.3 hours. They also enjoy
quick transport links to continental Europe through the English channel
tunnel, enabling them to deliver products to France and Germany in less
than two days.

 First International has an assembly plant in the Netherlands, which,
according to Yao, has the best transport system in Europe.

 ``Goods are brought to Rotterdam and then quickly shipped to users,''
said Yao.

 The Netherlands also boasts the lowest incidence of labor disputes in
Europe - it lost an average of only 13 working days per 1,000 employees
every year from 1991 to 1993. Greece, which has the worst labor record in
the EU, lost an average of 1,780 working days per 1,000 employees every
year in the same period.

 Joseph Chwo-ming Yu, a professor at the National Cheng Chi University,
said many IT firms are planning to expand operations in Europe as a hedge
against declining sales in other markets.

 For instance, Acer's sales last month, NT$3.642 billion, dipped 25
percent from the level in the same period last year. Mitac's sales
likewise dropped last month, by 18 percent to NT$912 million from the
figure in August 1995.

 According to Yu, about 34 percent of all local IT firms already serve the
European market. About the same number sell products to either North
America or China. Also, 24 of the 29 firms with big investment plans in
Europe now make over 60 percent of total sales in foreign markets.

Investment in Austria heading for early profit

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 VIENNA - Atomos Petrochemie, Taiwan's largest investment in Austria by
the Dahin Group, is going to celebrate its first anniversary on Sept. 30
with a silver lining on the horizon.

 Kevin Liu, president of Atomos Petrochemie, said on Saturday that he
believes the more than US$28-million investment project will prove
profitable in the first year.

 Dahin Group bought the petrochemical plant last year for US$28 million
from the state-run Chemie Linz. Atomos Petrochemie, located in the
Schwechat petrochemical industrial park near Vienna International Airport,
mainly produces PA (phthalic anhydride), an up-stream fossil material for
making plastics.

 Liu said since the plant began operation last September, its annual
output of chemical materials has increased from 38,000 metric tons to
42,000 metric tons and is expected to reach 45.000 metric tons within a
short period of time.

 Half of the plant's PA output is exported to Asian countries, while the
rest of it goes to Austria, Germany, France and Italy, Liu said.

 PA can be used to make a variety of products, ranging from nipples on
infants' milk bottles to medical gloves.

 Liu said that because of automated production lines, besides his wife and
himself, the plant hired only some 40 Austrian employees. While speaking
highly of the work force in Austria, Liu said the welfare system for the
employees sometimes was a headache in the factory management.

 Austria has proved to be conveniently located, allowing Atomos to acquire
raw materials from resource-rich countries such as the former Soviet
Union, the Netherlands, Croatia, Hungary and Slovakia, Liu said.

 On the future development of the petrochemical plant, Liu said that Dahin
Group decided to further invest five or six million US dollars to install
a co-generation facility in the plant. After the completion of the
facility by the end of next year, the next step is to set up down-stream
factories to be in line with its current Austrian production base, Liu
said.

 Dahin is one of the largest petrochemical intermediary producers in
Taiwan. Its production lines include PU resin, DOP and polymer materials.
The company has made huge investments in China, Hong Kong and Southeast
Asia.

Far Eastern Group looking to raise cash

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 The Far Eastern Group hopes to raise US$120 million in funds for two of
its companies by selling global depositary receipts (GDRs) in Europe this
year.

 GDRs are bonds that are convertible into warrants - certificates allowing
the transfer of the bonds into stocks - and are held on reserve in banks.

 Jean-Francois di Meglio, country manager of French bank Banque Paribas,
said last week that his banks, BZW and ING Barings, lead the world in the
sale of GDRs. They expect to sell US$60 million worth of GDRs for Far
Eastern Silo and Shipping before the end of the year.

 ``GDRs are currently at a premium. It's more difficult for foreigners to
buy GDRs. But they are largely responsible for the building up of the
Taiwan stock exchange since March of this year,'' said di Meglio.

 C.S. Tsai, a senior official of the Intercontinental Commercial Bank of
China (ICBC), said the ICBC is co-underwriting the sale of GDRs for Far
Eastern Textile. The textile firm is releasing over 30 million shares
worth over US$60 million. The sale began on September 12.

 The two Far Eastern companies reportedly will use funds generated from
the GDR sale to clear bank debts and to finance expansion projects.

 A high-ranking Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official said the
boom in the sale of GDRs and corporate bonds is likely to continue on the
strength of high annual profits from bond funds.

 Di Meglio, however, said GDR investors are demanding that the ROC
government give them a guarantee of convertibility from the date of bond
issue. The government has restricted conversion in the past due to a fear
of capital outflows.

MOEA approves US$328 in investments

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 The Ministry of Economic Affairs approved a series of new investment
projects yesterday worth US$328 million that include foreigners'
investments in Taiwan and Taiwan outbound investments, including several
going to China.

 The ministry gave the nod to eight plans by foreign firms to invest up to
US$266.4 million for projects inside Taiwan, and agreed to seven projects
for Taiwan companies to invest NT$36.24 million in China.

 Among the approved foreign investments here is one by GTE of the US,
which will remit US$32.7 million into Taiwan to set up a joint venture
with Taiwan partners that will offer the services of global system for
mobile phone communications in Taiwan. Germany's Mannesmann Eurokom will
also bring US$21.8 million into the joint venture.

 Two other foreign firms have been permitted to send capital into Taiwan
to also form joint ventures to provide telecom services.

 There were three new investment projects by Taiwan enterprises in China
and four firms with existing mainland investments plan to boost their
capital there.

 On of the major investors is Mitac International's US$10 million plan to
manufacture personal computers and peripherals in China.

 President Enterprises will spend US$996 million to establish a beer
brewery in Zhuhai, Guangdong province with the Kirin Group of Japan.

 And Yuen Foong Yu Paper will invest US$550 million to engage in the
production of paper, paper board, paper cartons, and printing business in
Xiamen, Fujian province.

3 new funds to pump NT$8b into Taiex

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Over NT$8 billion in new funds are ready to enter the stock market in the
next few days. Three securities consulting firms have successfully raised
the new capital through new mutual funds that focus on listed stocks.

 Yuan Ta Securities' new fund will top NT$4.5 billion. After six months,
the fund managers will raise the ratio of ``China concept'' shares -
shares of companies that have China investments - by over 60 percent.

 Fubon Securities' new fund will be over NT$2 billion with the initial
strategy focusing on a portfolio composed of shares in the electronic,
construction, and electric machinery industries as well as financial
institutions and China concept shares.

 Core Pacific Securities will also raise at least NT$1 billion. Before the
end of the first quarter of next year, the major emphasis will be on
shares favored by foreign institutional investors, while the focus will
shift to China concept shares in the second quarter of next year.

 Meanwhile the Vicarr Group of Hong Kong will launch stock warrants worth
US$10 million focusing on bluechip stocks selected by Morgan Stanley and
on China concept shares.

 The targeted stocks may include President Enterprises, Cheng Hsin Rubber,
Evergreen Marine, Yangming Marine, Pacific Construction, Chung Shing
Textile, Wei-Chuan Foods, Tong Yi INdustrial (tin cans), Kenda Rubber, and
Pou Chen Corp. (footwear).

China realtors to check out Taipei market

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 A 10-member delegation of real estate industry in Shanghai is scheduled
to arrive in Taipei tomorrow for a week-long market inspection tour.

 The delegation will be headed by Zhang Guijuan, a commissioner of the
Shanghai City Government's Urban Planning Commission, said Wang
Ying-chieh, president of the ROC Real Estate Brokerage Association.

 While here, Wang said, the Chinese delegates will attend a two-day
seminar to exchange views with their local counterparts on a number of
topics, including the current state of Taiwan's real estate market and its
public housing policy, as well as Shanghai's urban development plan,
housing policy, real estate industry regulations and investment tax
incentives.

 Meanwhile, Wang said, a large real estate industry delegation, made up of
urban planning officials and industry executives from Beijing, Zhuhai,
Fujian province and other mainland cities, will visit Taipei in late
October.

 The delegation, the largest of its kind ever to visit Taiwan, will meet
with their local counterparts to exchange expertise and experiences, as
well as to explore possible cooperation opportunities, Wang said.

Women's group hands out awards to `sisters'

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Special assistant to the DPP chairman Sissy Chen was recognized as being
the most daring woman who tried new jobs over the past year by the Taipei
Women Rights Promotion Association.

 The association marked its third founding anniversary yesterday by
selecting top 10 news making women who have drawn much public attention
over the past year.

 Chen made the list because she had changed jobs many times since her
return from the US a year ago, the association said.

 Chen first worked for a prospective woman presidential candidate, then
headed the DPP's publicity department. Following the March 23 presidential
election, she worked for a music company for a short period of time, and
then returned to the DPP to serve as Hsu's special assistant.

 The association selected Annie Lee as the ``best actress'' of a ``real
life'' soap opera.

 Lu first made headlines after accusing a Normal Taiwan University
professor of sexually harassing her. Lu blamed the professor for unfairly
preventing her from pursuing a doctoral degree at the school.

 She was later found to be having an affair with Wang Wen-yang, the son of
Formosa Plastics Group Chairman Wang Yung-ching. Wang was forced to resign
from his father's company after his affair with Lu were exposed.

 KMT Legislator Shen Chih-hui was selected ``the woman most vulnerable to
injuries'' because she sustained serious injuries after being kicked by
New Party Legislator Fu Kun-cheng.

 The association also selected Li Ming-jou, a radio DJ who was adored by
many teenagers, as the most daring woman for her sensational talks.

 Meanwhile, clients of all beauty centers were selected ``women easiest to
be conned.''

Ambassador issues open invitation

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 South African Ambassador Johannes L. Viljoen has expressed hope that more
Taiwan tourists will visit his country as a vacation destination.

 Viljoen, addressing a crowd at a flower exhibition on Saturday for Moon
Festival in Taichung, noted that 34,800 Taiwan tourists visited South
Africa last year.

 The number was the largest among Asian nations, and the fifth largest in
the world, he said, adding that South African attached great importance on
the high number of Taiwan tourists.

 Viljoen spoke enthusiastically about his country's wide range of
resources. He also noted that South African Airway's passenger potential
has increased by 20 percent annually.

 He said that South Africa is trying to attract more foreign tourists by
promoting its unique culture, climate and scenic beauty.

 South Africa will enter into spring next month and the welcome mat is out
for Taiwan.

Gambling plan slammed: Legalized gambling will only lead to more crime,
official

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 The legalization of gambling is not likely to eradicate underground
gambling houses in Taiwan, a senior tourist official said yesterday.

 ``The legalization of gambling would only serve as fuel for the gambling
fever here,'' Chang Hsueh-lao, deputy director-general of the Tourism
Bureau, asserted in a TTV news program.

 Gambling is rampant in Taiwan even though it is illegal. Some lawmakers
have urged the government to allow the establishment of tourist casinos
which they say can help increase government tax revenues and wipe out
underground gambling houses.

 Speaking on a TTV news program, Chang refuted the argument, saying local
people generally do not like to gamble at public places.

 ``I'm afraid that legally licensed casinos cannot attract prospective
gamblers,'' he noted.

 Chang further said legalization of gambling may give local people the
misleading impression that gambling is not a bad thing. This message would
help fuel the gambling mania around the island.

 The Tourism Bureau has considered opening tourist casinos on selected
offshore islands to lure foreign tourists, Chang said, adding that such
casinos would only be open to foreign passport holders. However, Chang
said, the bureau has dropped the idea after a feasibility study showed
negative results.

 For one thing, Chang said, establishing a casino alone cannot attract
foreign tourists to Taiwan. It is also not expected to provide enough
incentive to lure local gamblers who are usually more interested in
gambling at underground places where gamblers can hide their true
identities and engage in all types of games.

 Several lawmakers earlier this year jointly drafted a bill governing the
establishment of tourist casinos. According to the draft bill, such
casinos would be open to local people aged 18 or older. Strong opposition
from the government and academics persuaded the Legislative Yuan's
Judiciary Committee to not screen the controversial bill.

PRC claim on ROC `unjustified': academic

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 BRUSSELS - Beijing's claim that Taiwan is a part of its territory cannot
be justified under modern international law, according to a well known
Belgian academic.

 Jean-Marie Henckaerts, professor of international law at the University
of Brussels, states in a new book that Taiwan is a de facto country in
terms of international law, even if it is not yet recognized by all
countries in the world.

 The book, The International Status of Taiwan in the New World Order,
published in Boston and London in September, is a compilation of the
papers and reports read at a symposium sponsored by the University of
Brussels last June.

 Henckaerts states that a country is only a means of providing protection
to its people rather than a goal in itself, therefore, it is up to the
people of Taiwan to determine what is best for them and who owns the
island.

 In his view, Taiwan has met every criteria necessary to become a member
of the United Nations. No rules under current international law forbid
Taiwan from joining that world body.

 The author doubted Beijing's sovereignty claim to Taiwan, saying the
People's Republic of China, established in 1949, has not ruled the
territory governed by the Republic of China since 1945.

 Henckaerts can not see how Beijing can threaten to take Taiwan by force.
He believes it is the moral and legal duty of the international community
to safeguard Taiwan's freedom of choice, and make it clear to Beijing that
the international community will not accept the use of force as a way to
solve the Taiwan issue.

 He urges European countries to form a common front to deal with Beijing.

6,000 protest Japan's claims: Taipei march to `protect the Tiaoyutai'

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 More than 6,000 protesters took to the streets of Taipei yesterday
morning in the largest demonstration yet against Japan's recent claims to
the disputed Tiaoyutai islands.

 Led by a huge ROC flag and chanting ``protect the Tiaoyutai'' and ``down
with Chinese militarism,'' the protesters wound their way from the Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall, through downtown Taipei to the Sun Yat-sen
Memorial Hall.

 As they marched, the feelings of frustration and indignation were strong.

 ``The Tiaoyutai islands belong to the Chinese,'' protester Wei Tsu-chun
said. ``We Chinese people cannot be bullied by any country. We cannot
tolerate any country invading our territory.''

 ``Every Chinese person is furious when we hear Japan occupies our
Tiaoyutai islands,'' protester Chang Shu-fan said. ``I wish they would
leave immediately.''

 A wooden model of Bruce Lee was raised above the crowd along with a
Japanese sumo wrestler for Bruce Lee to kick. Above the models, a sign
read: ``The fierce dragon saves the nation.''

 New Party Legislator Chu Hui-liang, speaking at a rally following the
march, focused on rejecting what she called the Japanese cultural
infiltration of Taiwan by programming on cable TV.

 ``We want to see our own programs, right?'' she shouted to the crowd.
``Right,'' came the unanimous reply.

 Several other New Party lawmakers took turns to call on President Lee
Teng-hui for stronger action to assert sovereignty over the islands. They
also called for a boycott of Japanese goods.

 The New Party, which organized the event along with the ROC Alliance for
the Protection of the Tiaoyutai, gathered signatures for a drive to send a
million petitions to the president.

 One man holding a picture of Lee Teng-hui shouted: ``Remove Lee Tenghui
from office.''

 ``Lee Teng-hui has Japanese relatives, that is why he is so weak,'' he
said.

 Li Mi, a professor of International Ocean Law at National Taiwan Ocean
University, said: ``Look at Korea. They stood up against Japan and Japan
left. The people in Taiwan are different, though.''

 Shung King Fai, a Hong Kong Regional Council member, also took part in
yesterday's protest, telling the rally that all Chinese people should
unite in defense of the Tiaoyutai islands.

 Meanwhile, a small group of protesters set sail from Hong Kong yesterday
for a three-day trip to the Tiaoyutai chain.

 The protesters plan to raise a Chinese flag on one of the islands.

 Japanese coastal authorities have said they will turn the boat back if it
tries to enter its territorial waters.

 ``We emphasis that our protest will be peaceful but we are also prepared
to sacrifice ourselves to protect our islands,'' said spokesman David Chan.

 The ship carried 18 protesters, all men and aged between 25 to 68,
wearing green T-shirts and red headbands.

 The cargo ship was chartered by the Alliance of Worldwide Chinese for the
Protection of the Tiaoyutai Islands. It also carried 42 accompanying
journalists and 19 crew members.

 It was renamed the ``Bao-Tiao,'' or ``Tiaoyutai Islands Defender,'' for
the trip.

 ``We have taken no weapons,'' said Captain Ngai Lup-chee. ``If the
Japanese shoot at us, we will get away.''

 The group has asked for protection from the Chinese navy.

 Meanwhile, Japanese media reported yesterday that President Lee has
expressed the desire to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto to talk about regional security.

 Lee apparently made the request to Shinji Sato, president of Liberal
Democratic Party's Sino-Japanese parliamentarian group, earlier this month.

 The chance of such a meeting taking place, however, is considered slim.

Deep Chinese rifts remain despite anti-Japan unity

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 At a glance, it would seem Asia's disparate Chinese communities at last
have found a common voice as they angrily denounce Japan's claim of
sovereignty over a deserted East China Sea archipelago.

 But have they?

 In the weeks since Japanese ultranationalists built a shaky lighthouse to
assert Japan's title to what it calls the Senkaku islands, a collective
Chinese howl of indignation has arisen in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and
China.

 Daily protests, mostly small but a few attracting 10,000 or more people,
have stirred a sense that after a century of profound political rifts and
civil war, Chinese fundamental interests have begun to coalesce, with
Japan as catalyst.

 Fuelled by the islands dispute, this anti-Japanese Chinese nationalism
peaked on Sept. 18 - 65 years to the day after Japan invaded northeast
China to visit 14 years of atrocities on China's people and drag Asia into
World War II.

 Observers muse aloud whether the seemingly unanimous Chinese reaction to
Japan's territorial claim - that the islands are called the Tiaoyutai, not
the Senkakus, and belong to China - signals a closing of Chinese ranks.

 Has a ``Chinese century'' begun to dawn?

 Political experts say no, pointing to deep-seated and complex forces they
say will check the emergence of any influential new ``greater China''
nationalism or realignments in the fundamental China-Taiwan-Hong Kong
balance of power.

 Both Beijing and Taipei, experts say, are unwilling to allow a dispute
with Japan over the unpopulated isles to affect their own five-decade-old
battle of wits over the fate of Taiwan - a far higher priority - or to
stir up domestic unrest.

 ``Cross-strait ties (between Taiwan and China) have a special dynamic
which will not be influenced by the Tiaoyutai island row,'' said Soochow
University political scientist Luo Chih-chen.

 Luo said Beijing could not forcefully assert its sovereignty because this
would highlight its failure to win back Taiwan.

 ``In essence, the Tiaoyutai problem is the same as the Taiwan problem,''
Luo said. ``If China wanted to face the Tiaoyutai problem, it would be
forced to face the Taiwan problem.''

 Gallup pollster Tim Ting said it was impossible for China and Taiwan to
mount a united stand or even take firm unilateral measures against Japan,
since China fears offending Japanese investors and Taiwan wants to count
on Japanese and US support in any confrontation with the mainland.

 ``Chances are Taiwan, Japan and China will all play down the sovereignty
issue and the only understanding reached eventually will be on something
less controversial, like fishing rights in waters around the islands,''
Ting said.

 Powerful local forces are also at work, analysts say.

 Most of Taiwan's anti-Japan protests have been organized by the tiny but
vocal New Party, whose members hope to use the islands issue to undermine
President Lee Teng-hui, who they suspect longs for Taiwan's formal
independence rather than integration with China.

 ``It is only very few people in Taiwan who are trying to use this
opportunity to arouse nationalistic sentiment,'' said political scientist
Lu Ya-li of National Taiwan University.

 ``The majority of people, quite frankly, don't care.''

 In Hong Kong, even the Democratic party, which fears a loss of freedom in
the British colony after it returns to Chinese rule in mid-1997, has
voiced support for Beijing's claim to the Tiaoyutai islands and suspicion
of Japan.

 But analysts say various groups have different motives for urging Beijing
to use force to claim back the islands.

 ``For pro-China parties, this is simply a chance to win favor with
Beijing,'' a Taipei diplomat said.

 ``But for the Democrats, pressuring Beijing for a military response is a
way of wielding a very popular issue to exert political influence that
China does not want them to have.''

MAC calls for strong post 1997 links

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chang King-yuh has called for a solid
and stable relationship between Taiwan and Hong Kong after the British
colony's handover to Chinese rule in 1997.

 Speaking at a Taipei seminar on Taiwan-Hong Kong-China trade and economic
relations after 1997 over the weekend, Chang said a solid and stable
Taiwan-Hong Kong relationship would serve as the starting point for the
development of new trade and economic, and even general relations, among
the three Chinese communities.

 Chang, however, warned that post-1997 TaiwanHong Kong ties would be
lacking protection without the support of government authorities.

 Chang stressed that to maintain a stable post1997 Taiwan-Hong Kong
relationship would involve such sensitive issues as marine transportation
and Taiwan agencies' stay in Hong Kong. He said the council was ready to
talk with Beijing on these issues.

 He said that Beijing's recent promulgation of regulations governing
Taiwan-China shipping was just part of its `twohanded' policy aimed at
alienating Taiwan so as to enable itself to play a dominant role in
post-1997 Taiwan-Hong Kong relations, and force Taipei to accept its
version of the `one China' principle.

Overseas Chinese may improve ties

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 CANBERRA - Overseas Chinese in Australia and many other countries can
play a role in boosting understanding and peace between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, the vice chairman of Overseas Chinese Affairs
Commission (OCAC) said Saturday.

 In an interview with the CNA, Hung Tung-kuei said she believed overseas
Chinese can contribute a great deal by persuading Beijing leaders that,
``Chinese do not fight Chinese.''

 During her first visit to Australia since assuming her present position
three months ago, Hung spoke of her visits to Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand, Austria, San Francisco, Houston and South Africa and of the
overseas Chinese she had met living in these places.

 ``Everywhere I go, I convey the message of President Lee Teng-hui and
Vice President Lien Chan. The ROC government will not forget contributions
made by overseas Chinese and will increase relations with them,'' she said.

 She said there are still many tasks to be accomplished for helping
overseas Chinese and improving relations with them, including language
training, cultural seminars and the provision of Chinese educational
materials.

 ``The promotion of Chinese language and culture among overseas Chinese
worldwide is one of the main objectives of our government,'' she said.

 She said most Chinese parents residing in other countries have come to
know the importance of Chinese language and culture for their children.

 An increasing number of foreign governments also have come to realize
that Chinese language is a very important tool in their push to open vast
markets in Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China. In addition, many
Southeast Asian countries have millions of overseas Chinese playing
important roles in their business and economic sectors, she noted.

 She said the purpose of her trips is to meet as many overseas Chinese as
possible and in doing so, learn what the ROC government can offer to
fulfill their needs.

Beijing asked to take back illegals

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 With the approach of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) has again urged China to implement the Kinmen Agreement and
immediately take back the 800-plus current illegal mainland immigrants.

 ``As the Mid-Autumn Festival is an important occasion for family
gatherings for the Chinese, we hope all detained mainland immigrants will
be able to return to their homeland before the festival,'' said MAC Vice
Chairman Kao Koonglian on Sunday.

 The Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as Moon Festival, falls on Sept. 27
this year.

 To show his concern for detained migrants, MAC Chairman Chang King-yuh
will make an inspection tour of the Hsinchu detention house in northern
Taiwan on Monday. It is the largest of the five mainland migrants
detention centers in Taiwan.

 According to the Kinmen Agreement signed by the ROC Red Cross Society and
its mainland counterpart in September 1990, each side is obligated to take
back people who have illegally entered the other territory.

 Under the agreement, mainland authorities must send ships to Taiwan's
offshore islands of Kinmen or Matsu to take back their illegal immigrants,
while Taiwan is responsible for sending the immigrants to Kinmen or Matsu.

 Over the past six years, China has not only been unable to effectively
rein in its people's immigration drive but has also been slow in taking
back illegals held in Taiwan, adding to Taiwan's social burden.

 Moreover, some detained illegal mainland immigrants have staged hunger
strikes to protest their long detention in Taiwan.

 MAC statistics show that Taiwan has detained 34,019 illegal mainland
immigrants since 1987. A total of 33,200 of them have been repatriated but
a large portion remain at five detention centers around the island. About
20 of them have been in Taiwan for more than a year.

Prosecutors to lose power to detain suspects

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Prosecutors will lose their power to order the indefinite detention of
suspects under investigation, according to a revision being made to the
Code of Criminal Procedure.

 The revision was recently worked out by an ad hoc committee of the
Judicial Yuan to comply with a ruling by the Council of Grand Justices.
The ruling states that such powers are unconstitutional and must be
revised by the end of next year.

 Prosecutors have been authorized to detain suspects because they used to
be considered part of the court system, but the Council of Grand Justices
believes that prosecutors and judges have different duties and therefore
belong to different systems.

 Under the revision, all decisions to order custody of suspects must be
approved by court judges instead of prosecutors, beginning in 1998.

 In addition to the part concerning the power of custody, some provisions
of the Code of Criminal Procedure will also revised according to the
revision to be sent to the legislature for screening and approval.

 For instance, the maximum period of custody for investigation will be
shortened from two to one month, but will be able to be extended for a
month if necessary. Custody for trials will be shortened to two months.

 Under no circumstances can a person suspected of committing a minor crime
and is subject to only a fine, be taken into custody.

 Police will not be allowed to question suspects in the evenings, unless
such questioning is approved by prosecutors or judges in advance because
of the pressing need to get information related to the crimes they have
committed, according to the revision.

Peng feels no remorse over DPP: Ex-DPP presidential candidate critical of
plans to negotiate with KMT

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Former DPP presidential candidate Peng Ming-min yesterday again blasted
the DPP for its plan to cooperate with the KMT, saying the party should
try to expand its popular base by persuading people to accept its policies
instead of bargaining with the KMT for a few government posts.

 Peng made the remark while presiding over the inauguration of the
Kaohsiung branch of the NationBuilding Association, which he founded after
the March presidential race.

 Some of the association's leaders have recently announced their plan to
break away from the DPP to organize a new political party the Taiwan
Independence Party, after accusing the DPP of softening its stand on
Taiwan independence.

 Peng told his supporters that he did not owe the DPP anything. He said he
won the DPP's presidential nomination because of his efforts in vying for
voter support during the primaries.

 Peng said he has delivered 300 public speeches pushing his political
ideals long before the DPP decided to nominate him to run for the
presidency.

 His role in the presidential election prevented the DPP from breaking up
earlier, Peng said.

 ``It was wrong for the DPP to describe itself as the `mainstream' of
Taiwan's opposition movement,'' Peng said. ``The DPP is nothing but an
`episode' of this movement that started after Japan occupied Taiwan nearly
a century ago.''

 Peng criticized DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang for meeting President Lee in
private. ``The DPP should fight to become the ruling party by appealing
for public support with its policies and by supervising the KMT's
administration, instead of trying to get a few government posts through
secret deals with the KMT,'' Peng said.

 DPP Spokesman and Cultural Affairs Director Kuo Cheng-liang said he
sympathizes with Peng's situation after losing the presidential race, but
added that he could not agree with Peng's criticism of the party.

 The DPP has never before negotiated with the KMT for a few posts as a
condition for its cooperation with the KMT, nor has it done anything to
betray the opposition movement.

 The DPP might have adjusted its way of thinking, but this is because it
has to consider the Taiwan issue from a broader point of view for the sake
of Taiwan's future, instead of judging things from the standpoint of
people suffering from political persecution as it did in the past, Kuo
said.

 Kuo said he did not expect Peng to be punished for openly criticizing the
DPP. ``Peng is still a senior adviser to the DPP, but he has not paid his
party membership fees for a long time,'' Kuo said while explaining Peng's
status in the party.

Taiwan is a `treasure island`

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Taiwan is a good place for treasure hunting and archaeological studies
judging from the huge number of sunken vessels in waters in this area,
experts said yesterday.

 A group of archaeologists led by Huang Kuang-nan, curator of the Taiwan
History Museum, have recently found hundreds of pieces of antiques hidden
in a sunken vessel near Penghu.

 Their discovery was a encouragement to people who are planning to explore
what might have be buried at the bottom of the sea around Taiwan.

 ``There were more than 10,000 sunken vessels in the Taiwan Strait
according to historical documents,'' said Wu Chien-ming, chairman of the
Water Resources Planning Committee under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

 As early as 1830, Great Britain began running the sea route between
Europe and China. After that, more vessels came from the US and other
European countries, Wu said.

 There were few documents concerning vessels in distress before 1850.
According to an American reporter's investigative report, between 1850 and
1870, over 150 vessels capsized in the Taiwan Strait, Wu said.

Lake swimmers go for world record

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Over 11,000 people participated in a swim across Sun Moon Lake yesterday,
hoping to earn a spot in the Guinness Book of Records.

 With the crack of the starters pistol at 9:00 am sharp, the swimmers
splashed into the scenic lake in Nantou County, central Taiwan. Lin
Chiang-tsai, commissioner of Taiwan Province Department of Construction,
and Lin Yuan-Lang, Nantou County magistrate, fired the starting shots.

 Hsieh Shen-shan, chairman of the Council for Labor Affairs, Legislators
Liao Hsue-kuang and Tsaur Eel-jong also took part in the swim.

 For safety reasons, the organizing committee asked swimmers to stay in
groups of three or five. Several boats and 200 lifeguards were on hand to
protect the participants.

 Officials from the Guinness Book of Records were invited to witness the
swim across the 2,515 meterwide lake.

 Also, 216 disabled people took part in the swim.

 Officials of the organizing committee said that they are trying to list
the event in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest group swim ever
completed.
