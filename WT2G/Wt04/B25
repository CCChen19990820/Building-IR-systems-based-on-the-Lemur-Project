OF THE OGONI PEOPLE</H3>
 
</center>
FIRST MEETING WITH BRIAN ANDERSON<p>
 <p>
I first met Brian Anderson the chairman and managing director of Shell Nigeria on the Queens birthday party 1995 in Lagos, and he promises to my wife to help, to see that Ken gets adequate medical attention, he says he will see what he can do and we leave at the end of the party and I write of my encounter to Ken send it through my wife who leaves this day to see Ken and through this letter we are very happy to learn that Ken has been taken to the hospital the military hospital for the first time after being in detention for about 11 months.<p>
 <p>
SECOND MEETING WITH BRIAN ANDERSON<p>
 <p>
Well I asked him if he would use his influence to stop the trial announced so that Ken can get can get out of the illegal detention and so that negotiation can start between Shell and the Ogoni people. And he says that's difficult, but not impossible but that the international campaign is hurting Shell and the Nigerian government and if we can stop the campaign that he might be able to do something.<p>
 <p>
So I tell him that I don't have the power to do that, but however I will pass the information to Ken,  and he also at that time said I should try and get into the press - to get a press release and get him a copy, you know mentioning the fact that there is no environmental devastation in Ogoniland and I just say how can I do that, you mean I tell the world that what we've been saying ever since 1990 is a lie, there is no way I will do that.  And that happened at our second meeting.<p>
 <p>
THIRD MEETING WITH BRIAN ANDERSON<p>
 <p>
I wrote to Ken and Ken replied back with a letter to Brian Anderson where he gives him two scenarios. The first one - Ken gets killed and becomes a martyr or they [Shell] did the right thing, use their influence with the Nigerian government and get him out of their illegal detention and stop the charade of the tribunal. And when that happens the lobby with the writers will stop, the lobby by the human rights groups will stop and that remains the environmental campaigners and when the environmental lobby sees that he is now discussing with Shell they will lower
or stop their campaign.<p>
 <p>
Mr Brian Anderson tells me that he will no longer be available for further discussion as he'll be travelling frequently but that I should continue the discussion with Mr Achebe.  Mr Achebe  stresses the importance of continuous dialogue and after a week I phone Achebe and I'm told he's in Germany I phone again a second time and I'm told he's in Abucja and I phone again and I'm told he's in Port Harcourt holding meetings with other Ogoni people and I phone another time and he's not in the office and all this time I'm leaving my number and my messages and I don't get any reply so I now switch back to phone Anderson both in his office and in his house.  Now I phoned the first time in his house and they tell me he's at a cocktail party I phone another time and he's having lunch and I ask whether I can phone after lunch I don't get any answer, but I still phone and still he's not available and I phone another time and I hear he's not around you know and then I sort if get the message and I write back to Ken that it appears that I'm being avoided and Ken writes back - that I shouldn't bother as it appears a decision has been made.<p>
 <p>
  <p>
DEVASTATION OF OGONILAND<p>
 <p>
Ogoni environment is devastated. I got involved in Ogoniland after coming back to Ogoni after my University medical school and then the first thing that struck me is that the trees around my father's house the oranges and the guavas are no longer there the ones there are not producing any fruit and they sort of shrunken. Then I go to the hospital and the spectrum of diseases I see there is quite different from the ones I was taught at school or the ones I saw in other places I'd worked in Nigeria. A lot of respiratory diseases - high incidence of asthma, cancer, bronchitis and I'm quite surprised and also some bizarre skin diseases and a high level of miscarriages which is quite different from other areas in Nigeria that are not producing oil. And the land Ogoni is a small place  about 404 square miles 12 miles by 32 and large expanse of land that nothing grows on because of the oil spillages that have happened because of oil blow outs gas flares all over Ogoniland. You don't know when it is night it's always glowing. With the noise from the flow stations - it's very deafening and the people speak rather they shout the way of talking because they have to get across to the other person. And the pipe line gas and oil pipelines criss-crossing the whole place on the surface of the ground passing in front of houses at the back of houses on farm land unprotected. <p>
 <p>
 <p>
SHELL CLAIM SABOTAGE BY OGONI<p>
 <p>
Shell claims that the environmental devastation in Ogoniland is due to sabotage of the installations by Ogoni people, as far as I know no Ogoni person no MOSOP activist has ever been convicted of sabotage of oil installations. The Ogoni people would be the last people on earth to go near the Shell installations because they know that if anything goes wrong on the pipelines or on the installations it is their land which they hold precious that will be spoiled - that will be devastated it is their streams from which they fish and drink water that will be polluted because their is no piped on water in Ogoniland it's only the water from the streams so no Ogoni person will go near any Shell<p>
installation for sabotage because that would lead to spillage and we understand spillages and devastated land more than any people in this world.<p>
 <p>
EVIDENCE THAT SHELL ARE INVOLVED WITH MILITARY<p>
 <p>
I drive down to the village of Korokor-tai when I get there I meet another young man on the ground in a pool of blood at the feet of his mother and I'm told that he was shot by Major [Okuntino??] who had come there in the Shell bus accompanied by Shell executives and they had come to the village, said they were coming to look for Shell trucks. In my clinic in Bori Ogoniland I see the police constable coming to my clinic to tell me that all Ogoni people in the police in Ogoni land have been transferred out and I'm scared and he shows me the posting order<p>
transferring them and immediately I get to my car because that's frightening and go to visit my brother in hospital and I tell him what I've just heard and give him the police posting order and he immediately writes on it telling the world about what is happening and he's afraid that the first episode of genocide is being planned against the people, the Ogoni people.<p>
 <p>
I see foreign journalists in Bori and I ask what's happening they said they heard that there's shooting a journalist from the Guardian of London and one from the Independent.  And I take them to the village Kaa where most of my patients come from and we arrive there and it's like a small atomic bomb has been placedon the village I mean dropped on the village, everything the market is completely destroyed, the school the houses even the trees are on the ground and it is very very frightening and wedo know this time there were police, I mean a military presence in Ogoniland. They were stationed not too far from my clinic so I go back to the army and ask them what has happened, and we go
back there and they see the place and one of the officials says that he hasn't seen this sort of thing even while he was serving in Liberia that no destruction has ever been to this level and in that particular incident 35 people are killed and it continues like that another 7 Ogoni villages are all destroyed and a total of about one thousand people are killed in these raids by people using sophisticated weapons on unarmed villages and my patients tell me that the soldiers arrived across Andoni river with Shell boats  and while all this is going on we notice the presence of Shell helicopters hovering around and we're actually very very worried.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
DETENTION OF OWENS WIWA<p>
 <p>
On the 26th December 1993 on Boxing day I'm in my house with my wife who's pregnant and her sister as well come to spend Christmas with us and a captain in the Nigerian army Captain Tunde Odina comes in and has a beer in my house and eats the food my wife has prepared and at the end of it he tells me to take a holiday, to leave Ogoniland go to Lagos or somewhere.<p>
 <p>
At about 5 O'clock another Major comes in he calls himself Major Akintola of the Army Intelligence Unit at the Brigade in Bori camp and he tells me that the governor of the state Lieutenant Colonel Komo wants to see me and Barika Idamkue because at this time Barika Idamkue is the secretary of the Ogoni Relief and Rehabilitation Committee and I'm the coordinator so I mean we go there happily thinking that the Governor wants to give some relief to the people so at the end of the conversation I tell him that I was told by a captain, Captain Tunde Odina that I was to be arrested.  So the Governor tells me that is not true that is just one of the rumours that we hear and keep telling people and<p>
there's nothing like that so I go back to my house have dinner with my family and go to bed.<p>
 <p>
At about 2am the same captain who had come to my house you know to eat and drink comes in shouting, breaking my door and asks where is Dr Wiwa, I say well I'm here and then the other soldiers climb the fence and generally make noise and then I ask what is the matter and he tells me you are, by the order of the Federal Republic of Nigeria you are under arrest.  So I go back to my room change into my clothes and go into the 504 military vehicle and the other soldiers enter squeeze me in and they take me straight to the country home of Mr Ledum Mitee the Deputy president of MOSOP and repeat the same sort of thing they did in my house and bring the guy into the car and then the soldiers are coming inside too with their guns reeking of alcohol and marijuana and generally threatening us you know, and took us straight to the Air force base in Port Harcourt and later to the house of the government reservation division in Port Harcourt.<p>
 <p>
And we stayed there until the 4th of January at about 5 O'clock or so Major Okuntimo comes in to meet us and to discuss.  We ask him why we are detained he doesn't tell us anything, all he says is he's following his orders and then curiously asks us that since MOSOP is big it's powerful that we should join forces with him you know to see that one Mr Lawson-Jack senior executive of Shell in Port Harcourt is removed and we tell him that we don't do things like that.  We talk about ideas and how to change corporate behaviour in terms of the environmental devastation of Ogoniland we are not in for removing individuals and all that and he insist and so we ask him why, why do you want the man off?  and then he explains that the man has been undercutting him in his payments that he was also receiving from Shell.<p>
 <p>
And after our discussion he tells us that we are released and on getting out I meet my mother-in-law and I ask about my wife and she answers that they are fine, I say what do you mean they are fine?  I only have one wife, so she says they are fine that you have a child I said a child ?, she said yes, a son, I said yes how do I know it's a son I said I dreamt you know but then my wife is not due but I rushed down to the hospital that she's supposed to have delivered and I go in there and see her very happy and beside her there's, there's a young kid you know all red and cries when he sees me and I go and pick up my son and I feel very happy and I decide to forget and forgive my detention because that has brought me a son and asked my wife how everything happens and she tells me that after they are taking me away after some hours when daylight was coming she decides to come and look for me.  And at this time there are many roadblocks manned by the army in Ogoniland and she is stopped in one of the roadblocks and she comes out, she is asked to come out of the car, she comes out and they ask her who she is and she tells the person that she's my wife and they say Oh that trouble maker so they ask her to identify herself further , she says she's a housewife and housewives don't carry ID cards. So they search her and they decide to search her person and she doesn't like that and the army man tell her to go into the stream, the stream is polluted covered with oil, my wife doesn't know how to swim.  She protests, she gets the gun, they put up the gun pushing her from the back and she is pushed into the pond, into the stream but because of her hydrophobia she comes out and then the man aims the nozzle of the gun at her pregnant abdomen and then contractions start to come on and that process leads her to the hospital and my baby comes out born on January 4th Ogoni day and that's how I get my child.<p>

The environmental and social
costs of living with Shell in Nigeria
Greenpeace International - intro</title></head><body>
<body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ffffff" link="#ff0000" alink="#ff0000" vlink="#00ff00">

<p><H2>Introduction</H2>


<pre>'The flames of Shell are flames of Hell,
We bask below their light,
Nought for us to serve the blight,
Of cursed neglect and cursed Shell.'<a href="refer.html#3>3</a>3
_ Ogoni song</pre>

<p>The Royal Dutch/Shell Group is one of the largest businesses in the world  
with interests in over 3,000 companies and operations in more than 100 
countries<a href="refer.html#4>4</a>.  While this report focuses on the way in which Shell conducts its 
business in the Niger Delta, it has wider implications in that it exemplifies the 
environmental and social costs of oil.

<p>To somebody recently acquainted with the subject, the Ogoni's situation may 
seem more about human rights than the environment. After all, Nigeria has a 
history of puppet dictators, military rule and has denied its people democratic 
elections and minority rights.  The Ogoni issue however is more reaching and 
symbolic because it highlights the possible outcome for communities who 
object to the decimation of their natural resources.

<p>The Niger Delta and Nigerian coastal wetlands have been described as one 
of the most fragile ecosystems in the world and include rainforest and 
mangrove habitats<a href="refer.html#5>5</a>.  Because of the intense industrial activity, the area has 
been labelled the most endangered delta in the world<a href="refer.html#6>6</a>.  Demand for land is 
high with over six million people living in the region<a href="refer.html#7>7</a> and only 30% of the 
delta unaffected by flooding.  Certain areas of the delta are densely 
populated, such as the region of Ogoni, which averages 1,250 people per 
kilometre, compared to the Nigerian average of 300 per kilometre.

<p>The Ogoni, a distinct ethnic group within the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 
have a long history of preserving their surrounding environment which they 
regard as sacred.  Rivers and streams provide water for bathing, drinking and 
fish for food, so are bound up intricately with the life of the community.  The 
Ogoni, whose population is approximately 500,000, occupy an area of 404 
square miles<a href="refer.html#8>8</a>.  The heavy competition between the oil companies and the 
Ogoni for what is, by-right, Ogoni land has resulted in extreme tension in the 
area and the severe punishment of the community.

<p>Shell has been operating in the Niger Delta since 1958.  In its thirty-six years 
of operations, rather than setting standards and promoting a positive 
relationship with local people, as well as sound environmental and social 
policies, the company seemingly has done little.
The importance of Nigeria's oil to Shell cannot be underestimated, accounting 
for almost 14% of the company's production which equates to the greatest 
production outside the USA<a href="refer.html#9>9</a>.  Neither can the importance of oil sales to the 
Nigerian government be underestimated, accounting for around 80% of 
government revenue<a href="refer.html#10>10</a>.   Therefore, both Shell and the Nigerian government 
have an interest in maintaining the status quo and continuing with business 
as usual.

<p>For those in power, the Ogoni's campaign to protect their environment cannot 
gain momentum or international acclaim because it raises uncomfortable 
questions about the rights of communities to control their local environment 
and the rights of multinational oil companies.  So with brute force and 
systematic violence, the Ogoni are being silenced.

<p>The way in which Shell conducts its business in Ogoni is an indication of the 
way in which Big Oil operates abroad without proper policing.  Furthermore, 
the brutality waged upon the Ogoni, as a result of their campaign to protect 
their environment, is a  byproduct of society's increasing consumption of 
natural resources.   In effect, it is a microcosm of what we are doing to the 
entire earth _ just less visibly.

<html><head><title>KEN SARO-WIWA'S CLOSING STATEMENT TO THE NIGERIAN MILITARY
APPOINTED TRIBUNAL</title></head><body>
<body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ffffff" link="#ff0000" alink="#ff0000" vlink="#00ff00">

<p><H2>Overview</H2>


<center>'We either win this war to save our land, or we will be exterminated, because 
we have nowhere to run to.'
_ Ken Saro-Wiwa, MOSOP</center>

<p>At 1.00 am on Sunday 22 May 1994, Ken Saro-Wiwa, respected Nigerian 
author and campaigner for Ogoni rights,  was abducted after police and 
military broke into his home.  He is being held at an unknown location, without 
charge, and concerns for his health are growing<a href="refer.html#11>11</a>.  His arrest follows the 
deaths of four Ogoni elders, for which Ken Saro-Wiwa has been accused of 
involvement, even though it is widely accepted that he has never used nor 
advocated violence in his quest for environmental and social justice<a href="refer.html#12>12</a>.  
Amnesty International has declared him to be a 'Prisoner of Conscience'<a href="refer.html#13>13</a> 
and his arrest has brought widespread condemnation from around the world 
because it is viewed as part of the continuing suppression by the Nigerian 
authorities of the Ogoni's campaign against the destruction of their 
environment<a href="refer.html#14>14</a>. The Ogoni are attempting to force Shell to clean up their 
environment.  Once described as 'the food basket of the state'<a href="refer.html#15>15</a>, the Ogoni 
are now forced to import food as land, which once sustained their needs, is 
now rendered economically useless because of oil pollution.

The Nigerian government has been quick to silence those critics of oil 
operations since oil accounts for 95% of Nigeria's export earnings<a href="refer.html#16>16</a>.

Since August 1993, in a series of suspicious incidents, soldiers have stormed 
Ogoni villages, brutally murdering men, women and children and destroying 
Ogoni property including homes and schools.  To date, over 1,000 people 
have been killed by raiders and 30,000 have been made homeless<a href="refer.html#17>17</a>.  The 
military claims it is quelling outbreaks of violence between the Ogoni and 
neighbouring communities, but the Ogoni deny this, arguing that military 
intervention has more to do with their protests against Shell than disputes 
with their neighbours.  

<p>Shell agrees with the Nigerian government that the outbreaks of violence are 
'ethnic clashes'.  In its most recent publication on the matter, Operations in 
Nigeria<a href="refer.html#18>18</a>, Shell argues that recent conflicts and violent activity are 'disputes 
between neighbouring communities over territory.'  However, this has been 
rejected by Professor Claude Ake of the UN World Commission on 
Development and Culture, who was appointed by the military to investigate 
the outbreaks of violence.  Referring to one such attack which was classed as 
an 'ethnic clash' between the Ogoni and the neighbouring Andoni, Professor 
Ake stated<a href="refer.html#19>19</a>:
'I don't think it was purely an ethnic clash, in fact there is really no reason why 
it should be an ethnic clash; and as far as we could determine, there was 
nothing in dispute in the sense of territory, fishing rights, access rights, 
discriminatory treatment, which are the normal causes of these communal 
clashes ... One could not help getting the impression that there were broader 
forces which might have been interested in perhaps putting the Ogonis under 
pressure, probably to derail their agenda.'

<p>A further development which arouses concern comes from a leaked memo 
signed by the Rivers State Commissioner of Police, advocating an extensive 
mobilization of the police and armed forces to occupy Ogoni.  The memo, 
titled Operation Order No. 4/94 _ Restoration of Law and Order in Ogoni 
Land, dated 21 April, describes an operation that will involve 'the Nigerian 
Army, the Nigerian Airforce, the Nigerian Navy and the Nigerian Police' to 
'restore and maintain law and order in Ogoni land.'  A section of the memo 
also states that 'the purpose of this operation order is to ensure that ordinary 
law abiding citizens of the area, non-indigenous resident of carrying out 
business ventures or schooling within Ogoniland are not molested'<a href="refer.html#20>20</a>.

<p>This has been interpreted by many NGOs as a remit to allow foreign oil 
companies to continue drilling for oil in Ogoni without fear of demonstrations 
interrupting the flow of oil.

<p>At the same time, and prior to Ken Saro-Wiwa's abduction, the Rivers State 
government announced a new law enforcing the death penalty for those 
found guilty of involvement in communal clashes.  The Ogoni and others, 
such as Amnesty International, the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples 
Organization (UNPO) as well as Greenpeace, fear that this will be used to 
sentence Ken Saro-Wiwa if charges are brought against him.

APPOINTED TRIBUNAL</title></head><body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ffffff" link="#ff0000" alink="#ff0000" vlink="#00ff00">

<p><H2>The environmental and social costs of
living next door to Shell
</H2>
<p><center>'... SPDC [Shell Petroleum Development Company] always tries to minimise 
the impact of operations on the environment but also to ensure that local 
communities gain real benefits from having a Shell company as a 
neighbour.'<a href="refer.html#21">21</a>
_ Richard Tookey, former Head of Public Affairs, SIPC</center>

<p>While this report focuses on the record of Shell in the Niger Delta, it serves as 
an example of the way in which oil companies operate in different parts of the 
world.  While oil companies' operations in developed regions are usually 
accompanied by environmental impact assessments, social and 
environmental policies _ and not to mention a great deal of effort to appease 
the justified concerns of local communities _ these practices are not exported 
to lesser developed regions where little or no media attention is paid and 
where accountability is unheard of.

<p>In what is the largest exploration and production venture in Nigeria, Shell's 
subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), operates a joint 
venture agreement with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
(NNPC)<a href="refer.html#22">22</a>.  Shell's Nigerian operations have a capacity of one million barrels 
a day and its importance to Shell as a source of revenue cannot be over-
emphasized. 

<p>But Shell's operations in Nigeria have been dogged by local unrest and 
criticism from communities within the oil-producing areas and drawn 
increasing condemnation from abroad.  

<p>Since the beginning of Shell's operations in the Niger Delta, the company has 
wreaked havoc on neighbouring communities and their environment.  Many of 
its operations and materials are outdated, in poor condition and would be 
illegal in other parts of the world.  The problems described here in Ogoni are 
indicative of the problems experienced by other communities along the Delta.  

<p><H3> Gas Flaring</H3>

<p>Many of Shell's gas flares are situated very close to villages, sometimes 
within a hundred metres of Ogoni homes.  The company has been flaring at 
some sites for 24 hours a day for more than 30 years<a href="refer.html#23">23</a>.

<p>But Shell,  responding to criticism over gas flaring at close range, has 
stated<a href="refer.html#24">24</a>:

<p>'... Flares are usually located far from human habitation and protected by 
earth bunds.  When communities have expanded in the direction of 
production facilities, SPDC has taken appropriate action, including relocation 
of flares.  There is no evidence that flares affect crops.'

<p>Local reports present evidence which proves otherwise<a href="refer.html#25">25</a>: 

<p>'... Apart from physical destruction to plants around the flaring areas, thick 
soots are deposited on building roofs of neighbouring villages.  Whenever it 
rains, the soots are washed off and the black-ink like water running down the 
roofs is believed to contain chemicals which adversely affect the fertility of the 
soil.'

<p>Ken Saro-Wiwa, author and spokesperson for the Movement for the Survival 
of Ogoni People (MOSOP), argues<a href="refer.html#26">26</a>:

<p>'The most notorious action of both companies [Shell and Chevron] has been 
the flaring of gas, sometimes in the middle of villages, as in Dere, (Bomu 
oilfield) or very close to human habitation as in the Yorla and Korokoro 
oilfields in Ogoni.  This action has destroyed wildlife, and plant life, poisoned 
the atmosphere and therefore the inhabitants in the surrounding areas and 
made the residents half-deaf and prone to respiratory diseases.  Whenever it 
rains in Ogoni, all we have is acid rain which further poisons water courses, 
streams, creeks and agricultural land.'

<p>Concerning the close proximity of its gas flares, Shell argues that this is a 
result of communities expanding into the vicinity of oil operations.  The 
company maintains that once this happens, gas flares are relocated away 
from populous areas<a href="refer.html#27">27</a>.  However, the Ogoni maintain that Shell has never 
relocated a gas flare<a href="refer.html#28">28</a>.

<p><H3> Pipelines</H3>

<p>Shell's high-pressure pipelines pass above ground through villages and criss-
cross over land that was once used for agricultural purposes, rendering it 
economically useless.  Many pipelines also pass within metres of Ogoni 
homes.

<p>Responding to criticism of Shell's pipelines, Richard Tookey stated in 1992<a href="refer.html#29">29</a>: 
'... You suggest that pipelines should be buried as a means of preventing 
pollution.  Much of the area in which SPDC is operating is swamp, so burying 
pipelines could, in fact, exacerbate the risk of fractures and spillages.  From 
time to time the positioning of pipelines is reviewed, especially when it is 
known that communities have expanded onto land neighbouring a pipeline, 
and if considered a hazard then the pipelines are re-routed.'

<p>However, the Ogoni claim that their land is neither swampy, nor has a pipe 
ever reportedly been re-routed<a href="refer.html#30">30</a>.  No consultation takes place at all: before 
or during pipe-laying.

<p>But to emphasize further the fact that Shell does not apply the same 
standards worldwide, consider one of it's operations in the UK.  For Shell's 
pipeline from Stanlow in Cheshire to Mossmoran in Scotland, 17 different 
environmental surveys were commissioned before a single turf was cut<a href="refer.html#31">31</a>.  
The company explains<a href="refer.html#32">32</a>: 

<p>'A painstakingly detailed Environmental Impact Assessment covered every 
metre of the route, and each hedge, wall and fence was catalogued and 
ultimately replaced or rebuilt exactly as it had been before Shell arrived.  
Elaborate measures were taken to avoid lasting disfiguration and the route 
was diverted in several places to accommodate environmental concerns ...'

<p>This is a far cry from Shell's practices in Nigeria.  The Ogoni have never 
seen, let alone been consulted over, an environmental impact assessment.

<p>Greenpeace and other organizations have approached Shell to release 
environmental impact studies it claims to have conducted since 1982<a href="refer.html#33">33</a> so 
that a full and open analysis can be made of the extent of environmental and 
social damage.  No <a href=".html#impact">impact studies have been freely circulated</a>. 

<p><H3>Oil Spills</H3>

<p>The communities in the Niger Delta have been said to be 'groaning under the 
perennial destruction of their property and environment by oil spillages'<a href="refer.html#34">34</a>.

<p>As early as 1983, the Inspectorate Division of the Nigerian Petroleum 
Corporation drew attention to the impact of oil on the Nigerian environment<a href="refer.html#35">35</a>:

<p>'We witnessed the slow poisoning of the waters of this country, and the 
destruction of vegetation, and agricultural land by oil spills which occur during 
petroleum operations.  But since the inception of the oil industry in Nigeria 
more than twenty-five years ago, there has been no concerned and effective 
effort on the part of the Government, let alone the oil operators to control the 
environmental problems associated with the industry.'

<p>In one of the most recent spills in Ogoni, oil leaked from a Shell flowline for 40 
days between July and August 1993<a href="refer.html#36">36</a> without repair, further contaminating 
Ogoni farmland.  Shell argued that its engineers were unable to get into the 
area to repair the pipeline for fear of violence, but this has been vehemently 
denied by the Ogoni.

<p>According to an independent record of Shell's spills from 1982 to 1992, 
1,626,000 gallons were spilt from the company's Nigerian operations in 27 
separate incidents<a href="refer.html#37">37</a>. Of the total number of spills recorded from Shell _ a 
company which operates in more than 100 countries _ 40% were in 
Nigeria<a href="refer.html#38">38</a>.

<p>Concerning the Ogoni region, Shell has recently argued that in 1992, 60% of 
its oil spills in Ogoni were caused by sabotage<a href="refer.html#39">39</a> and therefore no reflection 
of the company's operating standards. This is refuted by Professor Claude 
Ake of the UN World Commission on Development and Culture<a href="refer.html#40">40</a>0:

<p>'... nobody can say that most of the pollution in Ogoniland is caused by 
sabotage.  In fact, as far as I know, what the Ogonis have tried to do is to put 
out the flares, which is something that importantly reduces pollution ... I think 
that this is the kind of irresponsible propaganda that the oil companies are 
putting out in order to discredit those who are trying to do something about 
the environment ...'

<p>So far, we only have Shell's word that most of the spills are caused by 
sabotage since attempts to gain independent access to the area in order to 
investigate the situation have been unsuccessful.  However, it is widely 
known that most spills occur throughout Nigeria because of malfunction or 
corrosion of equipment.  According to the Nigerian Ministry of Petroleum 
Resources, there were 2,676 recorded spills between 1976 and 1990, with 
the largest single cause of spill in general _ 38% _ due to equipment 
malfunction, with sabotage only responsible for 18%.  Corrosion of equipment 
accounted for 21% of spills.  Sabotage only accounted for 3% of the total oil 
spilt in the time period<a href="refer.html#41">41</a>.

<p>Similarly, according to the independent ten year spill record, only 4 of the 27 
spills recorded from Shell's operations in Nigeria were due to sabotage.  
Corrosion, equipment failure, pipe ruptures and blowouts were the main 
cause of spillages<a href="refer.html#42">42</a>. 

<p>Finally, it is difficult to estimate the exact figure for spillage because many go 
unreported.  This makes the call for a full and open assessment of the region 
all the more urgent, so that the effect of oil pollution damage and the causes 
can be measured.

<p>Villages in the Delta are impoverished as a result of the depletion of healthy 
fish and poisoned drinking water<a href="refer.html#43">43</a>.  A report submitted by the Rivers Chiefs 
to the World Conference of Indigenous Peoples on Environment and 
Development at Rio's Earth Summit in June 1992, stated<a href="refer.html#44">44</a>: 

<p>'Thus apart from air pollution from the oil industry's emissions and flares day 
and night, producing poisonous gases that are silently and systematically 
wiping out vulnerable airborne biota and otherwise endangering the life of 
plants, game and man himself, we have widespread water pollution and 
soil/land pollution that respectively result in the death of most aquatic eggs 
and juvenile stages of life of fin-fish and shell-fish and sensible animals (like 
oysters) on the one hand, whilst, on the other hand agricultural land 
contaminated with oil spills become dangerous for farming, even where they 
continue to produce any significant yields.

<p>'Apart from the basic fact that contaminated soils are rendered relatively but 
seriously infertile and polluted, sometimes for at least 30 years, the farmers 
and fishermen who have thus been dislocated then observe with great anger 
the extremely wide gulf between the lifestyles and incomes of oil-industry 
workers and themselves rendered economically impotent by the same oil 
industry: confrontations and anger in the oil producing areas occasionally 
explode into calamities.'

<p><H3>Oil Waste</H3>

<p>Open and unlined pits for storing drilling waste are reported to litter the 
area<a href="refer.html#45">48</a>  This contradicts Shell's claim that the 
company builds access roads as part of its community assistance 
programme<a href="refer.html#49">49</a>.

<p> <H3>Community Assistance</H3>

<p>'Shell companies throughout the world have wide-ranging programmes of 
community involvement and sponsorship.'<a href="refer.html#50">50</a>
_ Shell and the Environment report

<p>The people of the Niger Delta, who now live in a polluted environment, claim 
they have received precious little in return for living with Shell and dispute 
both the quantity and quality of community assistance.

<p>Vast amounts of money have been generated from oil production in the 
region.  From 1970 to 1988, the Federal Government received a total of 
$183.1 billion from oil extracted from the Delta<a href="refer.html#51">51</a>.  From the Ogoni region 
alone it has been estimated that Shell has extracted over $30 billion of oil<a href="refer.html#52">52</a>.  
Although Shell maintains that it has operated a community assistance 
programme for over 25 years<a href="refer.html#53">53</a>, the money spent on community assistance 
during the same period has been estimated at only $200,000<a href="refer.html#54">54</a> or put 
another way: just 0.000007% of the value of oil extracted.

<p>One of Shell's first operations was in the town of Oloibiri, Rivers State.  In 
1990, a BP engineer remarked<a href="refer.html#55">55</a>: 

<p>'I have explored for oil in Venezuela, I have explored for oil in Kuwait, I have 
never seen an oil-rich town as completely impoverished as Oloibiri.'

<p>The Nigerian government is supposed to direct 3% of its oil revenue back to 
the communities where the oil is produced. However little, if any, of that 
money has reached those in need of it.  Even Shell has admitted as much but 
maintains that it is beyond the scope of its business activities to influence the 
government<a href="refer.html#56">56</a>.  The Ogoni see it differently.  They see Shell as a 
multinational company, supported by the federal government, which was 
influential enough to "persuade" the government to increase the oil revenue 
royalty from 1.5% to 3% in 1982<a href="refer.html#57">57</a>, but unwilling to ensure that this money is 
made effective use of.

<p><H3> Compensation for Land
</H3>
<p>Another criticism of Shell is that the company has failed to compensate 
landowners adequately, if at all. Shell maintains that<a href="refer.html#58">58</a>:

<p>'The company has never acquired land without paying due compensation or 
obtaining approval of landlords.'

<p>However, it is widely reported that when Shell acquired land in the Delta, it 
paid for the crops growing on the land but not the land itself<a href="refer.html#59">59</a>.  Furthermore, 
Shell and other oil companies negotiate land settlements with illiterate 
villagers who are not in a position to specify proper terms and conditions.

<p>A Judicial Inquiry, following the Umuechem disaster (see page 18), in which 
80 innocent villagers were massacred at the hands of the Mobile Police Force 
during a protest against Shell, concluded that<a href="refer.html#60">60</a>:

<p>'What Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited is under 
obligation to do is to pay adequate compensation for lands acquired for oil 
operations and for crops and economic trees on such lands; to pay adequate 
compensation for pollution of water, rivers and streams by oil spillage and 
such other liabilities as may be stipulated by law ...

<p>'Their streams get polluted with the disposal of waste products from oil 
operations rendering the river void of fishes ... their farm crops planted on the 
remaining areas of farmland get damaged by oil pollution; their economic 
trees are hewed down; their economic situation bites and there is no help for 
them.  These deprivations without any compensatory benefits, cause 
frustration ... The compensations paid for these deprivations are just pittance, 
meagre pittance, on which people cannot subsist for even six months and 
they become frustrated with life ..'</body></html>

the Niger Delta
</H1>
<p>Shell's disregard for those living on oil-rich land has led other communities in 
the Niger Delta to try and prevent further damage to their environment.  To 
date, eight communities along the delta hold virtually the same grievances as 
the Ogoni against Shell:

<p><H3>The Ogbia.</H3>  In November 1992, the Ogbia community produced a 
'Charter of Demands' and established MORETO (The Movement for 
Reparation to Ogbia) under Chairman Atukpa J Dakoru. The Charter stated, 
'That due to intentional, negligent and/or inadvertent oil blowouts and 
spillages, our entire land, creeks and rivers and atmosphere have been 
polluted over these long years.'  It went on to state that there were no tarred 
roads except between oil wells; that the only water to drink was from polluted 
creeks; there were no telephones and that all protests had been ignored.  
The Ogbia have demanded compensation for damage, the rewriting of the 
Constitution, fair employment, the flaring of gas to cease, and the burying of 
high pressure pipelines at least 5 feet below the surface away from residential 
buildings<a href="refer.html#61">61</a>.

<p><H3>The Igbide.</H3>  In August 1992, Igbide youths in Delta State, west on the 
Niger Delta, blocked a road to Shell's Oroin flowstation for 5 days, demanding 
employment, water and electricity<a href="refer.html#62">62</a>.

<p><H3>The Ijaw. </H3> In September 1992, Diebu youths from South Ijaw blocked a 
Shell flowstation to protest against damage caused to fishing nets after an oil 
spill.  In November 1992, the Peremabiri community in Southern Ijaw sealed 
Shell's Dieby Creek flowstation to protest against non-payment by Shell for an 
oil spill which occurred in February 1992<a href="refer.html#63">63</a>.

<p><H3>The Etche. </H3> In 1990, 10 miles from Ogoni,  80 people were shot dead 
by the Mobile Police Force and 495 homes destroyed during a peaceful 
protest against Shell, after the company requested the assistance of the 
Mobile Police Force<a href="refer.html#64">64</a>.

<p><H3>The Izon. </H3> In 1992, the Izon Youth Vanguard, Burutu and Bomadi, 
Delta State, threatened to destroy the Escravos and Forcados terminals.  A 
letter was written to the US Embassy advising that all US citizens be 
evacuated.  This apparently stemmed from a complaint against Shell: a 
demand for electricity.  There were no casualties<a href="refer.html#65">65</a>.

<p><H3>The Irri. </H3> In June 1993, the Irri community in Delta State claimed that 
many of their houses were damaged after seismic testing was conducted by a 
Shell contractor.  An African Concord journalist visited the area and found 
large cracks in buildings and shattered glass _ 30 houses were damaged<a href="refer.html#66">66</a>.

<p><H3>The Uzere. </H3> In 1992, according to an article in the National Concord, 
following a protest against Shell, some oil wells were shut down.  
Demonstrators _ mostly women and children _ blocked roads carrying 
placards stating that there was no water, electricity or hospitals, even though 
oil exploration started 36 years ago.  It is reported as being one of the most 
neglected areas in the region<a href="refer.html#67">67</a>.

<pre>Shell is made up of human beings; the impact of our activities on other people 
is therefore always of concern to us.'68

<pre>'Human life does not mean much to those who have benefited from the oil.'<a href="refer.html#69">69</a>
_ Ken Saro-Wiwa, MOSOP</pre>

<p>Celebrating the Year of the Indigenous Peoples in January 1993, 
Greenpeace filmed a peaceful Ogoni protest against Shell.  Dr Leton, ex-
Chancellor of Rivers State University, addressed a rally of up to 500,000 
people to explain their campaign<a href="refer.html#70">70</a>:

<p>'[The Ogoni have] ... woken up to find our lands devastated by agents of 
death called oil companies.  Our atmosphere has been totally polluted, our 
lands degraded, our waters contaminated, our trees poisoned, so much so 
that our flora and fauna have virtually disappeared.

<p>'We are asking for the restoration of our environment, we are asking for the 
basic necessities of life _ water, electricity, education; but above all we are 
asking for the right to self-determination so that we can be responsible for our 
resources and our environment.'

<p>There have been countless demonstrations against Shell's operations in the 
Delta and not just by the Ogoni.  The outcome however has been consistent 
_ resulting in violence against protestors by the military.  One of the worst 
calamities to date happened in 1990 in Umuechem, 10 miles from Ogoni, 
when villagers were killed by the Mobile Police Force during a peaceful 
protest against Shell.  

<p>On hearing  of the proposed demonstration, Shell contacted the 
Commissioner of the Police and made the following request<a href="refer.html#71">71</a>: 

<p>' ... we request that you urgently provide us with security protection 
(preferably Mobile Police Force) at this location.'

<p>The request was met and the punishment of the protestors swift. Eighty 
people were shot dead and 495 homes destroyed.  The Official Inquiry into 
the disaster heard evidence submitted by the Umuechem Community, part of 
which concluded<a href="refer.html#72">72</a>:

<p>'These [Shell Petroleum Development Company] drilling operations have had 
serious adverse effects on the Umuechem people who are predominantly 
farmers, in that their lands had been acquired and their crops damaged with 
little or no compensation, and are thus left without farmlands or means of 
livelihood.  Their farmlands are covered by oil spillage/blow-out and rendered 
unsuitable for farming.'

<p>However, Shell maintains that<a href="refer.html#73">73</a>: 

<p>'... the problems which gave rise to the demonstrations and the consequent 
police action were not really of Shell's making at all.'

<p>But communities on oil-rich land are suffering as a result of Shell's industrial 
activity _ it is the unacceptable way in which this activity is conducted that has 
forced such demonstrations. 

<p>The tension is exacerbated also by Shell's insistence on military involvement.  
Recently, Shell has argued that it is under a legal obligation to notify the 
authorities if a threat to oil production is perceived, admitting at least its tacit 
consent to military activity.  According to Eric Nickson, Shell International's 
Head of Public Affairs, 'unavoidably, therefore, the company has on occasion 
been compelled to ask for assistance.'<a href="refer.html#74">74</a>  The outcome speaks for itself.

<p>In 1992, one person was killed, 30 shot and 150 beaten when local villagers 
from Bonny demonstrated against Shell<a href="refer.html#75">75</a>. 
 
<p>On 30 April 1993, Willbros, a US pipeline contractor, began laying pipes on 
behalf of Shell, on Ogoni farmland, destroying freshly planted crops<a href="refer.html#76">71</a>.  The 
Shell contractors were escorted by soldiers<a href="refer.html#77">77</a>.  As the peaceful protest 
against the pipelaying culminated in a demonstration of 10,000 people, 
soldiers opened fire on the crowd, wounding at least 10 and leaving Mrs 
Karalolo Korgbara, a mother of five, in a critical condition<a href="refer.html#78">78</a>.  She later lost 
her arm because of her injury<a href="refer.html#79">79</a>.  Four days of protests took place as a result 
of the shootings, resulting in the death of Mr Agbarator Otu who was shot in 
the back by soldiers<a href="refer.html#80">80</a>.

<p>Ignoring the tension in the area caused by the violence, SPDC wrote to the 
Governor of Rivers State asking for further provision of assistance so that the 
pipeline construction could be completed<a href="refer.html#81">81</a>.

<p>During the unrest in Nigeria over the summer of 1993, Ken Saro-Wiwa was 
arrested four times, had his passport seized on his way to attending a UN 
human rights conference, and imprisoned.  While in prison, his health 
deteriorated, collapsing after being denied food and a doctor<a href="refer.html#82">82</a> and falling 
unconscious for two hours after police interrogation<a href="refer.html#83">83</a>.  He was finally 
released on 22 July, charged with six counts relating to seditious intention, 
seditious publication and unlawful assembly<a href="refer.html#84">84</a>.

<p>Thereafter, a series of suspicious and brutal attacks occurred on Ogoni 
villages after Ogoni police were mysteriously drafted away from the region, 
resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Ogoni and thousands being made 
homeless.  The Nigerian government claimed that the attacks on Ogoni were 
the outcome of disputes between neighbouring communities.  However, the 
sophistication of weaponry used and the fact that all Ogoni police were 
removed from the area prior to the attacks, implies that the attacks were 
instrumented  by the military<a href="refer.html#85">85</a>.  

<p>Despite the obvious tension and fear mounting in the Ogoni region as the 
military's presence became more prominent, Shell attempted to conduct 
business as usual.

<p>On 23 October 1993, Shell sent firefighting trucks into Ogoni, claiming that a 
call had been received reporting a fire outbreak at the Korokoro flowstation<a href="refer.html#86">86</a>.  
Ogoni villagers, already nervous, were alarmed to see the trucks particularly 
since there was no fire, so denied the company access to the station.  It is 
maintained by Shell that the fire trucks were seized by the villagers and that a 
second team deployed by Shell was attacked, although this is denied by the 
Ogoni.  During the alleged attack, Shell claimed that 'the team exercised 
extreme restraint'<a href="refer.html#87">87</a>. However, one villager was shot dead and two others, 
including a 70 year old man, sustained serious bullet wounds<a href="refer.html#88">88</a>.

<p>To date, there is still no end to the environmental pollution and suppression 
as attacks on Ogoni villages continue.   Since August 1993, twenty Ogoni 
villages have been attacked<a href="refer.html#89">89</a>, resulting in more than 1000 deaths<a href="refer.html#90">90</a>.  
Military presence remains heavy, increasing the tension and fear in the 
region.  Ogoni has effectively been sealed off, military checkpoints have been 
set up and the systematic violence continues unabated.

<p>The controversy surrounding the military's involvement, in what initially 
started as a community's campaign against continuing oil pollution, is 
increasing.  One recent development in particular raises serious concerns 
over the military's perception of its own role in Ogoni.
On 26 June 1994, three civilians _ one a British national on an aid 
assignment to Ogoni _ were flogged with an electric cable after paying a visit 
to Mr Ledum Mitee, a civil rights lawyer and vice president of MOSOP, 
arrested with Ken Saro-Wiwa in May.  On being returned to Kpor, Ogoni, 
Major Okutimo (accused of being responsible for much of the brutality in 
Ogoni<a href="refer.html#91">91</a>) talked of how much he was 'doing for Shell and the government'.  

<p>According to a statement made by one of the abused, Major Okutimo spoke 
of his near death in Korokoro last October and for that, would never forgive 
Ken Saro-Wiwa.  'I ordered him to be taken to an unknown place and be 
chained _ legs and hands _ and not be given food.  Ken will never see the 
light of day until a court pronounces otherwise.'  

<p>Major Okutimo then went on to say, 'Shell Company has not been fair to me 
in this operation.'  He claimed to have risked his life and those of his soldiers 
to 'protect Shell Oil installation' [sic].  The conversation finished with his 
announcement, 'I am going to sanitise Ogoniland.  MOSOP will be no more 
when I finish.  I have been here for nine months.  I need four more weeks to 
get these things cleaned out.'  When it was put to Major Okutimo that, 
according to newspapers, soldiers had been withdrawn from the area, he 
simply replied, 'That is what you read in the papers.  We are still there.  We 
are there.'<a href="refer.html#92">92</a>

<H1>Shell's Response: a case of misguided priorities
</H1>
<p>Shell's handling of the crisis in Ogoni has been short-sighted. Instead of 
generating an atmosphere of co-operation, the company has chosen to 
conduct an exercise in damage limitation.

<p>In 1993, the Year of the Indigenous Peoples, Ken Saro-Wiwa and the Ogoni 
decided to seek international support for their campaign. Addressing the third 
General Assembly of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization 
(UNPO), Ken Saro-Wiwa accused Shell of 'waging an ecological war against 
the Ogoni'<a href="refer.html#93">93</a>.  Shell became alarmed over the attention paid to the Ogoni's 
plight.  

<p>Internal documents have come to light which reveal that meetings took place 
in The Hague and London in February 1993.  These documents expose 
Shell's real  concerns: that local opposition of its operations in Nigeria could 
no longer be controlled and were turning into, or had the potential to turn into, 
an international PR nightmare<a href="refer.html#94">94</a>:

<p>'The problem is not restricted to Nigeria; it has been thrust into UK sitting 
rooms through the TV programme 'The Heat of the Moment'<a href="refer.html#95">95</a> and the 
information has spread, most recently in the Netherlands and Australia.  
International networking ... is at work and gives rise to the possibility that 
internationally organized protest could develop.'

<p>The minutes then go on to propose action items which contradict Shell's 
official line that its commitment to protect the Ogoni environment has been 
established over many years.  

<p>The proposals include: reducing the incidence of operational spills; reducing 
flaring as a high priority; a need to work with consultants and the Nigerian 
government to monitor air and water quality, and improve understanding 'so a 
sense of realism can be given to growing accusations'; reassess present 
methods of negotiation and levels of payment for land; review the possibility 
of introducing employment programmes; and for Public Affairs staff to 'ensure 
that the quality and levels of staff are of a professional standard suitable to 
undertake these sensitive activities.' 

<p>Moreover, the document goes on to advise 'SPDC and SIPC PA departments 
to keep each other more closely informed to ensure that movements of key 
players, what they say and to whom is more effectively monitored to avoid 
unpleasant surprises and adversely affect the reputation of the Group as a 
whole.'<a href="refer.html#96">96</a> [Author's own emphasis]
As to what lengths Shell will go to 'preserve the reputation of the Group' 
remains to be seen, as does its commitment to deal with the pollution of 
Ogoni.

<p>In 1993, the company published a briefing paper entitled Tensions in Nigeria 
which stated that<a href="refer.html#97">97</a>:

<p>'SPDC has a programme of continuing improvement to facilities and 
environmental performance, and of community assistance in infrastructure, 
health, agriculture and education ... This commitment is not cosmetic or token 
_ it is something which has been established over many years.' [Author's own 
emphasis]

<p>Later that year Shell informed Greenpeace that in 1992<a href="refer.html#98">98</a>:

<p>'... SPDC put in place a five year Environmental Plan designed to enhance 
the company's environmental performance ...  

<p>Greenpeace and other organizations have asked Shell to release this Five
Year Environmental Plan, as well as the Environmental Impact Assessments 
(EIA) it claims to have undertaken since 1982. Neither have been
forthcoming.  

<p>However, recently The Body Shop International secured access to two EIAs 
through an independent consultant<a href="refer.html#99">99</a>.  But despite a belief held by many that 
EIAs are considered public property, The Body Shop's consultant could 
review only two impact assessments which could not be removed from Shell's 
office in the Hague. Both impact assessments were for pipelines and had 
been undertaken by a consulting arm of a Nigerian university. Furthermore, 
the studies seem to have been conducted after the pipelines were put into 
operation, therefore, not true EIAs which are conducted before construction 
takes place.

<p>In general, the consultant found that the assessments were unfocused,  
littered with statements that there 'will be significant impacts' without 
demonstrating how significant the impacts would be.  Furthermore, he went 
on to add<a href="refer.html#100">100</a>:

<p>'The documents are lengthy, generally poorly constructed and 
therefore it is difficult to envisage how they could either assist the Nigerian 
Planning Authorities in determining authorisation of the development, or 
enable SPDC employees in Nigeria to better manage their (potential) 
environmental impacts.
And:

<p>'Both documents refer to Shell's Oil Spill Contingency Plan as a major 
mitigative measure, but there is no clear indication that an effective 
contingency plan, customised to account for specific local environmental 
sensitivities, in fact exists.
And:

<p>'Finally, but perhaps most importantly, there is little evidence that 
SPDC have been involved in the EIA process, that they acknowledge the 
potential impacts of their pipeline operations and that they have taken 
ownership of the mitigation measures necessary to minimise potential 
impacts.'

<p>The report from the Body Shop's consultant concludes that the assessments 
undertaken for the two pipelines 'indicate clearly that Shell will face some 
difficulties with regard to the expectations of the local communities', but more 
importantly<a href="refer.html#101">101</a>:

<p>[ that the studies] '... lack a focused assessment of significant impacts and do 
not lend themselves to aiding either the planning authorities or Shell in putting 
the levers in place to effectively manage the environmental implications of 
SPDC's operations.' [Author's own emphasis]

<H2>Conclusion</H2>



<p>At Ebubu in Ogoni, twenty-four years after a pipeline blowout, a three acre 
site is still heavily polluted and encrusted with crude oil<a href="refer.html#102">102</a>.  In 1992, 
published scientific studies concluded that wetlands downstream from the site 
were being contaminated by oil seepage<a href="refer.html#103">103</a>.  Eric Nickson from Shell 
International claimed that Shell's clean-up operations continued until 1990, 
but since oil had 'reappeared', Shell would start again in 1994<a href="refer.html#104">104</a>. 
Eyewitness accounts say that Shell has done little, if anything, to rehabilitate 
the area<a href="refer.html#105">105</a>.  Dr Olua O Kamalu, a medical doctor in the region explains what 
happens in the searing heat<a href="refer.html#106">106</a>:

<p>'... when the sun hits this thing [the encrusted oil] it melts and it evaporates 
into the atmosphere increasing the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide 
content and ... if you live purely by rainwater ... the chemical, now the carbon 
monoxide, and the high concentration of carbon dioxide gets dissolved in 
water and what they [local community] drink is acid water.'

<p>Meanwhile,  Mr Achebe, Shell's Business Development Manager in Nigeria, 
according to a leading London newspaper<a href="refer.html#107">107</a>:

<p>'... implicitly conceded that Shell had done almost nothing to clean up its 
pollution because only the Ogonis were making noise.'

<p>Therefore, while Shell talks of its commitment not being 'cosmetic' or 'token', 
these statements appear hollow when considering the company's real 
priorities concerning the problems in the Niger Delta.

<p>Furthermore, in its most recent publication on the situation, Operations in 
Nigeria108, Shell states:

<p>'SPDC believes most of the environmental problems are not the result of oil 
operations.  An independent assessment would be helpful to focus on facts 
and, together with those concerned, address any remedies required.'

<p>Firstly, as this report has highlighted, the problems of the Niger Delta are 
largely because of oil extraction.  It is for reasons such as these, and for 
those communities mentioned, that the release of Shell's EIAs and its Five 
Year Environmental Plan is imperative.  Without them, a full and open 
assessment of the environmental and social damage along the Delta cannot 
be conducted.

<p>Secondly, so long as Shell continues to view the problems of the Niger Delta 
purely as a public relations problem _ protecting the 'reputation of the Group' 
_ for many people of the Niger Delta, reforms, if they happen, will come too 
late.  

<p>And finally, what the Ogoni and other communities along the Niger Delta are 
experiencing is one more example from many of what happens to 
communities when they attempt to stand up to those companies draining the 
resources they are so dependent on.  The way in which Shell operates, not 
unlike so many other oil companies, has simply become the acceptable way 
of conducting business.  So too has the environmental and social price others 
pay for our dependency on precious natural resources. 

<p>For the lesson already learnt by some communities is to beware the slogan, 
'You can be sure of Shell'.

      MOBY DICK SETS SAIL TO PROTEST PLAN TO DUMP OIL PLATFORM, TOXIC WASTE AND ALL, INTO THE NORTH SEA</head><body><P>
 <P>
The Moby Dick sailed from Lerwick in the Shetland Islands just before sunset today heading for the dilapidated Brent 
Spar oil rig.  Most of the 20 crew aboard the  Moby Dick leaned over the deck rails and waved colleagues and land 
goodbye.  Onboard with our Swedish skipper were a mixture of many nationalities. The mood was good as we 
steamed out of the harbour.  The local newspaper photographer took his last photos and waved farewell.  <P>
Soon we were watching the sun go down and thinking of 15 hours ahead, when we would be in the middle of the 
North Sea steaming through oil fields.<P>
 <P>
Tthe Moby Dick is an old fishing vessel now restored (complete with rainbow on its hull) to sail the world's 
oceansbearing witness to environmental abuses.  This time, the target was the oil companies polluting the North 
Sea.<P>

<head><H3>GREENPEACE OCCUPIES SCRAPPED NORTH SEA OIL PLATFORM BEFORE IT'S
DUMPED AT SEA</H3>
</head>
<body>
<P>
NORTH SEA, SUNDAY, 30 APRIL 1995--Greenpeace today scaled and took up
residence on an old North Sea oil platform to stop its owner, Shell, from dumping
the rusting hulk and its highly toxic contents to the sea bed.

<P>Four climbers used ropes and winches to scale the Brent Spar, which is the first
of the 400 North Sea oil platforms to be dumped at sea.  The climbers have food
and supplies for what is expected to be a long occupation.  The Moby Dick is standing by as a safety vessel.  The activists first climbed the steel
ladders on the installation, then scaled the outer part of the rig, 28 metres high
above the waterline. 

<P>After Moby Dick captain Pelle Pettersson notified the five other rig support vessels
in the area, stating that Greenpeace was protesting the dumping of the Brent Spar,
a Shell standby vessel then sailed very close to the Moby Dick and the inflatables,
harrassing them. 

<P>The Brent Spar contains over 100 tonnes of toxic sludge --including oil, arsenic,
cadmium, PCBs and lead -- including more than 30 tonnes of radioactive waste left
over from oil drilling and storage operations on the Brent Oil Field.

<P>The UK Government's decision to allow Shell to dump the Brent Spar was based
on information supplied and paid for by Shell. 

<P>Ironically, the planned dump comes just one month before North Sea environment
ministers meet in Denmark in June to discuss measures to eliminate the discharge
of hazardous substances from all sources into the North Sea and the marine
environment. 

<P>"The decision is short-sighted and the latest example of
governments allowing industry to treat the seas as a toxic dump," said
Greenpeace's Tim Birch onboard the Moby Dick.

<P>"Greenpeace will remain on Brent Spar until the UK Government or Shell comes to
their senses and revokes the decision to dump it," Birch said. 

<P>A Greenpeace report released today, "No Grounds for Dumping: The
decommissioning and abandonment of off-shore oil and gas platforms", analyses
the decommissioning options available to the UK Government.  The report
concludes that total removal is not only the best environmental option but also the
most cost-effective, feasible and job-saving.           

<P>"If the UK Government does not reverse its disastrous decision, dumping the toxic-
laden Brent Spar at sea could set a domino effect in motion as more of the 400
North Sea oil platforms are abandoned," said Birch.

<P>Marine ecosystems, especially in the North Sea, are still under serious pressure
from chemical and radioactive discharges, sewage pollution, pesticide run-off and
atmospheric pollution, among other sources.

<P>"Dumping oil platforms laden with toxic cocktails will only add to the list of
contaminants and proves yet again that the UK Government and the oil and gas
industries have total disregard for the health of our seas," said Birch.

<P>                            <B> ends</B>

<head><H4>SHELL QUESTIONS SAFETY OF BRENT SPAR; GREENPEACE QUESTIONS SAFETY
OF DUMPING
</H4></head><body>
 <P>
North Sea--4 May 1995--The Greenpeace activists occupying the
Brent Spar abandoned oil installation in the North Sea said today
they had been warned by Shell of safety problems on the platform.

<P>Campaigner on the platform, Tim Birch, said this morning that a
communication had been received late yesterday from Shell, which
spelt out safety problems in and around the abandoned
installation. Shell was concerned that there be no injury nor
loss of life. 

<P>"Greenpeace has done its research on the safety of our occupation
and all precautions have been taken.  But we consider that the
risks we are taking are nothing compared with the threat posed
to the marine environment with the dumping of the Brent Spar at
Sea," said Birch. 

<P>"Shell seems to have no concern at the effect that 100 tonnes of
tonnes of toxic sludge and 30 tonnes of radioactive waste will
have on the North East Atlantic," said Birch. 

<P>The Shell communication with the Greenpeace activists aboard the
Brent Spar came late yesterday in a broadcast to the rig, and a
fax to Greenpeace in London.  Shell warned that no entry to
enclosed areas should be undertaken; external walkways were
unsafe; there was no fire equipment on the rig; air monitoring
should be continuously carried out; no 'tampering' with closed
doors should be undertaken, nor navigation equipment be
interfered with. 

<P>Birch said that not only did Greenpeace have its own firefighting
equipment, air monitoring equipment and very experienced people,
but it also had Shell's own operations manual for the Brent Spar,
which spelt out the detail of the installation and the dangerous
areas.  Shell's assertion that Greenpeace was "unfamiliar" with
the installation was therefore unfounded. 

<P>But Birch said that Shell was operating under its usual double
standards, using one set of rules where it could get away with
them and another where it couldn't.

<P>"In the United States' waters, where Shell operates in the Gulf
of Mexico, all abandoned platforms must be removed within one
year of decommissioning.  This thing has been sitting here in the
North Sea, unused, for four years."

<P>He also noted that in the Gulf of Mexico, Shell must remove all
installations like the Brent Spar onto land.  The option of
dumping is only ever used in extreme circumstances and when all
other options have been ruled out.  Shell has researched the
disposal of the Brent Spar on land and it is perfectly feasible,
both technically and in terms of cost-effectiveness.  

<P>                             ends

 <P>
<head>From: Greenpeace campaigner on The Brent Spar

<br>Date: Thursday May 4, 1995</head><body>

<P>We are all now firmly established on the Brent Spar oil platform
118 miles north east of the Shetland Islands. It seems amazing
that we carried out this action and the Greenpeace activists on
board the Spar are all extremely happy with the progress. 

<P>Last night we had our first hot meal -- wonderful -- we even have
a cook on board. 

<P>Since Wednesday we've spent a lot of time on the telephone,
talking to the world's press.  We've also had the special
satellite communications equipment, so I've been able to do live
television interviews to TV stations all over Europe -- although
mostly to Germany and to the UK.  

<P>Late Wednesday we had a communication from Shell, who were
expressing concern for our safety (see press release).  Shell
said that we were unfamiliar with the rig -- but they didn't know
that we have the Shell Brent Spar operations manual so we do know
a little more than they thought!    It seems bizarre that they
are concerned for our safety but have no regard for the threat
to the marine environment of dumping this toxic waste dump on the
sea floor. 

<P>We thought we had the satellite TV equipment until Thursday
evening, but the weather starting getting bad again, and we had
to quickly pack it up in order to get it on the Moby Dick before
the waves got too high again.  The Moby left with a whole load
of crew and journalists and we settled in for the night.  

<P>Then today the UK Government finalised its review for the North
Sea drilling rigs.  The draft policy means that the oil industry
arguments to dump the rigs in even more shallow waters will go
ahead.  

<P>This is incredible, and, given that the North Sea ministers are
meeting in just four weeks, seems like a politically silly thing
to do.  

<P>Signing off for VE Weekend.

<head><H4>UK GOVERNMENT SET TO TURN NORTH SEA INTO OIL RIG GRAVEYARD </H4>
<br>Greenpeace Brent Spar occupation continues</head><body>
 <P>

North Sea--5 MAY 1995-- The UK Government's review of offshore
oil and gas rig abandonment would enable the oil industry to dump
North Sea rigs and their toxic contents where they stand,
Greenpeace said today.

<P>Released last night as Greenpeace activists ended their fifth day
of occupation on the Brent Spar platform, the UK Department of
Trade and Industry's review takes one more disastrous step
towards giving the oil industry its consent to dump toxic rig
wrecks in the North Sea.

<P>The Brent Spar is the first of 400 oil and gas platforms to be
given the go-ahead for dumping at sea.  The UK Government gave
its owner, Shell, permission to dump the platform and its 130
tonnes of toxic and radioactive contents in the North East
Atlantic.  50 platforms are due to for decommissioning over the
next ten years.  If the Brent Spar dumping goes ahead it will set
a precedent for the others to be dumped. 

<P>"This review shows that the UK Government is bending over
backwards to allow the oil industry to choose the cheap over the
responsible option, and to dump these platforms into an already
heavily polluted North Sea," said Greenpeace campaigner Tim Birch
from the Brent Spar.

<P>The review's draft policy accepts oil industry arguments to
reduce the required clearance depth between dumped platforms and
the sea surface from 75m to 55m to enable the industry to topple
their huge abandoned structures where they stand. This will
further endanger fishing and other vessels in the North Sea.  

<P>"The impact on the North Sea marine environment will be
disastrous as more and more rigs and platforms containing tonnes
of hazardous substances are decommissioned and sunk where they
are," said Birch.  "Dumping at sea is irresponsible, unneccessary
and easily avoidable.  Greenpeace has shown that disposal of rigs
on land is a viable alternative and the best environmental
option." 

<P>"In the US, the oil and gas industry is required to dispose of
old rigs onland within a year of decomissioning," said Birch. 
"The industry will dump them into the marine environment here in
UK waters simply because they can get away it courtesy of the
government."

<P>"It is incredible that the UK Government is working with the oil
industry to facilitate the dumping of these toxic rigs into the
North sea, just four weeks before North Sea ministers meet to
discuss ways to eliminate chemical pollution of the sea."

<P>14 Greenpeace activists from 4 countries are onboard the Brent
Spar to protest Shell's plans to dump it at sea.  They will
remain until the UK Government or Shell comes to their senses and
reverse the outrageous decision to dump.

<br><H4>Brent Spar Internet Diary
</H4></head><body>
 
<P>
We have now started our sixth day - a fairly gloomy one as far
as the weather is concerned.  In spite of this and the other
difficulties, morale is very high - in good part thanks to 
the cook.  We have an impressive array of ingredients - fresh
vegetables (boxes of cabbages, celeriac, peppers, carrots and
sacks of potatoes), plenty of dried foods, milk, juice, bread and
biscuits.
 
<P>We have only one toilet in operation - flushed using a bucket of
sea water which you have to collect by lowering the bucket 25
metres to the sea and then pulling it back up.  It is really soul
destroying when you mis-time swinging the bucket over the lip and
spill it all so you have to start again.
 
<P>The worst thing, apart from not having running water, is the
damp.  It feels like the sea fog has permeated every nook and
cranny and although all the fixtures and fittings, including
mattresses and blankets have been left they are really quite
damp.  
 
<P>Part of the morning was spent making safe the walkway around 
the
lower deck with planks of wood from the helideck and monitoring
for the hydrogen sulphide gas that can form and could reach our 
level.
 
<P>It is rather like the Marie Celeste as there are still notices
on the walls, menus, warnings about only residents being allowed
to use the videos.  In the office areas there is still a great
deal of information in the cupboards and personal effects such
as postcards - it's as if everyone left in a hurry.  The movement
of the sea makes loose doors creak open and shut, adding to the
illusion of the ghost ship.
 
<P>The generator hums constantly but the only sounds last night 
were
the flapping of the Greenpeace flag boldly displaying "Save the
North Sea" from the helideck and the eerie fog horn sounded over
the last two days.  One of the crew is going to make a recording
for posterity!
 
<P>The weather is slightly worse today - the sea is quite rough and
the Spar is swaying - gently, but enough to knock you off course
as you walk across a room.  From the office window, one of the
eight closest rigs can be seen - at night which ever way you look
there are flames from these and from those further afield.  There
are so many crowded together.  this makes the suggestion by the
Government that the rigs here be dumped in situ even more
shocking.
 
<P>The sea birds are not too frequent, but we have seen fulmars,
gannets and a bird of prey flying near to the spar - possibly a
merlin.  There is nothing see apart from the rigs, their support 
vessels
and the occasional helicopter.
 
<P>We have been heartened by the publicity this action has and still
is generating around Europe and beyond - even in Beirut.

<head><H4>INTERNET DIARY DAY 10  </H4>
 
<br>9th May 1995</head><body>
<P>We are now into our second week on the Brent Spar, the oil
storage platform that Shell wants to sink in the Atlantic. We are
finally becoming more comfortable in our new surroundings. The
idea of living on a floating polluted island is not a pleasant
prospect but we have now firmly set this before us.
Since the construction of our wind generator above on the heli
deck and the increasing media interest surrounding our stay,
the morale of crew members has reached a satisfactory level and
the  mood is positive.
<P>The SPAR sways constantly, reminding us of our location and
the risks. Outside the temperature is a low 5 deg.C, not European
summer-like at all. Heating one room to a comfortable level is
now possible and that has been warmly welcomed.
<P>Our food supplies are still very substantial on board, with an
excellent French cook to keep us going. It is still difficult
to keep clean, with salt water for washing. As you look around
the dinner table you see ever longer beards looking back at
you! After 10 days we all could do with a hot bath, but that
is just a small sacrifice under the circumstances. The word
"Squatters" has been used in the press, perhaps this is
something along those lines. However how many squats have a
satellite phone/fax/e-mail communications?
So we continue our "sit in" for the common goal...
 
<P>DON'T DUMP THE SPAR...

<head><H4>Diary - May 10 </H4>
</head><body>
 
<P>The hectic stress of the first few days is slowly changing to 
more
laborious activity. Every day there are  new things to build or
existing things which have to be repaired. It's incredible how
much equipment we have pulled onto the platform - the realisation
dawned on me slowly since we have now unpacked most of it.
 
<P>The atmosphere and the relationship between the crew is 
extremely
good. Unfortunately, it takes me a while to understand some of
the conversations because my English is  not very good - but it
is improving every day. Yesterday there was a very strong wind
and it was impressive to be on the heli-deck in the storm. There
is a marvellous 360 degrees view of the surroundings from up
there.
 
<P>Thanks to the excellent food that our excellent cook cooks for us 
- a warm
meal twice a day - I am definitely going to put on weight during
my stay!

<H4>Diary - May 11th</H4>

<P>"I've seen fire and I've seen rain..."-This song keeps rattling 
round my
brain.Why this song in particular? What's the significance of 
mentally
tuning into an old James Taylor song
whilst working 190 kilometres north east of Shetland in the cold 
North Sea?
Some strange flicker of nostalgia perhaps...but for what? I've worked 
here
before.
 
<P>Then as now I was shooting videotape.  Recording scenes as 
part of daily
life here, encoding video news, relaying media gossip. Then, for the 
most
part, I was working for the oil
industry, recording the minutia of rig life and spreading the new
technological knowledge of offshore oil exploration... expansion...
exploitation.
 
<P>All the E's!
 
<P>Now I'm working with people who play a different card, who 
use
other E's... Ecology, Environment.
 
<P>Greenpeace, the environmental organisation, invited me to shoot
news footage of their occupation of Brent Spar, a large disused 
oil storage platform which forms part of the Shell Brent oil 
field development.  Their people have now displaced the ghosts of 
those who worked here for 20 odd years, those pioneers of North 
Sea oil recovery. They, who battled those bitter, hoary elements 
with honest toil and high technology.  The new incumbents are no 
less eager.  They too struggle to succeed, accepting the rigours
of  a harsh seascape, working with vigour and seasoned
experience.  They too are professional, committed, eager to
succeed.  They share a  common 'E' with the last Spar
stalwarts... Endeavour.
<P>The new occupants of this rig are not of course direct 
descendants of the old order.  They carry out similar tasks it is 
true.  Survival and existence on this man made island demands it
be so.  These Greenpeace activists use modern technology, some
of it very advanced.  They conduct complicated logistical tasks.  
They 
 
have a command structure similar to their predecessors, but common 
professionalism is all they share.
 
<P>The 'New' crew are just that.  Their philosophical approach to 
this 
scene of modern economic advance is profoundly different to that of 
the
last shift.
 
<P>When I worked on this oil field last, in the seventies, the song
I have earlier mentioned was very popular with the crew of the 
production platform on which I was based. I guess the 'Fire and
Rain' bore relation to their time more than now.  In the greater
plan of things they are one and the same.
 
<P>The old order have never quite grasped this.
<br>The new order reads that final line...
 
<P>"But I always thought that I'd see you, Baby, one more time 
again".
 
 
<P>and sees a broader picture.
 
<P>Well perhaps on querying the new Brent Spar crew on the exact 
lyric of
the chorus of the James Taylor song most didn't even know who he 
was, far
less the song itself.  These ancient inhabitants of southwest Palestine
probably figure me for an old hippy.

 <P>
<head><H4>Diary May 12th 1995 -</H4></head><body>
<P>Good day to you, readers of this internet page, greetings from
the Greenpeace activists on the Brent Spar. Today it is my turn
to write a little note. It is now day 13 and things are getting
better all the time. We have almost started to like living on the
damned thing. It is getting homelier and cleaner every day and
what's even more important, it is also becoming as safe as we can
make it.  We have got almost the same gear as you would find on a normal ship.
Most of it we brought on ourselves but we are only using what we can,
of course. We have got, to mention but a few: life rafts, flares,
survival suits, lots of life vests, fire extinguishers, escape
ladders and ropes, breathing apparatus, lots of medical
equipment...and much more else.
 
<P>Shell wrote us a letter saying that they were worried about our
safety. Very nice of them but not necessary - they would be
better off being  concerned about the North Sea! Today I have
been sampling  a few of the big tanks. Take it from me, that
stuff does not  belong at the bottom of the sea, not even if it
is 2000 metres  deep. Everybody seems to understand that, except
the big shots of  Shell and their very well paid scientists. But
eventually they  will, it just takes time - of which we have as
much as it will take.  As I already said, The Spar is getting
cosier, cleaner and sort of safer for the activists, and  even
the sun is doing it's best to make life a bit more comfortable.
It is important that Shell agrees to  dispose the Brent Spar in
the proper way before we leave our temporary gently  swinging
'home'.

<H4> SHELL ATTEMPTS TO EVICT GREENPEACE FROM 
OIL PLATFORM</H4>

<br>Greenpeace stands firm on North Sea 
protection</head><body>
 
<P>LONDON, 13 May 1995--Greenpeace last night vowed to continue 
its North Sea campaign to fight the dumping of the Shell Brent Spar
oil platform, despite a legal attack from the oil company.
 
<P>At 9.30pm last night, a Shell helicopter landed on the Brent Spar
with two Sherrifs officers from Aberdeen carrying a legal
injunction and wearing Shell survival suits.  As the helicopter
hovered over the platform, a 12 page legal document was faxed to
the 13 Greenpeace activists who have occupied the platform for
the past 13 days.  Greenpeace lawyers are currently studying the
document.
 
<P>"Whatever strong-arm legal tactics Shell choose to use,
Greenpeace will continue to oppose the dumping of the oil
industry's toxic garbage in the North Sea," said Greenpeace
spokesperson Chris Rose.
 
<P>"Shell's attempts to use the courts to
enforce its disastrous plan to pollute the seas demonstrates its
contempt for public concern about its operations, fishermen's
livelihoods and for the health of the North Sea," Rose said.
 
<P>"Shell is chasing cash at the expense of the North Sea marine
environment -- yesterday it announced a 35% increase in profits
to  1280 million in just the first three months of the year.  To
dump the Brent Spar as a cheapskate alternative to responsible
decommissioning with decontamination onshore is nothing short of
obscene," said Greenpeace.
 
<P>The Brent Spar contains over 100 tonnes of toxic sludge --
including oil, arsenic, cadmium, PCBs and lead -- and more than
30 tonnes of radioactive waste left over from oil drilling and
storage operations on the Brent Oil Field.  It is the first of
the 400 North Sea oil platforms to be dumped at sea. 
 
<P>For more information, please contact Chris Rose on 0860 
355271
 
<P>For photographs of the Sherrif's arrival onto the platform,
please contact Reuters, AP and PA London
or Greenpeace ++44 71 833 0600

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - 13.5.95
 
<H4>DUMPING OIL PLATFORMS "SHOULD BE STOPPED" 
SAYS EU COMMISSIONER
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT</H4> - International support for 
Greenpeace
occupation of Brent Spar Grows
 
<P>International support for Greenpeace action to prevent the sea
dumping of toxic laden North Sea oil platforms continues to grow.
 
<P>Last night Ritt Bjerregaard, EU Commissioner for the 
environment,
appeared  on Danish TV.  Also last night Shell launched a legal
attack on the occupiers of the Brent Spar in an attempt to force
them to leave.  Greenpeace is seeking legal advice.
 
<P>Quotes translated from Danish TV:
 
<P>Ritt Bjerregaard, EU Commissioner for the environment:
 
<P>"Actually, I think most countries in the EU thinks this is dirty
and that it should be stopped. If it is banned in the US they try
other places and unfortunately there is both countries and
enterprises in this situation who choose the cheapest option and
we have to make sure they do not have that
opportunity... is the simple thing to do and in the
short term you avoid the problems with some firms and therefore
they choose that. Therefore it is good that Greenpeace is around
to ensure these things do not go on secretly."
 
<P>Svend Auken, Danish Minister for Environment and Energy:
 
<P>"We think there will be many hazardous substances which will
escape into the enviornment this way, and in any case the sea
should not be used as a dustbin....There are many problems in the
North Sea. Many of the platforms out there are about to reach the
time when they will have to be scrapped. This has to be done in
a safe manner and the only way this can be done is on land.  We
cannot accept just toppling them at sea... The
fact that the host of the Ministers' Conference raises this
matter, that we support Greenpeace and others, and that we are
supported by other countries, that will have to make an impact
on those considering dumping, I think.... ."
 
<P>Peter Sand Mortensen, Chair of the Fishermens Sector,
International Transport Federation, ITF.
 
<P>"It is quite simply a catastrophy.  For the environment, for the
fishermen , for all of us....if a permit is given now, what is
to be expected for the 400+ other installations out here.
Economic factors are working in favour of just leaving everything
out there once profits have been gained....this involves one of
the largest, Shell."

Chris Rose 01595 694 099.

<P>Date: Sat 14 May.  Time: 17.11 GMT 
<H4>SHELL ATTEMPT TO GAG THE PRESS AND 
GREENPEACE - SCOTTISH COURT
UPHOLDS PRESS FREEDOM</H4>
 
<P>In a legal attempt to end Greenpeace's 14 day old occupation of
their North Sea oil installation, the Brent Spar, Shell asked the
Scottish Courts to issue an order gagging the press.
 
<P>Shell requested "an order in terms of the Contempt of Court Act
1981, Section 4(2) postponing the publication of any report
relating to these proceedings for such period as the Court shall
consider appropriate."   Lord Kirkwood, the Scottish Judge, did
not grant their request.  
 
<P>Shell did manage to obtain an interim interdict attempting to
prevent the Greenpeace vessel Moby Dick from  resupplying the
Brent Spar occupiers with food and other essentials.
 
<P>"Shell's tactics are secrecy and starvation.  They are clearly
trying to force the people off the Brent Spar," said Chris Rose,
Greenpeace spokesperson.
  
<P>"Shell are so ashamed of what they are doing that they sought to
do it behind a veil of secrecy.   Lord Kirkwood, in denying
Shell's request, has recognised that the dumping of toxic oil
platforms at sea is a matter of great public interest.  He has
decided that if Shell are to do any dirty business it must be
done in public," said Rose.  
 
<P>The international group of activists on board Brent Spar are
awaiting legal advice, together with copies of the court orders
written in their respective languages.  
 
<P>Greenpeace is determined to draw attention to the dumping of
toxic-laden platforms at sea.

<head><H4>Diary 17 May 1995</H4></head><body>
<P>

We are in day 18 of the occupation of the disused Shell oil
installation the "Brent Spar".  This message appeals for your
interest and support, and tries to give an idea of what this
campaign involves.  Thanks for taking the time to read it.

<P>The sense of weirdness is all pervasive. Outside the Spar is a 
massive painted rusting superstructure, with huge fire hoses, 
waist-wide nylon ropes used to secure visiting tankers still in 
place, aerial walkways around every exterior surface, tools, 
safety equipment, lifting and electrical machinery everywhere, 
and pipes rising from the tanks beneath.  Most of all there is 
the huge steel cylinder which descends into the sucking waves of 
the North Sea hundreds of feet below.

<P>After they prised open the heavy steel doors inside, the first 
climbers found a Marie Celeste style scene of discarded coffee 
cups still on tables, full safety manuals and office files, 
blueprints, furniture, a working video, a fully equipped 
workshop, an empty gym, accommodation rooms with beds very damp 
but still made up, and one or two decks down, a control room with
lights,  hundreds of feet above the sea and lighting clouds as
they pass  over.  Beneath each rig sits a safety or support
vessel.  At  night the rigs are a block of bright sparkling
lights like a  space station or a chunk of a skyscraper lying
above the sea. The  support ships are powerful, manoeuvrable
vessels - most painted  bright red.  One, the Norwegian flagged
Rembas, comes to harass  any visiting inflatables reaching the
Brent Spar.  Most of the  time Shell's ships and helicopters buzz
the platform and we are  watched through binoculars.

<P>Right now there is a race against time to stop the dumping.  If
we fail, governments and multinationals will see  it as a signal
that environmental principles and practice can be  junked for a
cheap waste option on a massive scale.

<P>The Brent Spar is integral to the present effort to protect 
fisheries and stop marine pollution through the North Sea and 
Atlantic.  We use the North Sea to wash in as we have little 
freshwater - but we know that there are huge quantities of oil 
and biocide residues in the sea from the rigs around us.

<P>The Moby crew reported a pod of Orcas off the Spar today.  We 
see seabirds such as bonxies (great skuas) and gannets.  The
fundamentals represented in the sea, in  wilderness, and never
echoed in the technical reasoning of Shell  or any of the other
representatives of our modern western  military industrial
consumer culture.  They, the rapists of  Nature, are in the
ascendant, the fundamentals are getting shaky.   We may well win
the "Brent Spar" dump conflict but the general  outlook is bleak:
it's hard to see the blue sky beyond the  destructive storm we
are in.  That makes it all the more certain  that there's only
one side to be on.

<P>This campaign is so clear, and we are on the right side, the side 
of nature, of the wilderness, our brother and sister species, 
the children of future generations, all the little people who 
have no voice to fight the Shells of this world.  So we here are 
fortunate to be called to represent all these, our own lovely 
planet.

<P>Tension mounts a little, plans are tightened, defences 
reinforced.  The group is strong, has a good spirit.  Time for 
environmentalists to unite, to breathe in solidarity.  This is
our  position, here we stay - Save The Seas. 

 <P>Good wishes to all 
environmentalists, and many thanks for your support.

<P>EU's Bjerregaard condemns UK's rig-dumping plan BRUSSELS, May 18 (Reuter) -
<P>EU Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard condemned on Thursday Britain's
plan to allow deep-sea dumping of disused oil installations, aligning herself
with protestors occupying a condemned North Sea platform.</H5>

<P>"I think the United Kingdom should not dump the Brent Spar at sea,"
Bjerregaard told Reuters in a telephone interview.

<P>"We have to get away from the old idea that you can dump things at sea and
they will just disappear," she said.

<P>The Dane was referring to the Brent Spar platform, occupied since April 30 by
activists from the environment group Greenpeace.

<P>Protestors say dumping the rig with its 130-tonne cargo of toxic and
radioactive sludge will set a precedent for the 400 other platforms earmarked
for disposal as the North Sea oil boom fades.

<P>Platform owner Shell UK Exploration and Production says any environmental
impact from sea-dumping will be minimal and localised to a small area of sea
bed around the dump site.

<P>Shell Expro is jointly owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Exxon Corp.

<P>Bjerregaard, who oversees environmental policy-making within the EU's
executive, said the installation should be towed back to land for scrapping,
an option she said was backed by Belgium and Denmark among others.

<P>She said the issue was sure to feature on the agenda of North Sea
ministers when they meet on June 8 and 9 in Esbjerg, Denmark, to discuss
marine pollution issues.

<P>Shell bids to eject Greenpeace activists LONDON, May 18 (UPI) -- Oil
corporation Shell is applying (Thursday) in court to eject Greenpeace
activists from the Brent Spar oil facility, 120 miles (200 km) northeast of
Scotland's Shetland Islands. The environmentalists say their 2-week-old sit-in
protests Shell's plan to sink the obsolete facility in the North Sea.

 <P>FROM:  GREENPEACE CREW OCCUPYING THE SHELL BRENT SPAR OIL PLATFORM
DATE:  18 MAY, 1995 - DAY 19

<P>


     
     <head><H4>BELGIUM AND ICELAND JOIN PROTEST AGAINST UK GOVERNMENT</H4></head><body>

<P>We have just heard that Belgium and Iceland have joined Denmark
in the protest against the UK government's decision to allow
Shell to dump the disused Brent Spar oil platform into the North
Sea - as you can imagine, morale is very high on the Spar today
although conditions remain bearable!  The European Parliament has
also spoken out against the UK government's decision and is going
to send letters to the North Sea Conference member states -the
UK, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Norway,
Sweden and Switzerland - to express its concern over this
deliberate pollution of the marine environment. International
pressure increases on the UK, known better as 'the dirty old man
of Europe'

<P>More good news today - Shell failed in an attempt to evict us
from the platform.  Apparently, the judge at the Edinburgh Court
of session said he wanted more time to consider his decision! 
This is a very important decision since our occupation of the
Brent Spar is the only thing stopping Shell from dumping this
toxic dilapidated oil rig into the North Sea.  Of course, Shell
were confident of the outcome and have already booked some
expensive contractors to decommission the toxic-laden platform
this weekend...all this waiting is costing them money but we are
staying as long as we have to to reverse this ridiculous plan to
dump the rig at sea!

<P>Bye from the high spirited occupants of the gently swaying
platform in the North Sea.

<H4>SHELL FAILS TO OBTAIN COURT'S CONSENT TO EVICT GREENPEACE</H4>

 <br>Brent Spar occupation enters Day 20</head><body>

<P>LONDON, Friday, 19 May 1995--Shell failed today in a legal
attempt to remove all the Greenpeace activists occupying the
Brent Spar oil platform.  At a hearing at the Edinburgh Court of
Session, Lord Johnston ordered the ejection of one protestor,
Jonathan Castle.

<P>The Judge refused to make an eviction order against the other
protestors aboard the rig because under Scots law the court did
not usually grant orders against unknown and unnamed people.

<P>Shell's failure to secure an eviction order against all the
Greenpeace protestors means that they are running out of time in
their battle to dump the Brent Spar.  This afternoon Greenpeace
goes to the High Court in London to seek leave for a Judicial
Review to challenge the legality of the licence to dump granted
by the UK Government.  If this court action is successful it will
stop Shell from carrying out the dumping.

<P>Today's court ruling means that Messengers at Arms can now board
the Brent Spar and arrest Jonathan Castle.

<P>"Shell has failed to get court backing to remove Greenpeace,"
said Greenpeace spokesperson Simon Reddy outside the court.  "The
Greenpeace campaign will continue until Shell faces up to its
environmental obligations and drops its plan to abandon tons of
toxic waste at sea."

<P>The Greepeace activists, all volunteers, will continue to occupy
the toxic-laden platform.  They will wait to see how the warrant
will be served and seek legal advice.

<P>International pressure on the UK Government to revoke its
permission to allow Shell to dump the platform was stepped up
again last night, when the European Parliament adopted
resolutions opposing the planned dumping of the Brent Spar and
other offshore installations.  The Parliament said dumping the
installations would "deliberately pollute the marine
environment".  

<P>The European Parliament sent their objections to North Sea
Conference member states, asking them to take all possible steps
to prevent the dumping of the Brent Spar and the other off shore
platforms at their meeting in Denmark (June 8-9). 

<P>This adds to the growing list of protests from both within and
outside the UK.  In the past week, the EU Environment
Commissioner, the Belgian, Danish and Icelandic Governments and
the Labour UK Opposition Party have all objected to the dumping.

<P>THE LATEST

<P>The Norwegian Parliament has decided that the first Norwegian oil
rig about to be put out of service, will not be dumped but taken
ashore, dismantled and recycled.  The Energy and Environment
Committee of the Parliament announced this morning that the first
platform, in the Frigg field in the Norwegian EEZ, would be dealt
with onshore.

 <P>
FROM:  GREENPEACE CREW OCCUPYING THE SHELL BRENT SPAR OIL      
       PLATFORM
DATE:  19 MAY, 1995 -- DAY 20
<P>


     
     <head><H4>
GREENPEACE ACTIVISTS PREPARE FOR EVICTION FROM THE BRENT SPAR</H4></head><body>

<P>

It is 0850 local time and we have just been up on the helideck
for a group photograph - just in case it is our last chance and
we get evicted.  However we hope that we will not and all the
national offices and Greenpeace staff are working towards that
end.

<P>The court case in Edinburgh, in which we will seek to overthrow
Shell's court order to evict us from the Brent Spar, takes place
in a couple of hours at 1000.  A few hours after that we will be
starting court proceedings in London against the UK Government's
licence to dump this toxic-laden platform into the North Sea.

<P>Yesterday we saw some more killer whales and caught some whiting
fish for our dinner.  This morning we were joined by three
journalists and campaigners from Germany and the Netherlands. 
The weather was good when they were transferred by the Greenpeace
support vessel Moby Dick and the hired fishing vessel, the
Starina.  At the moment, rain  and snow squalls are closing in. 
The helideck is covered in a banner reading "Save the seas",
flags, including the Shetland one, a multi-coloured high flying
kite and strings of helium filled balloons.

<P>14.41 local time, we have heard the news of the outcome of
Shell's court application to evict us from the platform - they
were seeking to eject all the Greenpeace activists on board the
Brent spar but have only succeeded in evicting the skipper, John
Castle.  Following this negative court decision in Edinburgh,
Scotland, we expect the operation to evict us to commence
shortly.  As a first step we expect Shell and the Sheriffs (law
officers) to attempt to board us and arrest John Castle.

<P>We expect them to board in the next eighteen hours using a very
large diving / rig support vessel, the Stadive which is eight
times the size of the Brent Spar platform and is currently 20
miles north in the Dunlin oil field.  The Staydive will probably
come alongside the Brent spar and put people down in cranes on
board the platform.

<P>We will oppose their action peacefully.  Spirits are good - people
working very hard - not getting any sleep - time for that
later.....!

<P>The long fight goes on, and political pressure is building up to
stop Shell from dumping this toxic-laden platform into the North
Sea.  

Be with us in spirit - more later.

<P> FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

  



<H4>SHELL FAILS IN EARLY MORNING ATTEMPT TO REMOVE GREENPEACE FROM

BRENT SPAR OIL PLATFORM IN THE NORTH SEA

</H4></head><body>

LONDON, 22 May, 1995 -- (GP) Under cover of night and a force 7

gale, Shell today failed in an attempt to end the 23-day

Greenpeace occupation of the Brent Spar oil installation in the

North Sea due to poor weather.



<P>At 2:45 a.m. the giant Stadive, a multi-use vessel, bigger than

a football field, approached from a north/northwest position and

pulled alongside the Brent Spar.  Floodlights were used to

illuminate the Brent Spar and Greenpeace protesters watched as

apparent efforts to extend a crane from the Stadive were made

without success.  As of approximately 4:45 a.m., Shell announced

that it had halted its efforts to remove Greenpeace due to

inclement weather. 



<P>"The sea itself has granted us a stay of execution today," said

Greenpeace's Chris Rose.  "We're determined to stay on the Brent

Spar platform until Shell and the UK government abandon their

plans to dump this highly toxic platform."



<P>Those who have voiced criticism of Shell and the UK government's

plan to dump the Brent Spar include the EU Environment

Commissioner, European Parliament (EP), Denmark, Belgium, Iceland

and even the UK's own Labour Party.  EP objections went to North

Sea member states last week, asking them to take all possible

steps at their upcoming meeting in Denmark (June 8-9) to prevent

the dumping of Brent Spar and other offshore platforms. Norway

decided last week that its first out-of-service rig will not be

dumped but taken ashore and recycled.



<P>"The UK must enter the 21st century and join other North Sea

states to  permanently eliminate the dumping and discharge of

these toxic wastes," Rose said.



<P>Ironically, the Shell attempt at removing the Brent Spar

occupation comes on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of

Ken Saro-Wiwa, Nigerian writer and environmentalist. Saro-Wiwa

is a spokesman for the Ogoni people, who are protesting at

Shell's devastation of their lands in the  Niger Delta over the

past 30 years.  Saro Wiwa has been in prison for a year now after

being arrested on false charges of murder. For most of that time

his health has deteriorated.  He has spent weeks chained to the

wall.  Shell continues to deny its involvement but there is

growing evidence of the link between the Nigerian military

activities in the Delta and Shell.  The Brent Spar crew yesterday

sent a message of solidarity to Ken Saro Wiwa (see over)

<P>EDITOR'S NOTE:  INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS - broken promises: 

The dumping of the Brent Spar would be against the spirit of

several international conventions the UK is party to, including:

-    The Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf 1958: "any 

     installations ...must be entirely  removed;"

-    London Convention 1972: "take all practical steps to     

     prevent the pollution of the sea by the dumping of wastes;"

-    OSPAR Convention 1992: "to prevent and eliminate pollution 

     resulting from abandonment of offshore installations".





<P>MESSAGE FROM THE BRENT SPAR ON KEN SARO WIWA



<P>Brent Spar          May 21, 1995



<P>   Today, on the eve of the first anniversary of the arrest of

Ken Saro-Wiwa, we the Greenpeace environmental protesters

occupying the Brent Spar wish to express our admiration and

solidarity for Ken and the Ogoni people.    Ken is in military

confinement in Nigeria, after no trial, and is being

systematically starved and tortured.  This is because the oil

found under his homeland of Ogoni is valued by the military

dictatorship and by their friends Shell oil.  In Ken's homeland,

villages are being destroyed, Ogoni people terrorized and killed,

their land despoiled.  All for the black gold which Shell and the

military desire.  Shell has the influence to put an end to this

appalling situation now.  We the Brent Spar crew - attempting to

prevent the environmental crime of dumping this contaminated oil

platform, owned by Shell, into the ocean - call upon Shell to act

now to alleviate the suffering of Ken Saro-Wiwa, and of the Ogoni

people.  Ken has said that "the environment is man's first

right".



<P>We humbly agree with him.



<P>Our troubles now, in confrontation with Shell, are beneath

mention compared with Ken's real and terrible suffering.  If he

survives, his health will never again be complete.



<P>In Sorrow and empathy we try to stretch our small hand of

solidarity towards Ken at this time.



<P>In anger and contempt we contemplate the Shell oil company,

despoiler of the earth and ocean, trampler of human rights.



<P>You can't Sink a Rainbow.



<P>Ken Saro-Wiwa must live.



<P>Crew of the Greenpeace Brent Spar

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<H4>GREENPEACE ACTIVISTS WHO OCCUPIED BRENT SPAR ARRIVE IN SHETLAND
WHILE LEGAL EFFORTS TO STOP THE DUMPING CONTINUE IN LONDON</H4>

<P>LONDON, 24 May, 1995, 1:30 BST -- (GP) The remaining Greenpeace
activists who occupied the Brent Spar in protest of plans to dump
the toxic oil platform at sea have just arrived in Shetland.

<P>The first group of eight activists and six journalists were taken
by Shell helicopter yesterday from the Stadive to Shetland.  None
of those returned have been charged.  The remaining Greenpeace
activists on the Stadive refused to leave until all were safely
off the Brent Spar. 

<P>Shell told reporters that Jon Castle will be taken to Aberdeen
this evening from Shetland and will then be released.

<P>Greenpeace is currently in court proceedings in the High Court
in London to attempt to challenge the government's decision to
allow the dumping of the highly toxic and radioactive oil
platform at sea. 

<P>"Although our occupation of the rig has ended, the fight to stop
the dumping of the Brent Spar oil platform is not over yet," said
Jan Rispens, one of Greenpeace's Brent Spar activists.  "We
continue to work to stop the dumping in the courts and at the
North Sea Conference."  

<P>Criticism against Shell and the UK government's plan to dump the
Brent Spar continues to grow with Germany adding its voice to
those of the EU Environment Commissioner, European Parliament
(EP), Denmark, Belgium, Iceland and even the UK's own Labour
Party.  The issue is likely to be hotly debated at the upcoming
meeting of the North Sea Conference in Denmark (June 8-9).

<P>"The occupation of the Spar has again highlighted Shell and the
UK government's outrageous attitude towards our seas," Rispens
said. "They seem determined to take the cheapest option rather
than the safer alternative known to them."

<H4>UK GOVERNMENT USES LEGAL TECHNICALITY TO BLOCK GREENPEACE
CHALLENGE ON DUMPING OF BRENT SPAR</H4>  
 
<P>LONDON, 24 May 1995, 4 pm -- (GP) The High Court quashed any
possibility of a Greenpeace challenge to the UK Government's
decision to allow the dumping at sea of the Brent Spar oil
platform in a British court today. 
 
<P>The UK Government and Shell had argued that the case should be
heard in the Scottish courts.  After nearly a full day in court,
the judge ruled that the English courts had no jurisdiction over
the case despite the fact that he agreed Greenpeace would have
no standing in the Scottish courts.  The judge suggested the case
be taken to Scotland anyway.
 
<P>"This decision, based on a legal technicality, means that no
British court can hear Greenpeace challenge the Government.  In
effect it is a decision by the UK Government to allow Shell to
dump toxic chemicals and radioactive waste at sea," said
Madeleine Cobbing of Greenpeace.  "If the Government could
justify what it is doing it could defend itself in court.  It is
obviously too frightened to argue the case with Greenpeace."
 
<P>Criticism against Shell and the UK Government's plan to dump the
Brent Spar continues to grow with Germany adding its voice to
those of the EU Environment Commissioner, European Parliament
(EP), Denmark, Belgium, Iceland and even the UK's own Labour
Party.  The issue is likely to be hotly debated at the upcoming
meeting of the North Sea Conference in Denmark (June 8-9).
 
<P>"The UK Government can still stop the dumping of the Brent Spar
if it has the courage to take the right decision.  We call on
them to respond to the International condemnation from other
Governments, and cancel the dumping of the Brent Spar
immediately."
 
<P>As the last of the Brent Spar occupiers returned to the mainland,
Greenpeace pledged to continue its campaign against the dumping
of the Brent Spar and of all hazardous substances into the sea.
 
<P>Calls from other North Sea States to eliminate the discharge of
hazardous substances into the sea are still being resisted by the
UK Government.  A Greenpeace report* released tomorrow reveals
that the UK is still the worst polluter of the North Sea.

<H4>GREENPEACE BOARDS BRENT SPAR AGAIN; OCCUPIES TOW TUG</H4> 

<P>Scotland--07 June 1995--Shell's plans to dump the Brent Spar have
been thwarted again by Greenpeace activists
who, over the past 12 hours, have both climbed the oil
installation in the North Sea and blocked the tug in
Aberdeen which is supposed to tow the Spar. 

<P><a href="banne.gif">
<img align=top src="bannet.gif" alt="photo1.">80KB GIF</a>
 or <a href="banne.jpg">26KB JPG.</a> Greenpeace/Steve Cox.

<P>In the early hours of this morning, five activists from
Greenpeace vessel Moby Dick, out in the North Sea,
climbed the Spar and hung a banner reading "Save Our Seas" from
the walkway. They attempted to paint the side
of the Spar, but were knocked back by water cannons from the
nearby Shell supply vessel the Rembas.  

<P>Around 10.30 a.m. the climbers got back onto the Moby Dick, after
spending hours at the mercy of the hoses. 
As the last three climbers came off, the water cannons were
turned on them again and one woman, was sprayed
with the water cannon for a constant 20 minutes while she was
dangling on a rope.  Shell has denied this, saying
they were "testing equipment." 

<P>"Shell seems to have the same disregard for the safety of people
as it does for the safety of the environment. This
is appalling behaviour," said Martijn Lodewijks aboard the Moby
Dick. 

<P>Meanwhile in Aberdeen Harbour late last night, Greenpeace
climbers locked themselves to mooring ropes and the
superstructure of the Smit Singapore, the tug that is to tow the
Brent Spar to the North East Atlantic where Shell
plans to dump it.  Two divers disabled the propellor.  Ten people
were arrested, so far without charge, but two climbers were up the
mast of the ocean-going tug for 12 hours, delaying
the dumping for over 12 hours.

<img align=top src="banne2t.gif" alt="photo1.">82KB GIF</a>
 or <a href="banne2.jpg">34KB JPG.</a> Greenpeace/Steve Cox.

<P>Greenpeace understands that Shell is proceeding with its plans
to dump the Brent Spar as soon as possible -- indeed
it seems that Shell wants to start towing the Spar at exactly the
same time as Environment Ministers from around
Europe discuss the pollution of the North Sea at a meeting in
Denmark.

<P>"On the day North Sea states are discussing discharges of
hazardous substances into the sea, it is disgusting that
Shell and the UK Government are going ahead with dumping the
toxic-laden Brent Spar.  The North Sea states
put their environmental credentials to the test this week -- they
can agree zeroemissions as soon as possible or allow the seas to be used as a
dumping ground," said Chris Rose in Aberdeen.

<P>The latest country to protest the Spar's dumping is Ireland,
where the Irish Minister of State at the Dept of the
Marine, Eamon Gilmore, has asked the UK Government to postpone
the dumping until the end of June to allow
the Oslo Commission to review the conditions governing the
dumping of offshore installations at sea.

<P>
In northern Denmark, Greenpeace activists this morning have
blockaded a pesticides plant - Cheminova - which
manufactures pesticides so hazardous that they are not able to
be sold in Denmark.  The plant is Denmark's largest
single direct industrial source of hazardous substances to the
North Sea.

<head>From:From the Moby Dick.<P>
Date: Wednesday June 7th 1995<P>
</head><body>



 
 <P>About three o'clock this morning, five of our climbers from the
Moby Dick, climbed up the Brent Spar using ropes and grappling
irons, to hang banners and paint slogans.

 <P>We were all very much aware of Shell's vessel, the Rembas
loitering below, but nobody was prepared for the appalling
actions that were about to take place.  



 <P>Firstly, Shell workers approached the climbers' ropes with
knives, and much to our horror tried to cut them. They didn't
succeed and went away, allowing us to continue dropping the
banner which read: "Save Our Seas".

 <P>But obviously after some consultation, they decided to try and
remove them again, but this time with water cannons.
We watched aghast as they were knocked back with the sheer force
of the freezing water spray. It was an incredible effort to keep
holding on. One of the women on the rope was sprayed for a 
continuous 20 minutes.

 <P>Eventually after five hours, they had to climb down back onto the
Moby, because they were so cold and tired.

 <P>I radioed the Captain of the Rembas four or five times, urgently
asking him to stop the sprays.  He ignored me. We, on the Moby,
were shocked at Shell's violent acts of behaviour. It seems they
are oblivious to the seriousness of threatening human lives. 
Ironic really, when only a few weeks ago they stressed concern
on the safety conditions for the protesters on the rig.  
In actual fact, Shell seems to have the same disregard for the
safety of people as it does the safety of the environment.

 <P>Later we were told that the men on the Rembas were just testing
equipment, and denied what we witnessed they were really doing,
which was target practice rather than fire practice.

 <P>Determind to fight to the very end -- late last night we locked
ourselves to the mooring ropes and the superstructure of the Smit
Singapore; the tug that will tow the Brent Spar to its dumping
ground.

 <P>When the police showed up, they arrested ten activists, and left
two others perched on the mast, delaying the dumping for over 12
hours.

 <P>On the day North Sea states are discussing discharges of
hazardous substances into the sea, it's disgusting that Shell and
the UK Government are going ahead with dropping the toxic-laden 
Brent Spar into the ocean. The North Sea states put their
environmental credentials to the test this week -- they can agree
zero emissions as soon as possible or allow the seas to be used
as a dumping ground.

<P>Date:Friday 9th June.  
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE




<H4>GREENPEACE REVEALS LEAKED DOCUMENT: BRENT SPAR CAN BE FEASIBLY AND CHEAPLY
DECOMMISSIONED ON LAND</H4> 

<P>Esbjerg, Denmark--9 June 1995--A Shell report - leaked by Greenpeace today at
the North Sea Conference -- reveals that contrary to previous Shell
assertions, the Brent Spar could feasibly be towed back to land and
decommissioned at a cost less than a quarter of the amount Shell quoted in its
original estimates. 

<P>The report*,  produced by Smit Engineering in 1992, is a 200 page analysis. 
It shows that the structure of the Brent Spar could be repaired to enable it
to be towed safely back to shore. 

<P>Yesterday UK Minister for the Environment John Gummer said at the North Sea
Conference that the Spar would only be disposed of in the most environmentally
safe manner.  However, Greenpeace understands that the Department of the
Environment had no knowledge of this report.  it was not included in Shell's
key submissions to the Government -- the Best Practical Environmental Options
(BPEO) and the Abandonment Hypothesis. 

<P>The Smit report describes how the Spar could safely be dismantled on land
rather than sinking it together with its "cargo" of toxic and radioactive
waste.  This could be done at a cost of no more than 10 million pounds.  Shell
have said that on-land decommissioning would cost 45 million pounds. 

<P>"It seems hat the UK Government did not have the best information on which to
base their decision to dump the Brent Spar at sea.  Shell seem to have kept
this vital information very quiet," said Mary Morrison, Greenpeace
spokesperson.  "There is no justification at all for dumping 14,500 tonnes of
toxic rubbish in the sea -- John Gummer must stop it now." 

<P>Most of the other North sea States have opposed the dumping of the Brent Spar. 
Today the Ministers will take a decision on whether all offshore oil
installations should be disposed of on land.  There are some 400- oil rigs in
the North Sea - 50 of which will come up for decommissioning within the next
ten years. 
<P>Meanwhile Shell is continuing with the work to decommission.  The Greenpeace
ship Moby Dick, which is monitoring activities at the Brent Spar in the North
Sea, confirms that three vessels -- one carrying explosives plus two towing
tugs - are in the area.  The blowing of the anchor chains to prepare for
towing is imminent and work could begin as early as tonight.

prepared by Smit Engineering BV.  Attached are key pages from the report.

<HR>
<H4>GREENPEACE WELCOMES IMPORTANT DECISIONS AT NORTH SEA CONFERENCE</H4> 
<HR>
<P>Esbjerg, Denmark--9 June 1995--Greenpeace today welcomed the
important agreement of the North Sea States to end the discharge
of all hazardous chemicals into the North Sea and the wider
environment. 

<P>Greenpeace now demands that all North Sea governments give urgent
priority to achieving this as soon as possible. The chemical
industry, despite putting heavy pressure on Governments, has been
totally defeated.  Most North Sea States also agreed to end the
dumping of oil installations at sea.  The UK still insists
however that the Brent Spar should be dumped in the face of
severe criticism.

<P>"Years of campaigning by Greenpeace have finally paid off," said
Tim Birch, Greenpeace North Sea Campaigner.  "North Sea
Governments now recognise that it's unacceptable to allow
industries to dump toxic waste into rivers and the sea.  Provided
Governments live up to this agreement, the North Sea now has a
chance to recover after years of abuse.  This is a resounding
defeat for the chemical industry who have always seen the seas
as their private toxic sewer," said Birch.

<P>The Conference agreed on the following:

<P>HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES:

<P>All Ministers, except the UK, agreed to end the discharges,
emissions and losses of all man-made synthetic hazardous
substances into the environment within 25 years.  This means that
the current system of giving permits for discharges which contain
synthetic chemicals will be phased out. Industry has a maximum
period of 25 years within which to convert to clean non-polluting
technologies.   

<P>OFF-SHORE OIL INSTALLATION AND THE BRENT SPAR:

<P>Most of the North Sea States have severely condemned the UK for
the imminent dumping of the Brent Spar.  Greenpeace welcomes that
most North Sea States have agreed that it is totally unacceptable
to dump offshore installations at sea and recommend the
decommissioning of rigs on land.  The only objections to this
recommendation came from the UK, France and Norway. The UK
Government and Shell continue to view the North Sea as their
private dumping ground for rubbish. 

<P>RADIOACTIVE WASTE:

<P>North Sea States have agreed that radioactive discharges to water
bodies should be reduced yet the UK Government is to allow a
massive increase in discharges from the THORP plant at Sellafield
and increases in emissions are taking place in France from Cap
de la Hague. Greenpeace condemns the hyprocrisy of the UK
Government to allow such increases in the face of agreement to
reduce.   

<P>NUTRIENTS

All countries apart from the UK agreed a need for measures to 
prevent eutrophication caused by nutrients throughout the North
Sea.  This is a positive move because previous measures covered
only some areas of the North Sea. 

<P>FISHERIES

Despite the catastrophic situation of North Sea fish stocks, the
conference totally failed to deliver the strict conservation
measures urgently needed. Obviously, North Sea environment
ministers are lacking the political will and the courage to
denounce fisheries management failures and the disastrous
consequences. They are simply condemning the marine environment
and the fishing communities dependent upon it.

<P>From:    The Greenpeace vessel Altair
<br>Date:    Tues 13-JUN-95 16:06:12 GMT
<br><head><H4>Subject: internet update</H4></head><body>
<br>Latest update:

<P>We've been following the enormous monstrosity of the Shell oil
platform Brent Spar now for two days.  We are travelling
incredibly slowly toward the planned dump site.  Even at the
distance we are from the rig the Brent Spar looms across the
whole of our horizon. It's midday, and the rig is 45 Nautical
miles from Shetland.

<P>This morning, when we launched inflatables from the Altair,
Shell's boats, the Rembas and Torbas started spraying us and the
Spar with water cannons.  They sent a message out to Greenpeace
saying it was carrying out "fire practice," and warned that it
would be dangerous to go near the Spar, and Shell would have no
liability if anyone was injured. 

<P>In Lerwick Harbour in the Shetland Islands, fishing vessels are
flying Greenpeace flags with the Shell logo covered in oil, and
"don't dump the sea" written on them. It's good to know that
people around us are giving us their support. Cliche as it is,
every little bit helps. 

<P>Today we heard that the UK Government has received the copy of
the Shell report we leaked on the 'real' cost of decommissioning
of the Spar on land rather than dumping at sea.  Shell had
commissioned the report several years ago but it shows that the
cost of land decommissioning would be 9 million pounds, not the
30-40 million pounds Shell is quoting.   The UK government was denied this
information when it made its decision.  We hope the fact that
Shell is clearly withholding information that they think will not
help their claim to dump may motivate the government to
reconsider its permission.

<P>International pressure continues to build on Shell to change its
mind.  We call on anyone out there in the internet world to
write, call, fax and generally voice loudly their opposition to
Shell's plan to dump the rig in the Atlantic.  This campaign is
winnable.  We need your help.

<P>More as we continue our voyage,

<P>The crew of the Altair

<P>From:    Greenpeace vessel Altair tracking the Shell Brent Spar dumping flotilla 
<br>Date:    SAT 17-JUN-95 13:43:50 GMT, Part I
<br><head><H4>Subject:  Update, Sat lunchtime</H4></head><body>

<P>Position of Spar as at 1200 hours - 60 25 North, 05 27 West.
Distance travelled so far is 248 nautical miles.  Average speed
is 1.8 knots, present speed is 2.1 knots.   Wind is
southwesterly, force 4-5, sea swell is 2 metres.  Heading is 240
degrees.  Direction and distance from Esha Ness on Shetland is
276 degrees and 114 miles.
 
<P>Earlier this morning the helicopter again approached
the Spar and dropped four packages of supplies and equipment off
to our two activists still occupying the Brent Spar oil platform. 
One of the protestors on board had to wait for the fire hoses
being used by Shell vessels on them continually to be turned away
before he was able to move them down inside the lower decks. 

<P>The Shell hoses were turned directly on the heli deck making
movement impossible.  They turned away when our ship the Altair
moved closer to the Spar and the heli deck was left alone for a
brief moment -- long enough for them to retrieve their supplies.
 
<P>There are still two crew members from the Altair on board the
Shell vessel Rembas.  Radio contact was made from the Altair but
a request to speak to them was refused.  The Altair was told that
the two had been allowed to make phone calls home.
 
<P>One of the Shell tugs reported that it was unable to keep up the
tow overnight, but any problems now seem to have been solved. 
They have had a number of problems since they set out last
Sunday.
 
<P>We hear that there has been massive press coverage in the UK
today - and last night on TV lots of shots of the heli and water
cannon were used.  Protesters gathered at at least 100 Shell
stations in the UK in 40 counties today.  We are grateful for
that news! 
 
<P>Finally, we have run out of the "DON'T DUMP THE SEA" flags. 
The last one (which was stuck to the window of the office here)
was given to a crew member on one of the Shell rig maintenance
vessels, the Kommander Subsea - the flag was flying on the vessel
about an hour later!  That's the kind of support we need!

<P>More during our slow, and wet, journey!

<br>Date:    SAT 17-JUN-95 18:04:09 GMT, Part II
<br><H4>Subject:   brent spar evening update late Sat</H4>


<P>Position as at 6pm, 60 deg 16.8 north, 05 deg 42 West.  Distance
travelled is 263 n miles.  Average speed is 1.9 knots, present
speed is 2 knots.  Weather - moderate to high swell, wind
southwesterly beaufort scale 3, wave height 2.5 metres.  Present
heading is 240 deg.  Position is 143 n miles west of Shetland.
 
<P>The rig supply vessel, the Krombas, has now joined the Shell
flotilla and is shadowing the Greenpeace vessel Altair. This is
a similar ship to the Rembas and Torbas.  Our helicopter made
another flight and dropped more material on the Spar, then made
a drop on the Altair too.  When this happened the Krombas took
considerable interest in the Altair and started shadowing it
closely.  Even when the Altair moved away from the Spar, and was
at a distance of 2-3 n miles, the Krombas stayed with it and
hosed it down.  When asked what they were doing, the Krombas
replied that they were practising with their fire equipment, they
later said that they intended to restrict the visibility of the
Altair.
 
<P>That is all for now....  be back in touch tomorrow.

<P>From:     Crew of the Greenpeace vessel Altair tracking Shell Brent Spar dumping flotilla
<br>Date:     Monday 19 June 0800 hours BST
<br><head><H4>Subject:  Brent Spar morning update, 0800 hours BST, Monday 20th June Part 1</H4></head><body>

<P>Update in the morning from the Altair 
 
<P>The Spar is still being towed with one day to go before it
reaches the dumpsite with a current position of 59 deg 52 North,
07 deg 54 West. Distance from land, 97 n miles NW of the Butt of
Lewis on the outer Hebrides.

<P>The distance travelled so far is now 330 n miles with another 103
n miles to go. The flotilla is travelling at an average speed of
1.8 knots. Current heading is 245 deg.  Weather conditions are
not in Shell's favour - rather rough - SSW force 6, sea swell 2.5
metres. 
 
<P>We on the Altair were given a warning by the Shell support
vessel, Krombas, this morning, not to go within 500 metres of the
Spar.  We were told that there is a trap ready for us if we try
to do this - more specifically they said that there is a net to
catch us and divers ready to board us. The Krombas spokesperson
then said, "So long as you keep outside 500 meters, I can go back
to my bed, if not I warn you my trap is ready and my knife is
sharpened."

<P>Nice guy, huh?  Guess he hasn't heard about our 22 years as a
non-violent organization. 

<HR>
<H4>Brent Spar lunchtime update 19th June 1995, 1200 hours BST.  </H4>

<P>Our current position at noon today is 59 deg 48 North, 08 deg 09
West. Distance now travelled is 335 n miles, 95 nm to go to North
Feni Ridge. Average speed is 1.85 knots, current speed is 1.9
knots.  Distance from the Butt of Lewis is 97 n miles at a
bearing of 223 deg (WSW). Heading is 243 deg.

<P>Conditions - wind is SSW force 5/6, wave height is 1 metre, sea
swell is 3 metres.
 
<P>By our calculations, using the current speed as a guide, the ETA
at the planned dump site is 1400 hours on 21st June.

<P>Shell vessel HMS Orkney has now left our party - having been
replaced by a larger vessel.  This is too far away to be
identified but has one GUN on the fore deck and large cranes on
the aft deck.  Orkney is rumoured to be heading for the Hebrides.
 
<P>Shell vessel HMS Alderney has not been seen near the Spar and is
assumed to be elsewhere on other duties.

<P>The MV Solo left Stornoway (the West Isles of Scotland) at noon
today with a large number of journalists and crew
which will join us at the dump site, North Feni Ridge some time
tomorrow.  We will bear witness to the dumping of the toxic laden
Spar flotilla should it go forward. 

<P>Today, there was a Greenpeace protest outside the Royal Dutch
Headquarters in the Hague, the Netherlands. Tomorrow Austria, 
Ireland and Spain will join the eight countries who have called
for the public not to buy Shell products in order to register
their protest over the dumping of the Spar into the sea.

<P>It is amazing to see the public and governmental support that we
and the two activists occupying the flotilla are getting over the
outrageous dumping plans for the once disused oil rig.  However,
we do not condone the acts of violence against Shell property
that have been reported out of Germany.  We urge people to employ
only peaceful methods of protests (such as not buying Shell
products, writing letters to your Environment Ministers and
writing letters to the Shell Chairman). 

<P>More from the Altair as we go.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>BRENT SPAR</B>

<P>Shell U.K. Limtited still believes that deep water disposal of the Brent Spar is the best practicable environmental option, which was supported by independent studies.  Shell UK obtained the necessary permit for disposal for the UK authorities, which have handled every aspect of the approval process in accordance with established national and international policies and standards.

<p>As the disposal involved the Atlantic deep water, other governments have taken an interest and voiced strong objections.  Notwithstanding the efforts to convince these governments of the validity of the approach, most of them remain strongly against deep water disposal.

<P>The European companies of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group find themselves in an intenable position and feel that it is not possible to continue without wider support from the governments participating in the Oslo-Paris Convention.

<P>Shell UK has decided to abandon deepwater disposal and seek from the UK authoities a licence for onshore disposal.  This application for onshore disposal wil include a further review of methods to minimise the risks involved.

<P>The way forward will require the co-operation of all concerned, in particular the support of other governments in securing the availability of a deep water safe anchorage for Brent Spar in the immediate future.

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE




<H4>NORTH EAST ATLANTIC STATES TO DISCUSS COMPLETE BAN ON OFFSHORE OIL INSTALLATION DUMPING </H4> 

<body>



 
 

  
<P>LONDON, -- Greenpeace today called on the Oslo and
Paris (OSPAR) Commissions to stop marine pollution and ban the
legal disposal of oil rigs and platforms at sea at their annual
meeting taking place in Brussels from 26 -30 June. 
 
<P>A proposal for the prohibition of the dumping of offshore
installations at sea (put forward by Sweden), another on the
regulation of the dumping of wastes by military vessels and one
on the prohibition of chlorinated paraffins are all up for
discussion at the meeting.
 
<P>This year's meeting is taking place under special circumstances
because it takes place:
 
<P>Only days after Shell reversed its decision to dump the
Brent Spar oil platform even as the UK Government continues to
oppose the company's decision.  A majority of OSPAR member
states* as well as the EU Commission have already made it clear
to the UK Government that dumping is an unacceptable way of
dealing with oil installations and that OSPAR should ban the
practice altogether;
 
<P>Two weeks after the 4th Ministerial North  Sea Conference
where the majority of governments pledged to ban  the dumping of
offshore platforms at sea, and where the governments (with the
exception of the UK) agreed to cease all  discharges and
emissions of hazardous substances into the North Sea within 25
years;
 
<P>A few weeks after Germany decided to cease the production of
chlorinated paraffins due to environmental and health impacts,
prompting a plan by the UK to increase their own production of
this lethal and unnecessary chlorinated product;
 
 
<P>"The OSPAR meeting in Brussels is the perfect opportunity for
governments to put their words into action", said Greenpeace's
delegate to the meeting Remi Parmentier. "Greenpeace is hopeful
that they will use their political will to pass bans on the
dumping of offshore installations, chlorinated paraffins,
military dumping, and to make progress on drawing immediate plans
to cease all toxic discharges, as agreed by the North Sea
Ministers".

<P>
<HR>                
<P>Notes:
 
<P> the OSPAR Commission is the intergovernmental body that
regulates pollution in the North East Atlantic, from the Arctic 
to Gibraltar.  Its members are: Portugal, Spain, France, 
Ireland, Iceland, the UK, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Norway, 
Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, and the European Union. The 
Commission adopts decisions and recommendations by a two thirds
majority. 
 
<P> the OSPAR Commission has already banned the dumping at sea of
industrial wastes, radioactive wastes, and ocean incineration.
But it still allows the dumping of offshore installations at sea,
and the discharge of toxic and radioactive wastes from land into
rivers, estuaries and coastal waters.
 
<P> Last year Greenpeace detected military vessels from several
countries dumping wastes at sea (mainly obsolete ammunition)
despite the ban on the dumping of industrial wastes.  This has
prompted a Dutch proposal this year, to reach agreement that the
military are no special case, and that they should abide by the
rules of the Commission.
 
<P> The meeting will be held at the Palais des Congres  Hall 
Dynastie entrance  5 - Coudenberg 3, 1000 Brussels, tel. 32-2-513 
63  63, Fax. 32-2-513 64 14.
 
<P> Information on press accreditation can be obtained from the
OSPAR Secretariat at 44-171-242 99 27.

<P><head>   <H4>    GREENPEACE RESPONSE TO THE UK GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL
         THAT DUMPING THE BRENT SPAR REMAINS AN OPTION
 </H4></head><body>
<P>LONDON, 20 July 1995--The proposal to dump the Brent Spar in the
North Atlantic was greeted by widespread public opposition.  At
last month's Oslo and Paris Commission (OSPARCOM) meeting, 11 out
of 13 countries agreed a moratorium on the dumping of offshore
installations, pending agreement on a outright ban.  

<P>The opposition to dumping the Brent Spar was based on the
following facts: 
 
<P>(i) There has been no formal inventory of the Brent Spar's
contents, so the environmental impacts could not possibly be
properly assessed. 
 
<P>(ii) There is a lack of understanding of the deep sea
environment, and it is currently impossible to predict the
effects of the proposed dumping on deep sea ecosystems. 
 
<P>(iii) The documents which supported Shell's licence application
are highly conjectural in nature. They contain numerous
unsubstantiated assumptions, minimal data and extrapolations from
unnamed studies. 
 
<P>(iv) Dumping the Brent Spar would create a precedent for dumping
other contaminated structures in the sea and would undermine
current international agreements.  The environmental effects of
further dumping would be cumulative. 
 
<P>v) Dismantling of the Brent Spar is technically feasible and
offshore engineering firms believe they can do it safely and
effectively. The necessary facilities are already routinely in
use and decommissioning of many other oil installations has
already been carried out elsewhere in the world. 
 
<P>(vi) To protect the environment, the principle of minimising the
generation of wastes should be upheld and harmful materials
always recycled, treated or contained. 
 
<P>Greenpeace believes Shell UK were right in not dumping the Brent
Spar.  This view is supported by most governments in Europe and
a vast majority of the public.  There will always be scientific
debate, but in the arena of this debate the principle of
precautionary action is applied and the benefit of the doubt
given to the environment.  

<P>"It is no longer acceptable to simply dump and see what might
happen," said Greenpeace campaigner Paul Horsman.  "With land-
based disposal options available, the proposal to dump is the
irresponsible route," Horsman said.

<P><head><title>Text of Greenpeace statement on incorrect toxic sludge inventory.</title></head><body>


<h4>GREENPEACE STANDS BY ITS CAMPAIGN TO STOP THE BRENT SPAR BEING
DUMPED AT SEA</h4>

<p><B>London --5 September 1995</B>--Throughout the Brent Spar campaign
Greenpeace based its case upon figures supplied by Shell. These
indicated that the Brent Spar contained approximately 100 tonnes
of toxic sludge and 30 tonnes of low level radioactive waste.

<p>However, during its campaign against the dumping of the Brent
Spar installation, Greenpeace took samples from three of the six
storage tanks because of Shell's failure to provide an inventory
of the contents of the installation. The results were published
only five days before Shell reversed its decision to dump the
Brent Spar.

<p>Greenpeace scientists who analysed the samples were given the
wrong information regarding the depths that the samples were
taken. Instead of the depths being measured at the top of the
storage tanks they were taken from top of vent pipes that gave
access to the tanks. As a result of this, the estimate for the
amount of oil remaining in the Brent Spar is likely to be in
error.<p>However, the true inventory of the Brent Spar is still unclear.

<p><B>"Although regrettable, Greenpeace does not consider the
misunderstandings in our calculations to be of primary
importance. It does not deflect from the strength of our case
against sea dumping,"</B> said Sue Mayer, Greenpeace UK Science
Director. 

<p><B>"Our opposition to the plans for deep sea disposal, and our
public and political work were based on the information provided
by Shell.  The reports on which they based their initial decision
have been criticised by independent scientists."</B>
<a href="brent.html#debate">For these documents Click here.</a>
<p><B>At the moment Det Norske Veritas (DNV) is conducting a complete
inventory of the Spar.</B> Greenpeace has constantly expressed
support for the DNV inventory and hopes that it will provide
essential information on which to base the precise programme for
dismantling of the spar on land.<B> DNV will present its findings
on 18 October.
</B>
<p><B>"The Greenpeace position on the Spar has never been based on
kilos or tons, but on the principles of dumping.</B> This has also
been the debate in the wider political community. Clearly the way
forward is to initiate as constructive a debate as quickly as
possible on the decommissioning and disposal of oil installations
in general, and how best to address the on-shore disposal of the
Spar itself." said Mayer.
 
<p>"Greenpeace relies on the trust of the public. Because of this
we were happy to make it known that we had made a minor mistake.
Greenpeace only wishes that Shell and the UK Government would be
as honest and publicly admit their mistakes." said Mayer.

<p>I'm looking forward to our meeting this Wednesday.  In advance
of seeing you, I am writing to you about the results of our
sampling on the Brent Spar.
     
<p>As you know, we were concerned that no full analysis had been
done of the contents of the Brent Spar prior to your decision to
dump it.  Greenpeace therefore took some samples from a storage
tank on the Brent Spar during our occupation.  We were not able
to sample tanks 2 and 4 as the vent pipes were blocked with oily
sludge.  We thought samples had been successfully taken from
storage tank 1, but we have realised in the last few days that
when the samples were taken the sampling device was still in the
pipe leading into the storage tanks, rather than in the tank
itself.       
<P>In many references to our sampling, we stressed that the results
were not definitive, but I'm afraid that in writing to you and
your colleagues on the Shell UK Board on 19 June, I said that our
sampling showed a particular quantity of oil on the Brent Spar. 
That was wrong, and I apologise to you and your colleagues for
this.
     
<P>As I've said, our main concern was that there should be a full
and independent inventory of the contents of the Brent Spar, and
Greenpeace is delighted that, following your decision not to dump
the Brent Spar at sea, such an inventory is being compiled by the
independent analysts DNV.      
<p>As you also know from my letter to you of 16 August, since your
decision not to dump the Brent Spar, scientists have now made it
clear that there were fundamental flaws in the scientific
arguments that Shell UK put forward to the public and to UK
Government Ministers, justifying your decision to dump, in
particular, concerning the ecology of the area where you proposed
to dump the Brent Spar.  I hope that is something, now you have
the evidence for this, that Shell UK will be prepared to admit
publicly.
                                            
<p>In any event, as you  know, the basic argument between Greenpeace
and the European governments that supported our position on the
one hand, and Shell UK and the UK Government on the other, was
not about the contents of the Brent Spar, nor the physical
characteristics of the proposed dump site.  The argument was
about whether it was right to dump industrial waste of any sort
in the deep oceans, whether dumping the Brent Spar would be a
precedent for dumping other oil installations, and indeed other
waste in the oceans, and, fundamentally, over whether we should
dump wastes into any part of the environment, as opposed to
reducing waste, and recycling, treating or containing harmful
materials.  Our view remains that the division between us on the
Brent Spar depends on how deeply we value our environment, and
what damage and precedents we find unacceptable.      
As information about our sampling on the Brent Spar was made
available to the press, I am making this letter similarly
available, and I would be grateful if you could convey my
apologies to your colleagues on the Board of Shell UK.
     
<p>I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday.

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
<P><H4>SHELL EXPRESSES CONFIDENCE IN FINDING ALTERNATIVE TO DUMPING BRENT SPAR AT SEA IN MEETING WITH GREENPEACE</H4>
 
<P><B>LONDON, 9 January, 1995</B> -- In a meeting today between
Greenpeace International Executive Director Thilo Bode and Shell UK Chairman Dr Chris Fay, Shell expressed its confidence that the company would find alternatives to dumping the
disused Brent Spar oil instillation at sea.
 
<P>During the meeting to discuss the Brent Spar and other North Sea oil installations and the environmental implications of disposal options, Mr Bode requested that Shell prepare a
comprehensive plan for the decommissioning of all of its oil installations on land.
 
<P>Mr Bode pointed to a report by the industry association UKOOA (UK Offshore Operators Association), "Options For Oil And Gas Structures In The North Sea," which concludes that, on
balance, the on-land disposal and recycling of oil rigs is preferable to sea dumping on environmental grounds.
 
<P>Commissioned by the Aberdeen University group AURIS, the
report states that for steel jackets, the steel structures of installations, "total removal and return to the shore for recycling is the best option".(1)
 
<P>"It would be absurd and environmentally unacceptable to dump 6,700 tonnes of recyclable steel such as the Brent Spar into the sea," said Mr Bode after the meeting with Shell. "The UKOOA report supports common sense and environmental
responsibility --  bring the oil platforms back on land, clean them up and reuse the steel.  The dumping of such waste would not be acceptable for old cars or ships so why make an
exception for oil platforms?"
 
<P>The report also states that for the topside of structures (living and working quarters)  "...returning material to the shore for recycling and disposal would be an attractive
option. It removes potentially harmful material from the sea, eliminates a source of debris, and derives some benefit from the recycling of material and saving energy."(2)
 
<P>A second report, commissioned by Greenpeace, entitled "A Case Study Of Onshore Decommissioning Of North Sea Oil Structures," (3) states that over 95 percent of the Brent Spar platform could be recycled using existing technology.  This report was presented to Shell officials at the meeting today.
 
<P>"Reports commissioned by both the oil industry and
environmentalists have now stated that on-shore
decommissioning of oil installations is the best environmental option," said Mr Bode.  "Shell and other companies in the oil industry must now take this on board and draw up an action plan to return to land the dozens of North Sea oil
installations soon to be obsolete."
 
<P>Mr Bode added, "Greenpeace's Brent Spar campaign was about forcing industry to accept responsibility for the waste it creates and was launched with Shell's own information about the waste on board the Brent Spar. The subsequent error over oil samples - released only in the last few days of the
campaign - had absolutely no bearing on the strength of
Greenpeace's campaign, the validity of our arguments or the final success in preventing the dumping of the Brent Spar at sea."

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
<P><H4>NORTH SEA OILFIELDS MUST BE DISMANTLED ON LAND: GREENPEACE</H4>
 


<p>London--05 February 1996--In welcoming today's decision to dismantle Shell's North Sea gas
rig, the Leman BK, on land Greenpeace today called on the UK Government to rule out dumping
at sea for all oil installations and abandon the so-called "case by case" approach. 

<p>"The issue at stake here is whether we live in a throwaway society" says Greenpeace Campaign
Director Chris Rose.  "The public knows it is wrong to dump old cars in the village pond - and
it's wrong for the Government to let the oil industry treat the sea as its rubbish dump. The UK
Government must rule out dumping at sea and abandon the so-called case-by-case approach."

<p>Shell has confirmed it will dismantle the first of the deep North Sea installations -- the Brent Spar
-- on land.  In Norway, contracts have now been let for the dismantling of the North East Frigg
field -- entirely on land.  Countries surrounding the North East Atlantic last year banned the
dumping of oil installations at sea -- but the UK Government would not sign onto the ban. 

<p>"If, after his failed attempt to dump the Brent Spar, Mr Eggar now licences the sinking of
another platform, he will insult British as well as international public opinion.  His "case by case"
policy has been rejected by the British and European public and Greenpeace. The sea should be
for saving - not for dumping".
 
<p>Opinion Leader Research polled the British public in January (1) and received a clear message
from the public:  the sea should not be used as a dumping ground. 

<p>Greenpeace also pointed out that in December 1995 a report for the oil industry group UKOOA
(UK Offshore Operators Association) noted that the `best environmental option' for
decommissioned steel installations is to bring them ashore (2). A consultants report for
Greenpeace found that over 95% of the Brent Spar could be recycled (3).

<p>Contact: Cindy Baxter Greenpeace Communications ++44 171 833 0600

<p>(1):  The poll, carried out by Opinion Leader Research in January 1996 for Greenpeace and
released today, shows that 74% of British public aware of the Brent Spar controversy believes
that Greenpeace should continue its campaign to stop dumping of oil rigs. 57% believe that it
should not have been dumped in the Atlantic.

<P>Dear________,

<P>As the North Sea ministers prepare to meet in Denmark in early
June, I am writing to ask you to take strong and urgent action
to end the destruction of this diverse ecosystem on which we
depend.

<P>As you are preparing to attend this meeting, the oil company
Shell has permission to scuttle and dump a toxic oil
platform into the waters of the North Sea.  This is a sign
of the lack of concern and understanding of the need to protect
one of our most valuable resources -- the North Sea.

<P>I understand that the North Sea ministers will consider
eliminating toxic production at source and therefore toxic
discharges into the North Sea.  I urge you to move forward with
this proposal and to strongly support these efforts.

<P>All of the North Sea countries depend equally on clean air water
and sea of our environment.  The decision to protect the North
Sea environment rests with you.  Please work for its protection.


<P>Sincerely,
<P>

The largest uranium mines are in the United States, 
Canada, France, Australia, South Africa and Russia.
Many of the mining areas are on land occupied by 
indigenous people, for example the Aborigines of 
Australia.

<P>According to Aboriginal mythology, the Rainbow Serpent, 
asleep in the earth, guards over those elemental powers 
which lie outside of humankinds control.  Any attempt to 
seize these underworld elements will disturb the sleep of 
the serpent, provoking its vengeance: a terrible deluge 
of destruction and death.  

<P><B>The Rainbow Serpent has been wakened.  Men turned into 
shadows, cancer, women giving birth to jellyfish babies, 
leukaemia - since the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 
in August 1945, since the Bravo test in the Bikini 
Islands, and since the Chernobyl catastrophe in April of 
1986, we know that the Rainbow Serpent doesnt 
differentiate between uraniums military and peaceful 
uses. Death everywhere it touches.  But what we perhaps 
dont realise is that the destructive properties of 
uranium are unleashed the moment its mined from the 
ground.</B> &nbsp <I> Extracted from the World Uranium Hearing.</I>

<p>Uranium is the principal fuel most used in nuclear power plants.   Before uranium can be
made suitable for use in a nuclear reactor,  it must be mined from the earth and go through 
milling, conversion and enrichment processes. 

<p><FONT SIZE=+1 FACE="MS SERIF">M I N I N G</font>
 
<p>There are two main types of uranium mine.  
<p>1.<B> Open-Pit:</B> This is used to mine near-surface deposits
<p>2. <B>Underground: </B>This is used to mine deposits too deep for open pit mining
 
<p>The uranium is extracted either by leaching: when the uranium is dissolved in acid solution 
which is injected into the rock, and is then pumped to the surface. However, not all the acid 
can be collected and consequently leaks to the environment.  Or by traditional rock blasting 
methods. 
 
<p>Uranium can occur in association with other minerals such as gold and copper and is often 
mined as a by-product of these other materials.
 
<p>Uranium is a radioactive element.  It decays into a series of other radioactive elements, 
known as daughter products until it ends up as a stable form of lead.  As a  consequence 
of the various radioactive forms uranium goes through, the uranium ore in deposits 
contains many radioactive elements, some of which are particularly hazardous.  
 
<p>One of the major dangers of uranium is that it produces radium and radon gas  (a daughter 
product of radium).    When radon gas is inhaled it can cause lung cancer, while the radium 
can find its way into people, via food and water pathways, to cause other types of cancer. 
Uranium is also dangerous as a toxic heavy metal.
 
<p>The release of radon gas creates additional dangers, particularly in underground mining
operations. Good ventilation will protect the workers in underground mines,  but increases 
environmental contamination and the danger to surface workers.   However, if there is no 
ventilation the health risks to the underground workers are greatly increased. While open 
pit mining leads to direct releases of radon to the surrounding environment.

<p>Both underground and open pit mining involve the removal of massive quantities of the raw 
material from the earth.   In most uranium mines the percentage of uranium metal in the 
rock that is mined is very low in comparison to other mining industries - it is only between 
1-0.1 %.  

<p>Many of the mining areas are on land that was previously  occupied by indigenous 
peoples, for example the Aborogines in Australia.  By mining in remote regions on land 
occupied by  indigenous communities the nuclear industry attempts to avoid the true health 
and environmental costs of uranium mining.

<p><FONT SIZE=+1 FACE="MS SERIF">M I L L I N G</font>

<p>Generally this process increases the concentration of uranium from 1% to 75%.  The ore is 
ground down and then dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid.  The liquid is then allowed 
to settle in large open air ponds or lakes known as tailings dams.  The concentrated ore 
produced from this liquid is known as 'yellow-cake'.  
 
<p>Approximately 80% of the original radioactivity from the ore remains behind in the tailings 
dams where the once stable, and much safer, hard rock is now in a looser form and open 
to the wind and weather conditions, from which radon gas and radioactive dust can escape 
almost unhindered. This means that uranium mining  and milling are dangerous, not only 
for the workers, but also for people living in the surrounding area.   
 
<p>In addition to the radioactive hazards, "tailings" may contain chemically hazardous 
substances, including cyanide, arsenic. lead and mercury, which were previously held 
harmlessly in the rock, are now able to get into the environment by seepage, leaching and 
blown dust.    
 
<p><B>There have been massive accidental releases into the environment from tailings dams.  </B>
<p>One of the worst accidents was in the US, where a dam broke, releasing 100 million 
gallons of liquid mill waste and an estimated 1,100 tons of solid waste into the Rio Puerco 
river.  In Australia, a similar dam failure resulted in severe contamination of the East 
Finniss river, virtually wiping out plant and fish life in the river and on its banks.
 
<p>Nearly half the radon gas in the original uranium ore is liberated during mining and the 
other half during milling.  The concentrations of the gas and radioactive dust mean that the 
mill workers get radiation doses second only to the miners.   


<p>After mining and milling the uranium goes through a number of other processes where 
further contamination takes place and more waste is created.  Uranium has to be 
enriched before it can be used as a fuel for reactors.  This process can be use to 
increase the percentage of uranium-235 in the ore from 0.7% to between 2%-80%, 
depending on what type of reactor the uranium will be used in.  The enrichment process 
leads to further wastes, leaving behind large amounts of depleted uranium-235. 
 
<p><B>In terms of bulk, uranium mining leaves behind the largest amount of waste of the whole 
nuclear fuel cycle.</B>

<p>No full size 
reactors has yet been fully dismantled anywhere in the world.  Although some countries 
are planning to remove the entire structure, including the radioactive parts, leaving a flat 
empty space, others have suggested leaving the building where it stands, covering it in 
concrete or possibly burying it under a mound of earth.

<p>The cost of decommissioning nuclear power reactors is highly speculative. Cost 
estimates have been derived from generic studies, from scaling up the costs of 
decommissioning smaller research facilities.  The detail and sophistication employed in 
developing these estimates varies greatly and their lack of standardisation makes 
comparisons difficult.  Moreover, limited decommissioning experience - none with large 
reactors - makes it impossible to know if the estimates are on target, but it has been 
suggested that decommissioning costs could be up to 100% of the initial cost of 
construction.  

<p>During the next three decades, more than 350 nuclear reactors will be taken out of 
service.  Yet more than 40 years after the first nuclear power plant started producing 
electricity the nuclear industry still has no answers on how to safely and cost effectively 
dismantle a reactor.

<P>In some countries, the INF is chemically dissolved in "reprocessing plants", where 
plutonium and uranium are separated from the other radioactive waste products 
contained in the fuel.  While plutonium has been primarily used for the construction of 
nuclear weapons, numerous attempts have been made to use plutonium as a fuel in 
nuclear reactors.

<P>In addition to the separated plutonium and uranium, reprocessing generates a 
tremendous volume of nuclear waste.    Some of the nuclear waste is discharged 
directly into the air, ground and sea, creating direct short and long-term risks to the 
environment and public health.  At the same time, chemicals, equipment and other 
materials involved in reprocessing become contaminated by the radioactivity released 
from the reprocessed fuel.  In the end, reprocessing generates a volume of waste as 
much as 189 times greater than that contained in the original irradiated fuel.

<P>In September 1996, the text for a Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty (CTBT) was finally agreed at the United Nations in 
New York.  By mid-October, a total of 125 countries had 
signed the Treaty although only 1 (Fiji) had ratified it 
yet.  ALL the five official nuclear weapons states have 
signed.  Of the three so called threshold nuclear 
weapons states only Israel have signed, while India and 
Pakistan have not.  Of the 44 countries whose signature 
and ratification is needed before the treaty can enter 
into force, all but four (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) have signed.

<P>For the treaty to enter into force at the earliest 
possible opportunity (October 1998) all 44 countries on 
the entry-into-force list need to have ratified the 
treaty before the end of April 1998.

As part of the routine operation of every nuclear power station some waste materials are 
discharged directly into the environment.  Liquid waste is discharged with 'turbine cooling 
water' into the sea or a nearby river, and gaseous waste is released into the atmosphere.

<p>There are three categories of radioactive nuclear waste; High level waste (HLW), 
Intermediate level Waste (ILW) and Low level waste (LLW). 

<p>HLW consists mainly of irradiated fuel from the cores of nuclear reactors (although the 
nuclear industry do not consider this to be a waste), and the high level liquid waste 
produced during reprocessing.   The removal of plutonium by reprocessing results in a 
huge volume of this liquid radioactive waste.  Some of this deadly reprocessing waste, 
stored in large tanks, is mixed with a hot glass material and solidified, with the resulting 
glass logs also being classified as HLW.    While the glassification process may make it 
easier to transport and store the nuclear waste, it does in any way diminish the terrible 
danger posed to the public and the environment for millenia to come.     HLW is typically 
a thousand times more radioactive than ILW.

<p>ILW consists mainly of metal fuel 'cans' which originally contained the uranium fuel for 
nuclear power stations; reactor metalwork and chemical residues.  It has to be shielded 
to protect workers and the public for exposure during transport and disposal.  It is usually 
stored at the site of production.   ILW is typically a thousand times more radioactive that 
LLW.

<p>LLW can be defined as waste which does not require shielding during normal handling 
and transportation.  LLW consists mainly of items such as protective clothing and 
laboratory equipment which may have come into contact with radioactive material.
 
<p><hr><br>
<p><FONT SIZE=+1 FACE="Arial">DISPOSAL OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES</font>
 
<p>The highly radioactive nuclear fuel is removed from the reactor and at most sites this 
"spent" fuel is being stored temporarily in water-filled cooling pools.  As the cooling pools 
of many reactors are rapidly being filled, many reactors may soon have to shut down due 
to a lack of storage space for the deadly waste.    According to estimates by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the global amount of spent fuel was 125,000 
tonnes in 1992, and this will rise to 200,000 tonnes by the year 2000, and to 450,000 by 
the middle of the next century.  Yet, although a variety of disposal methods have been 
under discussion for decades -- including disposal in space -- there is still no solution for 
what to do with nuclear waste.

<p>Most of the current proposed 'solutions' for dealing with nuclear waste involve burying it 
under ground in a special store with strong enough protection to stop its radioactivity 
escaping.  The nuclear industry purports that after some form of processing, burial in the 
ground or the seabed, will be sufficiently safe.  This philosophy was born largely under 
the pressures of having to convince a worried public that the nuclear industry knows how 
to dispose of its wastes.    However, this is a false assurance.

<p>To pretend, as the nuclear industry often does, that a few experiments, test bores or 
geological surveys is all that is needed to deal with radioactive waste is simply 
disingenuous or scientifically illiterate or possibly both.   Adequate proof will take tens of 
thousands of years.

<p><B>The two main dangers inherent  in the burial of nuclear waste are air and water 
contamination.
</B>

<p><B>Air Contamination  </B>                                                                                                        
<p>Explosive or slow releases of gases from an underground disposal site is theoretically 
possible.  There is unfortunately no reliable way of estimating this danger - there are too 
many uncertainties concerning actual methods of burial and of possible chemical 
interactions within a real environment.
<p><B>Water Contamination</B>
<p>This is generally taken as the most likely mechanism of pollution in connection with waste 
disposal in rock. Underground waters may come in contact with radioactive elements that 
have leached out from the waste and contaminate the drinking water of local and distant 
communities.
<p>In addition to underground burial, various on-site storage schemes are being 
investigated.  Of primary interest is the storage of the spent fuel in large steel or concrete 
containers.   While on-site storage of spent fuel keeps the material at the point of its 
creation and reduces transportation risks, hundreds of communities around the world are 
threatened with de facto high level dumps on their doorsteps.  Plans also exist for 
consolidating containerised spent fuel at a few above-ground regional facilities, resulting 
in a huge number of road transports in containers not designed to withstand credible 
accidents. 
<p><B><I>The best solution for the future is that no more nuclear waste should be produced 
anywhere in the world.  </I></B>  
<p><hr><br>
<p><FONT SIZE=+1 FACE="Arial">DISMANTLING NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS</font>

<p>Large quantities of nuclear waste are also produced when a nuclear reactor is shutdown.  
This is because many of its component parts, including the fuel, have become 
radioactive.  They cannot simply be thrown away. The process of dealing with the power 
station at this point is called "decommissioning". Apart from removing the used fuel, 
however, there is not a clear agreement about what should happen next.  No full size 
reactors has yet been fully dismantled anywhere in the world.  Although some countries 
are planning to remove the entire structure, including the radioactive parts, leaving a flat 
empty space, others have suggested leaving the building where it stands, covering it in 
concrete or possibly burying it under a mound of earth.
<p>The cost of decommissioning nuclear power reactors is highly speculative. Cost 
estimates have been derived from generic studies, from scaling up the costs of 
decommissioning smaller research facilities.  The detail and sophistication employed in 
developing these estimates varies greatly and their lack of standardisation makes 
comparisons difficult.  Moreover, limited decommissioning experience - none with large 
reactors - makes it impossible to know if the estimates are on target, but it has been 
suggested that decommissioning costs could be up to 100% of the initial cost of 
construction.  
<p>During the next three decades, more than 350 nuclear reactors will be taken out of 
service.  Yet more than 40 years after the first nuclear power plant started producing 
electricity the nuclear industry still has no answers on how to safely and cost effectively 
dismantle a reactor.

<H2>1. INTRODUCTION</H2>

<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
The  Earth is bathed constantly in a spectrum of radiant energy from the  sun,
energy  which  is   essential to support all life.  A small proportion  of
this spectrum  is  composed of short-  wavelength,  high-energy  radiation
including ultraviolet  light.  Much of this is filtered out,   through
absorption  in  the atmosphere  or  reflection  from  clouds, and life on the
planet had    evolved to  avoid  or tolerate the small quantities which
naturally reach the Earth's surface.    
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
The ozone layer, located in the stratosphere,  is comprised of a blanket of
ozone molecules.   It is   the primary protective shield that life on Earth has
against the deadly ultraviolet rays of the sun.  During   the past sixty years
the ozone layer has been  severely  damaged  by millions of tonnes of ozone
depleting substances (ODSs),  most notably  chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs),
released  to  the   atmosphere  by humans.   Other ODSs  include
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), methyl   bromide (MeBr, halons  and other
industrial compounds which contain chlorine and bromine.   This chemical
warfare against the ozone layer continues to this day.    
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
ODSs are very stable and can survive in the atmosphere for many years or
decades.  They are   carried  up to the stratosphere by air currents where
eventually they disintegrate under UV   light.  Their disintegration releases
their chlorine or bromine molecules, which  creates a    chemical chain
reaction leading to the large scale destruction of ozone molecules. It is
estimated   that one chlorine molecule can destroy up to 100,000 ozone
molecules before it is neutralized.   
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
The ozone layer is a key element for a healthy, productive planet rather than a
scorched, barren   one.  A decrease in  the number of ozone molecules in the
stratosphere reduces the atmosphere's   ability to absorb UV-B radiation before
it reaches the surface of the Earth.  Changes of only a few   percent in the
thickness of the atmospheric ozone layer allow significant increases in the
amount of  UV-B radiation that filters through, and can have a profound impact
upon all life.
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
This added UV-B radiation  impacts on the stability of the global ecosystem;
on the genetic health   of all life; on the quality of the air and nature of
the weather and climate;  and on human health   and welfare. 
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Depletion of ozone through  man's activities  has already raised the amount of
UV-B reaching   large areas of  the Earth's surface to levels capable of
widespread damage to life.  There is  now   such a reservoir of ozone depleting
chemicals in the atmosphere that, even  if further    emissions ceased today,
current trends of ozone destruction are  set to  continue for several
decades. Unless emissions are stopped  immediately, ozone  depletion and damage
to the global   biosphere could become  very  severe and  even irreversible.
We  could already  be on the edge of a spiral towards the breakdown of the
biosphere as we know it.
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
We live on a radiantly beautiful planet. It is our responsibility, for the sake
of all future   generations of life, to ensure that we don't  leave behind us a
radiantly scorched Earth that can   no longer sustain life.

Each year the ozone layer is more damaged than in previous years, and the ozone
crisis is   rapidly escalating.      
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
In March 1995, for example, scientists reported an alarming thinning of the
ozone layer over the  Arctic,   Siberia and Scandinavia.  In some altitudes
ozone levels were 50 per cent below those  previously   observed.   On average,
a 20-30 per cent reduction in Arctic ozone levels was  reported. The   British
newspaper,  The Guardian,  headlined its front page story, "First Ozone Hole
Found Over Arctic".  
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Between November (1994)  and February (1995) there was an average ozone loss of
10-12 per cent,  over Europe, and 5-10  per cent  in North America.   Du
reached as high as 20 per cent over both continents.
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
On September 12, 1995, the World Meteorological Organization reported that
ozone depletions   over the Antarctic was "so far the most rapid depletion on
record" with severe ozone depletions   covering "about 10 million square
kilometers (about the size of Europe)". This was double the   size of the
Antarctic ozone hole during  the same period in 1993 and 1994, which until 1995
 had the "lowest ozone values ever observed by scientists".

  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
The ozone layer's most  vulnerable period  is expected around 1998-2000 when
the accumulated atmospheric  chlorine/bromine  levels from human made chemicals
will be at their   peak. At that time ozone  depletions are expected to be the
most severe and UV-B radiation at the highest.  This expectation may or may not
be realized,  and largely depends on the adequacy of the controls on the
production of ODSs under the terms of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments
and whether or not all the countries adhere to the full regime of those
controls.  Furthermore, it depends on the accuracy of scientific projections,
which until now have consistently underestimated  expected levels of ozone
depletion. There is certainly room for some more nasty surprises. 
</P>
</TD>
</TR>


<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP >
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
The thinning of the ozone layer allows more ultraviolet-B radiation to reach
the surface of the   earth. Higher levels of UV-B radiation dramatically
increase the risk of severe damage to    human   health  (e.g. eye diseases,
skin cancer, immune system suppression) and also endanger   crops, forests,
plants, marine life and wildlife.  
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Although there are natural variations in UV-B levels reaching the earth, and
there is some   conflicting data regarding UV-B measurements, several studies
suggest that the global increase   in UV-B incidence may be quite severe.  For
example, a 35 per cent increase was recorded between   1977/78 and 1986 at a
station in  Maryland,  USA,  a 35 per cent  increase in winter levels between
1989 and  1993  in Toronto  and an estimated 30 per cent increase in Tokyo over
the period from    1980  to 1991.  Measurements in Antarctica in 1993, a year
of particularly severe ozone   depletion, were over 50 per cent higher than in
1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Though we are entering this most vulnerable period of heightened UV-B
bombardment exploding   upon the global ecosystem,  scientific research into
the impact of increased UV-B radiation upon   the biosphere is tragically
underfunded.  It is almost as if we don't really want to know, or we   don't
really care about what the future may bring.
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
The UNEP affiliated Scientific Committee On Problems of the Environment
(SCOPE) forewords  its  1993   report "Effects of Increased Ultraviolet
Radiation on Global Ecosystems" with the following   forthright admonition:
"The fact that the number of experts on the effects of increased UV-B   impacts
on living systems due to ozone depletion continues to be rather small,
illustrates that   for the past 20 years, the governments of the world seemed
not to take seriously this potential   threat to the biosphere. Candidly
stated, research funding for "effects" research has been paltry  at best."
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
If doctors told us that a loved one has a potentially fatal disease, we would
most likely want to   learn as much as there is to know about the disease and
possible cures. Shouldn't we apply the   same resolve to informing ourselves
about the dangers we have brought upon Earth, so that we   could do whatever is
in our power to minimize the damage?  Shouldn't learning about the future   of
life,  under a regime of increased UV-B radiation,  be of higher priority than,
for example,   the development of yet another intercontinental ballistic
missile system, or a new generation of   nuclear weapons? And yet the funds
committed to UV-B research are minuscule in comparison   to funds spent on
weapons of mass destruction.

Concern over the impacts of increased ultraviolet radiation exposure on human
health has   caused governments around the world to established daily warning
programs.  For example, in   Australia,  Austria, Canada, Germany, Great
Britain, New Zealand, Netherlands,  and the United States,   forecasts for the
level of solar ultraviolet radiation and sunburn times are disseminated through
newspaper, radio and television messages. The Dutch authorities conduct an
annual skin cancer   awareness campaign, including the provision of free
sun-screen to people working outdoors.     
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Canada's UV Index is a forecast of the time required for fair, unprotected skin
to burn under the   highest sun based on the thickness of the ozone layer above
and the time of year. It is provided to   the news media daily. In many
newspapers, it is front page information. The commercial   television weather
service, The Weather Network, provides a feature on the Index and actual UV
measurements twice hourly during most of the year.     
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Messages such as Australia's "Slip, Slap, Slop" campaign urge citizens to slip
on a shirt, slap on   a hat and slop on sunscreen for protection.  Public
information campaigns by governments   and public health organizations provide
added information on the hazards of sun exposure.    
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Alterations of school programs and other outdoor activities are aimed at
reducing sun exposure   for children. Teams of doctors specializing in skin
cancers are roaming public beaches to educate sunbathers as to the dangers of
excessive sun. General advice is for people to avoid   exposure to direct
sunlight between 11 AM and 4 PM.     

</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
While programs to educate and alert the public are absolutely necessary, they
are also at   additional costs to public treasuries and in most countries draw
upon  already scarce resources.   Some countries, especially developing
nations, simply don't have the resources to protect the   public through high
profile public information campaigns.  While everyone's life will, one way   or
another, be negatively affected by the impacts of increased UV-B radiation,
poorer countries   will suffer to an even greater extent.

<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Blindness from cataracts is the major preventable cause of blindness in the
world today. Chronic UV-B   exposure has been shown to be a factor in this eye
disease. Latest findings indicate that each 1 per cent   decrease in ozone
levels results in 0.6 per cent to 0.8 per cent increase in eye cataracts, or
annually   approximately 100,000 to 150,000 additional cases of
cataract-induced blindness worldwide.    
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
In tropical areas where UV-B radiation is highest, cataracts are striking at a
younger age than   ever before.  Young  children are particularly sensitive
because  of  the less-developed   pigmentation of the eye.     
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
UV-B causes other eye injuries including photokeratitis also known as 'sun
blindness' or 'snow   blindness', damage to the retina, and intraocular
melanoma tumors.  Predictions suggest a   substantial future increase in eye
cancer rate in lower latitudes.     
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Exposure  of  the lens and retina to UV-radiation may be enhanced  by  wearing
sunglasses which   absorb UV  poorly; as the iris opens wider to  compensate
for reduced visible light, so the   penetration of UV also increases.

<H3>5.2 Our Endangered Skin</H3>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
   We continue to live under the misguided belief that a
tanned body is a healthy body. As a result,   incidents of malignant and
non-malignant skin cancers  are growing world-wide at epidemic   proportions.
The rate is expected to increase dramatically in the future as ozone depletion
permits more UV-B rays to reach the ground. There is compelling evidence that
solar ultraviolet   radiation is a complete carcinogen, acting on all major
stages of cancer: its initiation, its  promotion and its progression. Children
are particularly at risk. A severe sun burn in childhood   dramatically
increases an individual's chances of developing some form of skin cancer later
in   life.
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Even  at  current UV-B exposures, certain forms of skin cancer affect 1  in  5
people in the   United States and as many as 2 in 3 people in Australia.   Such
cancers are becoming increasingly common   in younger people.  
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Between 1979 and 1993, the incidence of non-melanoma, the most common form of
skin   cancer,  is estimated to have risen an average of 10 per cent in the
Northern Hemisphere, between the   latitudes 55 degrees N and 35 degrees N.
Even bigger increases are believed to have occurred in the Southern
Hemisphere. UNEP forecasts that a sustained 1  per cent decrease in
stratospheric ozone will result in a   2 per cent  increase of this type of
skin cancer. On the basis of an estimated 10 per cent reduction in ozone, a  25
per cent  increase  in  non-melanoma  skin cancer  rates  has  been  predicted
for temperate  latitudes by 2050. 
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Less common, but much more dangerous, are malignant melanomas which effect the
pigment  cells  in  the skin and which can spread rapidly  to  the  blood  and
lymphatic  system.    These have become increasingly frequent  throughout  the
world  over the last 40 years and, although detection and recovery rates  have
improved,  they  already    represent the most common  cause  of
cancer-related deaths in Australian adults under 45 years of age. Between the
periods 1978-82 and  1983-87, for example,  melanoma incidence  increased  in
most  European  and  Scandinavian  countries,  with increases  from around 9
per cent in the   Netherlands too as much as 56 per cent  in  Scotland.  
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Mortality  rates have also increased rapidly, by up to 4 times in both  Canada
and in the Netherlands between 1950 and 1990. In 1991 the US Environmental
Protection   Agency projected that over the next fifty years 12 million
Americans will contract skin cancer   and 200,000 will die from malignant
melanoma.  In 1994, UNEP once again confirmed that   increases in UV-B
radiation are likely to increase "the incidence and morbidity from skin
cancer" and  that "epidemiological data indicate that the risk of melanoma
increases with   sunlight exposure, especially during childhood."

The burning goes deeper, however than sunburn, skin cancers and cataracts. UV-B
radiation also   has the ability to suppress the human immune system leaving
the body vulnerable to many   diseases caused by bacteria and viruses entering
through or affecting the skin. UV-B may even   play a role in the course of
non-skin cancers through its suppression of the immune system   which weakens
the body's defense against the early stages of tumor formation. 
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
While darker skinned individuals are less likely to contract a skin cancer from
sun exposure,   dark skin is not a protection against immune suppression by
UV-B. Dark skin requires a greater   dosage of UV-B than white skin to initiate
immune suppression. However, the required dosage for   suppression in darker
skins is easily obtained by occupational and recreational exposure to the   sun.

</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Viruses responsible for diseases such as herpes, chicken pox, the human
immunodeficiency   virus HIV- 1 and a variety of papilloma viruses are directly
activated or reactivated by   exposure to UV-B radiation.
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Increased exposure to UV-B radiation in animals and humans has been linked to
elevated risk   from the following diseases: those caused by the herpes
viruses, leishmaniasis, malaria, forms   of tuberculosis and leprosy, lupus
erthematodes, contact dermatitis and toxic photo dermatitis,   and a number of
bacterial and fungal infections including E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus. 
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Exposure may also affect vaccinations against diseases. Impairment of the immune
 system by  UV-B may prevent the desired response to the vaccine.     
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
UV-B readily damages DNA. Thus, it is not unrealistic to hypothesize that UV-B
radiation will play   an additional role in the mutation of existing disease
bacteria and viruses and may produce   totally new strains of pathogens.     
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Humanity is just waking up to the fact that in coming years we shall be facing
an onslaught of   new and resurgent diseases, such as malaria, cholera and
dengue fever as a result of global   warming and climate change.  UV-B induced
immunosuppression will make humans that much   more vulnerable under very
precarious circumstances.      
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
It is not possible to estimate in monetary terms how much UV-B induced health
problems are   already costing society. Nevertheless, based on realistic
scenarios regarding the present and   future impacts of increased UV-B  upon
human health, it is safe to predict that those costs will   continue to grow at
a phenomenal rate.

of the quality of the air, water and soils upon which we are dependent;
further contribution to the greenhouse effect, and resultant climate change;
and deterioration of plastics and other materials widely used by society.

In addition to the direct effects of UV-B radiation on human health, increases
in UV-B radiation   will have important indirect impacts on human health
through alterations of the food supply.     
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Many agricultural crops including varieties of important food staples such as
rice have been   shown to be adversely affected by increases in UV-B radiation.
Such impacts may be manifest as   losses in yield, higher susceptibility to
damage from temperature, drought and disease, changes   in reproductive cycles,
and alterations of nutritional composition.     
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
With the human food supply already strained due to demands of an ever
increasing population,   changes in weather and climate and loss of soil
fertility, even small reductions resulting from   UV-B damage to the food
supply may be disastrous to many people, especially the poor and indigenous
people. Reduction in crop yield or livestock viability could present severe
problems for  food supply,   particularly in areas relying on subsistence
agriculture  or in economies in which food supply   is already under strain.
  
</P>
<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Indigenous populations are especially at risk from increases in UV-B radiation
since they   generally rely on local plants and animals as their food source.
Once local food supplies are compromised, they don't have the commercial
infrastructures in place to supplement their diet with imported food.
Furthermore, lack of nearby   medical care and facilities may magnify the
direct health effects of increases in UV-B radiation.     
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Fisheries are also in peril from increases in UV-B radiation through disruption
of the aquatic   food chain or the direct killing of eggs and larvae of
commercially valuable species.  It is   estimated that 16 per cent  ozone
depletion could result in 5 per cent  loss in phytoplankton (the basis of all
food in the seas), which would lead to a loss of about 7 million tons of fish
per year - about 7 per cent   of fishery yield.  Under the Antarctic ozone hole
productivity from phytoplankton was down by   6-12 per cent.  UV-B radiation
also damages the developmental stages of fish, most notably anchovy,   where
near 100 per cent mortality could occur with 16 per cent ozone depletion.

This soup, known as photochemical smog,  has reached unhealthy proportions in
cities around   the world: Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, New York, Mexico City,

Photochemical contains chemical compounds hazardous to human health, causing

Air pollutants produced by UV-B radiation, acting in concert with the direct
effects of UV-B on   life, alter the flow of elements through the atmosphere,
the hydrosphere, the lithosphere and   the biosphere. Most important of these
are the flows of carbon, sulphur and nitrogen. Changes in   these affect global
and local biogeochemical cycles and atmospheric processes such as rainfall
and cloud formation.
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
For example, changes in the flow of sulphur and nitrogen may reduce the
availability of   nutrients important to plants. Without these nutrients,
plants' ability to produce biomass which   stores carbon is reduced. This
carbon comes from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.   
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
A10 per cent  decrease in phytoplankton productivity, for example,  will
prevent 5 gigatonnes of   carbon dioxide from being absorbed from the atmosphere
; this will increase the greenhouse   effect further.    
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Decreasing the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere and stored in the
biosphere will   further increase the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere
already rising rapidly due to the   burning of fossil fuels. This will cause a
rise in atmospheric temperature, the so-called   "greenhouse effect."

As US Vice President Al Gore explains  the relationship between ozone
depletion, increased UV-B radiation and global warming  in his book, Earth In
Balance: "...the two best-known crises, global warming and stratospheric ozone
depletion, reinforce each other in a complex positive feedback loop.  Global
warming increases the amount of water vapor throughout the atmosphere and traps
infrared heat in the lower part of the sky which would otherwise radiate back
out to space, passing through the atmosphere. As a result, the stratosphere
actually cools as the lower atmosphere warms. A cooler stratosphere with more
water vapor means more ice crystals in the ozone layer, especially in the polar
regions, where chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) mingle with the ozone in the presence
of the ice, thus depleting the ozone at a faster rate. The thinner the ozone
layer, the more the ultraviolet radiation strikes the surface of the earth and
all organisms living there. The ultraviolet radiation strikes vegetation that
normally absorbs vast quantities of CO2 through photosynthesis and seems to
seriously disrupt its ability to do so. As the vegetation absorbs less CO2,
more of it accumulates in the atmosphere, causing still more global warming -
and still more stratospheric cooling. The cycle is reinforced and magnified. It
feeds upon itself."
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Thus, elevated UV-B radiation will have indirect influences on the weather. If
these impacts   continue over the long term, change in global and local climate
will occur. Increasing global or   regional temperatures will further impact
the biosphere which further alters the carbon cycle.   And so the cycle
continues.

 Enhanced  UV-B  also has the potential to
impact on other  aspects  of  modern human  life.    Exposure to UV-radiation
is the primary cause of degradation  of non-metallic  material   outdoors;
rubbers (natural and synthetic) and  plastics are  particularly  vulnerable.
Effects   include  discoloration,  cracking  and overall  weakening  of
material. Increases in incident UV-  B  will,  therefore, have  consequences
for the building industry, the transport manufacturing    and maintenance
industries and a wide range of other materials sectors.    The unaccounted

UV-radiation  has long been known to be damaging to life; indeed this  quality
is  being  employed    increasingly for the disinfection of water  and  for
the mutation  of microorganisms for   laboratory experiments .  UV-B affects
plants and  animals  by  modifying both their   biological  and  chemical
environment. Damage may occur in a number of ways, including the   direct
destruction of  the genetic  material  DNA, deactivation of enzymes, disruption
of    membranes  and other cell structures and the generation of highly
reactive chemical agents known as  "free radicals".

Although biological repair mechanisms  exist,  mutations  may  remain  as
errors  in the repair   processes.   In  addition,  the  repair  mechanisms
themselves may be deactivated by high UV   doses.  The interaction of  all
these  processes can lead to a variety of adverse effects on  plants    and
animals.   Many  effects are sub-lethal, may interact with other  factors  and
may,   therefore, be very difficult to attribute to UV-enhancement specifically.

<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Effects  on  plants in the sea, in freshwater and on land are  of  fundamental
importance because   of their position at the base of all other food chains.
By nature,  plants  have  evolved to   maximize the surface  area  they  expose
to sunlight,  but  consequently their exposure to   damaging UV-radiation  is
also increased.  Elevated UV exposure can cause temporary or  irreversible
damage to photosynthetic  apparatus (including the bleaching of the pigments
which  trap the sun's energy), to processes of cell division and growth
regulation, and to  the    composition and replication of genetic material.
Consequences include  a reduction in growth   yield, changes in levels and

Despite the every increasing list of negative effects of UV-B radiation, we
continue to release   ozone-depleting chemicals into the atmosphere. Despite
the availability of safer alternatives,   we continue to promote technologies
which are only slightly safer than the ones they replace.   Despite the
agreements under the Montreal Protocol, the manufacture and release of ozone-
depleting substances continues. Despite the wisdom of the global scientific
community showing   us the need for quick action, we drag our feet.   
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Scientific research has only begun to scratch the surface on the impacts of
UV-B radiation, but   what is known is cause for concern. We cannot afford to
sit and wait for the damage to reach a   scale that forces us to act; by then
it will be too late. We must wholeheartedly embrace the   Precautionary
Principle which states that we must not wait for scientific certainty before
acting when there is evidence of environmental damage.   
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
The time to act is now. We can no longer afford to wait for further
confirmation that the signs   we have already seen are definitely causing the
death of ecosystems and communities. The damage   is out there and growing
every day.   
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
We must take heed to the impacts of ozone depletion and UV-B radiation on
health, food supply, air  quality and weather and climate and push for more
rapid action on the elimination of ozone-  depleting substances. We must put an
immediate end to the production and use of all ozone-  depleting substances. We
must find safe but effective methods of destroying the stock-pile of   these
compounds before they are accidentally released into the atmosphere.  
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Even with an immediate and complete end to production and release of
ozone-depleting   substances to the environment, we are left with at least a
century of a below normal ozone layer   and enhanced levels of UV-B radiation.  

</P>
<P>

How deep will the burning go? It is already deep. Deep into the seas and the
forests, deep into   our skin and our welfare. How much deeper? That depends on
us. We must think long term and  act now.

Chemical companies have dictated the progress of the Montreal Protocol and measures
to protect the ozone layer.  In doing so, they have been able to switch from making
money from CFCs to making money from CFC replacements. For these companies, the
ozone hole has been a gold mine.  The ozone crisis has meant a change to new
products selling at premium prices.  It has meant investments in new plants and
revitalised marketing activity.  It has injected commercial life into a "mature" low profit
bulk chemicals market.  The change, as long as it was slow enough, was good for
business.

</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
    
 
In this report, we set out which corporations have profited from ozone destruction since
the ozone hole was discovered and which nations own the ozone hole.  This is a period
over which everyone involved has taken an extraordinary gamble with a natural system
essential for life on earth.

</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
   

If each atom of ozone destroying chlorine and bromine was marked with the logo of the
company that profited from its production, more than half the sky would be covered with
the logos of DuPont, Elf-Atochem, ICI, Great Lakes Chemical, Dead Sea Bromide,
Daikin and Solvay.   In our view, it is time the chemical companies are made to pay a
share of the cost of repairing ozone damage.

</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  
 
More resources are needed to enable the most rapid possible phase out of ozone
depleting chemicals.  The right places to look for new money are the nations and
corporations that have profited from producing ozone depleting gases over the last ten
years.

</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
    

This report is filled with new data which must inform the international debate over
causes and solutions to ozone depletion.  Among thousands of estimates the reader will
find: </P>
 <UL>
 <P>
     <DT><LI TYPE=DISC>The total value of sales of ozone depleting substances since 1986 has exceeded
     $US 30.6 billion.

For each of these issues, global commitments have been watered down by implicit
judgements about the costs of taking action.  But how are these judgements being
made?  Certainly not by evaluating the benefits of reducing risks of catastrophic ozone
loss.  This casual acceptance that current, or even reduced, levels of expenditure and
commitments are somehow appropriate represents profound complacency. 
Governments and corporations are setting a price on the ozone layer.  Our sky and our
health are for sale -- cheap.

<H1>Introduction: Who Owns the Ozone Hole?</H1>

In 1931, DuPont opened the first CFC factory in Deepwater, New Jersey.   Since then
over 20 million tonnes of CFCs have been released to the atmosphere. The business of
producing and selling chlorofluorocarbons attracted the world's largest chemical
companies and enriched their shareholders and directors.   Since 1974, it has been
understood that the ozone layer has been under assault from CFCs and other ozone
depleting substances (ODS) released into the atmosphere.  However, over twenty years
later, the accumulation of these chemicals in the stratosphere has reached the highest
levels ever and continues to rise.

</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  

 
But having identified the problem, several questions arise. If action needs to be taken to
protect the ozone layer, who should take it?  If there are costs to bear, who should pay?
Where do the obligations of industrialised countries end, and the responsibilities of
developing countries begin?  If chemical companies have made money from CFCs,
should they take some of the costs?

</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  

 
These questions are rarely asked at meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol,
and never honestly answered. Greenpeace believes that those responsible for
damaging the ozone layer should be held responsible for fixing it.  This means that if
there are costs to bear, then those who damaged the ozone layer must pay.

<H3>Commercial Confidentiality</H3>

</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  

 
Corporate data on the production of ozone depleting substances remains incomplete
and secretive. Many companies claimed commercial confidentiality when asked for their
historical CFC production.  Given that CFC production has almost stopped in some of
these companies, the refusal to disclose data on commercial grounds is an outrageous
denial of the public's right to know what damage corporations do to the environment.
The real fear of those companies that refuse to disclose data is not of commercial rivals,
but of being held publicly accountable for their share of the damage to the ozone layer.

Estimating Responsibility</H3>

</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  

 
Consultants working for Greenpeace have estimated the production of ozone depleting
substances by nations and by corporations between the years 1986 and 1995. This ten
year period follows the shocking discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica in 1985. 
The ozone hole provided clear evidence that dramatic precautionary action was both
justified and urgent.  However, over this period, over 17 million tonnes of a mixture of
ozone destroying gases have been produced - and production continues.  These gases
have either reached the stratosphere already or will reach it in the coming decades.

The Responsibility of Corporations</H3>

Figure 1 shows the share of ozone depleting substances from 1986-95 produced by
over 40 identified companies.  If these corporations are held accountable for the ozone
hole, their territorial share of the area of peak depletion in the ozone hole (enclosed by
the 220 Dobson Unit contour) is shown in the table.

</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  

 
This table also shows the estimated sales value (in thousands of U.S. dollars) of ODS
made by each company over the 10 years since the ozone hole was discovered.  The
global chemical industry has made estimated sales valued at over US $3,000,000,000
per year.

All nations have some responsibility for ozone depletion, but some have much greater
responsibility than others.   If each atom of ozone destroying chlorine or bromine in the
stratosphere was marked with a national flag - over half the sky would be dominated by
the Stars and Stripes, the Red Sun and the Union Jack.   The United States alone is
responsible for over seven million square kilometres of the Antarctic ozone hole - an
area more than two thirds the size of the United States itself.

The ozone layer is more damaged and vulnerable than ever.  The annual spring
Antarctic ozone "hole" now reaches an area of 23,000,000 square kilometres and
continues to increase in area, depth and longevity.  The first signs of an ozone hole are
appearing over the less susceptible Arctic. Ozone depletion has reached significant
levels over populated mid-latitudes and threatens an insidious rise in skin cancers, crop
damage, and ecological harm due to additional ultra-violet radiation.

 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Prior to the opening of the ozone hole, scientists expected ozone depletion to increase
slowly and gradually with rising concentrations of ODS.  This thinking was utterly
overturned by the discovery of unpredicted and dramatic loss of ozone over Antarctica. 
The ozone hole formed because of unforeseen reactions on polar stratospheric clouds;
the Mount Pinatubo volcano resulted in new ozone destroying reactions forming on
sulphate aerosols injected into the stratosphere.  Other mechanisms are poorly
understood - such as the interaction of ozone depletion with tropospheric climate
change - or remain the subject of speculation.  There may be mechanisms that remain
unknown at present, only to be discovered in catastrophic circumstances in the next
century.    
 </P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
The problem is one of risk.  We have only one Earth, one ozone layer, to experiment
with. The behaviour of the ozone layer has shown that it is not possible to make
comforting but simplistic relationships between ODS concentrations and ozone
depletion, and the resulting excess global exposure to harmful ultra-violet radiation.  The
discovery of the ozone hole in 1985 showed us all that change in our poorly understood
atmosphere can be non-linear, and catastrophic.
  </P>

<H3>The required response - urgent action to control ozone depleters</H3>

<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
The only credible solution is to reduce the risk as rapidly as possible.  The only plausible
way to do this is to eliminate emissions of  ozone destroying gases world wide in the
minimum technically possible time.  It is necessary to push the implementation of viable
alternative technologies to the limits of human ingenuity and resources.  The threat to
the ozone layer should be seen as an issue of national and global security, not simply a
discretionary environmental expenditure.
  </P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Greenpeace believes that a full and complete ban on all ozone depleting substances is
possible both technically and economically today.  The only barriers to this change are
political.
</P>
<H3>The actual response - arguments about money</H3>

<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
The Parties to the Montreal Protocol have begun to indulge in cost-benefit analysis.
Effectively they are trying to put a price on the ozone layer by refusing to bear the
supposed costs of the most rapid phase out schedules.   The progress on all key issues
facing the Parties is now dominated by discussions of cost.
  </P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
There are five main issues facing the Parties at the Vienna meeting of the Montreal
Protocol.  In each case, an implicit or explicit trade off is made between costs and the
ozone layer.  Yet there is absolutely no basis on which the risks of continued ODS
emissions can be quantified - and no attempt is made to do this.  Who is to say that
doubling annual funds supplied to developing countries is too much to spend on phasing
out CFCs?  Who is to say the expense of scrapping HCFC using equipment is not
justified by the need to protect the ozone layer?
  </P>
<P> 
The five main issues facing the Parties are described in the following sections:
</P>
<H4><I>1)  The phase out of ODS in developing countries</I></H4>

<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
This is closely linked to the funding provided by the industrialised world through the
Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol.  Phase out of CFCs by 2006 in developing
countries has been ruled out on economic grounds.  This means that Parties to the
Protocol are, at best, going to maintain the current status quo of CFC phaseout in 2010
-- or possibly even weaken international commitment to phasing out CFCs.  At the 1995
Geneva Open Ended Working Group  of the Montreal Protocol, the report of the sub-
group on options for Article 5 (developing) countries considered costs of phasing out
CFCs in developing countries and concluded:
 </P>
 <P>
"... the average annual disbursements of the 2006 scenario, for example, is almost twice
the present disbursements and was unlikely to be feasible. ... The three remaining
scenarios of 2006 with a tail, 2010, and  2010 with a tail are manageable from a
resource point of view " (22 August 1995).

   </P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
In this case a judgement has been made that the advantage of phasing out CFCs in
developing countries by 2006, rather than 2010, does not justify a doubling of annual
contributions to the multilateral fund.  Current annual total contributions are $170 million,
from the 46 industrialised nations that contribute to the fund.  By comparison, these
countries produced and sold an estimated $28.5 billion worth of ozone depleting
substances over the past ten years.
 </P>
<H4><I>2)  The phase out of ODS in Russia and other "economies in transition"</I></H4>
   </P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Russia entered the Montreal Protocol as a developed country and has taken on
commitments that it claims its economy can no longer support. At the 1995 Geneva
Open Ended Working Group meeting, a joint statement was made by Russia and
several Eastern European countries: 
 </P>
 <P>
     "In the light of the economic crisis in the countries with economies in transition, there
is no possibility of full compliance with the Montreal Protocol..."
   </P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
These countries have requested a relaxation of the time limit for phasing out CFCs from
1996 until 2000.  These countries currently have arrears to the Multilateral Fund of over
$50 million.  
 </P>
<H4><I>3)  The phase out of HCFCs in the industrialised world</I></H4>

<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
HCFCs are ozone depleting chemicals.  It is claimed that the investment in these
mistaken alternatives to CFCs should be protected, even though there are perfectly
adequate alternatives to HCFCs available. Some European countries plan to phase out
their use of HCFCs within the next five years.  Others claim that they are needed for
more than thirty.  The justification for continuing to use these ozone depleting chemicals
is purely profit led.  The UN Environment Programme Technical and Economic
Assessment panel (TEAP) says:
 </P>
 <P>
     "It is technically feasible but possibly not economically feasible to completely phase
out by 2015 because HCFC will still be required to service HCFC-based refrigeration
and air conditioning equipment with a useful lifetime beyond 2015".
 </P>



<H4><I>4)  The phase out of methyl bromide</I></H4>
   </P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Global production of the pesticide, methyl bromide, is the growing more rapidly than any
other ODS.  Methyl bromide is one of the most potent ozone depleters - particularly in
the short term.  As this inventory reveals, over the next twenty years, methyl bromide
produced over the past decade will cause as much depletion as halons.  Since new
methyl bromide production and consumption continues in industrial countries (unlike
halons, which have been banned), this chemical group is the second ranked ozone
destroyer, after CFCs, for the medium term.
  </P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Some countries already manage without methyl bromide altogether (for example, it has
been phased out in the Netherlands), but other countries claim their agriculture can not
function without it.  A detailed three year study conducted by United Nations
Environment Programme has already identified technically feasible alternatives, either
currently available or at an advanced state of development for over 90% of methyl
bromide's uses.  Clearly there are no scientific or technical reasons not to ban this
chemical.  It is clear from the following statement that some form of economic
calculation will guide the commitments that the European Community will accept: 
 </P>
 <P>
     "... noting the significant ozone depleting potential of methyl bromide, the European
Community recognises the ultimate objective of the elimination of its emissions, on the
basis of developments in scientific knowledge and taking into account technical and
economic conditions."
</P>
<H4><I>5) New commitments by developing countries to control HCFCs and Methyl Bromide</I></H4>

<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
There are, at present, no commitments relating to the consumption of HCFCs or methyl
bromide in developing countries.  Developing countries will require funding if they are to
take on further commitments.   According to the meeting report of the 1995 Geneva
Open Ended Working Group, China and the Group of 77 believe that:
 </P>
 <P>
     "Any further consideration of new commitments, such as those related to methyl
bromide, HCFCs or any new phase out scenario, would require a corresponding action
regarding provision of funding."
  </P>
<H3>What price the ozone layer?</H3>

<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
When considering the implicit valuation of the ozone layer, it may be worth
contemplating the following expenditures:

The crucial decisions to be made in the Montreal Protocol may require costs regarded
as "not feasible" by the Parties or their advisory committees.  However,  according to
the Polluter Pays Principle, these costs can and should be recovered from those who
are responsible for the ozone destruction.  The polluters did not pay for the destruction
caused by CFCs at the time they were sold, but there is every reason to ensure that
future commitments fall on those who have been historically responsible for the
problem.

Over the next twenty years, the ozone layer will face the greatest ever onslaught of
ozone destroying chlorine and bromine.

 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
This is a period of very great risk in which every conceivable effort must be made to
reduce the emissions of ozone destroying gases.  The history of ozone depletion has
been one of nasty surprises and unforeseen mechanisms of ozone destruction, and this
will undoubtedly continue.  
   </P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
CFCs, HCFCs and methyl bromide are not banned chemicals. While many of the
companies listed in this report will continue to profit from ozone destruction for years to
come, action to control continuing emissions of ozone depleting chemicals have
become hindered by arguments about money.

<B><I>WHOSE CHLORINE...</I></B> is the world's most comprehensive catalog of the names and
locations of producers of ozone depleting substances.   It estimates the amount of
ozone destroyers made by each producer over the past ten years.  And, it calculates the
total potential for ozone layer destruction caused by this production, using standard
Montreal Protocol "ozone depletion potential" (ODP) ratings and semi-empirical time-
weighted ozone depletion potentials.
</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
This inventory and its estimates are based upon a wide array of international and
national government records, reports by news media, industry and non-governmental
organizations, and company correspondence.   All figures contained in this report,
unless otherwise noted, should be considered to be estimates, not precise production
numbers.
</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Certain sources -- such as annual country reports submitted to the Montreal Protocol
Secretariat, chemical and country-specific reports produced by Montreal Protocol and
Multilateral Fund committees, and European Union annual reports  -- provided hard
data about production in specific countries, and at specific plants, for certain years.  
Industrial associations such as the Alternative Fluorocarbons Environmental
Acceptability Study, the European Council of Chemical Manufacturers Federation
(CEFIC) and the Halogenated Solvents Industry Association have reported cumulative
annual levels of production worldwide by their members.  Media reports and company
press releases provided information about plant openings, capacities and closures.
</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
These global, national, and company-specific information sources thus provided the
framework for each estimate. After the author compiled preliminary estimates,
Greenpeace campaigners around the world contacted most of the producing companies
and governments to confirm, deny or refine these numbers.  
</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Some companies and governments did provide precise cumulative 1986-1995
production data.  Many government officials provided cumulative production data, but
usually did not distinguish individual companies' production numbers.  These responses
refined our preliminary estimates.
</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Others corporations responded to correct a specific error, but refused to confirm or deny
the other information, claiming that such data is confidential and proprietary.  Some
replied to say that they could not reply in the time given, but indicated that they might do
so in the future.   And others did not respond at all to our faxes and phone calls. 
</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Where companies and governments did respond with precise information, the estimates
were revised accordingly.  In some cases, industry and government sources both
supplied data which did not match; in these cases, industry's numbers are used in this
report.
</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
Since this is the world's first comprehensive attempt to catalog ozone destruction
production, with varying degrees of cooperation provided by the producing companies
and governments, the estimates in this report should be considered preliminary. 
Further information from producing companies and governments will help refine future
editions of this inventory.
</P>

<H3>Scope:</H3>

<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
This inventory does not cover certain ozone depleting substances, one of which --
carbon tetrachloride -- is part of the Montreal Protocol.  Other sources of ozone
depletion not covered by the Protocol, nor by this Inventory, include: chlorine released
by rockets in the stratosphere, nitrogen oxides, and bromine released by the burning of
biomass.  These chemicals are not included due to limitations in data availability on the 
production and the ozone depleting potential of these chemicals.
</P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
We focus on production figures (rather than consumption) because it is the producer
nations and the producers themselves that have been the slowest to accept the need to
change.  The economies of producer nations and the shareholders and directors of
producer companies have been enriched by the production of CFCs and other ozone
depleters.
</P>
<H3>Ozone Depletion Potential Values:</H3>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
There are (at least) two ways of looking at the effects of ozone depleting  gases:
 </P>
 <P>
1.  <I>Long term (Montreal Protocol ODP)</I>: This measure estimates the cumulative damage
over all time that release  of each unit of ODS will cause relative to CFC-11.  This
approach is used by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol and  it gives a picture of the
average long term effect.  However,  it significantly underestimates the danger arising
from fast- acting, short-lived ozone depleters. These do most of their  damage in the
first few years after release.  The problem is  that over the next few years atmospheric
chlorine and bromine  concentrations will be at their highest, and it is over this  period
we should want to do most to reduce the concentrations.  The use of long term
comparisons of ozone depletion potential  (ODP) obscures the disproportionate role of
fast-acting ozone  depleters in adding to the risks of catastrophic ozone loss.   
 </P>
 <P>
2.  <I>Medium term (20 Year ODP)</I>:  This measure estimates the damage caused over the
next twenty years relative to CFC-11.  This increases the prominence of fast-acting
ozone  depleters and more realistically reflects the risks associated  with adding to
already unprecedented levels of chlorine and  bromine expected over the next couple of
decades.
 </P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
This distinction is not an academic curiosity.  The substances that are most
controversial and about which the Parties to the Montreal Protocol have greatest
reluctance to take action are HCFCs and Methyl Bromide.  These compounds are
particularly aggressive over the medium term.  Compared to the relatively slow-acting
CFC-11, which is used as a base for comparing ozone depleting potential,  these
compounds do 3-5 times more damage over twenty years than over the long term.  The
inappropriate use of long term ODPs serves to conceal the risks taken by the Parties as
they equivocate over action to control HCFCs and Methyl Bromide.
 </P>
<P> 
 <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
For this reason, we show the responsibility of nations and companies for producing
ozone depleting chemicals measured by their lifetime impact and by their 20 year
impact.  We have also shown other measures to give the reader an appreciation for the
importance of picking the correct timeframe.

<P>
The following inventory lists the known producers of ODS during the years 1986 to
1995.  Last known production capacities are listed, except for plants known to be
closed.  Production capacity does not equal actual production; in industrial countries,
Montreal Protocol regulations have limited the amount of production allowed at many of
these plants considerably below the actual capacities.

<P>
<B>Article 5 countries:</B>  Countries covered by Article 5, paragraph 1, of the Montreal Protocol. 
These are developing countries with a consumption of CFCs less than or equal to 0.3 kilograms
per capita.  Article 5 countries are able to negotiate delays in phasing out ozone depleting
chemicals in comparison to industrialised countries.  They also receive funds from the
Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol to cover the incremental costs of phasing out ODS.
</P>
<P>
<B>Bromine:</B>  A halogen that depletes ozone when released into the stratosphere.  Of the chemical
groups covered by this report, methyl bromide, halons and HBFCs release bromine into the
stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
<B>CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons):</B>   One of the families of ozone depleting substances (ODS). 
Chemicals comprised of chlorine, fluorine and carbon.  Their atmospheric lifetimes range from
55 to 1,700 years.   Scientists have invented dozens of kinds of CFCs, but three dominate
commerce:  CFC-12, used in foams, aerosols, refrigeration, sterilization, and air conditioning;
CFC-11, used in foams, aerosols and industrial refrigeration; and, CFC-113, used in solvents. 
The Montreal Protocol bans the consumption of newly-made CFCs outside Article 5 countries
beginning January 1, 1996.   Non-Article 5 countries, however, may produce 15% of their 1986
CFC production levels after this date, for essential domestic use and for export to Article 5
countries.
</P>
<P>
<B>Chlorine:</B> A halogen that depletes ozone when released into the stratosphere.  Of the chemical
groups covered by this report, CFCs, HCFCs and methyl chloroform release chlorine into the
stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
<B>HBFCs (Hydrobromofluorocarbons):</B>  A rarely-produced class of depleting chemicals.  The
only known HBFC in commerce, made by Great Lakes Chemical in the U.S., is used to retard
fires in racing cars.  Production and consumption of HBFCs are banned in non-Article 5
countries after 1996.  Production and consumption in Article 5 countries are not restricted.
</P>
<P>
<B>HCFCs (Hydrochlorofluorocarbons):</B>  A family of ODS, many of which are used as substitutes
for CFCs.  Chemicals include hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine and carbon.  Their atmospheric
lifetimes range from 1.4 to 19.5 years.   
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="pixel.gif" HSPACE=5>
     The most common HCFC, by far, is HCFC-22, which has been in production since the
1950s, and is used in refrigeration and foams.  HCFCs-141b/142b are the second most
common HCFCs, and are used in foams, and to a much more limited extent, as aerosols and
solvents. Production of the third most-common group of HCFCs -- HCFCs 123a/124a -- began
in the late 1980s, and finds little market demand.  These chemicals are used mainly as
refrigerants and sterilants.  
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="pixel.gif" HSPACE=5>
     The Montreal Protocol caps consumption of HCFCs from 1996-2003 at levels equalling
103.1% of CFC consumption in 1989.  This cap is then reduced to 65% from 2004 to 2009, 35%
from 2010 to 2014, 10% from 2015 to 2019, 0.5% from 2020 to 2029, and zero thereafter. 
These countries, however, may produce unlimited amounts of HCFCs for consumption in Article
5 countries. No caps or phase-out dates have been set for Article 5 countries.  
</P>
<P>
<B>Halons:</B>  A family of ODS; three kinds of halons are commonly produced: Halon-1211 (which
includes carbon, fluorine, chlorine and bromine; and Halons 1301 and 2402, which include
carbon, fluorine and bromine.  Their atmospheric lifetimes range from 20 to 77 years.  These
are most commonly used as fire retardants.  The Montreal Protocol allows non-Article 5
countries to produce and consume halons after January 1994 up to 15% of 1986 levels.  Article
5 countries face a delayed phase out in these chemicals.
</P>
<P>
<B>Methyl Bromide (also known as bromomethane):</B> An ODS used as a fumigant -- on soils,
commodities and in quarantine.  This chemical contains carbon, hydrogen and bromine.  Its
atmospheric lifetime is 2 years.  Methyl bromide is also a by-product of low-temperature
biomass burning.  The Montreal Protocol limits production and consumption of methyl bromide
in non-Article 5 countries beginning January 1995 at levels produced and consumed in 1991. 
There are no restrictions in Article 5 countries.
</P>
<P>
<B>Methyl Chloroform (also known as 1,1,1-trichloroethane):</B>  An ODS used as a solvent,
containing carbon, hydrogen and chlorine.  Its atmospheric lifetime is 6.1 years.  The Montreal
Protocol caps production and consumption of methyl chloroform in non-Article 5 countries at
levels 15% of those produced and consumed in 1989, beginning January 1, 1996.  Article 5
countries face a delayed phase out in these chemicals.
</P>
<P>
<B>Montreal Protocol:</B>  The full name of this international treaty is the "Montreal Protocol on
Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer."  This agreement was signed in Montreal, Canada,
on September 16, 1987, entered into force on January 1, 1989, and subsequently amended in
London (June 1990) and Copenhagen, Denmark (November 1992).  It followed the signing of
the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer in 1985.
</P>
<P>
<B>ODP (Ozone Depletion Potential):</B>  Ozone Depletion Potentials (ODPs) provide a relative
measure of the expected impact on stratospheric ozone per unit mass emission of a gas, as
compared to that expected from the same mass emission of CFC-11 integrated over time.  The
Montreal Protocol uses steady state ODPs which represent the cumulative effect on ozone over
an infinite time.  By contrast, a 20-Year ODP is a time-weighted depletion rating, which provides
a more realistic measure of medium-term depletion.
</P>
<P>
<B>ODS (Ozone Depleting Substance):</B>   Chlorine and bromine are the most potent ozone-
destroying halogens; other depleting halogens are fluorine and iodine.   Many natural and
human-derived chemical compounds release chlorine and bromine into earth's stratosphere,
thus depleting our ozone shield against ultraviolet radiation.  Most depletion is caused by
industrial chemicals covered in this report.  Other sources include rockets which release
chlorine as they pass through the stratosphere, nitrogen oxides, and biomass burned at low
temperatures for fuel.

                             <DD><FONT SIZE=1> - Du Pont testimony before US Congress, 1974</FONT>
  </P>

<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">When chemists Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina first postulated a link
between chlorofluorocarbons and ozone layer depletion in 1974, the news was
greeted with scepticism, but taken seriously nonetheless.  The vast majority of
credible scientists have since confirmed this hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 The ozone layer around the Earth shields us all from harmful ultraviolet
radiation from the sun.  Without the ozone layer, life on earth would not
exist.  Exposure to increased levels of ultraviolet radiation can cause
cataracts, skin cancer, and immune system suppression in humans as well as
innumerable effects on other living systems.  This is why Rowland's and
Molina's theory was taken so seriously, so quickly - the stakes are literally
the continuation of life on earth.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 One of the most pressing questions before the scientific community was how bad
will it get, and how fast will it happen? In an attempt to answer this, various
different models - all much more complex than any previous attempts - were
developed.  From 1974 to 1983 these models predicted anywhere from 19% ozone
depletion (50 years down the line) to a loss of only 3% of the ozone shield
[Benedick, Richard, Ozone Diplomacy, Harvard University Press, 1991, p.13]].
None of these models predicted the appearance of the Antarctic ozone hole,
which was first reported by British scientists in 1985.  
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Although the forces behind its annual creation are more fully understood now,
the hole's initial detection came as quite a shock in 1985. Scientists had
already acknowledged ozone depletion as a real threat, but it was generally
assumed that it would come on gradually.   This complacency generated policies
to gradually phase out global use of ozone depleting chemicals. The emergence
of the ozone hole proved that our understanding of atmospheric science is less
than perfect - yet the policies remained generally unchanged.  More importantly
though, the appearance of the hole showed that changes could be non-linear, and
sudden.  This fact should be placed firmly in the minds of negotiators at the
Protocol as they set policy under a gradually thinning global ozone layer.  
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 The unexpected, and at the time, unexplained, appearance of the hole is the
best argument possible for the need for the precautionary principle to govern
environmental policy.  Briefly stated, the precautionary principle suggests
that policy makers accept the notion that our scientific understanding of our
ecosystem is incomplete, and prescribes policies which take this into account
by seeking to avoid environmental harm.  Perceived short-term economic costs
should be viewed as secondary, given the enormous potential costs associated
with environmental disaster - in this case, widespread ozone depletion.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 The Montreal Protocol is not an example of the precautionary principle at
work.  Rather, the Protocol continues to be based on a premise of environmental
management, or a balancing of economics and ecology based on best available
science.  This is the fatal flaw in the Protocol.  Negotiators at the Protocol,
armed with the latest (but always imperfect) scientific data, manage the ozone
layer at the margins.  While it may be possible to phase out chemicals faster
and more completely, such steps are often deemed too expensive.  These
decisions are justified on the basis of science, which may, or as in the case
of the appearance of the hole, may not be correct.  As a later section in this
report shows, even that science concedes that a certain level of impacts will
come to pass.  
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 This environmental management practice is called risk-assessment. In short,
this risk assessment attempts to weigh the economic costs of banning ozone
depleting chemicals outright vs. the human and environmental "costs" (deaths,
cancers, extinctions) of additional damage to the ozone layer.  When
negotiators in Vienna in late 1995 decide whether or not to ban all CFCs
immediately or by 2010, they are deciding whether or not an additional amount
of ultraviolet radiation will be allowed to strike the Earth, and whether or
not an additional number of deaths from skin cancer are acceptable costs of
perceived economic needs.  The stakes involved in these discussions are quite
literally life and death. Risk assessment has been widely criticized for giving
governments the power to decide how many deaths are acceptable, how many
illnesses are bearable, how many extinctions are manageable.  The major reason
that the Protocol incorporates this philosophy is the pervasive influence of
the chemical industry at all levels of the Protocol.  It is often assumed that
the appearance of the Antarctic ozone hole was the impetus behind the crafting
of the Protocol in 1987.  In fact, Antarctica was never discussed at the
negotiations.  Rather, it was industry's late endorsement of the Protocol (led
by Du Pont) that paved the way for the global agreement.  Corporate
capitulation on their stance that CFC substitutes were still years away
provided a framework of possibility for governments to point to in crafting the
Protocol. 
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 This industry defined framework is the foundation of the Protocol today. At
every level of the Protocol, industry representatives exert a tremendous
influence.  For instance, the World Bank, which is responsible for the majority
of the funds given by the North to help the South phase out of ozone depleting
substances, relies heavily on chemical industry experts for technical
expertise.  As a result, decisions regarding alternatives to CFCs have been
skewed towards other environmentally damaging technologies, although pressure
from environmental groups has begun to change this in the last year.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 More subtly, while industry representatives sing the praises of the Protocol
and its processes, they have been hard at work in developing countries to
ensure their market share - sometimes of the very chemicals they have agreed to
phase out.  As an industrial trade agreement, meant to ensure markets for
Northern chemical companies, the Protocol has indeed been a success.  The
language of the Protocol guarantees that Northern chemical companies will be
allowed to continue producing CFCs for at least 10 more years.  In addition, as
the markets for CFCs shrink around the world, chemical company alternatives
(e.g. HCFCs and HFCs) are being entrenched despite the fact that other, more
environmentally friendly, and more economic options exist.  If one understands
the objective of the Protocol as phasing out consumption of CFCs in the North,
then, to some extent, it can be viewed as a success.  However, this narrow
interpretation is skewed.  The health of the ozone layer, and the global use of
ozone depleting substances, is the issue.  The Protocol sanctions continued use
of ozone depleting substances, funds the adoption of new ozone depleting
technologies, and creates new environmental problems.  Good for industry,
maybe.  Good for the environment?  Certainly not.

 <HR WIDTH=80%>
 <P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">One would think that the Montreal Protocol ensures that the production and use
of ozone depleting substances will stop.  It doesn't.  Chemical companies will,
for the most part, phase out sales of CFCs in the north this year,  but they
will continue to be produced for export for another 10 years.  CFCs will likely
not be phased out in the South until 2010, their use is increasing, and
production will not even be capped for several more years.  HCFCs, which are
potent ozone destroyers in the short term, are increasing in usage globally,
are not set to be phased out in the North until 2030, and may never be phased
out in the South.  Methyl bromide, a potent ozone destroyer used as a pesticide
and fumigant, is virtually unregulated by the Protocol (although various
national regulations cover it and there is a cap on developed nation
consumption).  For all of these chemicals, safer alternatives exist, and yet
their continued production and use remains sanctioned by the Parties to the
Montreal Protocol.
</P>

 <H3>CFCs</H3>

<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 As of January 1, 1996, it will be illegal for developed nations to produce or
import virgin CFCs, except for "essential" and "feedstock" uses and production
for export to the South.   Additionally, for every 100 tonnes of CFCs destroyed
by US companies, they may in turn produce 85 tonnes of new CFCs in 1996.  In
addition, large amounts of recycled and recovered CFCs will continue to be
available, although at inflated prices. 
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">  
 In 1996, 151,811 tonnes of new CFCs can be produced, legally in the north for
export to developing countries. This production loophole was inserted into the
Protocol mostly at the urging of developing nations, which were concerned about
the availability of CFCs after the North's phaseout.  Provisions for continued
legal production were added to the Montreal Protocol five years ago, when
industry was still maintaining that CFC replacement was going to be a difficult
proposition.  Experts now agree that the continued access to CFCs by developing
countries is hindering the switch to safer alternatives. Nevertheless,
developing countries will continue to consume CFCs, and that consumption is
expected to rise in the next several years.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Continued consumption of CFCs by the developing world is one of the most
important issues that will be discussed this year in the Montreal Protocol.
Early indications are that Parties will most likely agree to do nothing, and to
keep the phaseout date for the South at the year 2010.  Other options on the
table at the moment would actually weaken current phaseout schedules. This is
despite the fact that a recent study of available options concluded that a 2001
phaseout would be cheaper overall to fund, and would speed the recovery of the
ozone layer by approximately 8%. (Study on the Financial Mechanism of the
Montreal Protocol, March 1995, COWIconsult)
</P>


<H3>HCFCs</H3>

<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Currently, controls exist on the production of HCFCs in developed
countries only.  These chemicals are recognized as "transitional substances"
rather than permanent replacements, precisely because of their potential to
deplete the ozone layer.  The current phaseout schedule (which some nations
have accelerated domestically) will freeze HCFC production at a specified "cap"
level in 1996, and allows for gradual reductions until 2020 when 99.5% of
production must stop, with a final phaseout in 2030.  
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Despite efforts by some European nations to accelerate the global phaseout of
HCFCs, the United States, Japan and France in particular, continue to resist
additional controls.  This split is an industrial, not an environmental one.
In Europe, most manufacturers have switched almost entirely away from HCFCs in
favor of environmentally safer alternatives.  The US, Japan, and France, in
contrast, continue to rely heavily on sales of these ozone depleters, and so
act to ensure their continued market availability and protect their investments.
</P>


<H3> Methyl Bromide</H3>

<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Methyl bromide, a pesticide and fumigant, is the only ozone depleting chemical
that is virtually unregulated by the Montreal Protocol.  Methyl bromide use has
been almost completely eliminated in the Netherlands, and other countries are
following suit, as it becomes clear that alternatives are available or in an
advanced state of development for about 90% of all uses. According to the
United Nations Environment Programme, a rapid phaseout of methyl bromide is the
most significant short term step that countries can take to protect the ozone
layer.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Formalization of a global ban is currently in jeopardy at the Protocol
negotiations because of unfounded economic concerns fostered by an industry
propaganda campaign initiated by methyl bromide producers in the US and Israel.
The United States, which had initially supported a progressive position, is now
backpedaling as the Clinton administration has realized that Florida and
California (two very important states in the upcoming election) are the two
states that will be affected the most by a methyl bromide phaseout.  Developing
countries generally oppose controls on methyl bromide because of unfounded
concerns regarding the costs of alternatives.

<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Saving the ozone layer is not a game in which there are winners and losers.
Either everybody wins, or we all lose.  Recognizing this, and recalling that
ozone depleting chemicals were developed in the industrialized North, the
Protocol incorporates a system to aid developing countries in their phase out
of ozone depleting substances.  The Multilateral Fund, established in 1990, is
this system.  While in theory the system should work, in practice it is proving
very difficult.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 One of the obvious assumptions underlying the faith in ozone layer recovery is
that countries will live up to their committments.  In many key respects, they
are not.  For the Protocol to work as it is designed (much less as it should),
several key things must happen.  First, industrialized countries of the North
have to phase out their use of these chemicals.  Not all of them are.  Second,
those same Northern countries have to pay (via the Multilateral Fund) for
Southern countries' phase out.  Not all of them are.  Third, there has to be no
substantial black market production of CFCs from either Northern or Southern
countries.  There is.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Northern countries are simply not living up to their end of the bargain.  In
short, there isn't enough money, or even as much money as the North had
promised.  Currently, the North is over $50 million in arrears to the Fund,
which of course has the effect of slowing down CFC phase out in the South.
Italy, the worst example, has simply not paid anything yet.  Canada is also
significantly in debt to the Fund. In many other cases, differring accounting
practices between governments complicate reliable projections.  In at least one
case (the US), politicians are threatening to pull funding entirely.  The
cumulative effect undermines confidence in the South that the Fund will work.
This lack of faith threatens to unravel the entire agreement with developing
countries wary of committing themselves to further action.  At the last meeting
of the Protocol in August of 1995, the meeting completely broke down over these
issues and was simply adjourned, rather than closed. 
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 A significant problem, both for funding and phase-out in the North, is the
economic chaos in parts of Eastern Europe and the former soviet union.  These
economies in transition are in a difficult position to either convert their
economies away from ozone depleting chemicals or pay into the Fund - measures
agreed before the dissolution of their planned economies.  Many have suggested
that they now simply be reclassified as developing countries under the
Protocol, but of course that would both increase the amount of money needed and
additionally increase the amount of damage to the ozone layer.  Most production
is concentrated in Russia which is widely recognized to be a major source of
the growing trade in black market CFCS.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 The emerging black market in CFCS is pointed to by industry and governments as
the most significant problem in compliance with the Montreal Protocol. The US
government has mobilized Operation "Cool Breeze", which involves the US Federal
Bureau of Investigations (FBI), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the
Customs Service, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Interpol.  While the
estimated 10,000 to 20,000 US tons per year entering the US alone are certainly
a major, if predictable, problem with Protocol compliance, this trade pales in
comparison to "legal" production by US multinationals.  One wonders whether the
real concern here is ozone layer protection, or market share.

<H2>IF Southern countries operate in good faith (they're not)</H2>
 <HR WIDTH=80%>
 <P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 If Northern countries can be fairly accused of viewing the Protocol as a market
 creation and preservation device for their industries, Southern countries can
be similarly accused of behaving as if the Protocol were a developmental,
rather than an environmental agreement.  Nowhere is this clearer than in the
ongoing discussion on "basic domestic needs".
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 "The real issue is this;" said the representative of one large developing
country, "do you want CFCS produced in the North by large chemical companies,
or produced in the South by our own industries".  Under the terms of the
Protocol, a country in the South "shall, in order to meet its basic domestic
needs, be entitled to delay for ten years its compliance with the control
measures..."[Article 5, 1]   Since only a handful of developing countries
(including China, India, and Brazil) actually have the capacity to produce,
this is a fight over who gets that remaining market share.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 No matter what one may think of the relative merits of Southern vs. Northern
industry, the Protocol is quite clear that Southern production for export is
not allowed.  Southern governments which seek a re-opening of this question
need to find a way to articulate their arguments in environmental terms.  If,
for instance, these governments argued that keeping production in the South
would allow them to phase out CFCS faster, and to bypass HCFC substitutes,
negotiation might ensue. At the moment, though, these governments' arguments
simply appear to be attempts to bolster their own industry.  At the same time,
Northern arguments for maintaining the status quo both bolster their industry
and appear to favor the environment.  The North argues that it is in their
industry's economic interests to phase out CFCS as soon as possible, so that
they can continue to create markets for HCFCs and HFCs.  Many observers feel
less than confident on this point, but at least it makes an environmental
argument - albeit one that rests on the premise that HCFCs and HFCs are
acceptable substitutes to CFCS.  In truth, neither North or South need to be
producing more CFCS, as existing stockpiles and readily available replacement
technology are more than sufficient to meet economic demands.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Another area in which some Southern countries are violating at least the
spirit of the Montreal Protocol is by increasing production.  When the Fund was
set up and the South joined the Protocol it was recognized that equity issues
dictated that the South be allowed to continue to develop and expand its use
and production of ozone depleting chemicals.  However, no one foresaw the zeal
with which developing countries would seek to expand this capacity, and of
course, the increasing bills this would give to Northern governments for an
eventual phaseout.  India, for example, has actually said that unless the North
compensates it for not building new CFC plants, it will go ahead and build
them. While technically this is their right under the Protocol it hardly adds
to the spirit of international cooperation for governments to behave this way.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Finally, Southern countries are failing to provide accurate and reliable data
to negotiators at the Protocol regarding the amount of ozone depleting
substances that their countries consume.  The lack of this data makes it
virtually impossible to accurately forecast future needs for phaseout, or
impacts of delays in that phaseout.

 When the chemical industry endorsed the Montreal Protocol they thought they
had a no lose situation.  As CFCS were phased out, HCFCs and HFCs would be
phased in.  With the help of the Protocol's Fund, the industry was eagerly
anticipating moving into new markets in Southern countries.  Rather than paying
for the problems they caused, these polluters faced the prospect of profiting
from their damage to the ozone layer. Environmental groups were both relieved
and alarmed.  Relieved that CFCS would be phased out (although they haven't yet
been), but alarmed because of the fact that neither HCFCs nor HFCs are even
close to being environmentally benign.  It should have surprised no one that
chlorine based industries came up with chlorine based alternatives.  Almost
immediately, a search for "not in-kind alternatives" (NIKAs) began.  For some
applications, such as aerosols and electronics cleaning, environmentally benign
alternatives were readily available.  In refrigeration and foam blowing though
(the two sectors with the most growth potential in the developing world) HCFCs
and HFCs seemed to dominate the market.  In March of 1993, as the first
"Greenfreeze" - a hydrocarbon based refrigerator - was produced in Germany, all
that changed.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Isobutane and cyclopentane, two readily available hydrocarbon products, are
now clearly established as NIKA technologies for refrigeration and foam
blowing, respectively.  They are the standard technology in Europe today, and
have gained worldwide market share.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Despite this, it took years for the Protocol's implementing 
agencies (the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization) to recognize this shift and begin to fund
these technologies. The Bank and UNDP in particular, continue to rely on
chemical company "experts" for advice on their technology choices.  Last year,
the Executive Committee of the Fund noted "a presumption against HCFC projects"
and yet this year UNDP has continued to submit HCFC projects - without adequate
justification or estimates of the cost of a second conversion away from HCFCs.
Both steps are now supposedly required in order for HCFC projects to be
approved.  At the Fund's July meeting, these requirements were conveniently
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 The Protocol uses public money meant for environmental protection to phase out
CFC use.  The fact that the majority of this money has gone towards other
environmentally damaging technologies is a scandal, and a clear violation of
the spirit, if not the letter of the Protocol.

<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Even if we assume that production of ozone depleting substances will stop, and
that all countries will be in full compliance, the claims that the ozone layer
will recover are based on scientific understanding of our atmosphere that,
while improved from ten years ago, is still far from perfect.  Science has
consistently under, rather than over-estimated the speed and severity of ozone
depletion.  Clearly this history points to the need for policy to err on the
side of caution.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Reassuringly though, there is no single area of global ecological 
science that is as clearly established as the connection between industrial chemicals and
ozone depletion.   In 1994, NASA scientists announced the results of a major
study that conclusively proved the connection between ozone loss and CFCS -
once again confirming Rowland's and Molina's hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 What is still debated among credible scientists is at what levels depletion
will bottom out and when we will reach them.  According to United Nations
Environment Programme projections, (upon which negotiators depend 
in the Montreal Protocol) the ozone layer will fully recover by the middle of the next
century, and ozone depletion is expected to reach its peak around the year
1998. As mentioned before, those projections are based on full compliance.
UNEP projections are also based on the best available science, and on the
assumption that there will be no positive feedbacks, or nasty surprises, that
could accelerate ozone depletion.  Several trends are disturbing in this regard.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 For the past three years, ozone depletion has outstripped the predicted rate
of ozone loss. At first, in 1993, scientists noted that "the decline over much
of the United States, Europe, and Asia may only be a transitory effect from the
eruption of the Mt. Pinatubo volcano...If that is the case ozone levels should
return to more normal levels in a year or two..."[New York Times, 4/23/93] The
next year, UNEP reported that as the aerosols from Pinatubo had been swept out
of the air, ozone levels had returned to levels consistent with the models.
However this year, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) and the World Meteorological Organization both reported "unusually low
ozone levels", up to 35 percent depletion in some areas.  In addition, this
year a new and unexplained depletion happened over the southern hemisphere in
the summer, which runs completely counter to model predictions. 
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" "> 
 Ozone depletion is only one of the global ecological crises facing Earth's
atmosphere today.  The other is climate change, caused by global warming.
Scientific opinion is now clear that human activity is linked to the global
warming of the atmosphere. (New York Times, 9/10/95)  We know that greenhouse
gases trap heat, and we know that the concentrations of these gases are rising
in our atmosphere.  The debate now is over how severe and where the impacts
will be - an experiment on a global scale. Disturbingly, several models have
predicted that as climate change accelerates, it could also exacerbate ozone
depletion. Ironically, HFCs, a major replacement chemical for CFCS, are also
potent global warming gases. 
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Clearly something else is going on in the stratosphere. The Pinatubo aerosols
are gone.  However, we still are not able to fully and accurately predict the
behavior of the ozone layer. Until we can (and that point may be decades away)
we must err on the side of caution in designing policies to protect the
atmosphere.

<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Particularly since 1990, industry scientists, "wise use" organizers,
politicians and the media have begun to cast doubt on the science of ozone
depletion.  These attacks range from denying that chlorine (from CFCS, HCFCs
and other chemicals) and bromine (from methyl bromide and halons) cause ozone
depletion, to asserting that ozone depletion has not resulted in increased
levels of UV-B striking the earth. 
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Most worrying is the ongoing attempt by methyl bromide producers to wreck
negotiations on a phase out of the chemical.  Despite agreement by
international scientists that methyl bromide is one of the most dangerous ozone
destroying chemicals in use and that the ozone layer will never recover unless
it is banned, companies are staging drawn out debates over minor scientific
uncertainties in order to delay action.  Meanwhile, methyl bromide emissions
are on the increase.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 According to the sceptics' arguments, we just don't have enough science yet to
justify the policy steps outlined by the Montreal Protocol.  Imagine, however,
if one applied this logic to the public health arena--governments would not
promote safe sex because it's only a theory that HIV causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 These scientific sceptics pose a grave threat to continued developed country
contributions to the Multilateral Fund, particularly in the US.  Recently, US
contributions to the Fund have been threatened by the 104th Congress.  During
the House Appropriations process, several key Republican Members of Congress
threatened to attach a rider to the Environmental Protection's Agency budget
which would have stripped all funding to the Multilateral Fund.  As well,
several Senators led by the Chair of the Foreign Relations Committee Jesse
Helms (R-NC) also attempted to end US funding for the Fund.  If these efforts
succeed, developing countries will almost certainly walk out of the Protocol.
National legislation is under similar attacks.  Despite near worldwide
agreement on the upcoming ban on CFCS in 1996, Congressman Doolittle
(Republican-California), aided by Representative Delay (Republican-Texas), has
proposed legislation to repeal the ban. 
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 This action by the US Congress comes on the heels of legislation recently
signed into law in the state of Arizona which vows to defy the domestic and
global ban on CFCS in 1996.  Although state law is superseded by both the Clean
Air Act and the Montreal Protocol, this legislative move offers evidence of
both the sway of the sceptics and the potential threat of Doolittle's
legislation in the current political climate.  The fact that such backlash is
occurring in the US, which was the world's largest consumer of ozone depleting
chemicals and is the central country in the Protocol negotiations, gives these
domestic issues international importance.

 Let's  assume that the Protocol will overcome its many shortcomings, and that
sometime in the middle of the next century the ozone layer will fully recover.
Even with this assumption, we are still facing years of increasing impacts from
exposure to ultraviolet radiation.

 There is a direct correlation between increases in the amount of industrial
chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere,  increases in stratospheric ozone
depletion,  increases in the amount of UV-B radiation reaching the earth and
increased  damage to human health and other life forms .   Given this equation,
one wonders why the Parties to the Protocol continue to sanction the production
of ozone depleting chemicals.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 These alarming impacts are  highlighted in numerous reports, including the
1994 UNEP  Assessment of the Environmental Effects of Ozone Depletion". They
include:
</P>
<UL>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 <LI>  Skin cancer rate on the rise: Between 1979 and 1993, the incidence of
non-melanoma, the most common form of skin cancer, is already believed to have
risen an average of 10% in the Northern Hemisphere, between the latitudes 55N
and 35N. Even larger increases are believed to have occurred in the Southern
Hemisphere.  UNEP forecasts that a sustained 1% decrease in stratospheric ozone
will result in a 2% increase of this type of skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 In 1994, UNEP confirmed that increases in UV-B radiation are likely to
increase "the incidence and morbidity from skin cancer" and  that
"epidemiological data indicate that the risk of melanoma increases with
sunlight exposure, especially during childhood." (1994  Science, Environmental
Effects and Technology and Economic Assessments, Synthesis Report/ page 13)
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 <LI> Human immune system at risk:  Exposure to UV-B is now known to lower the
effectiveness of the human immune system. There is mounting evidence that UV-B
has the ability to activate latent viruses such as papilloma viruses, herpes,
and perhaps HIV. UNEP suggests that UV-B exposure might adversely influence
immunity to infectious diseases, such as  leishmaniasis, and malaria..  UV-B
exposure also may  reduce immunization rates, exacerbate photosensitivity
disease such as lupus, and cause medication reactions in individuals taking the
birth control pill and certain antidepressants and antibiotics.  [Dr. K.D.
Cooper, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]  As well, excessive UV-B radiation
can trigger herpes simplex virus infections of the oral cavity (UNEP,
Environmental Effects of Ozone Depletion, 1991] 
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 <LI> Increased incidence of eye cataracts:  In November, 1991 UNEP projected
that the effects of increased UV-B radiation will result  in substantial
increases in cataract (the clouding of the eyes lens) cases and blindness
worldwide.  Latest finding indicate that  each 1% decrease in ozone levels
leads to 0.6% to 0.8% increase in cataracts.  The World Health Organization
estimates that a 10 percent reduction in the ozone layer will result in two
million new cases of cataracts per year.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">

 <LI> Fish stock at risk: 16% ozone depletion could result in 5% loss in
phytoplankton (the basis of all food in the seas), which would lead to a loss
of about 7 million tonnes of fish per year -about 7% of fishery yield.  Under
the Antarctic ozone hole productivity from phytoplankton was down by 6-12%.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" "> 
<LI> Damage to plants:  UV-B radiation can alter plant form, damage tree and
plant growth, change the time of flowering, make plants more vulnerable to
disease and cause them to produce toxic substances. There may well be losses of
biodiversity and plant species, but our ignorance of the effects of UV-B on
ecosystems as a whole is far too great to allow figures to be put on these
losses.
</P>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 <LI> Air pollution: With loss of ozone in the upper atmosphere, it is expected
that UV-B radiation will cause ground-level ozone to increase in urban and
suburban areas, reaching potentially harmful concentrations earlier in the day.
</P>
 </UL>
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
 Scientific research into the impact of increased UV-B radiation upon the
biosphere is tragically under funded.  The UNEP Scientific Committee On
Problems of the Environment  (SCOPE) forewords  its  1993 report "Effects of
Increased Ultraviolet Radiation on Global Ecosystems" with the following
forthright admonition: "The fact that the number of experts on the effects of
increased UV-B impacts on living systems due to ozone depletion continues to be
rather small, illustrates that for the past 20 years, the governments of the
world seemed not to take seriously this potential threat to the biosphere.
Candidly stated, research funding for "effects" research has been paltry at
best."

that chlorine loading will peak at 3.8 parts per billion around the turn of the
century.  If one or all of these assumptions are wrong, ozone depletion will
get much worse, for much longer.

 The logical goal should be to reverse this trend as quickly as possible and to
allow the ozone layer to restore itself to pre- industrial levels.
Unfortunately, the Montreal Protocol does not seem aimed at this goal.

<IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif" ALT=" ">
  The shortest route to reducing the atmospheric levels of chlorine and
bromine, hence reducing the amount of ozone depletion and the risk of adverse
health and environmental impacts from ultraviolet radiation is the immediate
elimination of the production and use of ozone destroying compounds.  And yet,
the majority of the proposals currently on the table at the Montreal Protocol
would actually extend global use of ozone depleting chemicals.

 It is the moral obligation of governments to protect the public, and the
environment,  from undue harm. Clearly,  it is their responsibility to help
speed up the recovery of the ozone layer if they have the means to do so--which
they do. We now have the know-how to replace all ozone depleting substances
with environmentally safer technologies.  All we are lacking is the political
will.

 <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">Since the early 1930's, to the present day, human beings have conducted 
  a virtual chemical warfare against the ozone layer, by pumping millions 
  of tonnes of ozone depleting substances (ODSs)  into the atmosphere. </P> 
  
 <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif"> Not surprisingly, each year the ozone layer is more damaged than in 
  previous years, and the ozone crisis is rapidly escalating.  </P>
  
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">In March 1995 scientists reported an alarming thinning of the ozone 
  layer over the  Arctic, Siberia and Scandinavia.  In some altitudes 
  ozone levels were 50 per cent  below those  previously observed.   On 
  average, a 20-30 per cent reduction in Arctic ozone levels was  
  reported. The British newspaper,  The Guardian,  headlined its front 
  page story, "First Ozone Hole Found Over Arctic".</P>
  
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">On September 12, 1995  the World Meteorological Organization reported
  that ozone depletion over the Antarctic was "so far the most rapid 
  depletion on record" with severe ozone depletions covering "about 10 
  million square kilometres (about the size of Europe)". This was double 
  the size of the Antarctic ozone hole during  the same period in 1993 and 
  1994, which until 1995 had the "lowest ozone values ever observed by 
  scientists".</P>
  
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The ozone layer's most  vulnerable period  is expected around 1998-2000 
  when the accumulated atmospheric  chlorine/bromine  levels from human 
  made chemicals will be the highest. At that time ozone  depletions will 
  be the most severe and UV-B radiation at the highest. </P>
  
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  
  The ozone layer is the Earth's primary protective shield against the 
  sun's deadly ultraviolet rays.  The thining of the ozone layer allows 
  more ultraviolet-B radiation to reach the surface of the Earth. Higher 
  levels of UV-B radiation dramatically increase the risk of severe damage 
  to  human   health  (e.g. eye diseases, skin cancer, immune system 
  suppression) and also endanger crops, forests, plants, marine life and 
  wildlife.

<H3>1.1 Corporate Irresponsibility</H3>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  In the early 1970's scientists discovered that a class of chlorine  
  containing industrial chemicals called halocarbons were harmful to the 
  ozone layer.  The most commonly used halocarbons are chlorofluorocarbons 
  (CFCs).  CFCs are stable, non-toxic and inflammable compounds.  These 
  qualities have made them very attractive for industrial use. They have 
  numerous industrial applications as refrigerants, foam blowing agents, 
  electrical circuit-board solvents and aerosol propellants. 
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Unfortunately, they are also the major contributors to the depletion of 
  the ozone layer, and consequently  need to be eliminated.  
  </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The two main points of contention surrounding ODS phase-outs are: (a) 
  which alternative substances and technologies are the best substitutes, 
  on the short and long term, for CFCs and the goods and services they 
  provide; and (b) what is the most feasible phase-out schedule for all 
  ozone depleting substances.
  </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Chemical corporations,   that created the ozone crisis in the first 
  place,  promote the false-perception that at the present time only their 
  products, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons 
  (HFCs),   are available as viable alternatives to CFCs.  Led by such 
  giants as  Du Pont, ICI and Elf Atochem, they are striving to maintain a 
  multi-billion dollar global monopoly they have enjoyed with CFCs during 
  the past six decades.

    <HR WIDTH=35%>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The chemical industry conducts an extensive international lobby, and 
  expends vast  resources,  promoting its products. For example, on 
  December 1, 1992 the London Financial  Times reported that Du Pont had 
  invested $450 million in HCFC and HFC production, and  expects to hit 
  the $1 billion mark in 1995, with an expected recovery period for the  
  investment of no less than ten years. The company claims to require 
  another ten to twenty  years of HCFC and HFC production to profit above 
  and beyond recouping their investment.  
  </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  But both HCFCs and HFCs are environmentally harmful. HCFCs  continue to 
  destroy the ozone layer, albeit somewhat less than CFCs, and both HCFCs 
  and HFCs are potent global warming gases.  Because HCFCs destroy ozone, 
  they can only be considered as "transitional substances", meaning that 
  they will have to be replaced by  environmentally more acceptable 
  substances in the near future.  This takes two steps to accomplish what 
  could be done in one with environmentally safer alternatives. It also 
  doubles the costs. Double costs are incurred in retrofitting equipment, 
  changing production lines, and training of personnel.
  </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  It is estimated that  global HCFC and HFC production will be 219,000 
  tonnes and 365, 000  tonnes respectively by the year 2005.  We already 
  face an alarming rate of global warming due  to human activity.  The 
  world must not now take the risk of allowing the wide-scale use of new  
  generations of global warming gases. 
  </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  For example, over a twenty year time-span, the global  warming potential 
  (GWP) of HFC-134a is estimated to be  3,200 times that of carbon dioxide  

  (CO2).   Presented more graphically, the global warming impact of a  
  worldwide annual  production of at least 200,000 tonnes of  HFC-134a 
  equals roughly the CO2 emissions of an  industrialized nation the size 
  of France or the UK.    
  </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  <A NAME="r1">Furthermore</A>, the manufacture of HFCs is directly linked to the 
  production of organochlorines, a class of chemicals that are persistent 
  and toxic, and have been targeted for phase out.  Throughout the 
  manufacturing process, toxic intermediary and by-products are released 
  into the environment . Approximately 10per cent  of the total HFC-134a 
  production weight is toxic waste, which pollutes our air, soil and 
  water.

<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Professor Gustav Lorentzen (Norway),  in a paper entitled "The Use of 
  Natural Refrigerants, A Complete Solution to the CFC/HCFC Predicament" 
  writes: "It has already been suggested that HFC-134a may be decomposed 
  by sunlight in the troposphere and form acid and poisonous substances.  
  If this should turn out to be true, we may have to face yet another 
  catastrophe, even worse than the CFC experience." <A HREF="#f1">*</A>

<H3>1.2 Environmentally Safer Alternatives Exist</H3>

<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Over the years Greenpeace has maintained that it is possible to meet all 
  human needs that have been serviced by ozone depleting substances 
  without using chemicals that harm the ozone layer or the global climate. 
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  In 1992, Greenpeace published two extensive reports,  "Climbing Out of 
  the Ozone Hole" and "Making the Right Choices" which surveyed the then 
  existing alternatives to CFCs and other ozone depleting chemicals. 
  </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  
  Taking it a step further, in 1992, Greenpeace initiated the development 
  of the world's first ozone safe and climate friendly domestic 
  refrigerator technology --Greenfreeze.  Greenfreeze technology has 
  revolutionized the domestic refrigeration industry. It has spread like a 
  prairie fire throughout Western Europe and to other parts of the world, 
  such as Australia, China, India, and Latin America. Furthermore, it has 
  inspired industry in other sectors to develop new alternatives to 
  fluorocarbons. 
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Since '92 there has been a flurry of technological activity, with new 
  products that utilize environmentally safer technologies penetrating the 
  market place in rapid succession. 
     </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Today there is absolutely no need, nor excuse, for the on-going use of 
  ozone depleting substances.  Safer alternatives exist for virtually 
  every application of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs. 
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Presently there is a  lag time between technological development on the 
  one hand, and sound environmental policies and business practices on the 
  other. The availability of these safer products has yet to be translated 
  into tighter phase out  dates and restrictions on fluorocarbon use. 
  Businesses in both industrialized and developing countries are still 
  being encouraged by the chemical industry, governments and international 
  financial agencies (such as the World Bank) to invest in obsolete 
  fluorocarbon technologies. And yet, one doesn't need to be a rocket 
  scientist to realize that investing in fluorocarbon technologies is not 
  only environmentally irresponsible, but is also poor business .
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The present Greenpeace report, "No Excuses",  is an update of some of 
  the  safer alternatives in sectors where CFCs have been or will soon be 
  eliminated. The examples cited are commercially available.  Their 
  inclusion in this document should not be construed to mean Greenpeace 
  endorsation of any of the products or manufacturers.

<H3> 2.1  Domestic Refrigeration</H3>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  There are approximately 64 million domestic refrigerator-freezers 
  manufactured worldwide each year. The annual growth rate in the 
  refrigerator sector, especially in rapidly developing countries like 
  China, India and Indonesia is 15 per cent, while the growth rate in 
  industrialized countries is 7 per cent.  In addition, there are hundreds 
  of millions of domestic refrigerator units in use worldwide.
  </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Until recently, most domestic refrigerators were manufactured with the 
  use of ozone depleting substances --CFC-11 in the insulation, and CFC-12 
  as the refrigerant. In 1990, the combined total  of CFC-11 and CFC-12 
  used in domestic refrigerators was approximately 40,000 metric tonnes. 
  During 1993/94 the natural refrigerants, hydrocarbons R290 (propane) and 
  R600a (isobutane),  or blends of R290/R600a, have emerged as the major 
  contenders against the synthetic compound HFC-134a  for market 
  acceptance as refrigerant substitutes to CFC 12.  Similarly,  another 
  hydrocarbon, cyclopentane, is successfully competing for market share 
  against HCFC-141b in insulation foam blowing.  
  
</P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  <A NAME="r1">The</A> main benefit of hydrocarbons over their synthetic counterparts is 
  that they do not deplete the ozone layer, and their global warming 
  potential is insignificant.  Additional advantages are: <A HREF="#f1">*</A>
  <UL>
  <LI> they are compatible with materials normally used in refrigeration 
  plants such as copper and mineral oil,
  <LI> they have similar physical properties to CFC-12 (isobutane or mixture) 
  and HCFC-22 (propane), so they can be used for direct drop-in 
  replacement with minor adjustments to existing equipment
  <LI> only a small amount of refrigerant is needed,
  <LI> they have lower prices than HFC refrigerants 
   </DL>
  </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  In the spring  of 1992 Greenpeace initiated the  production of the 
  world's first 'Greenfreeze' domestic refrigerator, totally free of any  
  fluorocarbons.  Greenfreeze uses hydrocarbons for both the insulation 
  foam blowing agent and the refrigerant. A mixture of propane (R290) and 
  isobutane (R60Oa),  or  isobutane as a pure gas is used for the 
  refrigerant, and cyclopentane is used as the blowing agent. Hydrocarbons 
  are flammable but their flammability can be easily mitigated through 
  adequate safety measures in production and  product design. The content 
  of propane or butane in a domestic 'Greenfreeze' refrigerator equals 
  roughly the content of two <A NAME="r2">cigarette</A> <A NAME="r3">lighters</A>.

  The energy efficiency of Greenfreeze refrigerators has proven to be as

  insulated with foam blown with CFCs or HCFC-141b. For example,  the 
  Bosch-Siemens 1993 Annual Report writes: "A new line of 
  refrigerators/(freezers) are distinguishing themselves with the thick 
  'super-insulation' as well as with a specially designed refrigeration 
  cycle and compressor.  With this (technology) an energy saving of up to 
  50per cent has been realized.  The most energy efficient unit, with a 
  capacity of 360 liters (12.7 cu. ft) unit is complete CFC and HFC free 
  and has an energy consumption of .10kWh/100 liters.  This is the 
  equivalent of the energy consumption of a 15 Watt light bulb." <A HREF="#f3">***</A>

   Greenfreeze has now become the dominant technology in Europe. Many 
  models of 'Greenfreeze' refrigerators are now on sale in virtually all 
  European countries, including  Germany, Austria, Denmark, France, Italy, 
  Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain, Greece, Ireland, Bekgium, Norway, Czech 
  Republic, Slowenia, Hungary and  Britain.  All of the major European 
  companies, Bosch-Siemens, Electrolux,  Liebherr,Miele, Quelle, Vestfrost

  Greenfreeze-technology based refrigerators. Over 90per cent of new 
  fridges sold in Germany now use isobutane as the refrigerant.

  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Hydrocarbon refrigeration technology has also spread to other 
  continents. 
  In Australia, Email began selling their first line of Greenfreeze 
  refrigerators in early 1995 and will supply all the fridges for the 
  Sydney 2000 Olympics village with this technology.

  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Three of the four largest factories in China have converted to 
  hydrocarbon based refrigeration and foam production, in collaboration 
  with Liebherr or Bosch-Siemens. Funding support for the conversion has 
  come from the USEPA and German Government, as well as the Montreal 
  Protocol Multilateral Fund.

  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  India is also taking a keen interest, where an expert on CFC substitutes 
  has said "We think that hydrocarbons are attractive for India, because 
  this technology implies minimum changes of the compressor and the 
  manufacturing process. India already has all the technology to produce 
  and manage hydrocarbons, which are cheap, and we have the appropriate 
  lubricants. So, with hydrocarbons we would not be constrained by 
  technological dependence. The situation would be totally the opposite 
  with HFC 134a".

  Argentina is set to move into hydrocarbon based refrigeration (see <A HREF="6excuse.html">case 
  study</A>).Training programmes for hydrocarbon refrigerants have been set up 
  in Ghana, Kenya and Pakistan, the advantage being that with relatively 
  minor adjustments, hydrocarbons can be directly used as drop-in 
  replacements  for CFCs, avoiding the "double conversion" problem posed 
  by HCFCs and HFCs.

  <A NAME="r5">The</A> Dutch organization ECOZONE has been working with the Pakistan 
  Holland Metal Project (PHMP) in Peshawar on a training course for fridge

  repair workshop charged 10 refrigerators with Fongas (a local name for 
  Liquid Propane Gas) and monitored the results over 10 months. No 
  complaints were received from customers and the fridges are still 
  working well. The company "Quite Cool Engineering" lists costs as (one 
  twentieth compared to CFCs) and the fact that no technical changes are 
  necessary, as major advantages of Fongas. The owner, Mr Qureshi, added 
  that with HFC-134a "....we [would] have to replace the compressor and 
  the lubricant. That would mean I can close my business, because no

<H3>2.1.1
  Domestic Refrigeration Case Study: KOH-I-NOOR, Argentina</H3>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Early in 1994, Greenpeace contacted  KOH-I-NOOR, an Argentinean domestic 
  refrigerator manufacturer (licensed by Liebherr),  about converting to  
  hydrocarbons from CFCs.   The World Bank was at the time encouraging 
  KOH-I-NOOR to use  HFC-134a and HCFC-141b for CFC replacements. The 
  conversion of the factory from CFCs, regardless of which alternative was 
  chosen,  required partial funding from the Multilateral Fund of the 
  Montreal Protocol, which is mainly administered by the World Bank. 
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Paradoxically,   at a seminar hosted by the World Bank  a consensus 
  emerged between a number of manufacturers that cyclopentane was indeed a 
  viable alternative to CFC-11 and HCFC-141b as a blowing agent in 
  insulation foam production.  
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Citing safety reasons,  the experts from the  World Bank/Multilateral 
  Fund, at first discouraged the use hydrocarbons .  However,  since most 
  Argentinean stoves and many taxis run on natural gas, many of which pose 
  potentially greater safety problems, dealing with gas-safety was not 
  considered problematic by the manufacturers. 
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  There was also pressure from the Argentinean Government for an early 
  completion of project submissions to the Multilateral Fund. This put 
  hydrocarbon technology at a disadvantage by limiting the available time 
  for disseminating information to the manufacturers about this innovation 
  in refrigeration. 
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  However,  in cooperation with Liebherr,   KOH-I-NOOR  established the 
  fact that the safety of hydrocarbon refrigerants was not a problem,  
  that hydrocarbons performed satisfactorily with existing equipment, and  
  that developing a line of refrigerators using isobutane would be 
  feasible. 
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Concurrently,  as a result of Greenpeace's Greenfreeze campaign,  a high 
  degree of public support for'Greenfreeze' technology was generated in 
  Argentina.  This public response further convinced KOH-I-NOOR  of the 
  unique market opportunity presented by  the hydrocarbon option. 
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  KOH-I-NOOR completed its project preparation in April 1995. The project 
  relies completely on hydrocarbon technology,-- cyclopentane for foam 
  blowing, and isobutane for the refrigerant.
  The project was submitted for approval to the Multilateral Fund, and in 
  July, 1995 it was finally approved.  The production of ozone and climate 
  friendly refrigerators in Argentina will begin  as soon as funds are 
  available from the Multilateral Fund. 
    </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The KOH-I-NOOR project is further demonstration of the fact that 
  hydrocarbons represent cost- effective and efficient alternatives to 
  CFCs.

<H3>2.1.2  Stirling Cycle Refrigeration</H3>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  During the past few years a new technology, Stirling cycle, has begun to 
  receive considerable amount of  attention in the search for ever more 
  efficient technologies.  
      </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Among household appliances,  domestic refrigerators and freezers are the 
  number one consumers  of electricity. In the European Community fridges 
  and frezers account for 24 per cent  of domestic energy demand, or 6 per 
  cent  of the total electricity demand.
      </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Energy consumption of an average refrigerator with separate freezer 
  compartment ranges from 600 kWh/year in Europe, to 1310 kWh/year in the 
  USA.  An average refrigerator without freezer compartment consumes in 
  Europe about 350 kWh/year.
      </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  All household fridges and freezers in the world have one thing in 
  common: the Rankine evaporation cooling system (recognizable by the 
  black compressor pot & condenser). The Rankine cycle cooling system is 
  the true barrier to super energy efficient cooling and freezing. 
      </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The Stirling cycle cooler is a free piston, linear motor driven device. 
  The internal runnnig surfaces are supported by gas bearing, so no 
  contact wear takes place. The entire unit is hermetically sealed. It is 
  capable of continuous modulation and of maintaining high efficiencies 
  down to very low lifts. This means that it adopts easily to cooling 
  needs and keeps performing with high efficiency even at low demand. 
      </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The performance of the Stirling cycle cooling motor is on average about 
  two to three times more efficient than the Rankine machine.  According 
  to Sunpower  , the developers of Stirling cycle,  the Stirling cycle 
  compressor is a "drop-in" replacement for conventional compressors in 
  domestic and commercial refrigerators, air conditioners and heat pumps.
      </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  An additional attractive feature of the Stirling cycle 
  refrigerator/freezer is that it can be powered by a solar power.
      </P>
<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Stirling cycle refrigerators are not yet available on a mass production 
  level. They may well represent the future direction towards a super 
  efficient, solar powered refrigerator.

  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The most common form of refrigeration in supermarkets has been the 
  direct expansion system, whereby a refrigerant, usually CFCs or HCFCs, 
  circulates throughout the store in a long network of pipes, connected to 
  refrigeration units.
  </P>

  Demand for CFCs and HCFCs is mostly to top up leaking systems. Leaking 
  gases obviously go straight into the atmosphere and cause damage.  Most 
  refrigeration systems, if not all, that contain CFCs and HCFCs leak. The 
  total amount of gases in refrigeration equipment is called the bank, and 
  the average leakage rate for all systems is at the rate of 20 per cent  
  of the bank every year. Supermarkets leak at double this rate. This is 
  due to such factors as poor design, installation and maintenance, leaky 
  pipes and components. Each  store may have up to two miles of pipes 
  containing harmful gases, making it very difficult to get at the source 
  of the leaks. In practice many systems leak at higher rates than this, 
  and some stores have catastrophic failures, where the whole charge leaks 
  in one go.
    </P>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  As a result of the 1996 ban on production of CFCs in industrialized 
  countries  all supermarket chains are now engaged in a process of 
  change. Many plan to replace CFCs with other damaging products from the 
  chemical industry -- hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)  and  
  hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).  As explained above, these substances are 
  environmentally  unacceptable alternatives to CFCs.  </P>

<H3>2.2.2  Supermarkets Do Have a Choice : Secondary Cooling Systems</H3>

<P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  But supermarkets do have a choice. There are alternative refrigeration 
  systems available which  are environmentally much more responsible, 
  technically proven, and commercially available. 
  </P>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Numerous environmentally concerned supermarkets throughout Europe have 
  already installed  HCFC and HFC-free 'Greenfreeze'  technologies, using 
  secondary cooling systems for both chilling and  freezing capacity.  In 
  some locations, although HFCs have not been completely eliminated,  the 
  volume of HFCs used has been significantly reduced with the installation 
  of a secondary cooling system. 
   </P>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Secondary cooling systems use coolants such as water, brine, glycols,  
  silicon oils,  or  binary ice to circulate through the refrigeration 
  cabinets. The coolant itself is chilled, through a heat exchanger by a 
  primary refrigeration circuit using ammonia or hydrocarbons.  
   </P>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  This means that there is no longer the need to circulate a primary 
  coolant, such as CFCs or HCFCs throughout the store and the volume of 
  primary coolant needed is significantly reduced. The primary circuit is 
  usually located in a safely isolated  plant room in the back of the 
  store.
   </P>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The ideal secondary coolant will have: (a) constant temperature to give 

  even cooling in a long circuit; (b) good heat transfer properties for 
  energy efficiency; (c) high energy density to reduce coolant volume; (d) 
  low cost and easy maintenance; (e) no  adverse environmental impacts. 
   </P>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  A new product, marketed under the trademark  Flo-Ice  by Integral 
  Technologie GmbH of Germany  , reportedly meets these requirements by 
  using a suspension of small ice-crystals in a water/ethanol mixture as 
  the secondary coolant.  Integral has Flo-Ice technology partners in  
  Germany, Holland, Luxembourg, France, Norway and Switzerland.
   </P>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The Danish company Danfoss  and the Danish Technological Institute   are 
  both actively engaged in the development of secondary refrigerants and 
  indirect refrigeration systems. 
   </P>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">

  There is a rapidly growing list of environmentally conscious 
  supermarkets in Europe  that have already installed or are in the 
  process of installing  secondary cooling refrigeration.  These include  
  Migros Stores (Switzerland); Sainsburys , Marks & Spencers (UK);  Match, 
  Cactus, Knauf (Luxembourg); Obs! (Norway); Grosso, Edeka (Germany);  
  ADEG, KGM, (Austria); Albert Heijn Store (Holland). 
   </P>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Suppliers of secondary cooling equipment are widespread in Europe and 
  North America. <!--(see Appendix A for partial list of European suppliers.)-->
   </P>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The decision supermarkets now face  will have long term implications for 
  their shareholders, customers, the environment and future generations.  
  It is in the financial interest of shareholders that supermarkets invest 
  in technologies that are environmentally sustainable. HCFC and  HFC 
  technologies are harmful to the environment. They are therefore obsolete 
  and a bad investment.  Environmentally alert customers  will want to be 
  assured that their favourite supermarkets use  environmentally 
  responsible technologies. Investing in environmentally safer secondary 
  cooling systems therefore makes good business sense.

  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  
  The Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI) rating measures the 
  efficiency  of a refrigerant by combining its  direct and indirect 
  global warming contribution. Direct contribution is the Global Warming 
  Potential (GWP) of a substance leaked into the atmosphere, compared to 
  the GWP of CO2. The indirect contribution is the greenhouse effect 
  generated by the electricity needed to run an appliance during its 
  lifetime.  
  </P>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  It is well known that the GWP of hydrocarbons is insignificant compared 
  to the high GWP of HFCs and  HCFCs. The producers of HFCs dismiss the 
  high global warming potential of their products by claiming that in 
  optimized equipment the TEWI of HFCs is lower than that of natural 
  refrigerants, such as hydrocarbons.  This claim is incorrect.  In both 
  domestic and commercial refrigeration  the TEWI  of HFC-134a, for 
  example,  is actually higher than its natural refrigerant alternatives.

  than those using CFC-12. " <A HREF="#f1">*</A>

<H3>Case Study:  UK Companies Blaze A Trail With Hydrocarbon Refrigeration</H3>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  In 1994, Calor Gas (UK)  introduced a line of hydrocarbon refrigerants 
  as direct, drop-in replacements for CFCs and HCFCs, under the brand name 
  CARE.   Calor now manufactures four refrigerant grade hydrocarbons: 
  </P>
  <UL>
  <LI>Care 10 - Isobutane.
  <LI>Care 30 - Blend of propane and isobutane, replacement for R-12 (drop 
  in).
  <LI>Care 40 - Propane (R-290), replacement for R-22, R-502 (not drop in).
  <LI>Care 50 - Blend of Propane and Ethane. Replacement for R22, R-502 (drop 
  in).
   </UL>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Calor Gas runs free training courses on the safe storage and handling of 
  their refrigerants,  which around 1000 contractors have taken in the UK. 
  They distribute their gases through a national refrigerant wholesaler 
  (HRP) and will only sell them to contractors who have been on one of 
  theirhandling courses.
  </P>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Calor will also give technical support on the use of HC refrigerants in 
  the production process and are producing a publication  "Guidelines for 
  the Safe use of Care Refrigerants in Appliance Manufacture",   which 
  should be available shortly. 
    </P>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  According to Mr. Paul Blacklock, General Manager of Calor Gas 
  Refrigeration, commercial refrigeration and air conditioning equipment 
  manufacturers are chosing HC refrigerants as much for "their economic 
  and commercial advantages as their environmental benefits."
    </P>
  <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Examples of UK companies working with hydrocarbon refrigerants in 
  commercial refrigeration and air conditioning  :
  <UL>
  
   <LI TYPE=SQUARE> <B>George Barker & Co (Leeds) Ltd</B>   : Manufacturer of integral and 
  indirect display cases mainly for food and beverages. They have been in 
  the business for 60 years and supply all the main UK retailers. They 
  will have three models of display case with integral compressors on the 
  market by the start of 1996. Four feet (1260mm), five feet (1565mm) and 
  six feet (1870mm) versions with display areas from 1.43m2 to 2.18m2. 
  They have used the CFC-12 replacement brand Care 30 for over a year now 
  and have been testing theHCFC22/R-502 replacements Care 40 and 50 which 
  show even better efficiency.  According to a Calor communiqu, "during 
  trials of Calor Gas CARE refrigerants, Barkers reported energy savings 
  of up to 17 per cent. 
  <P>
  They are also testing  some secondary refrigerants for use with indirect 
  systems.
   </P>
   <LI TYPE=SQUARE> <B>IMI Air Conditioning Ltd.</B>: Manufacturer of packaged air 
  conditioning units. From 1 January 1996 they will be offering their  
  impact  range of wall mounted air conditioning units with Care 50 (a 
  blend of propane and ethane). This covers a range of 2 kW to 10 kW 
  cooling duty.
   <P>
  Later in 1996 they will also be offering a heat pump ventilation unit 
  and a range of chillers (12 - 45 kW) with Care 50.

    <P>
  <LI TYPE=SQUARE> <B>Eaton Williams Group</B>: Manufacturer of packaged air conditioning 
  equipment. Are offering their through the wall  QPM II  range (which 
  have a cooling capacity of 3.4 to 5 kW and aheating capacity of 3.6 to 
  5.3 kW). They specialise in refurbishment contracts, particularly hotels 
  and offices, where they can match the profile of the existing equipment 
  installed.

  occupied by London Transport) office buildings of 500m2 and 1000m2 with 
  cooling loads of 45kW and 85kW respectively have had chillers installed 
  that run on Care 50. The consultants (Troup, Bywaters and Anders  ) used 
  three HCFC-22 rotary scroll type compressors with standard air cooled 
  condensers which complied with the onerous noise and appearance 
  constraints for the area. Two of the machines were used for the 1000m2 
  building and one for the 500m2 building. Each chiller was charged with 
  less than 10kg of Care 50 to comply with BS 4434 1995- the recently 
  adopted safety standards for hydrocarbon refrigerants in the UK . The 
  compressor manufacturer (Maneurop) provided a warranty for use with Care 
  50 which was critical to the project.

  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Ammonia has been the refrigerant of choice in this sector for many years 
  before the CFC restrictions came into force. The vast majority of US 
  cold stores and over two thirds in Germany are already using ammonia .  
  The technical feasibility and commercial availability of ammonia is well 
  demonstrated. Almost all of Nestle's systems worldwide are now running 
  on ammonia. Unilever has made a complete switch to ammonia, as has Ciba

  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Approximately 50 per cent of HFC-134a production is for automotive air

     <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  <A NAME="r1n2">Car</A> air conditioning systems  require a relatively large volume of 
  refrigerant charge, and since the systems regularly leak, they need 
  constant recharging.   Approximately "65per cent of the cooling agent in  
  mobile  air conditioning leaks away unavoidably." <A HREF="#f1">*</A>  Refrigerant loss in 
  a typical car air-conditioning unit occurs within two to five years, and 
  on average, when a car is brought in to a garage for A/C service, only 
  about 40 per cent of the original 2kg charge is left. <A HREF="#f2">**</A>  This 
  guarantees on-going business for the refrigerant suppliers. Little 
  wonder that the chemical industry views the possibility of an 
  alternative technology penetrating the mobile air-conditioning market 
  with a great degree of trepidation. 
     </P>
     <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  A major obstacle to environmentally safer technologies penetrating the 
  automobile air conditioning market is that during the past few years 
  many of the major car manufacturers have already invested  into 
  converting to  HFC-134a .  Clearly, from an environmental perspective, 
  this has been a bad  decision, which needs to be quickly rectified by 
  these companies switching to safer technologies. 
     </P>
     <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Mobile hydrocarbon air conditioning is  feasible, and has been used in 
  the UK, US and Australia. The technical requirements of mobile air 
  conditioning are slightly different from that for static systems.  
  Different compressor and flexibility of piping is required. 
  Nevertheless,  with established refrigerants like ammonia and 
  hydrocarbons the technical problems are less of a barrier to the 
  development of safer alternatives then are the regulatory measures, 
  insurance and safety concerns,  and consumer acceptability.

     <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  There are a number of advantages to hydrocarbons in mobile 
  air-conditioning. It  is significantly (75per cent) cheaper to change 
  over from CFCs to propane/butane than changing to HFC 134a.   $50.00 per 
  vehicle with hydrocarbons, compared to $200 with HFC 134a.  The amount 
  of refrigerant charge using hydrocarbons is less than half required with 
  CFCs and HFCs. Hydrocarbons increase the cooling capacity of the system 
  by about 10 per cent and have fewer toxic combustion products than 
  CFC-12 and HFC-134a.

  Calor Gas has recently completed a risk assessment using their 
  hydrocarbon (CARE) products in mobile-airconditioning, and is presently 
  conducting field-tests.

<H3>2.6  Safety Concerns Regarding Hydrocarbons And Ammonia In Cooling 
  Systems</H3>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Hydrocarbons are highly flammable. Fortunately, the technology and the 
  expertise in working with flammable substances is readily available in 
  most parts of the world.  The safety precautions required during the 
  cyclopentane foaming production, or hydrocarbon refrigerant charging,  
  are common knowledge and easily achievable through adequate safety 
  measures.
  </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  <A NAME="r1">Hydrocarbon</A> refrigerators are relatively new on the market. Initially, a 
  large portion of the  production costs  were related to safety measures 
  and  the high costs of charging stations. Today, there is a second 
  generation of charging stations on the market, developed by the Danish 
  company A'Gramkow the world's largest producer of charging equipment for 
  hydrocarbons for the refrigeration industry.  This new generation of 
  charging stations for hydrocarbons  is considerably cheaper than earlier 
  systems, without relaxing the safety requirements. <A HREF="#f1">*</A>  
    </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Safety concerns with respect to hydrocarbons in domestic fridges can be 
  dramatically overstated and appear to be raised mainly by HFC producers. 
  The charge in a domestic fridge is between 30 to 80 g, depending on 
  size,  and even if the hermetically sealed system were to leak,  a 
  significant portion of  this charge would remain dissolved in the 
  mineral oil. 
    </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The German Safety and Standards Institution (TUV) has approved 
  'Greenfreeze' models as "safe and tested" and states that as a result of 
  their tests that "there are no dangers in the use, transport, and 
  storage of the refrigerator due to the use of liquid gas as a cooling 
  agent" and that "explosion of propane butane inside the refrigeratorcan 
  be practically excluded". Researchers at the Institute of Thermal 
  Engineering at Graz Technical University in Austria stated that 
  "changing from CFCs and HCFCs to flammable refrigerants like propane is 
  in fact not a problem of technology, it is mainly a problem of 
  regulations". 
       </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  A recently revised British Standard allows use of up to 1.5 Kg of 
  hydrocarbons in sealed systems in any public area.  Up to 10 Kg is 
  allowed in commercial and office spaces, and 25 Kg on industrial sites. 
  Upcoming changes in European Standard will increase the volume of 
  hydrocarbon refrigerant approved to be used, most likely along the lines 
  of the new British Standard. 
     </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  In the US, the Underwriters Laboratory  has approved the  use of  up to 
  115g of "higher inflammability"  refrigerants such as propane.  UL has 
  also approved the use of cyclopentane for  foam insulation in a domestic 
  fridge.  Use of hydrocarbons for automobile air conditioning in the US 
  currently requires an approval under the Significant New Alternatives

  <A NAME="r2">The</A> safety of hydrocarbon refrigeration results from the relative low

  represents a greater risk. An Australian study to "Measure the Insurance 
  Risk of Hydrocarbon Refrigerants in Motor Cars" found that "only 40 per 
  cent of the mass [of hydrocarbons] is required compared to R12 or 
  R134a....[For] a  medium sized Australian car the charge of hydrocarbon 
  is about 300g (10.6 oz.) the same as a large aerosol can." Furthermore, 
  the study concludes that "changing from R12 to saturated [hydrocarbon]

  Mayekawa in Japan, manufacturers of  equipment for ammonia systems have 
  produced new large scale systems ( Mycom range) with a  guarantee of 
  virtually zero leakage. These systems have been in production for 
  several years.

<H3>2. 7  Luxembourg : The First European Greenfreeze Country</H3>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Luxembourg's ozone protection legislation is an example of  progressive 
  environmental initiative. 
  </P>
     <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  On May 9, 1990 Luxembourg passed a law which is the framework for the 
  Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Instead of regulating dangerous 
  chemicals 'one-by-one' the Luxembourg law uses the EIA to achieve  
  environmental protection with the least legislative efforts. As it 
  demands "Best Available Technology" (BAT), a standard, which can be 
  upgraded when needed, the appropriate law is very flexible and quick and 
  therefore effective in regulating chemicals, in this case HCFC/HFCs.
    </P>
     <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  CFC/HCFC/HFC technologies are  not regarded as the "Best Available 
  Technologies" and are not accepted under the compulsory Environmental 
  Impact Assessment. The Luxembourg authorities base their ban on ozone 
  depleting and climate destroying chemicals on very simple arguments, 
  such as,  CFC/HCFC/HFC-technologies create toxic waste, they have toxic 
  by-products in case of fire,  and  sooner or later they  become waste 
  which can not be disposed in an environmentally sound manner. 
    </P>
     <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Environmentally better technologies are being used to replace them. 
  These include ammonia or hydrocarbon based adsorption systems for 
  air-conditioning,  and secondary cooling systems for commercial 
  refrigeration  in supermarkets. What system is applied in each case 
  depends on the actual circumstances.  Existing CFC-containing  systems 
  are being replaced  by HCFC and HFC-free  cooling alternatives in  
  supermarket refrigeration, office building air conditioning and 
  industries (from small enterprises up the large steel industry).
  <P>
  Examples of where this law has been applied include:
  </P>
  <UL>
<LI>The nine new electro steel mills of 'ARBED' which now use ammonia air 
  conditioning systems.
   <LI>The air condition of the headquarters of the Luxembourg "Banque 
  Generale".
    <LI>Numerous supermarkets in Luxembourg:  'Cactus' stores in Bereldange 
  and Esch; 'Match' stores in Diekirchen, Mersch; 'Bel Etoile' store in 
  Strassen; and 'Topas' store in the city of Luxembourg.
    <LI>"City Center Project": A huge multiple use center in downtown 
  Luxembourg hosting the 'European Statistical Agency', hotels and a big 
  supermarket.
  </UL>
     </P>
     <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The net result of the application of the EIA is that no new cooling 
  systems using CFCs, HCFCs or HFCS are being permitted anymore in 
  Luxembourg!

  Positive Government Intervention In The Market Place :  A Case Study</H3>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The Danish Environmental Protection Agency (DEPA) has played an active 
  role in encouraging Danish industry to convert to ozone and climate 
  friendly technologies through a three pronged  phasing-out strategy 
  consisting of : a tax on CFC and halon, a statutory order gradually 
  banning the use of ODS for specific purposes and a development programme 
  to support non-ODS technology.
  </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  <A NAME="r1n2">The Danish</A> EPA has recently (1995) published two most informative 
  manuscripts,  "Polyurethane Foam Without Ozone Depleting Substances" <A HREF="#f1">*</A> 
  and "Going Towards Natural Refrigerants" <A HREF="#f2">**</A> which detail how Danish 
  industry is moving towards ozone and climate friendly technologies in 
  refrigeration and polyurethane foam production. 
  </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The _Danish EPA reports summarize: 
  </P>
  </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  " The interest for natural refrigerants has been increasing during the 
  last couple of years and in Denmark a lot of activities take place to 
  develop new technology which implies ammonia, hydrocarbons, water and 
  C02.
  </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  New products have been marketed like small ammonia refrigeration units, 
  filling stations for hydrocarbon refrigerants, water compression 
  refrigeration units, etc.
  </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The Danish EPA is of the opinion that "Natural Refrigerants" will take a 
  stronger position in the future, and this development will make it 
  possible to reduce the consumption of ozone depleting refrigerants and 
  refrigerants which are potent climate gases. It is, however, essential 
  that this development causes refrigeration units which do not use more 
  energy. Examples in this report show that this is possible.
  </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Traditionally Danish industry has a high production of polyurethane foam 
  due to the substantial production and export of products like domestic 
  refrigerators and freezers, district heating pipes, jointing foam, 
  sandwich insulation panels etc.
  </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Experience from Danish industrial projects shows that it is possible to 
  produce many kinds of polyurethane foam without ozone depleting 
  substances or substances contributing significantly to global warming."

       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  More than half of the world production of preinsulated district heating

  C Moller), Logstor Ror, Tarco Energy and Starpipe (Dansk Rorindustri).
  </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  As from January 1993 CFC was no longer allowed for the blowing of 
  insulation foam for district heating pipes. HCFC - as a transitional 
  solution - and CO2 have been used instead. Now all four companies have 
  developed systems based on cyclopentane or other hydrocarbons. Two of 
  the companies also continue producing CO2-based pipes.

  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Three companies are producing sandwich panels for building cold stores 
  etc. The companies, DC System Insulation, Dansystem and Hercules changed 
  to HCFC in 1992-93, and they still use HCFC. Some of them are able to 
  produce with CO2, but this results in a slightly poorer insulation 
  value. DC System Insulation is now in a process of changing to pentane 
  as blowing agent and this technology is expected to be fully implemented 
  by the end of 1995.

  stopped, and most of the production was changed to HFC-134a. In 1994 
  isobutane was introduced as a refrigerant within domestic refrigeration 
  in Denmark and the production ratio of units with the hydrocarbon 
  refrigeration system is increasing and is now (medio 1995) about 10per

 <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  <A NAME="r1n2">Eliminating</A> ozone depleting and global warming substances from foam 
  production is of paramount importance, given the large volumes of 
  chemicals involved. The global CFC consumption in the foam sector  in 
  1990 was 174,000 metric tonnes.   The global usage of CFCs in appliance 
  foams in 1990 was 38,000 metric tonnes [approximately 21 percent  of the 
  total CFC used in the foam sector]. <A HREF="#f1">*</A>  In 1991, the Technology and 
  Economic Assessment Panel of the Montreal Protocol, estimated that 
  "...150,000 tonnes of HCFCs a year would be required to achieve a CFC 
  phase out in foam plastics in the developed countries in 1995". <A HREF="#f2">**</A> 
  </P>
  
  <H3> 3.1 Building insulation</H3>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Rigid Polyurethane foam (PUR) is commonly used in construction as an 
  insulating foam. There are a number of different kinds of foam which are 
  all rigid PUR - most noteably, boardstock, sandwich panels and spray 
  foams .
   </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Boardstock is prominently used in roof and wall insulation in commercial 
  buildings. Sandwich panels, where the foam is sandwiched  between facing 
  materials such as steel and aluminium, are used for insulating cold 
  stores, cold rooms and doors. Spray foams are made at the point of use 
  and are literally sprayed into place. They are highly suitable for the 
  insulation of uneven or inaccessible surfaces and are used in storage 
  tanks, pipe work and refrigerated trailers.
     </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Particularly in Europe (see <A HREF="19excuse.html">case study</A>), companies are using  pentane 
  - a hydrocarbon - as an alternative blowing agent for both board stock 
  and sandwich panels. Thanex in Denmark have used a mechanical process 
  for producing PUR insulating foam.  Recticel (Belgium), the largest 
  manufacturer of PUR foams in Europe, and Bayer, have been producing 
  hydrocarbon blown foams for construction applications for a number of 
  years. 
    </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Alternatively, CO2  is currently being used as the blowing agent by ICI 
  and Liquid Polymers Group in the UK,  ResinaChemie and BASF in Germany 
  and Nassau Doors in Denmark. Carbon dioxide blowing,  in combination 
  with process changes, as demonstrated by Windsor Doors in Norway, is a 
  proven technology for spray foams.
    </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
   Often the best alternatives to polyurethane boardstock are not foam at 
  all. Magnesium carbonate, as produced by Darchem in the UK, can be made 
  into an insulation product  for use  in power stations and oil 
  installations. Products such as mineral fibre and fibreboard have always 
  been in competition with polyurethane. Mineral fibre is dominant in 
  insulation products in the UK.  Meanwhile, the Swiss company Isofloc 
  produces boardstock panels made out of cellulose. The panels are made 
  out of recycled materials.
     </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Extruded polystyrene is also used as a rigid boardstock, where its 
  moisture resistance and strength make it suitable for below ground 
  construction insulation , for example, in  foundations.  Dow Chemicals 
  and BASF use carbon dioxide technology to produce extruded polystyrene. 
  The product is sold in many European countries.

<H3>Case Study: Polyurethane Foam - Urepol Oy, Finland.</H3>

       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Urepol Oy is a Finnish company manufacturing polyurethane insulated 
  steel-faced and flexible faced panels, and one-component PUR foam 
  insulation. Ten years ago, when the issue of ozone depletion and the 
  role of the CFCs  first received widespread attention, the company 
  started a research and development program to look for new blowing 
  agents. The research intensified as the phase out of  CFCs and the  
  market opportunities for environmentally safer products, especially in 
  neighbouring Sweden, became apparent.  After an initial conversion to 
  HCFCs from CFCs, the search for a safer alternative soon focused on 
  hydrocarbon blowing agents 
   </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The process of introducing hydrocarbons into the commercial arena 
  required several years of research, development and testing.  
  Manufacturing equipment had to be redesigned  and changes needed to be 
  made in safety procedures.
 </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The conversion was not without problems. While the company was familiar 
  with fluorocarbon gases,  there was little information on the physical 
  properties and behaviour of the hydrocarbon gases when used as blowing 
  agents in end products like faced panels.  The company learned as it 
  went along in the development process. A large part of the additional 
  investment of over $1 million was needed to install adequate safety 
  procedures and equipment.  Commercial production of the foams had to 
  wait for approval from the Finnish Technical Inspection Centre,  which 
  was granted in April, 1994.
    </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Both insulation foam and the faced insulating panels are blown with 
  hydrocarbons. The faced panels are produced with pentane, and the 
  one-component insulation foam is  blown with a propane/butane mix. 
  Urepol Oy was the first company in Europe to use pentane as a blowing 
  agent in the production of steel- faced polyurethane insulated panels.
    </P>
       <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Urepol Oy's manufacturing processes have now been CFC and HCFC free for 
  over a year. The changes have proven to be productive as the company now 
  has a very large marketbase in Sweden, and its international market 
  share has expanded since 1990.
    </P>
       <P>

  Urepol Oy now firmly believes that in the development of new products  
  environmental factors are crucial to competitive success .

<H3>3.2 Appliance Insulation</H3>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  <A NAME="r1">Rigid</A> polyurethane (PUR) foams continue to be the dominant insulation 
  used in domestic refrigerator-freezers. It is estimated that 
  approximately 75-80 per cent  is used in refrigerator-freezers and the 
  remaining 20-25 per cent  is used in other appliances such as display 
  cabinets, water heaters, portable coolers, commercial appliances and 
  vending machines...." <A HREF="#f1">*</A> 
  </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  <A NAME="r2">Until</A> recently,  primarily CFC-11 has been used to to produce PUR foams 
  for appliances. The total amount of CFC-11 used for the manufacture of 
  polyurethane insulating foam in the refrigerator and freezer industry 
  was approximately 16,000 tonnes in 1994. <A HREF="#f2">**</A>
    </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
   <A NAME="r3n4">Since</A> the domestic refrigerator-freezers manufacturing industry expects 
  to complete transition from CFCs (in industrialized countries) in 1995 
  making the right choice for an alternative blowing agent is all the more 
  pressing. <A HREF="#f3">***</A>   Today there are only two serious contenders being 
  considered by those moving to CFC-free foam blowing: HCFC-141b and 
  (cyclo) pentane. <A HREF="#f4">****</A> However, HCFC-141b is not only destructive to the 
  ozone layer, but is also a potent global warming susbstance. It is 
  therefore not an acceptable alternative to CFCs.
    </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  <A NAME="r5">Cyclopentane</A> has proven to be the optimal replacement for CFCs. It is 
  already in wide use
  in Europe. From an efficiency point of view cyclopentane blown foams 
  have been found to perform better than even  CFC-11 blown foams.  As the 
  1994 UNEP report on the "Elimination of CFC from Domestic Refrigeration 
  Manufacture"  states:  " Insulating properties of cyclopentane do not 
  deteriorate with time as fast as do those of CFC-11 blown foam.  In a 
  standard test cyclopentane foam and CFC-11 foam may both have initial 
  values of 19 mW/mK. With a few days or weeks of aging cut samples at 60 
  degrees C or 70 degrees C, the CFC-11 foam will have deteriorated to be 
  worse than the cyclopentane foam. Its final value may be 2 or 3 mW/mK 
  worse than the cyclopentane version." <A HREF="#f5">*****</A>
    </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  In the Nordic region, a major area of manufacture of PUR foam, 
  conversion to pentane-blowing  is almost complete. For example, both 
  Electrolux and Vestfrost in Denmark have eliminated the use 
  fluorocarbons for this purpose. 
    </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  Major refrigerator manufacturers in Japan, such as Matsushita, Sharp and 
  Sanyo are insulating some of their models with foam blown by 
  cyclopentane.  Most of the major refrigerator manufacturers in Europe, 
  as mentioned above, have now converted to using only cyclopentane blown 
  foams.
    </P>
   <P> 
  <B>Vacuum Panels</B>
     </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  As an alternative to polyurethane foam, vacuum panels are able to act as 
  an appliance insulant. These vacuum panels are filled with  silica or 
  fibreglass, or ceramic spacers. Degussa in Germany are developing this 
  product and the panels, which are manufactured in collaboration with 
  Electrolux Sweden,  have already been used in certain applications.   
  Vacuum panels in appliances are used by General Electric and 
  Owens-Corning in the USA. In Japan, Sharp  combines the use of vacuum 
  panels with PUR foam blown with cyclopentane in domestic refrigerators.  
  AEG in Germany has introduced some vacuum panel insulated fridges. 
    </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  It is likely that more widespread use of the panels will occur as higher 
  standards of energy efficiency become mandatory.
    </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif">
  The Swiss Ecofridge Project uses vacuum insulation, where the vacuum is 
  filled with diathomaceous Earth. The thermal conductivity is about 0.005  
  compared with 0.020 in conventional refrigerator insulation.

<H2>4.  Case Study: CFCS In Asthma Sprays In Germany</H2>
  <HR WIDTH=100%>
  <HR ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=30%>
 <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif"> 
  Asthma sprays filled in Germany significantly contribute to the 
  destruction of the ozone layer,  with the equivalent of 1,000 tonnes of 
  CFC-11 in terms of their ODP (38 per cent of the country's share). 
  </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif"> 
  Paradoxically, the health system thus contributes almost as much to  
  ozone depletion, and the consequent increases in health threating UV-B 
  radiation exposure, as the entire refrigeration and air-conditioning 
  industry,   and far more than then production of insulating foams  in 
  the construction industry. 
  </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif"> 
  Pharmaceutical giants like Glaxo and Boehringer-Igelheim have chosen to 
  move away from CFCs by switching to HFC-134a or HFC-227. These 
  propellants are powerful greenhouse gases.  It is estimated that if all 
  asthma sprays filled in this country were converted to using HFC-134a as 
  a propellant, their emissions would be equivalent to 2.5 times the 
  greenhouse effect of the annual emissions of all fifty German 
  incineration plants for domestic waste.
  </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif"> 
  Fortunately there is a solution available in the treatment of asthma 
  which is not damaging to the ozone layer or the climate. The substances 
  which asthma sufferers need to propel into their bronchial tubes can be 
  inhaled just as easily, if not better in many cases, in powdered form. 
  New, easy and safe-to-use powder appliances are said by German 
  pneumologists to be equivalent to CFC-propelled sprays in terms of their 
  medical effect. Orion Pharma (Germany) will have completely switched 
  their whole range of asthma sprays to CFC/HFC free methods.

  Greenfreeze, hydrocarbon based technology, has now become the standard 
  for domestic refrigeration in Europe, and is rapidly spreading to other 
  parts of the world, such as China, Australia, Latin America.
  </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif"> 
  Stirling cycle is another promising technology for domestic

  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif"> 
  Gas-fired absorption refrigeration using water and lithium bromide is 
  well developed in Japan.  Absorption systems based on zeolite will be 
  the method of refrigeration in the next generation of German Intercity

   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif"> 
  Portable hydrocarbon air-conditioners are now on the market in Europe.

  Evaporative water coolers are one of several alternatives to current 
  models of refrigerators and air conditioners. In the United   States 
  more than 70 companies manufacture evaporative air conditioners for 
  residential, automotive, commercial and industrial   markets. 
    </P>

  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif"> 
  <A NAME="r1">The</A> world has limited resources, and as the  United Nations Environment 
  Program (UNEP) 1992 Technology and Economic  Assessment Panel stated, 
  "the development of technologies which do not use either controlled or 
  transitional substances can be inhibited because the prospect of 
  technology using transitional substances discourages investment in 
  technology that would only be profitable if transitional substances were 
  not acceptable."<A HREF="#f1">*</A>  Simply stated,  this means that the production and 
  promotion of HCFCs and HFCs hinders the transition to safer 
  alternatives.
  </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif"> 
  Clearly, environmentally safer alternatives to fluorocarbons exist for 
  virtually every application of ozone depleting substances. It is 
  possible to meet human needs and protect the ozone layer and the global 
  climate at the same time.  
   </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif"> 
  The world desperately needs positive action on the part of governments 
  to immediately phase-out all ozone depleting and climate damaging 
  substances  such as HCFCs and HFCs and to remove regulatory barriers 
  which hinder the development and wide scale use of environmentally safer 
  alternatives.  
   </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif"> 
  The world also needs the vision, inovation and leadership of industry in 
  the further development of environmentally sound technologies. Some 
  branches of industry, and some companies that have seized the 
  opportunities presented  by environmental necessities, have made major 
  steps in the right direction.  On the whole, however, we still have a 
  long way to go. 
   </P>
   <P> 
  <IMG HSPACE=5 SRC="pixel.gif"> 
  Industry needs vigorous stimulus from  governments to rapidly convert to 
  ozone  and climate friendly technologies. A strong political signal,  
  significantly speeding up the phase-out of all ozone depleting 
  substances, is immediately needed from the Parties to the Montreal 
  Protocol.

It is published here with the permission of the author.</I></P> <H2>EDUCATING THE MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITIES  ABOUT THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND HUMAN HEALTH</H2><H3>Introduction</H3><P>I would like to congratulate the National Science and Technology Council and the Institute of Medicine for holding this conference, which I hope will be a watershed both for physician and other health professional involvement in the issues of climate change and ozone depletion, and for a wider understanding of the potential human health consequences of global environmental change.</P><P>In the early l980's, it was stated U.S. government policy that if necessary we would fight and win a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, protecting our people by relocating them to the countryside where they would make shelters to defend themselves against a nuclear attack.  </P><P>In retrospect, looking back l3 years or so, these policies may seem incredible, but at the time, though they were challenged overwhelmingly by consensus scientific opinion, including by the government's own scientists, they were largely unquestioned by policy-makers and the public.</P><P>How could this have occurred?  How could people have gone along, knowing intuitively, as I believe they did, that these policies made little sense?</P><P>Of course, our fear of the Soviet Union and its own nuclear capability was the underlying reason, but the public's general acceptance then  of the nuclear arms race and of the possibility of using these weapons was made possible by four features that characterized how people dealt with the threat of nuclear war.  </P><P>#l.  that the subject was highly technical and complex and therefore hard for people to understand,</P><P>#2.  that it was beyond the scope of anyone's experience or imagination, an abstraction that made it hard to consider as a potential reality, </P><P>#3.  that it was terrifying to contemplate death and destruction on such a massive scale, and therefore easy for people to avoid thinking about and to deny as a threat,</P><P>and #4.  that there were people, including some scientists, who were very vocal in their efforts to question the warnings about nuclear war, and who attempted to undermine the credibility of those issuing such warnings--so it was not surprising for the public at times to be confused.   </P><P> The role of physicians and other health professionals--in Physicians for Social Responsibility, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, and other groups--during this period in helping to promote a change in public opinion about nuclear war was crucial.   By talking about what a nuclear war would really mean to the health and lives of people and their children, they were able to translate the abstract, technical science of nuclear weapons into concrete, personal terms that people could relate to and understand.  In this way, they were able to help people overcome some of their avoidance, denial, and confusion and to motivate them to work for the prevention of nuclear war.  </P><P>Now why am I talking about the l980's and nuclear war?</P><P>Because as you have heard today we are now facing what may be a similar threat to human health and life with climate change, ozone depletion, and other forms of global environmental degradation, because there is a profound and fundamental lack of understanding of what scientists are saying about these issues, and an enormous amount of avoidance and denial about the nature and magnitude of this threat for human beings, and because, once again, there is a critically important role to play for physicians and public health professionals.</P><P>Over the last several years, we have been deluged with reports from scientists worldwide, detailing the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and warning us that unless we are able to reduce our emissions of these gases, we are likely to experience major changes in the world's climate, with consequences that could prove disastrous for human beings.  </P><P>And in the last decade, we have witnessed some of the most variable and extreme weather on record, consistent with greenhouse warming predictions, from cyclones in Bangladesh, to tornadoes across the U.S., to record heat and flooding in Europe, to the Mississippi River valley disaster, and to this summer's 5 day heat wave across the plain states, which killed l000's of cattle and hundreds of people, 568 in Chicago alone.</P><P>But despite all these studies; all the warnings by the world's scientific community; despite even the concrete evidence before us that we have changed the composition of the atmosphere and that this change already may be resulting in a warming of the land and the oceans and in unprecedented violent weather patterns, and may be causing harm to plants and animals and to ourselves;  we seem oblivious to the dangers we face, we seem not to understand the urgent need to reduce our production of greenhouse gases and at least slow down this runaway global experiment with life on this planet, the outcome of which no-one can really predict.  </P><P>We seem to be turning away from mass transit, energy conservation, and renewable energy resources, buying more and  more gas guzzling 4 wheel drive jeeps and Land Rovers as if we were about to cross the Serengeti rather than negotiate our way in and out of suburban shopping mall parking lots, burning fossil fuels as if there no tommorrow, acting, as George Kennan said in l98l in reference to the nuclear arms race, "like victims of some sort of hypnotism, like men in a dream, like lemmings heading to the sea."</P><P>How can one explain this?</P><P>I believe the reasons are similar to those which greeted the prospect of nuclear war.  The science of global environmental change is too abstract, technical, and complex for people to comprehend.  The possible scenarios involving heat, flooding, drought, and disease are too frightening, biblical in their proportions, for people to want to think about.  Political leaders, by and large, lack the scientific, and in particular the medical and public health, knowledge that would help them understand the implications of global environmental change for human beings, and therefore many tend not to take the issue terribly seriously.  </P> <P>And there are strong voices, including a few scientists, who dismiss concerns about climate change and even ozone depletion, some clearly motivated by reasonable scientific uncertainties, but many of whom represent vested interests and have tried to undermine the credibility of those in the IPCC, the National Academy of Sciences, and other respected scientists, calling them doomsayers or "chicken littles", and who are often given equal time by the media, as if they represented widely held, equally valid, opposing scientific viewpoints, making it hard for the public to know what or whom to believe.</P><P>But perhaps the most important factor in our failure to grasp the potential dangers we face is the fact that most of us see ourselves as separate from, rather than an integral part of, the environment, that it is something to be conquered or exploited, that we can change the atmosphere and oceans and alter biodiversity in the process without these changes affecting us.</P><P>For all these reasons, ultimately because of this fundamental disconnection between ourselves and the physical and biological worlds in which we live, it is essential that health be at the center of the global environmental debate, and that physicians and other health professionals take the lead in educating the public and informing policy-makers about the human dimensions of global environmental change.  </P><P>But until recently human health has not figured prominently in discussions about the global environment, and the medical and public health communities have not been involved.  As this conference so well illustrates, along with one held last spring by the NIH on Biodiversity and Human Health, and the soon to be released report by the IPCC, this is starting to change.</P><P>In large part, this lack of involvement has resulted from the fact that most physicians and public health professionals have little knowledge of these issues.  With few exceptions, global environmental health is not a part of medical or public health education in the United States.</P><P>Although there have been no formal studies about how the relationship of human health to the global environment is addressed in medical schools and schools of public health, there has been much attention paid to the more general topics of environmental and occupational medicine in medical school curricula.  A brief review of how these subjects have been handled may provide some insights into global environmental health issues, and illustrate how great a task it will be to introduce them into curricula.  </P><P>The IOM, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the ATSDR, the American College of Physicians, and the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine have all called attention to the fact that practicing physicians in the United States do not have the training or experience to identify possible occupationally or environmentally induced illnesses, as they have been inadequately exposed to information about these conditions at every level of their education.  A l99l/92 survey by Jay Burstein and Barry Levy found that while 2/3 or so of U.S. medical schools included occupational medicine in their curricula, the average number of hours devoted to this subject during the entire 4 years of medical school was only 6.  The situation was even worse for internal medicine and family medicine residency programs.</P><P>If this is the state of affairs for occupational and environmental medicine, with their emphases on the direct effects of toxic exposures, a subject that has a long history in traditional medicine, what can we expect for global environmental medicine, which involves such disciplines as atmospheric chemistry and physics,  oceanography, entomology, botany, and ecology, all of which are very foreign to medical education.</P><P>An informal brief interview survey, which I conducted during early August of this year with faculty from 9 U.S. medical schools and 7 schools of public health revealed that the issues of climate change, ozone depletion, and other aspects of global environmental change, if they were mentioned at all, were simply listed among other environmental causes of disease in introductory core courses, usually without significant content, or were covered in electives that were held because of a specific interest by a key faculty member.  Schools of public health were more likely to devote attention to climate change, ozone depletion, and other aspects of global environmental change in their required courses.</P><P>The main source of information and education for health professionals about the global environment has come from the medical and scientific literature and from the efforts of various governmental and non-profit groups.  In the last several years there have been numerous papers, monographs, and books summarizing the potential medical consequences of global environmental change and calling on physicians and public health professionals to become more involved.</P> <P>These include this excellent series in the Lancet, edited by Paul Epstein and David Sharp, our MIT Press book Critical Condition: Human Health and the Environment, which includes chapters on climate change, ozone depletion, world population growth, and biodiversity loss, edited by Mike McCally, Howard Hu, Andy Haines and myself,  (there is a copy on the display table and some order blanks and I must admit that a small fraction of the proceeds of go to the Judah Benjamin Chivian at the University of Colorado education fund.  Others who have published seminal work in this field include Alex Leaf, John Last, Tony McMichael, Jonathan Patz, Chris Cassel, Bob Shope, Larry Kalkstein, Steve Morse, Margaret Kripke, Mary Wilson, Aminikutty Jeevan, Raymond Hayes, Tassir Hussain, Warren Piver, Jay Fouts, Tee Guidotti, Bernie Goldstein, Tony Cortese, Jennifer Leaning, and many others.</P><P>Several non-profit organizations have also played an active role in health professional education, including Physicians for Social Responsibility and its Project on Global Environmental Change and Health, which I direct, which has been in the forefront of educating physicians, public health professionals, environmentalists, and policy-makers on global environmental health issues through conferences such as this one at MIT in l992   and numerous publications, presentations, and briefings; the National Association of Physicians for the Environment, NAPE, organized by John Grupenhoff, which has been highly successful in bringing organized medicine and medical specialty societies into environmental health efforts and has been particularly active in air pollution and biodiversity issues and in promoting the UV index with the National Weather Service, and the Consortium for Environmental Education in Medicine, CEEM  under the leadership of Tony Cortese and Kathy Rest, which has begun to enlist students, faculty and deans at New England medical schools, and ultimately across the country, in the task of integrating environmental health studies, including global environmental health, into medical school curricula.</P><P> The IPCC, WHO, UNEP, the EPA, and in Canada, the Canadian Global Change Program of the Royal Society, have all made major contributions to public understanding about health and global environmental change.</P><H3>What Is To Be Done?</H3><P>The IOM, with the support of the ATSDR, NIOSH, and the EPA just published this superb text, edited by Andrew Pope and David Rall.  Although its focus is almost exclusively on occupational and environmental medicine, it provides an excellent framework for our discussions on how to train physicians and public health professionals about global environmental issues.</P><P>It recommends that all graduating medical students should understand the influence of the environment on human health,</P><P>It discusses the many barriers to introducing environmental medicine into medical school curricula, and most importantly, it presents a comprehensive strategy for integrating environmental health issues into existing courses and clinical rotations, using 56 largely self-instructional case studies.</P><P>Integrating global environmental medicine into medical and public health education will, however, be far, far more difficult.  But I believe  there is no task more important.</P><P>Physicians and other health professionals helped change public opinion about nuclear weapons, a change we see evidence of so clearly today with the massive protests against French nuclear testing.</P><P>They now need in addition to help people understand how climate change, ozone depletion, and other global environmental degradation may threaten their health and lives and those of their children, for it is only then that people will be willing to change their personal behaviors and be motivated to support policies necessary to protect the global environment.</P><P>It is our responsibility--as physicians and public health professionals, as educators, as government leaders and officials, as concerned citizens to find ways to educate the medical and public health communities about global environmental change so they can accomplish this critically important task.</P><P>Thank you.</P><HR WIDTH=94%></BODY></HTML>

Lashof, Natural Resources Defense Council,<BR>(202) 783-7800</B></P><H3>Health Overview</H3><P>Global climate change poses substantial risks to human health. Millions ofpeople could be affected, and the IPCC anticipates that most of the impactswould be adverse. Increases in mortality from heat waves compounded by moresevere urban air pollution are predicted with high confidence. Increases ininfectious diseases, such as malaria and schistosomiasis, arealso predicted with high confidence, due to the geographic spread ofconducive climatic conditions and changes in the lifecycle of diseasevectors and infectious organisms. Finally, other impacts of climate change,such as sea-level rise and increases in drought, would also adverselyaffect public health by increasing hunger in some areas, by damaginginfrastructure and by displacing populations.</P><H3>IPCC Findings</H3><P>     The sustained health of human populations requires the continuedintegrity of Earth s natural systems.  The disturbance, by climate change,of physical systems and of ecosystems wouldtherefore pose risks to human health.</P><H3>Heat Stress</H3><P>    Extensive research has shown that heat waves cause excess deaths. TheIPCC predicts, with high confidence, that climate change will causeadditional heat-related deaths and illnesses. Studies in selected cities inNorth America, North Africa, and East Asia indicate that the number couldmore than double by 2050, representing several thousand extra deathsannually in a number of very large cities. Heat-related deaths areconcentrated among vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and the veryyoung, and are mostly associated with preexisting cardiovascular andrespiratory disorders. Poverty and poor housing are exacerbating factors.Although some of the excess deaths recorded during heat waves representindividuals who would have died within a few weeks in the absence of theheat event, this appears to account for only 20 40 percent of the cases.Global warming will also cause some decrease in winter mortality, but theIPCC concludes that overall there is likely to be a net increase inweather-related deaths.</P><P>    The effects of heat are amplified by stagnant air, high humidity andhigh levels of air pollution. As use of coal and oil generally results insignificant emissions of local air pollutants as well as greenhouse gases,high levels of urban air pollution are likely to be associated with globalwarming. Furthermore, higher temperatures directly enhance the chemicalreactions that produce urban smog (i.e., tropospheric ozone).</P><H3>Infectious Diseases</H3><P>    Vector-borne diseases are a major cause of illness and death intropical countries. Rather than being transmitted directly from human tohuman, these diseases are transmitted by insects or other  vectors.Climate is an important determinant of the spread of vector-borne diseases,affecting the distribution of the disease-carrying insects as well as theinfectiousness of the disease itself. The IPCC concluded that  In general,increased warmth and moisture would enhance transmission of these diseases.Vector-borne diseases that the IPCC considers  very likely  or  highlylikely  to be affected by climate change include malaria, schistosomiasis,onchocerciasis (river blindness), dengue, and yellow fever .    Malaria isa central example. Malaria is caused by a parasite (plasmodium) and istransmitted from human to human by mosquito vectors. About 300 million newcases of malaria occur each year. The anopheline mosquitos that are themost important vector for malaria generally require mean wintertemperatures above 60  Fahrenheit (F) to survive.</P><P>Temperatures above 64 F are required for the parasite to be activelyinfectious. Warmer temperature speed up the lifecycle of the parasite andincrease infectiousness. One model reviewed by the IPCC estimates thatglobal warming could increase the potential malaria transmission zone to anarea that includes 60 percent of the world's population, compared to 45percent under current climate conditions This model predicts aclimate-induced increase of  50-80 million cases of malaria annually inresponse to a global mean temperature increase of about 5  degreesFahrenheit.  Although this quantitative result must be viewed cautiously,and does not account for the potential for public health measures tomitigate the impact, it clearly indicates the magnitude of the potentialimpact of climate change on public health.</P><P>Other types of infectious disease could also increase due to climatechange. Warmer temperatures and increased flooding, for example, couldincrease contamination of drinking water, leading to diarrheal anddysentery epidemics. Cholera, in particular, can survive in sea water whensheltered beneath the mucous outer coat of various algae and zooplankton.Increases in coastal algal blooms, which would be promoted by warming,could therefore amplify cholera proliferation and transmission. Finally,public health will also be threatened by the consequence of other adverseeffects of climate change, such as increases in malnutrition in some areas,damages to sanitation infrastructure, and the creation of refugees fromsea-level rise and storm surges.</P><H3>U.S. Impacts</H3><P>More than 500 deaths were caused by an intense heat wave that struck themidwest U.S. during the summer of 1995. Although it is not possible toattribute this (or any other) particular event to global climate change, itis the type of event that is projected to become more frequent due toglobal warming. For example, the IPCC presents results of a study forAtlanta which projects that the number of heat-related deaths wouldincrease from an average of less than 80 per year currently to 150 440 peryear in 2050, depending on the climate change scenario and the ability ofthe population to acclimatize to warmer conditions.</P><P>Global warming could also lead to U.S. outbreaks of infectious diseasesthat are currently confined to more tropical countries. For example, localtransmission of malaria could become possible in much of the U.S. by themiddle of the next century. As travelers already bring several cases ofmalaria into the U.S. each year, local epidemics are possible. despite thestrong public health infrastructure in the U.S. compared to poorercountries. Recently 13 cases of dengue fever have been confirmed in andaround McAllen, Texas. Dengue fever (also called  break bone fever ) istransmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, whose range and infectiousnessdepend strongly on warm temperatures. According the IPCC report, anincrease of  5 7 F in average temperature doubles the rate of transmissionof the dengue virus. Dengue has recently reemerged in Central America andspread in Mexico. Local transmission is suspected in the Texas cases, butis difficult to confirm.</P><HR WIDTH=94%></BODY></HTML>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG SRC="intro.gif" ALT="introduction: Climate change is potentially the biggest threat to the
future of both the human race and the environment.">

 </HEAD>
 <BODY>
 
<P>
 <B><FONT SIZE=+1>The US Vice President, Al Gore, has written a book based on the
 above premise.  The UK Government has sponsored a television
 advertisement warning of 'catastrophic' impacts if nothing is
 done.  And more than 160 governments have signed the Framework
 Convention On Climate Change, which commits them to stabilise
 carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas concentrations in the
 atmosphere at levels that pose no danger.  </B></FONT SIZE>
 
<P>
 A major driving force behind all this concern is an assessment
 by the world's best climate scientists.  In 1988, the United
 Nations established a scientific group - the intergovernmental
 Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - to investigate the science of
 human induced climate change in order to advise world leaders on
 how to deal with the problem.
 <P>

 The IPCC released its first report in May 1990.  The panel
 concluded that human-induced climate change is real and that
 levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are increasing.  The
 main contributor is carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and
 gas.  The report noted that the planet faces probable temperature
 increases unprecedented in human history, but stated that the
 first signs of climate change might not emerge for at least a
 decade.
 
<P>
 Greenpeace has been monitoring scientific and news reports of
 major extreme weather events and natural climate-related
 disasters since the IPCC's first warning in 1990.  Greenpeace
 believes the only conclusion that can be drawn from this
 'catalogue of disasters' is that global warming is now detectable
 and the first impacts of human-induced climate change are in fact
 already being felt.
 <P>

 Climate change means much more than higher temperatures.  It will 
 mean an increase in average global temperatures, but some regions
 will warm more than others, and some may in fact cool.  Impacts
 will vary considerably.  Changing rainfall patterns will bring
 more droughts to some regions but more floods to others.  Many
 plants and animals will face extinction.  Water supplies will
 become less reliable in some regions, particularly in those
 already vulnerable.  There may be more hurricanes in the tropics,
 and more windstorms in Europe.  Entire island countries in the
 Pacific may disappear under the sea.
 
<P>
 Yet if action is taken, unmitigated disaster is not inevitable. 
 We have international political agreement on the need to protect
 the climate - the Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Now
 we must set targets and timetables within that convention to
 reduce emissions.  Solutions to global warming do exist - the
 clean energy alternatives and the energy saving processes only
 require political will to be implemented.
 <P>

<B> We can save the climate - but the longer we delay action, the
 more extreme that action will have to be.</B>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>
 This Greenpeace catalogue of climatic experiences in the period
 since the  release of the first IPCC report provides serious
 cause for alarm.  The first signs of human-induced climate change
 are emerging.
</B></FONT SIZE>
<P>
 
 <B>But does it have to be like this?</B> Clearly if we want to stop
 global warming we must do something to slow emissions of
 greenhouse gases.
 <P>
<B>
 And we do have the capacity - the power- to change.
 </B>
<P>
 But governments must provide the political leadership - at local,
 national and international levels.  They must promote energy
 efficiency and conservation measures, and ensure the development
 and speedy introduction of new clean energy technologies.
 <P>

 We must use less energy and be more efficient in our use.  We
 need stringent efficiency standards for appliances, homes and
 offices, industrial processes and vehicles.  We need more
 renewable energy.  We need more railways and public transport.
 <P>

 At present governments and financial institutions like the World
 Bank continue to favour policies which will only intensify the
 problem of climate change.  They do so with the knowledge that
 there are alternative options available which can reduce our
 addictive reliance on fossil fuels and which would cut our
 emissions of greenhouse gases.
 <P>

 New power stations are being built when efficiency programmes
 would generate more jobs and save money.  New buildings waste
 vast amounts of energy instead of incorporating the latest
 efficient technologies.  New renewable energy technologies are
 being ignored, the victims of a continued dominance of oil, coal
 and gas.  New roads are constructed when investment in railways
 and mass transport systems are far less polluting.
 <P>
<B>
 Greenpeace believes that a future without fossil fuels is
 essential to preserve the environment from the serious risk of
 climate change.  We know real alternatives exist.  If we really
 want to stop global warming we can!

<LI> British scientists warn that changes in ocean

                changes in the world's climate.  Oxford
                University's Dr Peter Killworth suggests there is
                evidence from ice core data that oceans can
                "flip" to completely different states within 50
                years or less.  During this period, the oceans
                lose heat at a dramatic rate.  An enhanced

<TITLE>CTB: bleaching corals</TITLE>
 

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG SRC="coral.gif" ALT="We may be witnessing an early warning of global
changes which should represent a serious concern for mankind. - Dr. T.Goreau
and colleagues, Discovery Bay Marine Laboratory, Jamaica, testifying to
US Senate Committee on Caribbean coral bleaching, October 1990">
</P> 
</HEAD>
<BODY>
 <P>

 <B>Coral reef systems protect coastal areas, in some cases whole
 islands, from the destructive power of the sea and wind, and
 provide a haven for marine life.  Dying corals expose these
 coastal areas to severe  sociol-economic effects.  Whilst corals
 are stressed by pollution and sedimentation, they have indicated
 their particular sensitivity to sudden sea temperature changes. 
 They thrive in waters up to 28 degrees Celsius, but if exposed
 to temperatures just 2 to 3 degrees Celsius higher - even for two
 or three days - the algae are expelled from the coral.
 <P>
 In 1991, leading coral reef expert John Ogden, Director of
 Florida Institute of Oceanography, suggested that nearly every
 reef system in the world was suffering from coral bleaching,
 along the coasts of more than 20 countries, including Australia,
 China, Japan, Panama, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, India,
 Indonesia, Kenya, the Red Sea states, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and
 the Bahamas.
 <P>
 Corals will inevitably be among the first organisms to show the
 consequences of a sustained increase in sea surface temperatures,
 because of the fragile temperature dependence of the tiny algae,
 called zooxanthellae, which live in the coral's cells.  The
 coral's colour and most of its food come from these algae, so
 without them the coral cannot grow.

 A recent United Nations report suggested that global warming
 would reduce global food production, increase prices and cause
 new uncertainties about  food supplies.  Significant declines in
 grain yields are forecast for Africa, tropical Latin America and
 much of India and southeast Asia.  Reduced yields are also
 projected for the USA, Canada, the Middle East, and southern
 Europe.

 Many of our recent severe droughts (and floods) have been linked
 with a unusually prolonged El Nino event, a periodic climatic
 pattern which generally lasts 12 to 18 months and brings warm
 conditions to the eastern Pacific.  Some climate scientists
 believe that El Nino events will become more intense and more
 frequent in a global warming world.

 The best-guess forecast of the IPCC for sea level rise is a
 global average of 3-10 millimetres per year.  As more than 70 per
 cent of the world's population live on coastal plains, the
 potential for massive personal, economic and physical dislocation
 becomes clear - even if sea levels rise only marginally.

 Mangroves (which act as crucial nursery, feeding and spawning
 grounds for coastal fisheries) corals (which protect coastal
 areas from wind and wave erosion) and coastlines will be all
 threatened by even small rises in sea levels.

 Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Ocean island nations are the most
 likely to suffer.

<TITLE>Letter to Clinton</TITLE>
<PRE>
Dear President Clinton,

I write to you because I am deeply concerned about global
warming and climate change. I also write to you because you
are the President of the country that is the  largest
emitter of carbon dioxide in the world. The United States,
with less then 5% of the world's population, produces close
to 25% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. 
Consequently,  the United States not only bears the
greatest degree of responsibility for the environmental
crisis brought about by global warming and climate change,
but is also in a position to take a leadership role in
taking immediate and effective action towards averting this
global catastrophe.

Mr. President, I appeal to you to provide the global
leadership for the early completion of a legally binding
'International CO2 Reduction Protocol';  which would,   at
minimum,  aim to achieve in industrialized countries  a 20
percent reduction of CO2 emissions (from 1990 levels) by
the year 2005. Furthermore, I urge you vigorously advocate
the global transition to the use  of renewable sources of
energy, such as solar power.


As Vice President Al Gore wrote, "if the world is to have
any chance at all of successfully negotiating the
excruciatingly difficult treaties that are now necessary,
the United States will simply have to take a leadership
role."  Unfortunately,  the role the US delegation has been
playing in recent climate negotiations is more reminiscent 
of the obstructive Bush administration which, in the leadup
to the Earth Summit, blocked real progress on the Climate
Convention .

I wish to quote you  more of Vice-President Al Gore's
profound words, because I believe that he speaks for
millions of people around the world who are truly alarmed
about the prospects of an environmental Armageddon brought
about by human caused climate change:

"I have come to believe that we must take bold and
unequivocal action: we must make the rescue of the
environment the central organizing principle for
civilization. Whether we realize it or not, we are now
engaged in an epic battle to right the balance of our
earth, and the tide of this battle will turn only when the
majority of people in the world become sufficiently aroused
by a shared sense  of urgent danger to join an all-out
effort."

"[It] is clear that doubling CO2 will in fact increase
global temperatures and in the process subject us to the
risk of catastrophic changes in global climate patterns....
[The] artificial global warming we are causing threatens
far more than a few degrees added to average temperatures:
it threatens to destroy the climate equilibrium we have
known for the entire history of human civilization. As the
climate pattern begins to change, so too do the movements
of the wind and rain, the floods and droughts, the
grasslands and deserts, the insects and weeds, the feasts
and famines, the seasons of peace and war."

"We are in fact conducting a massive, unprecedented -some
say unethical- experiment. As we contemplate a choice
between adapting to the changes we are causing and
preventing those changes, we should bear in mind that our
choice will bind not only ourselves but our grandchildren
and their grandchildren as well. And of course many of the
changes -such as the predicted extinction of half the
living creatures on earth- would be irreversible."

"We need to act now on the basis of what we know. Some
scientists believe that we are in danger of passing a kind
of point of no return, after which we will have missed the
last good opportunity to solve the problem before it
spirals out of our control. If we choose not to act, will
we indeed pass that point?"


Mr. President, please act now.

Yours truly,

<H2><B><a href="mailto:president@whitehouse.gov">Send it !</A> (But don't forget to sign it !)</B></H2>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Preface</H1>








Greenpeace International commissioned this short study in November 1994 into 
the relationship between climate change and flooding, because of a growing belief 
that the first signs of human induced climate change are becoming evident in 
the global record of temperature, precipitation and related extreme events. The 
results of this study confirm our concerns.
<P>
Summarized in laymen's terms, this study has found:<P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	River flooding is likely to increase with climate change due to the 
enhanced greenhouse effect, owing to a general increase in precipitation 
and to changes in the intensity and duration of extreme rainfall events.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	Global Climate Models (GCMs) all project increases in global 
precipitation as CO2 and other greenhouse gases increase in the 
atmosphere. These models also indicate that the frequency of high 
rainfall events will increase, whenever this aspect of their GCM projections have been studied.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	Observations of precipitation records for the World, Canada, USA and 
Europe, show an increase. The geographical pattern of observed 
precipitation trends is broadly consistent with the projections of climate 
models. Streamflow observations in the USA and Europe also show an 
increase in recent decades that is consistent with GCM projections.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	Particular findings for the USA and Europe include:<P>
		<DD><IMG SRC="gpdotsmsm.gif">	Increasing streamflow trends from 559 gauges in the USA from 
1941-1988 are consistent with the enhanced greenhouse forcing 
hypothesis. Precipitation in Canada and the USA has increased by 
7.6% from 1891-1990. One study, from 14 stations, indicates that the 
daily maximum precipitation intensity increased significantly from 
1916-1985.
		<DD><IMG SRC="gpdotsmsm.gif">	Increasing streamflow trends are evident in North Europe. In Germany 
14 stations indicate that runoff increased significantly over the period 
1931-1988, with runoff values after 1964 being 26% higher than in the 
preceding period. Precipitation increased significantly over this period 
i.e. in Bavaria, 40% between 1960 and 1990. In the Meuse river the 
peak runoff near Maastricht has increased 10-12% since 1911 and the 
wintertime precipitation has increased this century (1911-1993) by 
20% compared to the 1882-1910 period.

<P>

<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	The circumstances immediately prior and during the recent floods 
(1993,1995) in Europe are consistent with the projections of the climate 
models and are indicative of the kinds of events that are likely to 
become more common as the global climate warms. The consistency is in 
several directions, particularly changes to the wintertime weather sys-
tems and increases in amount, intensity and duration of precipitation. 
These record floods, however, are not unique, having occurred once 
before this century, and cannot be directly attributed to the enhanced 
greenhouse effect.
<P>
These latter events highlight the risks associated with increasing concentrations 
of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Greenpeace is not alone in this belief. 
Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, said of the January 1995 
European floods that they "point to a possible global warming". 
<P>
Greenpeace hopes that the results of this study will contribute to two major 
international processes in 1995:
<P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	The First Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change to be held in Berlin, 28 March to 7 April 
is required to review the adequacy of the existing commitments for 
industrialized countries to stabilize their emissions at 1990 levels by the 
year 2000. With the 1994 Report of the IPCC on Radiative Forcing Of 
Climate Change concluding in its work on carbon cycle modelling that 
"perhaps the most important result .... is that stabilization of [global] 
emissions does not lead to stabilization of CO2 concentration", it is clear 
that further emission reductions are essential.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	The IPCC is concluding its Second Assessment Report on Climate Change 
in December 1995 and in the course of this is preparing a report in 
Article 2 of the Climate Convention. This Article states that the 
convention's ultimate objective is to achieve stabilization of greenhouse 
gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent 
dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system" with this 
being "achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to 
adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not 
threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a 
sustainable manner". 
<P>
By demonstrating some of the potential consequences of climate change this 
study provides a powerful incentive for further legally binding commitments to 
reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, which can, over time, stabilize 
greenhouse concentrations at safe levels.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Executive Summary</H1>


Over the last few years we have witnessed a large number of river flooding events, 
in Europe but also on a global scale. These floods and the related damage can be 
attributed to a large extent to the growing exposure of human society and 
infrastructure to extreme weather events. However, there is a notion that also the 
weather itself, the climate, is changing as a result of the enhanced greenhouse 
effect.
<P>
To investigate the possible role of the enhanced greenhouse effect in the recent 
river flooding events, the relevant physical processes have been analysed and an 
extensive literature survey has been carried out. In summary, the following 
conclusions can be drawn:
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	Physical arguments clearly indicate that global warming will cause an 
increase of evaporation from the ocean. Moreover, a warmer atmosphere can 
carry more moisture, which leads to larger amounts of precipitable water. 
Global warming will also induce higher temperature differences between the 
land and sea surfaces, causing an increased transport of precipitable water to 
the continents, and an increase of convectional rainfall. 
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	The general circulation models (GCMs) discussed all indicate an 
intensification of the (global) hydrological cycle as a result of global 
warming. At a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration (expected at 
about 2070) the estimated increase in mean annual global precipitation 
varies from 3 to 15%. The general consensus is that we should expect greater 
amounts of rainfall (10 to 20%) in much of the mid-latitudes during winter 
(i.e. northwest Europe), increases at high latitudes throughout the year, and 
in areas affected by monsoon rainfall (India, Northern Australia). Whenever 
investigated, there is qualitative agreement between most models on a shift 
towards more heavy rainfall events and higher rainfall intensities. Similarly, 
there is consensus that in arid and semi-arid areas (such as Southern Europe 
and North Africa) the amount of rainfall is expected to decrease or remain 
more or less constant.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	Present CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have reached a level of 130% 
as compared to pre-industrial levels and thus, we are one third underway to 
doubling. When equivalent CO2 concentrations are considered, we are even 
halfway to doubling. According to the theory, and given the projections for 
increased rainfall under doubling of CO2 concentrations, we should already 
be experiencing a certain increase in rainfall, say about 1 to 5% in the global 
average, and about 5% in the mid-latitudes (i.e. northwest Europe).
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	Observations of (regional) trends in rainfall are consistent with the GCM 
predictions described above. Some studies show that the evaporation rates 
for different parts of the ocean have increased since the seventies. There is 
observational evidence of more rainfall in northwest Europe. This is due to 
an increase in the frequency of the zonal circulations (leading to more winds 
from the sea), causing wetter and milder winters. At one station in the 
Netherlands, an increase of +5% has been measured over the period 
1961-1990 (compared to 1930-1960). In the United States and in the 
monsoon regions increases in the frequency of heavy rainfall events have also 
been observed.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	The possibility of substantial precipitation changes must be considered as 
realistic. In spite of the uncertainties and the lack of quantitative data we 
are fairly confident that, as a prediction, it is qualitatively correct. Given the 
nature of weather statistics, a small change in the mean weather comes with 
changes in the frequency and magnitude of what we call extreme events.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	Records on recent flooding and on paleoflooding indicate the high sensitivity 
of flood occurrence to changing climate for river basins in the USA and 
Europe. Analyses also indicate that there is no simple proportionality 
between the scale and frequency of floods and climate variations. However, in 
general, increases in precipitation lead to proportionally larger increases in 
runoff.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	Runoff can be considered as the hydrological response of river basins to 
climate conditions. Studies presented here indicate that winter runoff 
responses of alpine and nonalpine-related German river streams have 
increased since 1965 (+26%), and a upward trend in runoff peaks in the 
Meuse (10-12%) after 1911 (compared to the period 1882-1910). Another 
study shows increases in natural streamflows (unaffected by human 
intervention) all over the USA, illustrating that rainfall on this continent has 
indeed increased. This supports the hypothesis that enhanced greenhouse 
forcing produces an enhanced hydrologic cycle.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	Several hydrologic modelling studies indicate that greater precipitation will 
cause higher runoff and an increase in soil moisture, as expected. For the 
Rhine river, it is estimated that a 20% increase in precipitation will double 
the occurrence of what used to be an one-in-two year peak flow event. 
However, it is difficult to distinguish climate-change induced effects in the 
river regimes from changes caused by the natural variability of the climate, 
and various man-made alterations (urbanisation, land use, drainage, 
channelisation, dams etc.). Separating these from other effects can be done 
by modelling, but such studies are currently in a very early stage.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	The recent floods in northwest Europe (1993, 1995), and in the USA (1993) 
were caused primarily by unusually high rainfall amounts in combination 
with a saturation of soil due to preceding rainfall (and, to a lesser extent, 
human interference in the catchment basin). Individual flooding events can 
not be attributed directly to the enhanced greenhouse effect. According to 
the predictions presented above an increase of flooding is what we expect as a 
result of the enhanced greenhouse effect. The recent floods cannot be taken 
as a proof of climate change as the associated rainfall events still fit in the 
natural variability of our climate, and floods of comparable magnitude have 
been observed earlier this century. What can be said is that an increased fre-
quency of unusual amounts of rainfall and floods as we have witnessed over 
the last decade are consistent with the climate model predictions.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	As greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere we should 
expect an increase in rainfall and a (nonproportional) increase in river 
flooding events, in particular in mid-latitude regions in the Northern 
Hemisphere (i.e. northwest Europe, etc.). Given the long lead times of CO2 
build-up in the atmosphere, it is difficult, if not impossible, to prevent (some 
of) the expected increase in river flooding events. What can be done in the 
short term is slowing down climate change by reducing greenhouse emissions. 
In the longer term, such a (preventive) strategy can be aimed at stabilising  
greenhouse gas concentrations, and thus decreasing the risk of a potential 
destabilisation of the climate system.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>1. General Introduction</H1>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

					<H2>1.1.	Introduction</H2>

Physical arguments, as well as general circulation models (GCMs), suggest that 
significant changes in global precipitation will occur as a result of global 
warming (IPCC, 1990; 1992). Changes in patterns, intensity and frequency of 
rainfall on the global and regional scale should be expected.
<P>
Depending on the rate and magnitude of climate change, the increasing rainfall 
may seriously affect society. For instance, the normal conveyance of rainwater to 
rivers or brooks will change. Higher precipitation intensity leads to faster 
saturation of the soils, and increases in runoff volumes. In combination with a 
decrease of the buffering capacities (channelisation due to deforestation, 
urbanisation, draining wetlands, etc.), higher peak water levels can be expected, 
with an increase in the frequency of flooding events. 
<P>
Water-related disasters, i.e. floods and droughts, are known to cause devastating 
death tolls, suffering and economic damages. Due to these implications, the 
topic of extreme hydrological events has drawn increasing attention in the 
literature. Compare, for example, the coverage in the IPCC report of 1990 with 
that of its supplement (1992), and with the agenda of the forthcoming IPCC 1995 
report. The purpose of the present literature review is to reveal state-of-the-art 
knowledge on whether and how extreme events in precipitation will affect river 
regimes and flooding frequencies. An extreme weather event can be defined as an 
event sufficiently anomalous, in comparison with the mean weather, to cause 
substantial socio-economic damage (Tol et al., 1994). Clearly, the impact of a 
rainfall event depends on its characteristics (such as geographical pattern, total 
amount, duration, intensity, etc.) in relation to the responding ability of the 
area (location, size, soil type etc.) affected. 
<P>
In the following, a review of recent literature in relation to possible changes in 
flooding patterns is given. After an introduction of the characteristics of the 
climate models, predictions on (extreme) rainfall are compared with 
meteorological observations (global and regional scale), and investigated for their 
implications on flooding behaviour. The review starts with a concise discussion 
of the origins of flooding, and of the mechanisms leading to rainfall and possible 
changes therein.

<H2>1.2.	Origins of flooding</H2>

<H3>1.2.1.	Hydrological aspects</H3>
The driving force in a hydrological cycle is the radiant 
energy from the sun. Heating of the sea surfaces causes evaporation. Eventually, 
the water vapour changes back to the liquid state through condensation to form 
clouds and, under certain atmospheric conditions, precipitation (rain or snow). 
The precipitation returns directly to the ocean or embarks on a more indirect 
route to the oceans via land surfaces. The rainfall may be intercepted by 
vegetation. The intercepted water may return at once to the air by evaporation. 
Rainfall reaching the ground may collect to form surface runoff or may infiltrate 
the ground. The liquid water in the soil then percolates through the unsaturated 
layers to the water table, where the ground becomes saturated, or is taken up by 
vegetation from which it can be transpired back into the atmosphere. The 
surface water runoff and groundwater flow join in surface streams and rivers that 
may be held up temporarily in lakes or rivers, but finally flow into the ocean (in 
the following, the term catchment area is frequently used (in American 
literature: the drainage basin or watershed). It can be defined as the area that 
collects and directs the surface water into the stream that drains it).
<P>

In most cases, the prevalence of heavy or intense precipitation in the river basin 
is the primary cause of flooding. The meteorological variable of interest is the 
intensity of rainfall. In case of low-intensity rainfall, the rainwater infiltrates the 
soil and takes a relatively long period of time to reach the stream (by the 
subsurface or groundwater flow). If much rain prevails in a short time, intensity 
may be high enough to exceed the infiltration capacity of the soil (the ability of 
a soil to absorb water). The residual (falling water that is not absorbed by the 
soil) becomes surface runoff. Obviously, the potential for flooding is then great. 
Hence, next to heavy rainfall the absorption capacity is significant. This capacity 
depends on soil type and the amount of moisture already present in the soil. For 
example, sandy soils absorb much of the rain, but clay soils have very low 
infiltration capacities. When rainfall continues, soil moisture increases and the 
water holding capacity of the soil decreases. Whenever and wherever the rate of 
rainfall (or snowmelt) exceeds the infiltration rate at the surface, the excess water 
begins to accumulate at the surface. Even low-intensity rainfall will then produce 
surface runoff. Surface runoff is most likely to occur in the low portions of the 
catchment, near the streams, where the initial soil moisture content is highest. It 
is evident that the chance on flooding depends on the combination of rainfall 
and catchment characteristics. <A NAME="r1">For example</A>, high-intensity rainfall with limited 
duration may heavily affect a brook but will have little impact on large rivers. 
The latter are more sensitive to widespread rainfall over an extended period, 
especially when the area of rainfall is large enough to affect the feeding 
tributaries<A HREF="1-2.html#f1">*</A>.

					<H3>1.2.2.	Human activities</H3>
A number of different aspects affect flow response and flooding:
<OL>
	<LI>Removal of vegetation or conversion to plants with lower annual 
evapotranspiration and interception increase runoff volumes. After 
rainfall, the antecedent soil moisture content and water tables tend to be 
higher for the next event. Consequently, less storage is available to hold 
the precipitation of the next event.
	<LI>Activities that further reduce the infiltration capacity of soils are 
intensive grazing, deforestation and urbanisation. As the proportion of 
precipitation for surface runoff increases due to human interference, the 
river responds more quickly to precipitation events.
	<LI>Increased erosion and sedimentation reduces the capacity of stream 
channels at both upstream and downstream locations. Flows that would 
have remained within the streambanks previously may now flood.
	<LI>Alterations of the stream channel (channelisation, dikes, dams, bridges) 
change the overall conveyance system of a catchment area.
</OL>
<P>
These activities can have a noticeable effect on flow volume and peak 
magnitude, and timing of the peak for precipitation events that are not extreme 
in terms of duration and amount. However, when the amount and duration of 
precipitation increases (i.e., extreme rainfall events in terms of intensity and/or 
duration), the influence of the soil-plant system and human interferences in the 
catchment basin on runoff volume diminishes. Many studies indicate that the 
greatest increases in peak and flow volumes, and the occurrence of flooding take 
place under wet antecedent conditions. 
<P>
The flow characteristics change in relation to the severity of disturbance of the 
ecological system and to the percentage of catchment area affected. Changes in 
streamflow become less evident downstream because of the combined changes in 
volume, peak and timing at the different upstream areas. For example, flow 
volume can increase as a result of a disturbance, but the magnitude of the peak 
discharge downstream can be reduced if upstream peakflows are desynchronised. 
<P>
Reports on flow response to land treatments exhibit little consensus. Several 
studies have shown increases in flow volumes and peak discharge following 
deforestation. However, other studies indicate little effect or even reductions. For 
example, a study indicating a reduction in peak discharge following forest 
cutting, also showed that peak discharges were delayed by several hours. The 
delayed peaks were attributed to a larger soil disturbance due to a rougher 
surface with greater storage.

<H2>1.3. Physical and geographical backgrounds of precipitation</H2>

Major weather patterns producing rainfall and the geographical distribution 
of rainfall are explained below. 

<H3>1.3.1.	Frontal disturbances</H3>
When air is cooled as a result of the converging of two contrasting air masses 
it can produce widespread rainfall. 
 <P>
 Warm air is made to rise and hence cools, and the 
condensation of water vapour forms characteristic clouds (stratus, 
stratocumulus) and rainfall. Precipitation usually occurs along the fronts, 
which 
may be several hundreds of kilometres long. On average, precipitation 
produced 
by a warm front is usually prolonged with moderate intensity (the amount 
of 
rain that has precipitated within a certain period); at the cold front, the 
rainfall 
is usually more heavy and short-lived (and thus more intense). The 
development of these frontal disturbances is typical for extratropical 
cyclones 
(depressions), the major weather pattern for producing precipitation in the 
temperate regions, where cold air from the pole meets warm air originating 
in 
the tropics. For example, more than 60% of the annual rainfall in the British 
Isles 
comes from such disturbances.

<H3>1.3.2.	Convectional precipitation</H3>
A great deal of the precipitation in the tropics is caused by convectional 
activity. 
When a tropical maritime air mass moves over land at a higher temperature, 
the 
air is heated and forced to rise by convection. Deep cumulus clouds form, 
becoming cumulonimbus (heavy rain-clouds) extending up to the tropopause 
(the top of the troposphere, the lower part of the atmosphere from the 
surface to 
around 10-15 km), sometimes accompanied with thunder and lightning; the 
horizontal scale of convection is typically 10km x 10km. The development of convection is a regular daily feature of 
the 
weather throughout the year in many parts of the tropics. A large supply of 
moisture is carried upwards. When vertical velocities are large enough, the 
air 
cools to condensation temperatures, and rainfall of great intensity occurs. 
Convectional activity is not confined to the tropics; it is a common local scale 
rain-forming phenomenon in higher latitudes, particularly in summer.

					<H3>1.3.3.	Orographic rainfall</H3>
Precipitation (rain or snow) can come directly from a maritime air mass that 
cools when forced to rise over mountains. It is an important feature of the 
western mountains of the British Isles, which lie along the track of the 
prevailing 
winds that carry moisture from the Atlantic Ocean. A range of mountains 
may 
delay the passage of a front and cause long periods of rainfall.

					<H3>1.3.4.	Monsoon</H3>
The marked predominance of summer rainfall over much of Asia is 
associated 
with the summer monsoon circulation. It carries moist air northwards from 
the 
Indian Ocean. A low pressure field above the southeastern continent, due to 
intense warming, generates this circulation. The seasonal movements of the 
Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) determine the development of the 
weather 
conditions in the monsoon areas. The ITCZ is a varying boundary between air 
masses originating in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The 
regularity of 
the onset of the rainy seasons is a marked feature of the monsoon. The 
precipitation is caused by the confrontation of differing air masses, 
convection, 
and orographic effects. The summer period is characterised by moist 
southwesterly winds, causing the transport of warm, moist air from the 
oceans to 
the subcontinent. Quantities of rain vary but intensities are high. For 
example, 
India receives 80% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon period. 

					<H3>1.3.5.	Global distribution</H3>
The geographical distribution of annual average precipitation is unequally 
distributed over the earth. At the middle 
latitudes, 
rainfall amounts are moderate with precipitation originating primarily from 
frontal disturbances, summer convection and orographic influences 
(mountains). 
Heavy precipitation is observed over large areas of the tropical continents. 
Predominantly convectional rain occurs in this area around the equator. The 
major dry areas (deserts) of the world correspond to subtropical latitudes.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>2.	The Potential Effects Of A Global Warming
On Rainfall Mechanisms</H1>








The most widely used indicator of the expected climate change due to enhanced 
greenhouse gas concentrations is the global mean temperature value. Many 
authors have concentrated on this variable. In both the 1990 and 1992 reports 
published by the IPCC, it is suggested that over the past 140 years global 
temperature has risen by about 0.45oC. A recent report of the Max-Planck-
Institut fr Meteorologie in Hamburg (Hegerl et al., 1994) shows that the 
probability that the latest 20-year warming is due to the (estimated) natural 
variability is less than 5%.
<P>
<A NAME="r1">It is certain</A> that enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations increase the radiative 
forcing (IPCC 1990, 1992). The total forcing is the sum of those from the 
individual greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, CFCs). For simplicity, total forcing is 
expressed in terms of the amount of CO2 which would give that forcing, the 
equivalent carbon dioxide concentration. Greenhouse gases have increased since 
pre-industrial (mid-18th century) by an amount that is equivalent to about a 
50% increase of CO2, whereas CO2 itself has risen by only 30%<A HREF="2-0.html#f1">*</A>.
<P>
Precipitation is a second major indicator of climate change. The implications of 
a global warming for the amount of precipitable water in the atmosphere, and 
for the geographical distribution are introduced in the following subsections.

<A NAME="f1">*</A> Recently, there has been increasing interest in the role of tropospheric aerosols 
(IPCC, 1994; 1995). During the past few decades, human activity has led to an 
increase of sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere, mainly due to fossil fuel 
combustion and biomass burning. These aerosols affect the radiation balance 
directly, by scattering and absorption of solar radiation, or indirectly, by being a 
major contributor to cloud condensation nuclei, and hence influencing the size of 
cloud droplets and the cloud reflectivity. It is suggested that the enhanced presence 
of aerosols reduces the estimated rate of global warming (most pronounced over the 
northern mid-latitude continents), and precipitation. Current model estimates 
(Jones et al., 1994) indeed indicate a negative radiative forcing when the aerosol 
effect is included in the GCM. However, the estimates are highly uncertain.  With 
regards to rainfall, modelling indicates a lower increase in the global mean 
precipitation. (IPCC, 1995). This implies that reducing aerosols, as is presently done 
in Europe, would cause an increase in rainfall. As all these suggestions are highly 
speculative, they are not considered in the present report's conclusion. <A HREF="2-0.html#r1">Return</A>

<H2>2.1.	Water vapour</H2>

It is anticipated that atmospheric warming will lead to more rainfall. The 
amount of water potentially available for rainfall increases because warmer air is 
capable of holding more moisture. This is derived from the Clausius-Clapeyron 
relation. In this figure, qsat is the specific humidity of saturated air, defined as 
the ratio between the mass of water vapour and the mass of the saturated air in 
a given volume (in g/g). Around T=20oC, the increase is about 6% per degree 
Celsius. Clearly, qsat increases exponentially with temperature, causing the 
amount of water vapour to rise even higher at higher temperatures. There is 
evidence that this mechanism does take place in nature. Note the enhanced 
convectional rainfall in the tropics, where relative humidity is high (compared 
to middle latitudes).
<P>
<A NAME="r1">Indeed</A>, upward trends in the amount of precipitable water over the ocean have 
been reported by a number of authors. For example, satellite observations 
(Stephens, 1990) have revealed that the amount of water vapour increases with 
sea surface temperature. Flohn et al. (1990) observed increases in the 
evaporation rate from parts of the ocean. These findings<A HREF="2-1.html#f1">*</A> are consistent with the 
measured warming of the North Atlantic Ocean.

<A NAME="f1">*</A> It has been argued that increased convection dries the middle and upper 
troposphere due to a compensatory subsidence of air. This is not confirmed by 
observations: in the tropics, Hense et al. (1988) measured increases in both 
temperature and moisture in the mid-troposphere. Studying satellite data on 
atmospheric water vapour, Rind et al. (1993) found that increased convection leads 
to an increased water vapour above 500 mb. <A HREF="2-1.html#r1">Return</A>

<H2>2.2.	Circulation patterns</H2>

Changes in atmospheric circulation patterns are also considered as an indicator 
of a possible climate change. Obviously, a close relationship exists between type 
of atmospheric circulation and the prevalence of rainfall. There is observational 
evidence that the frequency of certain European circulation patterns has 
changed over during the last 30 years (i.e. Zwart, 1992; 1993). GCMs indicate 
changes in the Northern Hemisphere Storm tracks (Hall et al., 1994). We will 
explore this further in the later chapters.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>3.	GCM PROJECTIONS AND GLOBAL TRENDS IN RAINFALL
</H1>


In recent years, an impressive pile of reports has been published on changes in 
the climate as predicted by GCMs. An effort has been made here to extract the 
most recent information. After describing some of their characteristics, the review 
starts with the findings of transient global climate simulations and relevant 
results of mixed-layer models. (Results of regional-scale modelling will be 
summarised separately.) To compare, information on trends in rainfall on the 
global scale is given.

<H2>3.1.	Characteristics of GCMs</H2>

General circulation models are extensions of existing weather forecasting models, 
obviously operating on different time and spatial scales. The modelling with 
regards to rainfall is based on fairly straightforward physical theory. It would 
therefore be surprising if the model predictions were very different from what 
theoretically can be expected. The power of these models lies in the fact that 
they account for the overall effect of several complicated processes, and that 
they have the potential to give quantitative estimates. 
<P>
The GCMs can be used to simulate both the present climate and the 
greenhouse-effect induced changes of the climate. They operate on the 
three-dimensional scale. Large-scale processes are resolved explicitly. Processes on 
scales that cannot be resolved ("subgrid scales") are incorporated by 
parametrisation. Statistical properties, derived from both observational and 
theoretical studies, are then related to the resolved-scale variables (temperature, 
humidity, wind and pressure). 
<P>
<A NAME="r1">In earlier research</A>, GCM studies were carried out with the ocean represented as a 
mixed layer<A HREF="3-1.html#f1">*</A>. Fairly recently, finance, processing speed and computational skill 
have allowed atmospheric models to be coupled to oceanic general circulation 
models. In these coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs, the changes in climate are 
assessed by "transient response" experiments: simulations usually carried out 
with a 1% increase per year in equivalent CO2 concentrations, consistent with 
the "business-as-usual" scenarios described by the IPCC (1990). The results are 
compared with those of a control run in which the equivalent CO2 
concentrations are held constant<A HREF="3-1.html#f2">**</A>.
<P>
Rainfall is usually estimated by two schemes in the GCM: a convection scheme 
and a large-scale condensation scheme. As in nature, both processes can be active 
at the same time (e.g., Hewitson and Crane, 1992). The result is a vertical 
transport of heat, moisture and momentum from the atmospheric boundary 
layer to higher levels, which may eventually lead to precipitation. Condensation 
takes place when the water vapour content exceeds the saturation value. After 
correcting for the release of latent heat and sub-grid effects, the remainder 
precipitates as water or snow.
<P>
Typical GCM models have a horizontal resolution of 300 to 1000 km2. This is 
sufficient to represent the large-scale features of the climate, but allow only a 
limited interpretation on regional scales. Alternative schemes for regional 
estimations have therefore been developed: a nested approach in which 
high-resolution regional climate models are driven by large-scale GCM output, 
and statistical methods which correlate the regional climate to the large-scale 
flow. The results from GCMs become less reliable on smaller geographical and 
time scales. On the regional scales, projections suffer from significant errors, and 
tend to differ from model to model (IPCC, 1992). 
<P>
Climate perturbation is usually expressed in terms of the change of mean values. 
However, it has been recognised that the occurrence of extreme events may have 
a greater impact than changes in the mean climate itself (Katz and Brown, 1991), 
but modelling of extreme events is difficult due to the scale incompatibility. 
Most deductions on the small-scale events are made indirectly, i.e. by 
considering changes in the mean and/or in the variability.

<H2>3.2.	Projections</H2>

In the literature, many variables are used to express rainfall characteristics: type, 
total amount, intensity, number of rain days, frequency of high- and low-rainfall 
events, return period of high- and low-rainfall events, etc. Usually, they are 
loosely defined if at all, and sometimes add no new information. Due to their 
importance in the hydrological cycle, averages and variability of rainfall 
amounts, intensity of rainfall, and frequency of rainfall events will be considered 
whenever possible. 
<P>
<A NAME="r1">At the moment</A>, the four major coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs are the 
high-resolution climate model of the United Kingdom Meteorological Office 
(UKMO, Hadley Centre, Bracknell), the climate model of the National Center of 
Atmospheric Research (NCAR, Boulder, USA, without flux correction), the 
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics model (GFDL, Princeton, USA), and the MPI model 
(Max-Planck-Institut fr Meteorologie, Hamburg, Germany). These models 
qualitatively agree on the global patterns (IPCC, 1990). The most certain 
conclusion is that the average precipitation amounts increase globally. Annual 
changes have been estimated to lie within the range of +3 to +15% under 
doubled CO2 conditions<A HREF="3-2.html#f1">*</A>.
<P>
Increases are particularly expected at high latitudes throughout the year, and in 
much of the mid-latitudes during winter. More rainfall is predicted in southeast 
Asia (monsoon region). In the tropics, projections are uncertain, i.e. they differ 
from model to model. In the Southern Hemisphere, precipitation increases are 
predicted along the mid-latitude storm tracks.
<P>
In the IPCC report of 1992 results of several doubled CO2 experiments with GCMs 
and mixed-layer ocean models have been summarised (Table B2, pg. 111). In 
general, the simulated globally-averaged increases in precipitation are similar to 
those in the 1990 IPCC report. The annual percentage increases range from 2.5% 
to 8%.
<P>
One of the first papers on changing rainfall processes estimated by GCMs was 
written by Noda and Tokioka (1989). Their (mixed layer) model is developed at 
the Meteorological Research Institute of Japan (MRI-GCM). Under doubled CO2 
concentrations, the increase of the global mean precipitation is attributed to the 
increase of precipitation of cumulus type causing a decrease in the global area of 
total precipitation. Furthermore, the frequency of intense convective rainfall 
increases while that of nonconvective rainfall decreases. 
<P>
Parey (1994), analysing results from the high resolution global simulations at the 
LMD (Laboratoire du Meteorologie Dynamique, France), observed that the 
changes in precipitation between three simulations (1xCO2, 2xCO2, and 3xCO2) 
were small. She did find more rainfall in winter (and a decrease in snowfall) and 
less rainfall in summer over the high and middle latitudes of the Northern 
Hemisphere. The number of rain days increased due to snowfall became rainfall 
during the early spring season. The variability in rainfall appears to change in 
the same way as the mean rainfall amounts. No conclusion could be drawn on 
changes in the frequency of extreme rainfall events.
<P>
Gordon et al. (1992) investigated the variability of daily rainfall with the global 
model of CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, 
Australia). More heavy rainfall days and fewer light rainfall days are observed 
when CO2 has doubled: a heavy rain event which occurs once in five years 
becomes at least twice as frequent. A widespread increase in rainfall of 
convective origin is observed, and the mean intensity of rainfall rises 
correspondingly. 
<P>
Fowler and Hennessey (1994) obtained comparable findings (UKMO 
high-resolution model): the mean intensity increases by 10-30% at most 
latitudes. Studies currently being conducted with the UKMO model confirm this: 
tendencies to heavier rain events, in connection with an increase of convectional 
activity. 
<P>
In general, the results obtained with the MPI model (Cubasch et al., 1994) show 
agreement. Again, an increase in rainfall during the Northern Hemisphere 
mid-latitude winter period (Northwest Europe), and in the monsoon region in 
summer is observed. Cubasch proposed a Monte Carlo technique to obtain more 
representative results. An ensemble average of four different runs was calculated. 
The individual findings were compared to obtain a general idea of the stability 
of the result. A considerable between-experiment standard deviation was 
observed.
<P>
Meehl et al. (1993) attempted to estimate possible sensitivities of ENSO related 
effects with the global NCAR model. The observed rise in mean sea-surface 
temperatures leads to an increase in evaporation and precipitation. An 
intensification of atmospheric anomalies in the tropics is indicated: most dry 
areas became drier and wet areas wetter.

<H2>3.3.	Caveats</H2>

The models generally agree that enhanced precipitation will accompany global 
warming. Differences in the results may originate from problems with the 
simulation of rainfall processes by GCMs. Two of them are enumerated here.
<P>
1) Spatial-scale incompatibility <BR>
The coarse horizontal and vertical resolution of the GCMs result in crude 
estimations of the small-scale rainfall processes (Hewitson and Crane, 1992). For 
example, convective cells have a characteristic scale of the order 50 km2. A 
model grid box may be around 500 km2. Simulations are further hampered 
when rainfall events are influenced by local topography. As a result, the rainfall 
at a grid point is difficult to compare with the rainfall measured at a 
meteorological station (von Storch et al., 1993). 
<P>
2) Intermodel agreement <BR>
The quantitative agreement between different models is much better for 
temperature than for rainfall. The first reason is that precipitation is changed 
indirectly by a wider variety of different processes. Warming is primarily a direct 
response to increased radiative heating. The second reason is that the simulated 
changes in precipitation are relatively small compared with the natural 
variations observed in time series, and are thus more difficult to detect. Also, 
differences between models in CO2 doubling times, horizontal and vertical 
resolution, correction of air-sea fluxes, and parametrisations lead to differences in 
the GCM predictions.

<H2>3.4.	Observations on global rainfall</H2>

With regards to precipitation, the IPCC report of 1992 summarises some general 
observations: during the last few decades precipitation has tended to increase in 
the mid-latitudes, to decrease in the Northern Hemispheric subtropics and show 
a general increase throughout the Southern Hemisphere. 
<P>
Hulme (1995) analysed a database containing records from 8300 gauges 
throughout the world. He examined changes in different hemispheres and 
different latitudinal bands for the period 1900 to 1992. Results are shown in 
Figure 8. The Southern Hemisphere shows a weak trend towards increased 
precipitation. Within the Northern Hemisphere there is drying in the tropical 
latitudes (south of 23.4o North) and wetting in the high latitudes (north of 50o 
North, about the latitude of the south coast of England) in recent decades. 
Between 23.4o North and 50o North, there has been very little change. The drying 
in tropical latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere is dominated by the recent 
desiccation in the Sahel region of Africa.
<P>
Observed rainfall trends are qualitatively consistent with the GCM projections, 
however precipitation is more difficult to monitor than temperature as it varies 
much more in time and space. There are significant differences in the quality of 
the data sets and in the construction and efficiency of rain monitoring stations.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>4. Regional Flooding Implications</H1>


With a changing climate and an intensified hydrological cycle, we should also 
expect changes in flooding regimes. Obviously, it is not an easy matter to convert 
climate changes to corresponding changes in flood probability. To obtain 
somewhat more insight, we examine projections on streamflow and discuss a few 
studies which have concentrated on how possible climate changes affect runoff 
and stream flow. We compare these, where possible with, observations of relevant 
parameters (rainfall duration and intensity, stream flow) in several regions.
<P>
This study has not sought to examine the question of whether or not river 
flooding events have increased in recent years. The data are unavailable and the 
causes too complex to make a reasonable estimate of general trends in this area. 
Where data are available however we have reported on precipitation and 
streamflow trends.
<P>
The flooding phenomena examined here provide an insight into the potential 
impacts of future climate change on flooding rather than directly attributing 
individual events, however unusual, to the enhanced greenhouse effect. Trends 
in underlying parameters, such as streamflow in the USA, are consistent with 
GCM predictions but also lie within the bounds of natural variability.
<P>
The direct use of GCM output to drive hydrologic models is considered to be 
improper due to the coarse resolution (relative to river basin scale) of the spatial 
grids used by GCMs and the simplified GCM representations of sub-grid 
atmospheric processes. However, as the GCMs perform reasonably well in 
simulating the climate with respect to annual and seasonal averages over large 
regions, the simulations can be used to guide relevant changes that are applied 
to catchment scale hydrologic models.
<P>
The reliability of any estimation of the impact of climate change on surface 
hydrology is questionable because of the limitations of hydrological models. 
Values quoted here should, therefore, be considered as plausible changes in 
runoff based on the current state of science.

<H2>4.1.	Europe</H2>

<H3>4.1.1.	Projections</H3>
Derived from an UKMO GCM transient experiment, future climate change for 
mean precipitation in winter and summer was estimated by Viner and Hulme 
(1993). Seasonal results are depicted in Figure 9a-b. Increases (20 to 30%) are 
noted in large parts of northern and northwestern Europe (a maximum of more 
than 20% in the Belgium/Northern France area), and in the Baltic region. In 
summer, rainfall is higher in northern Europe and lower in large parts of 
southern Europe. 
<P>
Consistent with more rainfall in northern Europe is the prediction of a 
northward shift and intensification -probably with greater precipitation- of the 
North Atlantic storm track by Hall et al. (1994) (using the UKMO GCM).
<P>
Von Storch (1991), giving an example of a statistical approach in the 
downscaling of climate estimates (MPI) to regional scales that is consistent with 
observations, projected a decreasing trend in winter rainfall over the Iberian 
peninsula.

<H3>4.1.2.	Observations</H3>
<A NAME="r1">Bardossy and Caspary</A> (1990) studied changes in time series of classified 
European atmospheric circulation patterns for the period 1881-1989. They 
concluded that frequencies of several circulation types did indeed change 
considerably. The frequency of zonal<A HREF="4-1.html#f1">*</A> circulations in winter has increased since 
1973. Correspondingly, a decrease in meridional "blocking" circulations has been 
observed since 1980. The climatological consequences are: relatively warm and 
humid winters in Western and Central Europe, with precipitation mostly falling 
as rain.
<P>
Sch&ouml;nwiese (1993) indeed observed upward trends in rainfall during winter in 
Western and Central Europe (period 1891-1990). The statistical significance are 
highest for the North Sea basin and Scandinavia (p<0.05). However, similar 
trends for the period 1961-1990 are not significant in statistical terms. Over the 
period 1961-1990, summers became drier in the North Sea basin (not significant). 
A decrease in rainfall is observed in the Mediterranean area (Spain, Southern 
France, Italy and Greece) during the period 1891-1990 (not significant). He also 
notes a decrease in pressure over Northern Europe and an increase in pressure 
over Souther Europe in the winter period (over the period 1961-1990). This 
induces an intensification of zonal circulations in winter. 
<P>
At a weather station in the Netherlands (De Bilt) the annual means of total 
precipitation amount and duration increased (+5% and +11%, 
respectively) for the period 1961-1990 compared to 1931-1960 (Zwart, 
1993). (However, one station is not representative for a larger area.) 
Also, precipitation amounts increased significantly in Bavaria 
(Germany) during the last 3 decades (Dister, 1995).
<P>
The precipitation time-series produced by Jones et al. (1994) for England and 
Wales confirm these long-term trends in seasonal rainfall.

<H3>4.1.3.	Flooding</H3>
Concerned by the 1993 flooding of the Meuse (see section <A HREF="4-1.html#4-1-4">4.1.4</A>.), Dutch 
authorities launched a extensive study on the possible causes (Waterloopkundig 
Laboratorium, 1994). One result can be seen in Figure 10, where the behaviour of 
peak runoff in the Meuse near Maastricht is depicted. A rising trend of 10 to 12% 
has been estimated since 1911. After comparing the frequency of peak water 
levels before and after 1911, more runoff peaks were observed in the recent 
period. This increase is ascribed to changes in land use and river infrastructure, 
and urbanisation. In contrast to what is often believed, deforestation cannot be 
the reason. Over the period 1834-1992 forest area grew in the Ardennes (+10%). 
However, nearly all the floods of the Meuse took place in winter and were 
preceded by much precipitation in a large area (van Meijgaard, personal 
communication, 1995).
<P>
In this respect, it is remarkable that the Waterloopkundig Laboratorium, 1994) 
also reveals that in the catchment area of the Meuse in Wallonie the 
precipitation in wintertime this century (1911-1993) has increased with more 
than 20% relative to 1882-1910. The KNMI (1995) points to the persistence of 
zonal circulations during the 1993 and 1995 winters (causing the excessive 
frontal rainfall). In 1993/94 a westerly flow occurred on 55% of the winter days 
(average is 40%). In the winter of 1994/95 this is above 60%.
<P>
Analysing runoff conditions over the last sixty years in Germany, Schumann 
(1993) finds similar trends. In total, 14 runoff series from rivers in different 
regions in Germany were analysed for the period 1931-1988. It appeared that the 
winter runoff of alpine-influenced river basins has increased by warmer winters 
since 1965. For non-alpine influenced river basins, average runoff values for the 
months March to June were larger after 1964. The average runoff values were 
increased by 26% as compared to the time period 1931-1963. It was also found 
that the average discharge of annual low water periods was increased. The 
annual lowest 60-day average of daily runoff was, on average, 29% higher from 
1964 to 1988 than in the period 1931-1963. These results were found to hold for 
river basins differing in size and situated in different hydrological regions of 
Germany. Because mostly large river basins were analysed, Schumann assumes 
that changes reflecting human intervention can be neglected. In this context, the 
remark of Dister (1995) is noteworthy: "Apart from infrastructural changes, the 
main cause for the 1995 flooding of the river Rhine is a climatological one, i.e. 
the increase of 40% in precipitation in Bavaria between 1960 and 1990".
<P>
A study by Boardman et al. (1994) reveals that, in the last twenty years, there 
has been an increase in the incidence of flooding of property by runoff from 
agricultural land in certain areas of northwestern Europe. Some of the high risk 
areas considered were the Ardennes and the south part of the Dutch province of 
Limburg. The Royal Meteorological Office at Ukkel (Demaree, 1990) found 
evidence of an increase in the maximum precipitation intensity for the first 
catchment over the period 1934-1976/1983, which explains in part the observed 
increase in flooding incidents in this area. However, in the southern Limburg 
area, the changes in land use were identified as important factors contributing to 
the increase in runoff. The final conclusion for these catchments was that 
"increases in flooding in recent years are primarily the result of changes in land 
use and the intensification of farming, and that changes in climate (if any) are 
unimportant" (for the period under consideration). An explanation why the 
observed increase of rainfall intensity in certain regions is not important was not 
given.
<P>
In the period 1950-75 there were 66 floods in Italy (2.5 per year). During the 
17-year period thereafter (1976-1993), the frequency was 4 floods per year (with a 
total of 126). Since 1950, there have been seven severe droughts, of which four 
were concentrated in the 1980s. These data seem to confirm that Italy is 
undergoing a "climate partitioning" into a wet northern region and a southern 
semi-arid region. This "splitting" is in agreement with general circulation model 
predictions: rainfall trends should go towards extremes (Ferrara, 1993).
<P>
Kwadijk (1993), and Kwadijk and Middelkoop (1994) estimated the impact of 
climate change on the peak discharge probability of the Rhine river by means of 
a water balance model. Scenarios for temperature changes between 0oC and 4oC 
and precipitation changes between plus 20% and minus 20% have been applied. 
Within this range, flood frequencies appear to be more sensitive to a 
precipitation change than to a temperature change. From the study it can be 
deduced that a biennial flood doubles in frequency to become an annual 
occurrence under the influence of a 20% increase in precipitation. The associated 
peak flow volume raises by approximately 30%. (The method was only applied 
for estimation of probability changes of events having relatively low recurrence 
times.)
<P>
From the application of the Business-as-Usual (BaU) scenarios developed by the 
IPCC (1990; 1992), it became evident that in the Alpine part of the basin winter 
discharge will increase and over time, as snow and ice have melted, summer 
discharge will decrease. In winter, the ratio rain/snow changes due to an increase 
of the winter temperature, and from a shift of maximum precipitation from 
summer to winter. The summer discharge will decrease, due to an increased 
evapotranspiration and decreased melt water availability. Downstream effects 
from precipitation changes become increasingly dominant over those related to 
temperature changes. The river regime at the Lobith gauging station (where the 
Rhine enters the Netherlands) will change from a combined snow-melt/rain-fed 
river to an almost entirely rain-fed river. Application of the BaU scenario ("best 
guess") reveals that at Lobith winter runoff will increase by 17% and summer 
runoff will decrease by 15% in the course of the next century.
<P>
That changes in magnitude and frequency of heavy floods accompanied changes 
in the (European) climate has already been observed earlier (Lamb, 1977): Many 
parts of Europe experienced anomalous wetness and great floods from about AD 
1150 onward till about AD 1500 (Medieval warm period). However, southern 
Europe experienced very rare flooding in that period (which agrees with current 
GCM projections, showing that regional responses to climate change may differ).

<A NAME="4-1-4"><H3>4.1.4.	Analyses of recent floods</H3></A>

Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, 21-31 December, 1993
In northwestern Europe, the worst flooding in 60 to 100 years took place just 
before Christmas 1993. In Germany, the flooding was most severe through the 
Rhineland and neighbouring regions. River water poured into many riverside 
towns. Cologne experienced its the worst flood in 100 years. In France, the 
flooding burst the banks of the Oise, Meuse and Moselle. Hundreds of people had 
to be evacuated. In Belgium, the river Meuse cut off the city of Dinant. It was the 
highest flood since 1926. The Dutch government declared a state of emergency 
along the basin of the Meuse. In total, 170 sq km of Dutch territory was 
inundated. The water level at Maastricht was 10 cm higher than measured. The 
1993 peak runoff volume in Maastricht (3120 m3/s) was higher than it was in 
1926 (3000 m3/s). It was thought that a flooding of this magnitude occurred 
once every 155 years. The total estimated damage was 265 million Dutch 
guilders (Rijkswaterstaat, 1994).
<P>
Excessive rainfall over a large area was the primary cause of these floods. 
December 1993 was a very wet month in large parts of west and central Europe. 
Active western circulation forced repetition of active rainstorms in central 
Europe. Along the French-Belgium border, 100 mm fell in two days. Fortunately, 
there was no snow in the Ardennes. Otherwise, water levels in the Meuse would 
have risen considerably higher (several decimeters). 
<P>
There is a clear relation between daily rainfall and runoff. On 19 
December, over 30 mm had already fallen in the French part of the Meuse 
catchment. The precipitation on 20 December originated from a disturbance 
passing somewhat more north compared to the rainfall of 19 December. Hence, 
the rain fell in an area that had already suffered from higher levels due to the 
upstream rainfall. This coincidence might be the reason that water levels were 
higher than expected.
<P>
A statistical survey of rainfall data for three stations in the Ardennes on the 
prevalence of two- to four-day rainfall events revealed that such events take 
place once every 10 to 20 years (van Meijgaard, 1994). However, the recurrence 
period will be larger over the whole catchment area of the Meuse. Indeed, the 
total precipitation in december 1993 in Belgium was characterised by the 
Belgium Meteorological Organisation (KMI) as very exceptional, which means 
that the event has an occurrence of the order of one in the 100 years (van 
Meijgaard, 1994). The precipitation amount was 2.6-3.6 times the average 
precipitation.
<P>
<B>Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, 24 January-4 February, 1995</B><BR>
January was wet: the precipitation amount in this month was 1.5 to 3 times the 
average monthly total. The flooding of the rivers Rhine and Meuse was of 
comparable magnitude with the 1993 flooding. Again, it was called "the flood of 
the century". Over a period of 9 days the water level rose above the critical level 
(when inundation begins). In 1993, this period was 5 days. Although information 
is not yet fully consistent, it is generally assumed that compared to the 1993 
flood, the rainfall was less intense but of a longer duration, and coincided with 
frozen soils (which enhances surface runoff) and later snow melting in the 
Ardennes and the Alpes. The peak runoff of the Meuse at Maastricht was around 
3100 m3/s. The peak runoff of the Rhine was six times as high as the average 
runoff (2200 m3/s). The precipitation in the period 22-30 January in the 
catchment areas of the Rhine and the Meuse is characterised by the Royal 
Netherlands Meteorological Organisation (KNMI, 1995) as exceptional: in this 
century it only occurred two times earlier (1926 and 1993). 
<P>
<B>Alps: France, Italy, Switzerland, 23 September-8 October 1993</B><BR>
After three days of heavy rain, rivers overflowed and mudslides occurred. 
Flooding in the Savoie region was the worst in 35 years. In Italy, towns were 
flooded all along the Ligurian coast and up into Piedmont towards the Alps. In 
the port of Genoa it rained non-stop for 22 hours: 525 mm in 4 days compared 
to an annual average of 250 mm. Obviously, the flooding was caused by the 
abundant rainfall.

<H2>4.2.	North America</H2>

<H3>4.2.1.	Projections</H3>
A regional model embedded in the global NCAR model revealed the existence of 
areas with significant increases and decreases of frequency and intensity of 
precipitation under 2xCO2 conditions (Mearns et al., 1994). In some areas, 
frequency decreases while mean daily amounts increase. In an earlier study, 
Mearns et al. (1990) found an increase in the day-to-day variability of 
precipitation.
<P>
In the GISS (Goddard Space Flight Center, Institute for Space Studies, USA) model, 
precipitation variability appears to change with the same sign as the mean 
precipitation itself, i.e. increasing in the warmer climate (3/4 of the time) (Rind 
et al., 1989). The hydrological cycle intensifies by about 10%. 

					<H3>4.2.2.	Observations</H3>
Groisman and Easterling (1994a,b) reported that the North American annual 
precipitation time series shows an upward trend (+7.6%, significant at the 5% 
level) in precipitation amount during the period 1891-1990, owing mainly to 
increases in eastern Canada and adjacent regions of the United States. On the 
Century-scale the linear trends of the US and Canadian precipitation +3.9% per 
century (not statistically significant) and 13.7% per century (statistically 
significant), respectively. The increase was strongest for the last four decades 
(Figure 12). Especially significant were trends over the southeastern US (14% over 
the last 40 years) and northern Canada (17% over the last 40 years). 
<P>
Iwashima et al. (1993) presented a study that shows an interdecadal increase in 
the frequency of maximum daily precipitation amounts over the entire USA 
(period: 1916-1985; 14 stations). However, Hogg, performing a similar analysis for 
selected Canadian stations, could not confirm this. But he did find that the 80s 
was the most likely decade for the largest one-day rainfall (Bruce, 1994).

<H3>4.2.3.	Flooding</H3>
In North America, Lins and Michaels (1994) found statistically significant 
(p<0.05) increases in natural streamflow in nearly all regions of the United 
States. These are ascribed to an enhanced hydrologic cycle produced by an 
enhanced greenhouse forcing. The data set covers the years 1941-1988 and 
contains data from 559 gauging stations. Several criteria were used to ensure that 
any trends are due to actual changes in streamflow rather than to human 
activities or changes in measurements methods. The most significant increases 
were found from the Rocky Mountains eastward to the Atlantic. They conclude 
that these results support the hypothesis that enhanced greenhouse forcing 
produces an enhanced hydrological cycle.
<P>
In the United States too, there is historic evidence that a change in the climate 
induced changes in the flooding regimes. However, no simple proportionality 
exists between the scale or frequency of floods and climate variations. Knox 
(1993) inspected a 7000-year geological record of overbank floods for upper 
Mississippi river tributaries in mid-continent North America. Approximately 3300 
years ago, when the climate became cooler and wetter, an abrupt shift in flood 
behaviour occurred, with frequent floods of a magnitude that now recurs only 
once every 500 years or more. Still larger floods occurred during the transition 
(between about AD 1250 and 1450) from the medieval warm interval to the 
cooler Little Ice Age. All of these changes were associated with changes in mean 
annual temperature of only about 1-2 K and changes in mean precipitation of 
10-20%. In a similar study, Ely et al. (1993) presented a 5000-year record of 
extreme floods and climate change for the southwestern United States. Here, 
periods of especially high magnitude floods appeared to occur during transitions 
from cool to warm climate conditions. An analyses of modern floods shows that 
the "paleofloods" must have been linked to changes in large-scale atmospheric 
circulation patterns.

					<H3>4.2.4.	Analyses of recent floods</H3>

<B>United States (Midwest), 27 June-15 August 1993</B><BR>
In June, Mississippi floods reached second highest level ever. Violent 
thunderstorms occurred in Iowa. By mid July, it was called the worst flooding in 
the northern Mississippi basin in over a century. The floods cover nearly 17000 
square miles, one and a half time as great as the previous worst flood in this 
century (in 1937; 12700 square miles). Remarkably, it came in July, giving 
farmers less time to recover than during previous inundations, which always 
came in late winter or early spring.  
<P>
At the beginning of the summer, an unusually strong jet stream was firmly 
established over the northern portion of the Mississippi basin, causing a 
stationary surface front where cooler drier air to the north was nearly 
continuously overrun by moisture-laden warmer air from the south. The result 
was: widespread areas of prolonged and excessive precipitation throughout large 
portion of the USA. The main reason is, therefore, the saturation of the soil due 
to heavy antecedent precipitation (van Ellen, 1995). The tentative analysis of the 
USA's National Meteorological Center (World Climate News, 1993) was as follows: 
The extreme flooding could be interpreted as being consistent with the global 
warming hypothesis. However, the flood cannot be considered as adding any 
conclusive evidence on greenhouse warming. It may well be that the ultimate 
"cause" of the excessive precipitation in the central USA is a combination of 
factors in conjunction with natural variability in the climate system. However, 
all these mechanisms seem less likely than a direct influence of the sea-surface-
temperature anomaly in the tropical Pacific Ocean associated with ENSO. 
Preliminary tests using the current ENSO related sea-surface temperature 
anomalies in a numerical climate model at the National Meteorological Climate 
Centre show a response in North America that replicates the observed 
precipitation and temperature anomaly pattern to a considerable extent. An 
additional effect may be due to the draining of wetlands. These wetlands formed 
a buffer between the rivers and other low-lying lands, and their loss caused a 
concentration of water further downstream which, in turn, contributed to a 
larger flooding.

<H2>4.3.	Australia</H2>

<H3>4.3.1.	Projections</H3>
Using an improved version of the mixed-layer model of CSIRO, Whetton et al. 
(1993) found an increase in the frequency of high-rainfall events and a decrease 
in the frequency of low-rainfall events. This results applies over most of 
Australia. The frequency of the simulated heavy rain events and increased by 
factors ranging from 2 to 5 under 2xCO2 conditions. These findings are in 
agreement with the global scale modelling by Gordon et al. (1992), using an 
earlier version of the same model. Current investigations with a limited-area 
model (island of Tasmania) nested in the global CSIRO model predicts that the 
total number of rain days decreases while the frequency of high-intensity rainfall 
events increases.

<H3>4.3.2.	Observations</H3>
Suppiah (1994) concluded that the synoptic climatological patterns during 
anomalous wet and dry conditions in central Australia agree fairly well with 
those simulated by the CSIRO climate model. No trends in rainfall were 
investigated. 
<P>
Drought and moisture indices calculated for Australia showed no systematic 
long-term changes (IPCC, 1990).
<P>
The relation between rainfall in Australia and changes in ENSO remains 
uncertain. ENSO is said to account for one third of the total variance in seasonal 
rainfall (Pittock, 1984). On the other hand, Cordery and Yao (1993) conclude 
that although strong, consistent relationships between ENSO and rainfall have 
existed for many years, they are subject to sudden changes that do not appear to 
be linked with any other phenomena.

<H3>4.3.3.	Flooding</H3>
A study performed by Chiew et al. (1993) describes the impacts of climate 
change on Australian catchments by use of a hydrologic daily rainfall-runoff 
model. The first part of this study consisted of a sensitivity analysis. In general, 
changes in rainfall are amplified in the simulated runoff. In the wet and 
temperate areas, the percentage change in runoff is about twice as much as the 
percentage of change in rainfall. In the drier areas, large increases in rainfall can 
enhance runoff by more than five times the change in runoff. In these 
catchments, runoff also reduces very quickly as rainfall decreases. This is mainly 
because the percentage of rainfall that becomes runoff is very low in these 
catchments. The change in rainfall has little effect on the soil moisture in wet 
catchments but in drier catchments, the percentage of change in soil moisture 
levels can be greater than the percentage of change in rainfall. Compared to 
precipitation, temperature increases alone have negligible effects.
<P>
The second part of this study used results from five global climate models to 
provide regional climate change scenarios. This information served as the input 
for the hydrologic model. The range of changes in runoff and soil moisture by 
the year 2030 were then estimated. The GCMs reasonably agree on a general 
increase of temperature and rainfall across most of Australia, but quantitative 
predictions vary considerably on the regional scale.
<P> 
In the summer, rainfall increases of up to 5% per degree of global warming are 
predicted in southeast Australia and of up to 10% per degree of global warming 
elsewhere. In the winter, three separate regions are identified: the models agree 
on an increase (of up to 5% per degree warming) in Tasmania, agree on a 
decrease (of up to 5%) in central and south Australia, or fail to agree (-5% to 
+5%) in eastern and southwest Australia. The average global warming falls in the 
range of 0.6 K to 1.7 K by 2030. For example, the maximum increase of summer 
precipitation on the northeast coast will then range from 6% (0.6x10) to 17% 
(1.7x10).
<P>
The model simulations with the mentioned precipitation increases as input 
indicate a nonlinear increase in annual runoff: up to 25% by 2030 in the 
wet-tropical catchments near the northeast coast of Australia. Because the GCMs 
do not agree in the direction of rainfall change in south-east Australia, the 
direction of the runoff is also uncertain: 20%. For Tasmanian catchments, a 
10% increase in runoff is simulated whereas for catchments in the South 
Australian Gulf, up to 35% decrease in annual runoff is simulated for 2030. Near 
the western coast, simulations show runoff changes of up to 50%. It is 
concluded that the runoff changes simulated for many parts of Australia are 
large enough to affect the prevailing flooding regimes.
<P>
Another approach is demonstrated by Bates et al. (1994). The effects of doubled 
CO2 concentrations on a small South Australian catchment were evaluated using 
the results from the CSIRO GCM, a stochastic weather model and a water balance 
model. Changed climate sequences are produced by adjusting the weather 
generator according to GCM trends. The long-term sequences (1000 years) of 
artificial daily rain records are then used to the drive the hydrologic model.
<P>
Although results show only a marginal decrease in median monthly runoff 
during winter months, large increases in monthly runoff maxima are indicated 
for August and September due to large increases in extreme monthly rainfall. 
Modest increases in evapotranspiration were also indicated for these 
months.
<P>
In a case study of urban flooding damage, Minnery and Smith (1994) links flood 
probability and flood damage for two urban river catchments in New South 
Wales. He estimated that the financial damage would be between 4.5 and 11 
times higher under doubled CO2 concentrations (the connection between the 
increasing rainfall intensity and probable maximum flood value was not 
considered).

<H2>4.4.	Monsoon region</H2>

<H3>4.4.1.	Projections</H3>
Global warming is expected to lead to a higher temperature difference between 
the land and sea surfaces on the Indian subcontinent. This induces stronger 
winds from sea and, in combination with higher evaporation, and transports 
greater quantities of moist air. Recent results from global coupled models 
generally agree with these expectations. 
<P>
The global coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model of NCAR produces greater 
mean precipitation in the south Asian summer monsoon region (Lal, 1993). With 
the same GCM, Meehl and Washington (1993) found that the interannual 
variability of monsoon rainfall is enhanced.
<P>
The UKMO GCM model (Bhaskaran et al., 1995) predicts a total precipitation 
increase of approximately 20% with increased CO2. Specific humidity increases 
by 19%, indicating that the increased monsoon rainfall is largely due to 
increased water content of the atmosphere. The model also predicts a greater 
number of heavy rainfall days during the summer monsoon period, and an 
increased interannual variability. 

<H3>4.4.2.	Observations</H3>
The annual times series of East Asian precipitation shows a weak tendency for 
increasing precipitation over the last 100 years (Hulme and Zhao, 1994). This is 
confirmed by Sontakke et al. (1993) analysing the all-India summer monsoon 
rainfall series from 1813 to 1991. There was little trend in precipitation up to the 
turn of the century and only a marginally significant wetting trend between 1902 
and 1991. 
<P>
Consistent with the model results, observations (20 years) show a trend of 
increased interannual variability of Indian monsoon precipitation (Meehl and 
Washington, 1993). Rackhecha and Soman (1994) find significant increasing 
trends in the extreme rainfall series at stations over the west coast of India and 
at some stations in the central part of the subcontinent.
<P>
Chowdbury and Debsarma (1992) reveal a significant upward trend in 
Bangladesh annual rainfall in the north (by 18%) and in the southwest (since the 
early 70s), and a downward trend in the southeast. In addition, a trend towards 
more severe tropical cyclones was detected.
<P>
Kumar et al. (1993) noticed that annual precipitation has been increasing (by 
more than 5%) over India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Burma since 1850. On 
the other hand, no significant precipitation change has been observed 
throughout the Taiwanese region (Cheng et al., 1993)

<H3>4.4.3.	Flooding</H3>
In recent years the frequency of abnormal floods in Bangladesh has increased 
substantially (Khalequzzaman, 1994): 1974, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1991 and 1993. 
Normally the monsoon floods cover 20% of the territory one year out of two. The 
disastrous river floods of 1987 and 1988 inundated 40 and 60% of the country, 
respectively. Apart from the reasons given above, other factors that reduce the 
water carrying capacity of the drainage system may be important here: change 
in the base level of the rivers due to local sea level rise, inadequate sediment 
accumulation on flood plains, an increase in the catchment area due to seismic 
and neotectonic activities in the region, river bed narrowing due to siltation and 
damming, soil erosion, deforestation in the upstream region, and the increase in 
the rate of melting of snow pack in the Himalayas (observed over the past 
decade). Studies of the World Climate Research Program on the ENSO 
phenomenon suggest a strong relationship between variations in Bay of Bengal 
tropical cyclones, as well as other weather conditions in Bangladesh, and the 
state of development of El Ni&ntilde;o (Bruce, 1995).

<H3>4.4.4.	Analysis of a recent flood</H3>

<B>June 1993</B><BR> 
The monsoonal floods in Bangladesh were the worst in 58 years, causing serious 
damage to lives and property. The heavy monsoon downpour (heaviest rains in 
20 years) and synchronisation of flood peaks of the three major rivers are 
considered to be the main causes. The monsoon began a few days earlier than 
usual. It advanced northwards and also covered the whole of India a few days 
early. The total rainfall was equal to the long-term average: it was a "normal" 
monsoon year.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>CONCLUDING THOUGHTS</H1>


<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	Physical arguments clearly indicate that global warming will cause an 
increase of evaporation from the ocean. Moreover, a warmer atmosphere can 
carry more moisture, which leads to larger amounts of precipitable water. 
Global warming will also induce higher temperature differences between the 
land and sea surfaces, causing an increased transport of precipitable water to 
the continents, and an increase of convectional rainfall. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	The general circulation models (GCMs) discussed all indicate an 
intensification of the (global) hydrological cycle as a result of global 
warming. At a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration (expected at 
about 2070) the estimated increase in mean annual global precipitation 
varies from 3 to 15%. The general consensus is that we should expect greater 
amounts of rainfall (10 to 20%) in much of the mid-latitudes during winter 
(i.e. northwest Europe), increases at high latitudes throughout the year, and 
in areas affected by monsoon rainfall (India, Northern Australia). Whenever 
investigated, there is qualitative agreement between most models on a shift 
towards more heavy rainfall events and higher rainfall intensities. Similarly, 
there is consensus that in arid and semi-arid areas (such as Southern Europe 
and North Africa) the amount of rainfall is expected to decrease or remain 
more or less constant.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	Present CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have reached a level of 130% 
as compared to pre-industrial levels and thus, we are one third underway to 
doubling. When equivalent CO2 concentrations are considered, we are even 
halfway to doubling. According to the theory, and given the projections for 
increased rainfall under doubling of CO2 concentrations, we should already 
be experiencing a certain increase in rainfall, say about 1 to 5% in the global 
average, and about 5% in the mid-latitudes (i.e. northwest Europe).
<P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	Observations of (regional) trends in rainfall are consistent with the GCM 
predictions described above. Some studies show that the evaporation rates 
for different parts of the ocean have increased since the seventies. There is 
observational evidence of more rainfall in northwest Europe. This is due to 
an increase in the frequency of the zonal circulations (leading to more winds 
from the sea), causing wetter and milder winters. At one station in the 
Netherlands, an increase of +5% has been measured over the period 
1961-1990 (compared to 1930-1960). In the United States and in the 
monsoon regions increases in the frequency of heavy rainfall events have also 
been observed.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	The possibility of substantial precipitation changes must be considered as 
realistic. In spite of the uncertainties and the lack of quantitative data we 
are fairly confident that, as a prediction, it is qualitatively correct. Given the 
nature of weather statistics, a small change in the mean weather comes with 
changes in the frequency and magnitude of what we call extreme events.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	Records on recent flooding and on paleoflooding indicate the high sensitivity 
of flood occurrence to changing climate for river basins in the USA and 
Europe. Analyses also indicate that there is no simple proportionality 
between the scale and frequency of floods and climate variations. However, in 
general, increases in precipitation lead to proportionally larger increases in 
runoff.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	Runoff can be considered as the hydrological response of river basins to 
climate conditions. Studies presented here indicate that winter runoff 
responses of alpine and nonalpine-related German river streams have 
increased since 1965 (+26%), and a upward trend in runoff peaks in the 
Meuse (10-12%) after 1911 (compared to the period 1882-1910). Another 
study shows increases in natural streamflows (unaffected by human 
intervention) all over the USA, illustrating that rainfall on this continent has 
indeed increased. This supports the hypothesis that enhanced greenhouse 
forcing produces an enhanced hydrologic cycle.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	Several hydrologic modelling studies indicate that greater precipitation will 
cause higher runoff and an increase in soil moisture, as expected. For the 
Rhine river, it is estimated that a 20% increase in precipitation will double 
the occurrence of what used to be an one-in-two year peak flow event. 
However, it is difficult to distinguish climate-change induced effects in the 
river regimes from changes caused by the natural variability of the climate, 
and various man-made alterations (urbanisation, land use, drainage, 
channelisation, dams etc.). Separating these from other effects can be done 
by modelling, but such studies are currently in a very early stage.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gpdotsm.gif">	The recent floods in northwest Europe (1993, 1995), and in the USA (1993) 
were caused primarily by unusually high rainfall amounts in combination 
with a saturation of soil due to preceding rainfall (and, to a lesser extent, 
human interference in the catchment basin). Individual flooding events can 
not be attributed directly to the enhanced greenhouse effect. According to 
the predictions presented above an increase of flooding is what we expect as a 
result of the enhanced greenhouse effect. The recent floods cannot be taken 
as a proof of climate change as the associated rainfall events still fit in the 
natural variability of our climate, and floods of comparable magnitude have 
been observed earlier this century. What can be said is that an increased fre-
quency of unusual amounts of rainfall and floods as we have witnessed over 
the last decade are consistent with the climate model predictions.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Climate Time Bomb: 1994 Update</H1>

    <P>
Greenpeace has produced the first-ever catalogue of recent record climatic 
events around the world. It covers the period since the release of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) First Assessment report 
in 1990.  The <A HREF="../ctb/index.html">Climate Time Bomb catalogue</A>, including this Update, records 
droughts, floods, record storms and other climate related extreme events 
from 1990 to early 1995.  
    <P>
Whilst no single extreme event, nor sequence of events, can  be attributed to 
the greenhouse effect, Greenpeace believes that the totality of the planet's 
climatic experience since 1990, indicates that the first footprint of climate 
change  as a result of the human-enhanced greenhouse effect is now 
becoming clear. We are not alone in this view. The respected Enquete 
Commission (the German Bundestag's  advisory body on climate change) 
stated in its 1992 report  that 'Our planet is already warming at an 
increasing rate. The first signs of climate change are already measurable and 
noticeable. Hence there is no reason any more to delay  urgently required 
actions.'
    <P>
On the scientific front, in 1994, the IPCC concluded that stabilisation of  
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations  can be  attained only with global 
human-induced emissions  that  eventually drop to substantially below 1990 
levels.  
    <P>
Further, it concluded that  'Perhaps the most important result ... is that 
stabilization of [CO2] emissions does not lead to stabilisation of CO2 
concentration; in fact, the calculations show that concentrations continue to 
increase slowly for at least several centuries.'
    <P>
The 1994 IPCC report also warned that a 'positive feedback' between rising 
temperature and CO2 levels is likely, with future greenhouse gas induced 
warming possibly triggering further, very large releases of CO2 and methane 
to the atmosphere: A clear correlation between atmospheric CO2 
concentration and global temperature (especially during warming periods) is 
evident from the Ice-core records.  
    <P>
The following are extracts of reports linking  warming trends, with melting 
ice, drought, floods and disease during 1994/95:
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <I><B>Indian plague due to climate change?</B></I>
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=8 SRC="srboy.gif">
In November 1994, Professor Paul Epstein, of the Harvard School  of Public 
Health's working group on new disease wrote to  the New York Times 
associating the unusually hot, wet climatic conditions which prevailed at the 
time with the  outbreak of pneumonic plague in India in September.  Epstein  
pointed out that the Indian plague is part of a larger pattern of disease 
emergence and resurgence world-wide, which may be linked to climate 
change, and considers that  climate change may be liberating pests and 
pathogens from  ecological controls and predation.  'Rodents and insects 
carry no passports,' wrote Epstein.
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <I><B>Temperature rise suits malaria </B></I>
    <P>
The medical journal, the Lancet, reported in March that the temperature 
between 1961 and 1990 increased greatly, and in  the late 1980's, malaria 
became established in areas where it was previously absent or rare. 
Nationally, cases rose by  266 percent. Considerable mortality in previously 
unexposed populations is likely.
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <I><B>Global temperatures continue to rise</B></I>
    <P>
In 1994, recent figures show that, global temperature was the third or 
fourth highest  on record.  In Canada research showed that the permafrost  
has warmed appreciably, resulting in many areas now close to thawing point. 
In other areas, thawing has already  begun. Some researchers reported that 
during the last 26 years, the southern limit of the permafrost region has  
moved 120 km north.

    <P>
    <IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 SRC="srpeng.gif">
 Recent reports indicate a melting of sea ice around the Antarctic Peninsula, 
an observation which is suspected to be  the cause of the decline in Adelie 
penguins which rely on  the ice for shelter and survival. Almost every ice 
sheet on its coast is shrinking, as warmer summer temperatures melt the 
continents frozen wilderness. Warming of the Arctic permafrost is also 
pronounced.

In the Pacific, high sea temperatures were linked with unprecedented mass

    <IMG ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=8 SRC="srcoral.gif">
Spanish and American researchers reported that the deep ocean, at a depth 
of 800-2500 metres, in the Atlantic Ocean  between Europe and the 
Caribbean warmed by a third of a degree in the last 35 years. The warming 
is  surprisingly deep, but is consistent with climate model projections, as well 
as observations from the Pacific and  Southern Oceans, and the 
Mediterranean Sea reported in 1993.

In Switzerland, scientists claim that the retreat of glaciers gives a clear signal

<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B><I>Australia and New Zealand bake</B></I>
    <P>
1994 and 1995 saw widespread floods and droughts and associated forest or 
bush fires. During the Southern Hemisphere winter, New Zealand suffered 
the worst drought in living memory.
    <P>
In Australia, the fourth consecutive year of drought drastically affected 
production of wheat, canola, barley, cotton, oilseeds and sorghum, prompting 
dire warnings of huge economic losses.  'It's not an intermittent disaster. It's 
coming now quite regularly with climate change effects,' Prime Minister Paul 
Keating said of the droughts.

<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B><I>Fires and heatwaves across Europe</B></I>
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 SRC="srtree.gif">
The 1994 Northern Hemisphere summer saw a record heatwave right across 
Europe, the hottest and sunniest on record in most places from the 
Netherlands to Hungary and Poland. It caused widespread forest fires across 
Spain and the western US; rail tracks to bend in the Czech Republic; and algal 
blooms off the German Coast. The then German Environment Minister Klaus 
Toepfer blamed climate change. Japan suffered its hottest day in history.    
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B><I>Europe hit by floods</B></I>
    <P>
For the second time in two years, in January 1995 Europe was  struck by a 
'hundred year' flood, resulting in the evacuation of 250,000 Dutch people 
and costing billions of  US dollars.  IPCC climate experts rejected claims that 
the  flood was caused by agricultural practices.  Instead, experts claim, it was 
caused by the unusually lengthy rainfall.  
   <P> 
Pier Vellinga from the IPCC said that though the floods  were not proof of 
climate change, they were consistent with  the projections of general 
circulation models (GCMs).

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>New Energy Deal</H1>





<I>
"Behold the blessed vision of the sun no longer pouring his energies 
unregulated into space but by means of photo  electric cells and thermopiles 
these powers gathered into electric store houses to the total extinction of 
steam engines and the utter repression of smoke".</I><FONT SIZE=-1> Rolo Appleyard - solar researcher - 1891</FONT SIZE>
  
  
  <P>
Energy is a basic resource without which much of what we expect from 
industrial societies would be impossible. For developing countries access to 
secure energy supplies and to efficient energy using technologies is one of 
the pre-requisites for economic and social development.
   <P> 
Ecologically however the world cannot afford a continuation  of  
industrialized countries' energy intensive consumption  pattern, nor for 
developing countries to follow that path  into the future.
   <P> 

The scale of the problem can be seen from a few simple numbers. Mid-range 
estimates project a five-fold increase in global primary energy demand by 
2100 along with a 3.5 fold increase in CO2 emissions from 6.1 billion tonnes 
of carbon per year to around 21 billion tonnes. Apart from a multitude of 
other serious environmental problems associated with the use of fossil fuels, 
such as  acid rain, such an increase in CO2 emissions would lead to massive 
climatic change. 
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B><I>Fossil fuel failure</B></I>
    <P>
       
Huge infusions of lending for energy infrastructure averaging $40 billion 
every year over the past 20 years have resulted in  crushing debt loads for 
many developing countries. Newly- industrialising nations are discovering  
that  fossil fuel  energy sources come at a high  economic, social and 
environmental cost.
  <P>
The 'nuclear option' has also proved an expensive failure in the  
industrialised world,  where a virtual standstill in nuclear  projects has been 
in  force for some years. Worse, these  nuclear programmes have resulted in 
large stockpiles of weapons- usable plutonium. 
  <P>
The need to meet the world's energy needs at a time of ecological limits on 
energy use and increasingly scarce  capital for energy expansion, demands 
new solutions which step off the road of unsustainable and destabilising 
fossil and nuclear fuels.  
  <P>
The new solutions can achieve the benefits of affordable and  sustainable 
energy without the  drawbacks of conventional  fuels for all nations, 
including  the world's poorest.  The time has come for a new, global energy 
deal.
  <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B><I>Fossil free future</I></B>
  <P>
  <IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 SRC="srdonkey.gif">
A global economic and energy modelling study commissioned by Greenpeace 
from the Stockholm Environment Institute investigated the feasibility of 
avoiding dangerous rates of  climate change.
  <P>
 
The main results of the study, which adopted conventional UN economic 
development and population growth assumptions, demonstrate that it is  
economically and technically feasible to phase out fossil fuels and nuclear 
power. Major improvements in energy efficiency, especially in the  transport, 
buildings and electricity sectors would yield major  reductions in CO2 
emissions. The rapid introduction of renewables such as wind, solar and 
biomass is essential to  both achieve the early reductions in emissions and to 
ultimately eliminate CO2 emissions.  
  <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B><I>The solutions</I></B>
  <P>  
Energy efficiency combined with advanced renewable power systems can 
address both the environmental and economic costs of supplying energy 
services.  
    <P>
Energy services are what people, or industry actually use. These include 
cooking, lighting, industrial process heat, transport, and so on. Energy supply 
(i.e. coal, oil, gas, nuclear, solar, biofuels, hydro) is the raw material used to 
drive the energy service.  Energy efficiency refers to the quantity (and 
quality) of the energy supply used to create a unit of   energy service. The 
higher the efficiency the lower is the required amount of energy supply. 
   <P> 
There is vast scope for improving the efficiency of energy  use both now 
with available technology and in the future  with continuing technological  
development.
    <P>
     <IMG ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=8 SRC="sreli.gif">
Renewable energy is energy that can be obtained, directly or indirectly, from 
natural flows of sunlight, water, and air. Renewable systems include solar 
photovoltaic power systems, solar hot water systems, wind turbines, bio-fuel 
plantations, hydroelectric systems and so on.  These energy sources are 
sustainable because they never 'run out'.  Most   importantly, though, is the 
fact that many renewable energy   applications such as wind power and 
solar thermal are already cheaper than conventional fuels, even though fossil 
and nuclear power enjoy the advantage that their price does not reflect their 
full environmental and economic costs.
    <P>
Many of these energy options can be designed, built, and exploited locally 
and at less economic cost than conventional systems. They produce strong 
positive impacts for national economies because they exploit indigenous 
labour and materials. In rural areas, the most sophisticated solar arrays can 
provide sufficient high-quality energy at a cost lower than from electricity 
grids - and radically improve the living conditions of the world's poorest 
people. 
    <P>
Similar solar solutions are also available for industrial applications to supply 
reliable grid connected electricity. In the United States, as part of a plan to 
develop a 1,000 MW Solar Enterprise Zone in the Nevada desert, ENRON has 
announced plans to build a 100 MW solar power station. Such a power 
station would be the largest solar operation in the United States, producing 
enough power for a city of 100,000 people.  
    <P>
Most important of all is the need to spark a rapid growth in the use of 
renewable energy technologies.  Developed countries must take the lead in 
sharing the existing  technology - both advanced and mundane - that  makes 
the  solar revolution possible. These countries should aim to achieve a 
minimum 3% per year penetration of their own energy supply system with 
renewable technologies. Developing countries need to adopt policies which 
favour renewable energy over yet more huge centralised power stations.
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B><I>Solar power for the developing world</B></I>
    <P>
On the eve of the 21st century 2 billion people, some seventy per cent of the 
developing world's population, are without electricity, reliant on 19th 
century fuels to provide basic services, such as lighting. Solar photovoltaics 
(PV) offers developing nations an immediate and direct alternative to 
kerosene lamps, diesel generators, fossil fuelled utilities and expensive grid 
extensions, while satisfying the demand for household electric power.  
    <P>
Today some 200,000 families around the world use small household PV 
systems to power energy efficient lighting and other appliances. These 
people represent the largest group of domestic users of solar electricity in 
the world.  For the vast majority of the two billion people without electricity, 
solar PV is the most cost effective, affordable and available power source.
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B><I>Solar potential</I></B>
    <P>
Currently the size of the PV world market (some 60 MW/year)  is well below 
what is required to satisfy the demands of the rural population of the 
developing world. The total capacity of PV that would be required to meet 
the basic needs of the 2 billion people without electricity services is some 
140 GW of PV.  Since 1976 some 450 MW of solar PV  has been produced.
    <P>
The European Commission's Power for the World' programme (a global PV 
action plan) estimates providing solar electricity to a billion people in the 
developing world would cost $60 billion ($3 billion a year for 20 years). This 
is only 3% of annual energy investments in developing countries and less 
than 0.5% of current military expenditure.

200,000 solar PV systems are installed around the world, including 37,000 
in Mexico, 20,000 in Kenya, 16,000 in Indonesia, 15,000 in China, 4,500 in 
Sri Lanka, 4,000 in the Dominican Republic and 1,000 in Brazil.
    <P>
    <IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=8 SRC="srpanel.gif">
In Kenya more rural households obtain their electricity from  solar energy 
than from the official policy of grid extension.  Around 1 MW of PV power 
has been installed in Kenya. Around 20,000 households have purchased solar 
PV for their homes compared to the 17,000 connected to the official rural 
electrification programme.
    <P>
     
In the Dominican Republic, Enersol, a US-based non-governmental 
organisation, has successfully trained local entrepreneurs to assemble, 
market, install and service PV systems, and to develop a community based 
solar NGO to manage revolving loan funds allowing full cost recovery finance 
of the solar systems. The programme began in 1985 with 6 systems, grew to 
a 100 in 1987, more than 1,000 in 1989 and 4,500 in 1994. Since 1992, 
Enersol has replicated their successful Dominican programme in Honduras 
and Guatemala and contributed to projects in Bolivia and Costa Rica. The 
Solar Electric Light Fund (SELF) has taken the Enersol model and has 
established a number of successful solar seed' projects around the world.

In the developing world, solar electric power generation is cost-competitive 
with utility grid extensions. Despite the high up front costs, solar 
electrification remains the least   cost alternative when calculated over the 
twenty year life of the solar panels. Utilising the sun's distribution system is 
far cheaper than stringing wires at $10,000 a mile to deliver fossil fuelled or 
nuclear powered electricity to rural populations.
  <P>
With a wholesale re-direction of the lending regimes of multilateral banks, 
such as the World Bank so that priority is given to energy efficiency and 
renewable energy solar power will allow governments to deliver their 
promises of electricity for all without jeopardising the environment.

<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <I><B>Postscript: What is photovoltaic (PV) technology ?</B></I>
<P>
PV power is the conversion of sunlight 
directly into   electricity. The photo (light) voltaic (effect) was first 
discovered in the 18th century.  The first solar cells were developed in 1954. 
Since 1980 costs have dropped ten fold making PV a cost-effective way of 
delivering pollution free electricity directly to the user. As well as providing 
reliable cost- effective pollution free electricity solar PV provides additional 
benefits such as improved health, literacy and education and helps to slow 
urban migration.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Funding Climate Change?</H1>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>The World Bank's fossil fuel addiction</H3>


Developing country economies are directly threatened by climate change, as 
forestries, fisheries, agriculture, and human health face major challenges. 
Almost all of the developing country signatories to the climate convention 
are members of the World Bank and other regional multilateral development 
banks (MDBs).
  <P>
The climate convention will allocate funds to help developing countries set 
up projects aimed at reducing CO2 emissions, largely through the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF) administered by the World Bank.  Under the 
Climate Convention, the GEF's main aim is to help developing countries in the 
fight against climate change through renewable energy projects
   <P> 
Since negotiations for the climate convention began in 1991, developing 
countries continue to oppose the World Bank's management of the GEF, and 
with good reason.  
    <P>
Most of the World Bank's involvement with climate change has  been in 
funding it. The bank has financed enormous fossil fuel projects in developing 
countries through its energy lending- departments where the policies totally 
ignore the Bank's responsibilities under the comparatively tiny GEF. In 1994, 
the Bank lent $2.76 billion in the conventional energy sector and $3.29 
billion in the transport sector. Compare this with GEF projects which will add 
up to just $300 million a year. A losing battle in the fight against climate 
change. 
    <P>
The regional development banks, especially the Asian Development Bank, 
are taking the lead in starting to work towards developing renewable energy 
policies for all their energy lending. But the World Bank continues to operate 
with inconsistent energy policies - one arm funding huge fossil fuel projects 
and the other feebly trying to stop it. 
    <P>
Furthermore, more than half of the GEF's designated Global Warming' 
projects in pilot phase went to energy projects in the fossil fuel sector. 
    <P>
The result. Local pollution levels soar and global CO2 emissions continue to 
increase dramatically.
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B>Greenpeace demands:</B>
<P>
In order to meet their commitments under the GEF, the Multilateral 
Development Banks must adopt a consistent CO2 reduction policy across all 
energy lending, to be based on comprehensive least cost energy plans, and 
including environmental and social costs in sector and project
 evaluations.
  <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B>A Case In Point: India</B><BR>
<P>
  <IMG ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=8 SRC="srshack.gif">
In 1994, the World Bank announced a new commitment to enhance 
renewable energy development.  But its double standards persisted. While 
the bank's intentions seemed honourable, it continues to support, with a 
$400 million loan, a controversial 2000 MW coal fired power plant expansion 
in the Singrauli region in eastern central India.  No Environmental Impact 
Assessment was carried out, no least cost energy plan was laid out, and 
certainly no CO2 emissions have been calculated.  
  <P>

Over the next ten years, the World Bank plans to provide $1.2 billion for the 
construction of 14 new coal fired power plants and two gas-fired power 
plants around India. This expansion plan will produce an annual minimum 
100 million tonnes of CO2.   On top of this, a  $300 million coal mining 
expansion loan is currently under preparation for India.
  <P>
At Singrauli, the World Bank's project has led to the relocation of 51,000 
people; coal mining has turned the area into a moonlike landscape; drinking 
water is polluted and there are widespread health problems.  Ironically, 
about 60% of the regions' inhabitants do not have electricity in their homes - 
it is mostly exported.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Insurers And Bankers Waking Up To Climate Change</H1>

The climatic destabilization which would be caused by climate change now 
clearly threatens insurance companies with unmanageable catastrophe 
losses, threatening banks with significant physical risks to the projects for 
which they provide loans.  
    <P>
These institutions are now starting to recognise that a destabilising climate 
could well cause untold economic disruption. 
    <P>
Leading insurers speak in growing numbers of their fears that global 
warming could bankrupt the $1,400 billion insurance industry. A collapse of 
global property-catastrophe insurance
reserves in the face of escalating windstorm, flood, and drought-related 
wildfire losses would pose dire knock-on economic problems. These would 
apply to insurers, bankers, and pension
 funds alike.
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <I><B>Investments at risk</B></I>
<P>
The private financial institutions control a vast and growing share of equity 
markets. Global warming threatens the long term security of fossil fuel 
investments - whether by the private financial institutions, or other 
institutions - in a way which is as yet little appreciated by investors. 
Investing in carbon-fuel industries - coal or gas-fired power plants, or oil 
exploration projects, for instance - may seem like safe bets in 1995. But coal, 
oil and gas (the carbon fuels) are by far the largest source of the greenhouse 
gases which cause global warming, the effects of which may already be 
taking its toll on those who invest in carbon fuels.  
    <P>
Greenpeace commissioned a report from the Delphi Group of financial 
consultants, written by a former Director and Chief Analyst with Chase 
Investment Bank. 'Climate change presents major long term risks to the 
carbon fuel industry,' this report concludes. 'These risks have not yet been 
adequately discounted by financial markets.'
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <I><B>Insurers</B></I>
  <P>
The President of the Reinsurance Association of America told Time magazine 
in 1993 that: 'the insurance business is first in line to be affected by climate 
change... it could bankrupt the industry.' Greenpeace has now heard such 
sentiments expressed, by very senior figures in the industry, in London, 
Zurich, Munich, New York, and Tokyo.
    <P>
Eugene Lecomte, President of the US Insurance Institute for Property Loss 
Reduction, explained the worst-case analysis in 1993 at a conference on 
climate change organised by Greenpeace, the US College of Insurance, and 
insurance consultants ET&T. 
    <P>
    <IMG ALIGN=right HSPACE=8 SRC="srriver.gif">
'Despite the fact that the industry is financially healthy,' Lecomte said, 'and 
has some $160 billion in surplus, in two events you could take 70 billion, or 
maybe  80 billion of that surplus away and you'd cripple the industry. It 
wouldn't be able to take on new risks. It wouldn't have the capacity to 
underwrite the business of the future. We'd have massive, massive 
availability problems.'
    <P>
In 1993, Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, called on governments, 
businesses, and insurers alike to 'take immediate action' to address the 
'dramatic development of natural catastrophes. ...The threatened climatic 
changes demand urgent and drastic measures,' the company stressed.
     <P>      
In the UK, the Chartered Insurance Institute Society of Fellows set up a 
Study Group on climate change and insurance. It concluded in a 1994 report 
that 'the industry has a limited breathing space in which to gather its wits, 
and plan in a truly long term timeframe.' It recommended many options, one 
of which was that 'all investment managers should modify their investment 
policies to take account of the potential direct and indirect effects of global 
warming' .
    <P>
Swiss Re, the world's second biggest reinsurer, wrote in a 1994 report that: 
'human intervention in the natural climatic system could accelerate global 
climatic change to such an extent that society may no longer be able to adapt 
quickly enough.' It noted that society had a duty to respond, and that 'there 
is no shortage of practical suggestions, especially with regard to a drastic 
reduction of greenhouse gases'

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Questions And Answers On The Climate Protocol</H1>

<BR CLEAR>
.
  <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B>Q: Why does the Climate Convention need a Protocol?</B>
  <P>
 <B>A:</B>   The Framework Convention on Climate Change is just that - a framework.  
Real progress towards the achievement of its objective can only come 
through the adoption of a protocol (or protocols) to the Convention. Protocols 
are crucial: without them, the Convention would become an ineffective and 
useless 'sleeping treaty.' For example, the emission commitments in the 
convention only require that developed countries stabilize their emissions at 
1990 levels from the year 2000, yet real reductions are needed to avert the 
threat of massive climate change.
    <P>
When the convention was negotiated it was agreed that the Berlin Climate 
Summit would  review the adequacy of  the emission commitments for 
developed countries and  take appropriate action   
  <P>
The consensus of legal views is that negotiation of the protocol is preferable 
to amending the Convention itself, owing to its complexity.
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B>Q:  How does it work? </B>
    <P>
<B>A:</B>   Adoption of a protocol by the Convention does not become  legally 
binding until the required number of countries have ratified it, and then 
only on those countries that have done so. The voting requirements for 
adoption of a protocol have  yet to be agreed, and in fact remain hotly 
disputed.
    <P>
A protocol needs to be proposed six months before the Conference of the 
Parties for it to be considered for adoption.
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B>Q:  Are there any examples in place now? </B>
    <P>
<B>A:</B>   The 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete  the Ozone Layer, 
has delivered a concrete programme for progressively eliminating the 
production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances such as CFCs.  
The 1985 Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer provided 
the legal framework  for the Montreal Protocol.   Since its inception, and as 
the ozone layer deteriorated, the Montreal  Protocol has been tightened up, 
making major advances  towards stopping production of the harmful gases 
which destroy the ozone layer.  
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B>Q:  Are there any proposals on the table for Berlin?</B>
    <P>
<B>A:</B>   The Permanent Representative of Trinidad and Tobago to  the United 
Nations in New York, on behalf of the 36 nation  Alliance of Small Island 
States, submitted a draft protocol  on 20 September, 1994, calling for 
developed countries to  adopt a CO2 emission reduction target of 20% from 
1990 levels by the year 2005.  The German Government submitted  further 
elements  to the AOSIS protocol on 22 September.   Both documents have 
now been formally transmitted by official negotiators to Berlin.
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B>Q:  Whose responsibility is it to negotiate the Protocol?</B>
    <P>
<B>A:</B>   All Parties to the Convention have to be involved in its  negotiation.  The 
main responsibility however lies with the biggest CO2 polluters of the 
industrialised countries - the OECD, central and eastern Europe and the 
Russian Federation.
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B>Q: What is the main element it should contain?</B>
    <P>
<B>A:</B>   A Protocol should include, at a minimum, the commitment  for 
industrialised countries to cut CO2 emissions by 20% by  2005 i.e. a target 
and a timetable for emission reductions.   This would, however, be just a first 
step towards cutting  CO2 emissions back to a safe level.  
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"><B>Q:  Can a protocol still be adopted at Berlin?</B>
    <P>
<B>A:</B>   Yes, given sufficient political will from developed countries. 
    <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B>Q: What else should a protocol contain?</B>
    <P>
<B>A:</B>   In order to support country programmes to meet emission  reduction 
targets, and to overcome competitiveness concerns, the protocol also needs to 
contain  a package of measures  stating clear objectives for:
  <UL>
   <DT><IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> Global minimal standards for  international  energy- consuming 
technologies, such as motor vehicles
  <P>
   <DT><IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> Standards for increased adoption of energy efficiency  and renewable 
energy technologies,
  <P>
   <DT><IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> Adoption of climate friendly policies in the field of  buildings and 
transport, as well as for the management of electricity and gas utilities i.e. 
integrated resource planning (IRP).  
  <P>
   <DT><IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> Removal of subsidies to fossil fuels and nuclear power. The protocol also 
needs to contain commitments to provide  financial and technology 
assistance for developing countries in order  to accelerate the adoption of the 
energy efficiency and renewable energy systems.
  </UL>
  <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B>Q:  Why not just measures and polices rather than targets and  timetables 
for emission reductions?</B>
  <P>
 <B>A:</B>   Without clear emission targets to drive the development  of policies and 
measures, the latter will be little more  than statements of the lowest 
common denominator. Negotiations on targets and timetables are necessary 
to send  a clear signal to policy makers and industry.  In this context, legally 
binding  targets and timetables  for emission reductions have been essential, 
for example, to the  success of the Montreal Protocol.  Indeed, without the 
existence of the current target in the Convention, it is  doubtful whether the 
current public policy debates occurring  in many industrialised countries 
now would be as sharp and focused as they are.  As industrialized
 countries grapple in the next  phase of their national plans to limit CO2 and 
other greenhouse gas emissions, the existence of targets will become more 
and more important as a basic, underlying policy  parameter.  
  <P>
<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="sundotsm.gif" ALT="dot!"> <B>Q:  What are some of the obstacles to the adoption of a protocol?</B>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> The failure of many industrialised countries to demonstrate  that they can 
and will implement their existing commitments  in the Convention has 
caused many developing countries, including China, to question the motives 
behind a protocol  negotiation at this stage.
  <P>
<LI> The USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have linked  further 
emission commitments by industrialized countries to  commitments by 
developing countries.  This is seen by developing countries as grossly unfair 
and against the principles in the convention.  Whilst most participants 
acknowledge the need for developing countries to ultimately  take action, it 
is widely accepted that the first phase in  the global response has to be taken 
by developed countries,  which produce over 75% of global CO2 emissions.
  <P>
<LI> The negotiators are still stuck in a discussion on the  voting rules for the 
adoption of a protocol (Rule 42).   It  is up to the Convention process to 
decide its own rules and  these need to be adopted at Berlin.   However some 
Parties,  particularly the OPEC states Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, want a  
Protocol to be adopted by consensus.  This would effectively  block any 
protocol with emission commitments.   The two thirds majority also proposed 
is enough to reflect the will of the meeting.

<P>
The last big power station in Germany, a 750 megawatt plant at
Grevenbroich in the Rhineland brown-coal region, has been shut down.
The plant had remained to the last in the hands of the former
Rhineland-Westphalia electricity giant, RWE. The shutdown also means
the biggest single source of carbon dioxide has run dry. At the same
time the hundredth German 50 megawatt-plus solar power station was
started up on the same site in the presence of the USE Energy Minister.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=5 SRC="turnaround.gif" ALT="Photo of Power Station">
In his address the chairperson of the USE Government Council, Bettino
Calderone, praised Germany's service in pioneering the radical change
in the way energy is supplied in the world. "Germany has shown that
turning away from the large-scale production of energy is viable, sound
economic policy," he said.

<HR WIDTH=80%>

The other USE states had likewise taken this
path, but still needed a few years before being able to remove their
remaining inefficient power stations from the grid. "But only in this
way will we achieve the goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 80
per cent of their 1990 levels." 
<P>
The shutdown of the Grevenbroich power
station also saw the completion of the RWE's own reorganisation. One of
what used to be the biggest electricity suppliers has become one of the
biggest manufacturers of photovoltaic facilities.  It has managed in
its labora- tories to improve the efficiency of solar cells almost to
the physical limit. Another company priority is its energy consultancy,
in which it works for local authorities and industrial companies to
devise and install the most economical systems for obtaining energy.
<P>
The energy "turnaround" began in Germany in 1995. Feeling the impact
made by the first indications of the greenhouse effect, the Government
launched an extensive programme of energy saving and at last passed the
ecological tax reform which had long been a matter of controversy. At
the heart of the new policy was an energy tax on non-renewable sources
of energy.  This created perceptible incentives for industry to avoid
squandering energy and switch to environmentally sounder technologies. 
Household consumption of electricity was then also able to be reduced
by about half. Federal and state Governments called for the
construction of smaller, decentralised, combined heat-and-power plants
90 per cent efficient in their use of fuel. Not even at optimal
operation can large-scale power stations achieve this efficiency. They
transform only 40 per cent of the energy they use into electricity.
<P>
Parallel to this, in a step which had long been called for by
environmental organisations, billions of marks were made available for
research on renewable energies.  This then made possible the gradual
shutdown of nuclear and fossil-fuel power stations.

A hundred and sixty UN member states achieved the breakthrough in
climate protection twenty-five years ago. At the conference of parties
to the Climate Convention which took place in the German capital from
28 March until 7 April 1995, these countries agreed to a binding
protocol on reducing the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. Emissions of
CO2 had to be reduced by 20 per cent of their 1990 level by the year
2005. An overall reduction of 80 per cent by the year 2050 was
prescribed. Over and above this the industrialised nations bound
themselves to transfer know-how on energy saving and effective energy
production to poor countries, doing so at no cost to the countries
involved. 
<P>
The protocol was not passed until the last minute. Thanks not least to
the German delegation's negotiating skills, a majority of those
participating were won over to reductions on the basis of a draft made
by the alliance of small island states, AOSIS.

Energy
consumption in Germany has fallen by about 60 per cent in the last
twenty-five years. The former industrialised countries now operate a
"sustainable market economy" by relying on solar energy for two-thirds
of their requirements.  
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="oliver.gif" ALT="Oliver Worm">
They use wind energy, biomass, and
decentralised hydro and solar power.  The heavily checked rise in
population in the former develo-ping countries gives further cause for
hope, as does the fact that the concentration of greenhouse gas in the
atmosphere is stabilising. The danger of a collapse in the climate
seems to have been vanquished. What then remains for an environmental
organisation to do? 
<P>

After thirty years' struggle to protect the
environment and the climate Greenpeace is ending its transport, energy
and climate campaigns. True to the motto, "We are working to make
ourselves superfluous," some fifteen people at Greenpeace are shortly
going into early retirement. Their campaigns have been successfully
concluded - a success for Greenpeace and the environment. In future the
organisation will concentrate more on the issues of closed-cycle
production and use of resources, especially water and forests,
avoidance and minimisation of toxic waste, and genetic engineering.
Short-term profit interests continue to endanger the urgently needed
changeover to a way of life and kind of economic management which
respect the planet's natural limits.  Here Greenpeace will continue to
warn, keep watch and take effective action.

The Daimler Benz company's sales rose again last year by eleven per
cent. As its chairman reported at its annual press conference in
Berlin, only 20 per cent of the total company profit - made by its
subsidiary, Mercedes Benz - still came from private cars. Production
was exclusively of fuel-efficient cars doing over 115 miles to the
gallon.      
<P>
In 2019 roughly 60 per cent of sales were accounted for by
public transport, telecommunications, and its new subsidiary, the
Daimler Benz Car-Sharing company.  Daimler Benz's leading position in
environmentally-friendly private transport worldwide had, so the
company chairman said, been apparent at the trade fair on mobility
which had just come to an end.  There had been great interest in the
new energy-saving train and the further refined call-bus systems.
Mobility consultancy to local authorities and regions had increased
strongly, accounting for 15 per cent of total sales in 2019.

OPEC has disbanded itself at a historic meeting in Geneva. At the same
meeting representatives of all the former oil-exporting member states
founded the Organisation for Hydrogen Exporting Countries, OHEC. At its
end OPEC had been producing over 95 per cent of its energy exports with
hydrogen from energy obtained from the sun. In Saudi Arabia alone 
some 4,000 square miles of desert are bordered by photovoltaic panels. 
For some years now oil has only been extracted in small quantities for
special plastics and medicinal products. 
<P>
The Saudi Arabian Energy
Minister, Schams El Arab, said in Geneva that the turning point in
OPEC's energy policy began to made shortly before the Climate
Conference in Berlin in 1995. "We had no other choice. Either we had to
concentrate on alternative energies or go under, because it was no
longer possible to sell oil in large quantities."

In future the United Nations Environmental Disaster Council will only
be able to provide immediate aid in exceptional cases when there are
floods, storms or droughts. "We have no choice but to capitulate in the
face of the dramatically increasing number of natural disasters
resulting from the worldwide change in climate," admitted Richard
Warmer, spokesperson for the Council, a body set up by the UN Security
Council, in New York. The majority of the member states were behind
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=5 SRC="capitulate.gif" ALT="Photo of Flood">
with their payments, and many had also withdrawn their contingent from
the Disaster Corps.  Warmer presented a devastating resumee of the past
year. "The horrors entered a new dimension in 2019," he said. Never had
so many tornados crossed the USA.

Several big floods struck the
Mediterranean countries. The number of hurricanes was five times what
it had been in the year 2000. As a result of Windstorm Steve, for
example, ten thousand people on the Caribbean islands lost their lives
and four million became homeless. After the storm, epidemics spread.
<P>
For months health systems were in a state of collapse, and clean
drinking water was in short supply. "We almost completely used up
emergency reserves in supplying food to those affected in the Caribbean
and other regions hit by storms," Richard Warmer reported. The urgently
needed international food aid had not materialised because a persistent
drought in the USA and extremely heavy rains in the United States of
Europe had ruined harvests. 
<P>
The evacuation of the Kiribati Pacific island group last year also took
its toll. With the islands faced by terrific floods, the UN Disas-
ter Corps evacuated the atolls' 120,000 inhabitants at the request of
the small island states' alliance, AOSIS. The evacuees are to find a
new home in North-east New Zealand.
<P>
The UN Disaster Council appealed to the United States of Europe to open
its borders to more environmental refugees. For some two weeks now the
USE authorities have been refusing entry to several thousand Egyptians
drifting on ships off the Italian coast, having fled from the drought -
and floods -in their land. The USE Asylum Minister, Pierre de Coeur,
said a few days ago that the refugee camps were absolutely overcrowded.
"It is therefore unreasonable, on humanitarian grounds," said de Coeur,
"to allow still more people entry."

The international community of states twenty-five years ago missed the
opportunity to avert the collapse in the climate. From 28 March until 7
April 1995 a hundred and sixty nations met in the German capital for
the first conference of parties to the Climate Convention, this having
been signed at the UN Conference on Environment and Development at Rio
de Janeiro in June 1992. They bound themselves in the convention to
stabilising greenhouse-gas emissions at their 1990 level by the year
2000. In Berlin, a protocol with detailed goals for the reduction of
greenhouse gases, above all carbon dioxide, was supposed to be adopted
for the time until the end of the century. But in spite of clear signs
then of a change in the climate, the countries could not agree. The
industrialised nations, in particular, refused to enter into any
far-reaching obligations.

A new record storm. The worst floods in living memory. The longest
drought 
since weather statistics were first recorded. One after another,
reports such as these are having a marked influence on news and
reporting in the international media.  Whether the issue be climate

refugees and those seeking asylum from other environmental
catastrophes, or wars over water and what is left of the world's oil;
be it astronomically high economic damages, or an overtaxed UN Disaster
Corps - the climate, having been thrown off balance, has for a long
time been shaping international relations.
<P>

Scientists and environmental organisations have warned of this collapse
for over thirty
years - and only now are they being listened to. Too late! All that can
help now is a radical change in the economic system. The phaseout of
nuclear and fossil sources of energy, which could have been implemented
25 years ago, must be effected worldwide immediately - meaning without
any easing periods of transition. All investment must go into
establishing a
global economy with a solar
base, one using closed-loop systems and producing as little
toxic waste as possible. 
<P>
Rigid measures must be taken to ensure a
strict ban in the former industrialised countries on the consumption of
all products harmful to the climate. If we do not apply the emergency
brake hard now, the world's next
generations will have no chance at all.

Germans spend an average of three hours a day in traffic jams, it has
emerged from a study by the Frankfurt Institute for Time Management
carried out on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Economics, in which
some five thousand men and women were questioned. The time a car driver
spends at a standstill on the road has doubled since 2010. "The economy
incurs billions of marks of damages a day as a result of traffic jams,"
said the study director,
Otto Flimm Jr. Umpteen thousand people regularly arrived late at work.
Supply dates were almost never successfully met. 
<P>
The study again proved that
telematics, the electronic traffic control system, was a failure, Mr.
Flimm Jr said. The system was supposed to make it possible for car
drivers to reach their goal, albeit by roundabout routes, but with the
advantage of avoiding jams. But now not only the main traffic routes
are gridlocked, all minor roads and residential
streets are too.

<P>
The Saudi Arabian chief of staff announced that his troops had occupied
the whole of Oman and the Yemen following weeks of fighting. The attack
had been "necessary", said Emir Seif al-Harb, because for months the
Governments in Muscat and Sanaa had flouted their OPEC quotas and
exported too much oil. The war has already claimed thousands of
victims.

<A NAME="a2"><B>Ex-President regrets</B></A>
<P>
In Washington Ex-President Gore presented his memoirs, Earth on a
Tightrope.
In it he writes that the biggest mistake in his career was to 
have underestimated the importance of the 1995 Climate Conference in
Berlin, and to have done too little to prevent its failure.

The situation in Bangladesh has become more critical still following
the flood disaster in which 400,000 people died last week. The seventh
"flood of the century" since the year 2000 has left fifteen per cent of
the country under water and made 70 million people homeless. Supplies
of food and water have not yet been got through to those affected.

Mercedes Benz has presented its new model in Stuttgart.  The 45 h.p.
car has a top speed of 200 mph, at which speed it 
does ten miles to the gallon. 
A company spokesperson at the same time announced that the first
fuel-efficient car to do 75 miles to the gallon was expected to go into
mass production in 2022.

The whole of Europe will remain under the influence of a stable area of

beginning of February will continue. Maximum daytime temperatures will
be between 30 and 35 degrees Celsius, falling to 20 degrees at night.
The fire risk is extremely high on account of the long period of
dryness. Stricter water rationing also has to be expected.<BR CLEAR>

<br><font size=+2 COLOR="00ff55"><I><B>STOP THE HERRING DERBY!</B> </I></font>

<br clear=all><B>For the second time since the 1970s North Sea herring has been
brought to the brink of collapse. Mid way through 1996 emergency
measures had to be taken to halve the total catch allowed for
this year, throwing the fishing industry into turmoil. It is
debatable whether any catch should be allowed in 1997.

<p>Yet, at this crisis point, one of the very worst and least
defensible practices is about to start. This is the 'Herring
Derby': the annual congregation of shoals of herring that are
forced to run the gauntlet of powerful modern fishing vessels as
the fish pass from the North Sea to the English Channel to spawn. The
fishery is not primarily for the herring but for the roe, which are
exported to Japan for New Year's celebrations.</B>


<P><B><a href="../cbio/prdec11.html"><img width=40 height=40 ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=0 src="../icons/bionews.gif">PRESS RELEASE:</a>
December 11th 1996,  Greenpeace targets "Herring Derby" in English Channel

<p><!--a href="../cbio/*********"><img align=left border=0 width=35 height=35 src="
../icons/bioact.gif" HSPACE=5></A><B><a href="../cbio/******"> ACTION:</A> December 11th 1996  - ******</B-->


<font size=+2><p><I>Countdown to crisis:</I></font>

<B><p>In 1947 the spawning stock of North Sea herring was 5 million
tonnes. But, under a sustained onslaught, the stock was worn down
until, in the 1970s, it finally  crashed. Fishing was banned for six
long years. In the 1980s, so as to avoid a repeat, the management goal
was to build up the herring stock to 2.2 million tonnes. But the stock
never got higher than 1.3 million tonnes (in 1989) and then started to
fall. If minor but rapid adjustments in the catches had then been
made, all might have been well. 
<p>However European fisheries policy has repeatedly proved incapable of
delivering such adjustments. The blame for failure is widespread.
Fisheries scientists and managers were reluctant to believe the
evidence, knowing of the implications, and put off the warning.
Fishers demanded too many fish. A blind eye was turned to the huge
quantities that were being caught in the industrial fisheries for
sprat and other fish. A significant number of fishers mis-reported
their catches, saying that they were caught outside the North Sea, or
deliberately underestimated the amounts being sold, for example to the
eastern-European klondykers. 

<p>But in the end the buck stops with national Fisheries Ministers.
They failed to provide leadership and instead put off unpopular
decisions. The blame for this crisis rests principally with them.

<p>Earlier this year it became clear that the spawning stock had
fallen to just 500,000 tonnes and the politicians were faced with an
ultimatum from the fisheries scientists - 50% cuts now or a complete
ban in 1997, backed with the support of the European Fisheries
Commissioner, Emma Bonino. The Fisheries Ministers had little choice
but to agree to the cuts. However, as is usual, they did the absolute
minimum. 

<p>Few realise that the target they have now agreed - to restore the
stock to 800,000 tonnes - is not that of a healthy stock or that which
provides the maximum catch for fishers. It is what is called MBAL, the
Minimum Biologically Acceptable Level, below which the chance of stock
collapse is believed by fisheries scientists to increase dramatically.
One specific aspect of the scientific advice that they ignored was to
stop the Herring Derby in the English Channel.

<p><font size=+1>Herring Derby</font>
<p>The Herring Derby involves an important sub-stock of herring
which live in the North Sea proper, but spawn in the vicinity of
the Bay of Dieppe. The eggs are laid over gravel beds - where
they stick - at a depth of 20-50 metres. Upon hatching the young
drift northwards along the Dutch coast and most reach nursery
areas in the German Bight. The Derby involves principally Dutch-
owned vessels, including pair trawlers and supertrawlers, and
takes place in December. It gets its name from the frantic
manoeuvring of the boats to get the best line on the fish shoals
as they pass, and because it is all over in a  few weeks.

<p>The race is driven by the value of the roe. Vast amounts of money can
be made from it. But it is also completely unsupportable, as can be
readily confirmed by fishermen not engaged in the trade. It must stop.

<p><font size=+1>Ecological impact</font>
<p>Herring have a greater role in the world than that of making a
few fishers rich! It is one of a few species that occupy a
central place in the North Sea food-web. They are eaten by larger fish
including cod, whiting and mackerel.  Earlier this century, when
herring were abundant, it was an important food for bluefin tuna which
have since disappeared.  They are also important for other parts of
the North Sea food web, including numerous seabirds, seals, porpoises,
dolphins, orca and minke whales. Concern about the impact of the
herring fishery stretches beyond fisheries politics.


<p><font size=+1>What does Greenpeace want?</font>

<ul>
	<li>Specifically, we want the targeting of spawning stocks of
	herring in the North Sea to cease. <p>

	<li>Generally for North Sea herring catch levels should be limited
	so that the herring stock can grow to reach an interim target of
	2-3 million tonnes (what the fisheries ministers agreed in the
	1980s) and ultimately to a size that provides the maximum catches
	commensurate with minimum ecological impact.<p>

	<li>By-catch of juvenile herring in industrial fisheries must be
	rigorously restricted and controlled.<p>

	<li>Greenpeace wants a precautionary approach to be applied to
	fisheries. This concept is now recognised, by the European
	Commission and North Sea States, at least in principle, as the
	way forward with fisheries management. In simple terms it means
	that you take uncertainty fully into account, and avoid causing
	problems instead of attempting repairs after the event.<p>

 	<li>Greenpeace wants next March's crisis meeting between
	Environment and Fisheries Ministers in Bergen to agree an
	emergency recovery programme for North Sea fisheries, coupled
	with agreement on medium and long term reforms of fisheries
	management.<p>

<P><B>15th August 1996</B>


<font size=+1>

<UL> 

<LI>World fisheries are in crisis:


This is due to the industrialization of fisheries
<BR><BR>
<LI>Factory trawlers are 0.14% of the US fishing fleet and catch
over 20% of total fish catches operating at only one third of
total capacity.
<BR><BR>
<LI>The scale of factory trawlers is not sustainable, and their
global mobility allows them to leave fishing grounds that have
collapsed.
<BR><BR><LI>The first factory trawler was built by a whaling company,
factory trawlers are designed after factory whaling ships, and
they hunt like whalers (pulse fishing)

<BR><BR><LI>The Georges Bank and Grand Bank were overfished by factory
trawlers in the 1960s-1970s.  The fisheries were further
overfished due to management failures.

<BR><BR><LI>The Japanese factory trawler fleet grew from 4 boats to 42 in
less than a decade in the North Pacific and overfished pollock.

<BR><BR><LI>The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976
extended US jurisdiction to 200 miles from the coast, mandated an
end to overfishing and created councils to manage fisheries.

<BR><BR><LI>The Act failed to stop overfishing, did not require ecosystem
management and the precautionary approach, and failed to stop
conflicts of interest on the councils.  The Act furthered the
creation of a US factory trawler fleet.

<BR><BR><LI>US factory trawlers increased from none in the early 1980s to
over 50 in the early 1990s.

<BR><BR><LI>Their overcapacity has lead to a massive waste of fish: over
580 million pounds of fish annually.

<BR><BR><LI>They remove over massive quantities of pollock, which has the
largest biomass in the North Pacific and is at the core of the
food web.


<BR><BR><LI>Single species management and the definition of overfishing
used by managers are fundamentally flawed.

<BR><BR><LI>Catches of pollock in the last 30 years are unparalleled. 
Three significant stocks of pollock have collapsed or declined in
the North Pacific and the only large stock left is showing signs
of stress.

<BR><BR><LI>Seabirds, fur and harbor seals, and Steller sea lions have all
declined precipitously.  This has corresponded to factory trawler
fishing.  Competition 

<BR><BR><LI>Bottom trawls destroy marine habitat and midwater trawls kill
tremendous amounts of juvenile pollock.

<BR><BR><LI>Factory trawlers are not sustainable economically, many are
bankrupt but continue to fish to avoid greater losses not
operating.

<BR><BR><LI>The industry being consolidated into fewer companies.  American

Seafoods and Tyson control most of the fleet.

<BR><BR><LI>US factory trawlers are now moving to Russian waters with
subsidies from the US government.

<BR><BR><LI>Factory trawlers must be banned (we call for a phase-out by
2001).  A ban does not insure sustainable fisheries, that
requires adherence to the Principles for Ecologically-Responsible
Fisheries.

<BR><BR><LI>There is also an obligation to change US fisheries management
under UN treaties.

<h3>...here's just a few frightening factory trawler facts...</h3></center>
<ul>
<li>There are approximately 55 Seattle-based factory trawlers operating in the North Pacific. 
Just these 55 vessels were responsible for taking 60% of the 4.4 billion pounds of fish taken in the
North Pacific.</li>
<li>Some of the factory trawlers use nets with an opening as large as 2 miles in circumference. 
You could fit 228 houses on half acre lots in the opening of just one of these nets.</li>
<li>Our fisheries are drying up. Currently, 82% of managed fish stocks in the U.S. are fully or
over-exploited. In 1994, Alaskan groundfish factory trawlers threw overboard, dead or dying, over 572 MILLION
pounds of fish because they were the wrong sex, size or species.</li>

<P><B>Fishing is an ancient human tradition -- one that satisfies vital
food needs of hundreds of millions of people and is economically,
socially and culturally important.  Today, however, tradition has
been transformed into a  resource extraction industry spanning the
globe.  In its wake, fish populations are being dangerously
depleted; nature's balance is being altered across vast areas of
the world's oceanic ecosystems in ways that may be irreversible,
and key species in the complex, diverse web of marine life are
threatened.</B>

<H2>  GREENPEACE PRINCIPLES FOR ECOLOGICALLY RESPONSIBLE FISHERIES</H2>
 
            <H3>PRELIMINARY DOCUMENT - FEBRUARY 1996</H3>

<pre> 
Note: These Principles are being distributed in preliminary form.
Greenpeace welcomes any comments or suggestions for improvement.
These should be sent to Biodiversity Campaign Coordinator,
Greenpeace International, Keizersgracht 176, 1016 DW Amsterdam, The
Netherlands.
 
 
I. Introduction - Oceans, Fish, and Fisheries Threatened
 
1. Humanity depends for its survival on the healthy functioning  of
the planet's ecosystems. The oceans are the origin of life on earth
and are home to much of the earth's rich evolutionary  heritage  of
life forms and species.
 
2. Oceans  provide  many  essential  services  such  as  regulating
climate and cycling nutrients. They  are  vital  sources  of  food,
medicines and livelihood, and  of  cultural  and  spiritual  values
which give meaning to human societies.
 
3. The oceans sustain us, but  we  are  not  sustaining  them.  The
diversity  of  life  in  the   world's    oceans      is      being
dramatically  altered  by  the  excessive  exploitation   of  fish,
and other marine species.  Most    commercially      targeted  fish
populations and  many associated marine species are  in    decline.
In  addition,  marine and coastal ecosystems, as well as habitats
vitally important for fish  breeding  and rearing, are being
rapidly  degraded.
 
4. Not  only  is    marine  biodiversity  at  risk,  but  also  the
millions of people who depend on the sea for food and  livelihoods.
Industrial societies need to redefine their relationship  with  the
oceans.  A swift and  fundamental    transition  to    ecologically
responsible, low impact fishing is urgently needed.  Adjustments in
consumption patterns also are required.
 
5. Greenpeace supports ecologically  responsible  fishing.  Indeed,
Greenpeace believes that the  principles  expressed  here  are
achievable and, that if they are applied, there will be enormous
benefits, both for the environment and fishing communities.  But to
achieve this, sweeping  institutional,  social and economic reforms
are  required.  Ecologically    safe fishing levels must be set in
a precautionary way that takes into account our incomplete
understanding about the workings of  complex ecosystems.
 
6. Governments have the responsibility to act swiftly and
decisively  on  the  design  and  implementation  of programs  for
the effective control  and  management   of    their fisheries.
The fishing, fish processing,  and  trading  industries share in
this responsibility, and must demonstrate  to  the  public that
they can  act  responsibly  to  protect  marine  biodiversity.
Processes established to achieve ecologically responsible fisheries
must, above all,  be   genuinely  transparent  to  the  public  and
enable  the full  participation  of  public  interest  groups  that
have a genuine interest  in  protecting the health and integrity of
marine ecosystems.
 
7.  The complexity and scale of today's  crisis  in  fisheries mean
there  is  no  simple  panacea.   Each  fishery  has    unique
characteristics related to the social, economic  and  political
context, the  species  fished,  the  nature  of  the  exploited
environment,  and  the type of  technology  employed.
 
8. Thus, the Greenpeace Principles elaborate only the most
significant, general areas of reform,  while  more    specific
measures  must be  tailored  to  meet  each  set  of  unique local,
national or regional conditions.
 
II.  PRINCIPLES FOR ECOLOGICALLY RESPONSIBLE, LOW IMPACT FISHERIES
 
9. To minimise the risk of irreversible  damage  the  intensity  of
fishing  should  not  substantially  or  permanently  distort   the
character of the ecosystem. To achieve this, target stocks should
be maintained at a high proportion of the biomass that would occur
in the absence of fishing.
 
10. As a rule, a fishery must not jeopardise the ability of any
species  to  withstand  natural  or  human  induced fluctuations in
the environment.
 
11. A fishery must not endanger  any  species or population,  nor
inhibit  the recovery of  any  that  are  depleted,  threatened  or
endangered.
 
12.  The  catch of  non-target  species  or  undersized  fish
(bycatch)  in  fishing  operations  must  be  reduced    to  levels
approaching zero.   Any  remaining   bycatch    should    not    be
discarded, but instead brought to shore, unless it can be  returned
to the sea alive and in a healthy condition.
 
13. The destructive impacts of a fishing  activity   on    habitats
must be eliminated  (e.g.,  damage  to  coral reefs, seagrass beds,
bottom substrate).
 
14. Wasteful forms of fish production, and   fishing  for  wasteful
purposes, such as those which involve only a lethal harvest of roe,
must be eliminated.
 
15. Industrial reduction fisheries must be treated with  particular
caution because of the  potential  for  serious  food  web  impacts
caused by removal of such large amounts of the marine biomass at
critical trophic levels.
 
16. Toxic,   persistent,  or  bioaccumulative  substances  must not
be part of the production process.  Compounds which are  not
hazardous, should be either recycled, reused  or reprocessed.
 
17. Total  energy  consumption  of  the  product  cycle,  including
fisheries operations,  transport,  processing  and    distribution,
must be minimised.
 
18. CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs and  other  ozone  depleting  substances  and
refrigerants, as well  as  substances  that  contribute  to  global
warming must be eliminated from the  production  cycle, wherever
alternatives exist.
 
19. Packaging must be minimised in the first  instance, and should
be reusable or recyclable.
 
III. THE PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH
 
20. To compensate for humanity's enormous lack of understanding of
marine ecological processes, fishing must be based on the
Precautionary Approach.  The overriding objective of the
Precautionary Approach is to conduct fisheries activities in a
manner that ensures a  high  level  of probability that marine
species or ecosystems will not be seriously or irreversibly harmed.
This approach, among other things,  shifts the  burden of  proof
onto  those  that  seek  to  exploit  marine ecosystems,  and onto
those institutions  responsible  for fisheries management,  to
demonstrate that there will be minimal risk of serious or
irreversible harm.
 
21.  Our poor understanding of the marine environment demands  that
the emphasis be on prevention of damage, rather than attempts to
repair  mistakes  through  mitigation  or  restoration measures.
The precautionary approach, therefore, should apply  at all times,
even when stocks are abundant. To apply the precautionary approach
only  when fish stocks are low is a reactive response and the very
opposite of precaution.
 
22. No fishery shall be established or expanded until a
verifiable,  scientifically  based,  dynamic  management  procedure
with clear objectives has been established.  The performance of
such management procedures should  be  demonstrated,  by
simulation  or otherwise,  to  be  capable  of  ensuring  a  high
probability  of achievement of the objectives under a  wide  range
of  alternative assumptions and  scenarios about the dynamics of
the system.
 
23. No fishery shall be established or expanded in  the  absence of
reliable estimates of  the  minimum  size  of  the  target  species
biomass.    Where  scientific  data  or  other  reliable  forms  of
information  are inadequate  to  determine  the  likely  impact  of
fishing  on  the populations and the ecosystem of which they are
a part, fishing effort  should  be  restricted  to  an  extremely
low percentage  of   the  lowest  estimate  of  the  unfished
biomass, pending proper analysis.
 
24. Before introducing any new fishing methods or gear types into
a fishery a scientifically based environmental impact assessment
must demonstrate that such methods or gear will have no damaging
impact on the target fish populations, other associated species, or
their habitats. Existing gear and methods should also be subject to
such assessments and damaging gears or methods should be phased
out. Where a new gear or method is intended to replace an existing
one as an interim measure, it must be shown to have a less damaging
effect.
 
25. In fisheries where overexploitation has  severely  reduced  the
spawning stock biomass  or  substantially  altered  the  ecosystem,
moratoria on fishing should be imposed to assist recovery.
 
26. Development of management  procedures  and  supporting national
legislation that meet the above requirements must begin immediately
(1996) for all fisheries, with phased implementation over  a
decade-long  period, by which time  they  should  be  fully
operational worldwide.  Some flexibility is envisaged for small
scale, traditionally managed fisheries which have been stable for
20 years or more.
 
27. The  protection  of  the  marine  environment  is integral   to
effective  fisheries  conservation. Fisheries management should  be
part of an integrated planning system for  the  regulation  of  all
human activities that impact the coastal zone or  watershed  (e.g.,
for the protection of anadramous species such as salmon). All human
activities which have the potential for significant adverse impact
on the conservation of fish stocks and marine biodiversity should
be subject to environmental impact assessments and any adverse
impacts must be minimised and eliminated.
 
28.  Fisheries management concerns the management  of  fishers  and
their activities, not the  management  of  ecosystems. As such,
attempts to augment fisheries production must not include: the
culling  of predator species; fisheries enhancement and sea
ranching (except in extreme cases ie. when a population is no
longer extant); the manipulation  of the gene pool of wild species
and other forms of genetic 'engineering'.
 
29. In addition, Greenpeace has serious concerns about the
development of intensive aquaculture, particularly its promotion as
a means of meeting world food needs. A separate set of Greenpeace
principles have been drafted that are specific to aquaculture.
 
IV.  SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS FOR ECOLOGICALLY RESPONSIBLE
FISHERIES
 
30. Greenpeace seeks a substantial  transformation  from  fisheries
production  dominated  by   large-scale,   intensive   methods   to
smaller-scale,   community-based,  fisheries  using    ecologically
safe,   selective  fishing  technology  and  environmentally  sound
practices.  Greenpeace believes this transformation will  result in
lower impact,  more ecologically  responsible  fisheries  that  are
also socially, economically and culturally beneficial.
 
31.  There should  be  a  renewed  emphasis  on  meeting  essential
nutritional needs from fish production through reliance on regional
and  local  fisheries  and  the  progressive  conversion  of
industrial reduction fisheries to provide substantially greater
quantities  of fish protein for human consumption.
 
32. Every  effort  should  be  made  to  amalgamate  scientifically
acquired forms  of  knowledge with traditional, locally    acquired
knowledge systems.  This approach will enable  the  development  of
locally  appropriate   fisheries    management    regimes,  fishing
technology   and   practices designed to meet the objectives  of
a reformed, low impact fishing industry  while,  at  the  same
time, safeguarding  the  rights  of    traditionally  dependent
fishing communities  to  basic  food  and  livelihoods  --     all
within environmental limits.
 
33.The optimum yield from any fishery should be defined   as    the
yield that maintains the long-term ecological viability  of  fished
systems and  this  must   take   precedence    over      short-term
financial considerations.
 
34. Within  ecologically sound limits,  fisheries must provide for
the  essential  needs  of  communities  that  have traditionally
depended  on  local fisheries for   essential   food and
livelihoods.
 
35. A nation's export of its fisheries production should  not    be
at the expense of the environment, or domestic  consumption  needs,
nor should it cause any significant adverse social  or  cultural
impacts for its coastal communities.
 

36.  Access  rights  to  fisheries  must  be  consistent  with  the
cultural practices and economic  needs  of  communities  that  have
historically depended   on    local    fisheries    and  that  have
consistently demonstrated the capacity to fish in  a  manner  which
maintains the integrity of the ecosystem.
 
37.  No new fishery should be started or an existing one expanded

until an environmental and social impact assessment proves it to be
socially acceptable to affected communities.
 
V. URGENT GOVERNMENT ACTION ON REFORMS   Greenpeace advocates the
following governmental actions:
 
38. As virtually all major commercial  fisheries  today  are  being
fished at or  beyond  the  limits  of    sustainability,    fishing
capacity  and  overall  effort  must be  drastically reduced.
 
39.  Governments  should  adopt  and implement the  Precautionary
Approach  to  fisheries  and  related  criteria  for   ecologically
responsible  fisheries in national,  regional  and    international
management  regimes.  They should also  ensure  sufficient  funds
for  research  on  marine environments,  on  fisheries impacts, and
on fishing gear selectivity.
 
40.  Effective  mechanisms  must  be  established  to  regulate
the activities of  both  domestic  and  international  fishing
vessels, their captains and observers, as well as  to  ensure
that  states enter    into    and    comply    with

international   fisheries conservation  agreements and laws.
 
41.  Particular emphasis must be placed on ensuring that in
Government efforts to address the problem of excess fishing
capacity, large scale industrial fishing fleets are not allowed to
move to areas of the world where their activities will be
detrimental to fish stocks, marine biodiversity and coastal
communities.
 

42.  Governments   must  eliminate  subsidies    that    underwrite
the expansion  of  fishing  capacity, or  the  migration  of  their
fishing  fleets  to  distant  waters,    and  subsidies  that   are
detrimental to the long-term economic    viability    and    social
well-being    of    fishworkers  and   community-based   fisheries.
Governments should establish and fund compensation  plans  to  help
fishers and  fishworkers  who  become  displaced    by   fishing
capacity reductions or who are affected by transitional programmes.
 
43.  National  government  funding and inter-governmental lending
and assistance made  available  for fisheries  development  must
be redirected only  to  promote  the  development  or  maintenance
of ecologically responsible fisheries.
 
44. Taxation levels in the fishing industry should be adjusted to
reflect the level of environmental impacts resulting from
ecologically unsound practises.
 
45. Economic incentives aimed  at  protecting  biological diversity
through  the  adoption  of  non-destructive, selective  gear  types
and  the reduction of fishing capacity  should  be  established  to
complement precautionary management regimes.
 
46. In order to protect society's common natural heritage, access
to fishing and control of ocean areas should not be privatised. In
addition, fishing operations should be subject to liability
regimes requiring payment of compensation in respect of any
damages.
 
VI. URGENT MARKET ACTION ON REFORMS   Greenpeace advocates the
following market-based actions:
 
47. The fish buying, processing and retailing  industry  should
use  these principles as benchmarks when reviewing their
purchasing  policies related to the production and marketing of
seafood products.
 
48. All levels of industry  that  profit from  fisheries  should
invest some part of their revenues into monitoring,  enforcement,
smooth  transition  and  conversion  to environmentally sound
fishing technologies  and  practices, including  compensation  for
fishermen impacted by such recovery measures.
 
49. As consumers can only exercise their  choice  on  the  basis of
adequate information regarding the impact of their consumption, the
fish buying, processing and retailing industry must provide the
public with direct access  to  information. This can be done, for
example, through  detailed product labelling or, where appropriate,
point-of-purchase and  other forms  of  information directly
accessible by consumers.

<P>*Canadians have already lost over 50 per cent of  their
original forest cover.

<P>*In British Columbia, over half of the forest that has been
logged has been logged since 1970.

<P>*Ever year in B.C. the equivalent 2.5 million logging trucks
of ancient forest are clearcut (70 million cubic meters).

<P>*British Columbia provides fewer jobs per acre of forest cut
than any other forest producing nation in the world.

<P>*Selective logging would provide 3-4 more jobs per 1000 cubic
metres of forest logged than conventional clearcutting.

<P>*The ten largest logging companies control over half the
licensed timber land in B.C.

<P>*According to the Ministry of Forests the current Annual
Allowable Cut in B.C. is 18 million cubic meters (25%) above
the long run sustainable yield. 

<P>*Coastal temperate rainforests only ever covered less than
0.5% of the Earth's surface.

<P>*Less than 50 per cent of the world's temperate rainforests
remain and these are in small fragments on the west coast of
Canada, United States, Chile, Australia, New Zealand and
Tasmania.

<P>*25 per cent of the world's remaining ancient temperate
rainforests are in British Columbia.  Less than 7% of B.C's
ancient temperate rainforests have been protected.

<P>*57% of the temperate rainforest in British Columbia has
already been clearcut.

<P>*Of the original 170 primary and secondary watersheds on
Vancouver Island, only 10 remain intact, and only 4 are

<B>"Everytime the barge goes by loaded with logs, everyone knows and feels 
there's a grand theft taking place, that it's genocide for the Haida people and a continuation of the logging off of our islands for the government's and company's benefit -  They take with them our past and our future..."

<B>...The Haida Brave and the Haida Monarch are two of the largest self-loading self propelled log
barges in the world.  

<P>The barges can carry 12,000 cubic metres ( 400 logging trucks full ) of logs on thier 48 hour journey
from the Queen Charlotte Islands to Vancouver.   

<P>They are owned by timber giant MacMillan Bloedel, the company
responsible for logging more of Canada's temperate rainforests than any other.
 
<P>The barges run up and down Canada's west coast and occasionally into the
United States, moving the felled temperate rainforests of Canada to mills in Powell River, Nanaimo, Howe Sound, the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island.

<P><font size=+1>Say Good bye to Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands)</font>
 
<P>The Haida Brave and the Haida Monarch load up on the shores of  Haida Gwaii
two or three times per week.  This means that in one year the
barges will take away a staggering <font size=+1> <tt> $200,000,000 </tt></font>worth 
of felled Cedar, Hemlock
and Spruce. 
<P>Because 94 percent of all the rainforests cut in the region
are barged out to mills in the Lower Island or Vancouver Island for processing,
 logging in Haida Gwaii provides only 427 direct jobs to on-island residents. 
<P>The local community is calling for a 50% reduction of logging in the region and for
on-island processing facilities that would keep more jobs at home. None of the
four large logging companies currently clearcutting the rainforests of Haida
Gwaii operate processing operations on the islands.

<H3>CLEARCUT DESTRUCTION: </H3>
<P> Three years ago, the B.C. government announced
that 62% of the land area in Clayoquot (74% of the old-growth
forest) would be open to clearcut logging.  Over one-quarter of
Clayoquot Sound has already been clearcut.  Most of the wood is
shipped to other countries to produce garden furniture, newspapers,
magazines and phonebooks.
 
<H3>THE PROTESTS: </H3>
<P> In the wake of the government's decision, national
and international protests broke out.  Over 10,000 people came to
Clayoquot Sound in 1993:  857 people were arrested that summer
trying to stop the clearcutting.  Some of MacMillian Bloedel's
European and American customers cancelled their contracts to
protest MacBlo's role in the clearcutting.

<BR><BR><a href="../pics/for63.gif">
<img hspace=15 align=left lowsrc="../thumbs/for63t.gif" src="../pics/for63s.gif" width=115 height=175 border=0></a>
 

Greenpeace has encouraged individuals and companies to join the
struggle.  More than 30 of Canada's best-known authors have spoken
out to condemn clearcutting.  Dozens of Hollywood stars including Oliver Stone, Tom Cruise, Barbara Streisand and Robert Redford have joined the campaign. The publishing house Knopf Canada and one of Canada's largest school boards, along with Germany's largest
publishing houses, have publicly announced that they would prefer
to use clearcut-free paper.

<BR clear=all><BR><a href="../pics/for14.gif">
<img hspace=15 align=left lowsrc="../thumbs/for14t.gif" src="../pics/for14s.gif" width=115 height=175 border=0></a>

<P>Clearcutting is an ecologically disastrous practice which destroys
the original forest ecosystem, leading to habitat loss, soil
erosion, bare mountains, landslides and devastated fish streams.
It was clear that very few people want to see this happen in
Clayoquot, or anywhere else in Canada.
<P> 
<B>67 percent of Canadians oppose clearcutting - Angus Reid, 1994</B>
 
<BR clear=all><BR><H3>SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS: </H3>
<P> In response to the international outcry, the
B.C. government created a panel of First Nations people and
scientists to determine what would qualify as acceptable logging in
Clayoquot Sound.  After almost two years, the Scientific Panel made
over 100 recommendations, including an end to clearcutting in
Clayoquot Sound and a moratorium on any logging or road-building in
the Sound's intact valleys.
<B><P>In 1995 the government of B.C. adopoted the Science Panel's
reports in their entirety.  The key points are:
<UL>
<LI> Ending conventional clearcutting;
<LI> Deferring logging in pristine areas until studies and
inventories of all species that reside there have been conducted;
<LI>  Extending the land-use decision-making agreement (Interim
Measures Agreement) between the Provincial government and the Nuu-
Chah-Nulth Central Regions Tribal Council;
<LI> . Developing a forest use plan, designed to maintain the whole
forest ecosystem in a healthy and productive state, will begin
immediately;
<LI>Banning logging in areas that have been overcut;
<LI>  Reducing the amount of wood cut each year in Clayoquot Sound.
 </UL></B>
<P>These steps move towards protecting Clayoquot Sound, but there are
still some unanswered questions.  The Panel's mandate was to
consider HOW to log in Clayoquot, not WHETHER there should be any
logging.  Greenpeace is actively campaigning to ensure that no logging takes place in the remaining intact areas of Clayoquot Sound.

<H3>THE FIRST NATIONS: </H3>
<P> The Nuu-chah-nulth people of Clayqouot Sound
have lived in the region for thousand s of years and have never
ceded their territiories.  They have consistently stated their
opposition to clearcutting, and Greenpeace is dedicated to
supporting them in their struggle to end clearcutting on their
traditional lands.
 
<H3>WHERE TO FROM HERE?</H3>
<P>  Greenpeace will ask customers of MacMillian
Bloedel to use their influence to demand that the timber giant agrees to stay
out of the pristing areas of Clayoquot Sound permanently and,
effective immediately, that they not violate any of the
recommendations of the panel. 
 
<P>Throughout the world, we are asking paper and timber consumers to
reconsider the ecological impacts of their wood sources and to
develop environmental procurement policies that reject wood fibre
coming from practices such as clearcutting, or from rare ecosystems
such as primary rainforests.
 
<P>A first step is to ensure that their wood or paper is not made from
clearcut ancient rainforests.  Some of the Scientific Panel's
members have already said that the stringent recommendations made
for Clayoquot should apply equally to the temperate rainforest throughout British Columbia.  In the coming year Greenpeace will work to protect the biodiversity of these other, equally fragile
rainforests in B.C.
 <BR><HR>
<B><H3>WHAT YOU CAN DO:  </H3>
<UL>
<LI> Reduce your consumption of wood and paper products
<LI> Ask your municipality or school board to demand clearcut-free
paper.
<LI> Write a letter to your local newspaper.
<LI> Visit Clayoquot Sound and volunteer your efforts with the Friends of Clayoquot Sound.
<LI> Contact Greenpeace
</UL>
<P>Write to the Premier of British Columbia, and the Nelson Keitlah Co-chair of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council and the Central Region Board</B>

<P><B>"Both Arrivals and Shipments of Russian Logs at High Level; 
Nearly the Half of Last Year Arrived for Only January-April 
This Year:
</B> 
<P>According to the All Japan Russian Logs Dealing Association, 
arrivals of Russian timber during April registered 503.700 
cubic meters, an increase of 7.7% over the same month of the 
previous year or more 5% over the previous month. It was a 
substantial arrival.

<P>The shipments are also in a good condition, registering 475.958 
cubic meters.It was an increase of 16,3% over one year ago or a 
5,5% increase from March.
<P>The largest volumes arrived at Fushiki and Toyama New Ports 
with 86.947 cubic meters, followed by Hokkaido 80.947, Maizuru 
60.514, Onahama 50.796 and Sakata 46.780. Also the largest 
volumes went out from Fushiki and Toyama New Ports with 85.899 
cubic meters, followed by Hokkaido 50,092 and Sakata 45,392. 
Onahama, Maizuru and Niigata also registered more than 30,000 
cubic meters.
Of the arrivals in April, logs for softwood plywood registered 
61,275 cubic meters. Though the figure was a little bit smaller 
than the previous month, the overall arrivals of Russian log 
for plywood for January-April have already exceeded 310,000 
cubic meters. They have already occupied 46 % of the annual 
arrivals of last year of 672,134 cubic meters.
It indicates that utilisation of softwood timber (Russian 
timber) for plywood material has been steadily increasing. It 
is supposed that the arrivals for this year may reach 800,000 - 
900,000 cubic meters if the present pace continues on as they 
are.
<P>When housing starts for March increased in two month (a good 
figure of 1.585 million units in the annual ratio), Russian 
timber that is mainly demanded for scantlings (batten products) 
of housing materials can expect of a recovery in its shipment 
in the future.
<P>How will the stocks of logs in the volume of 1,960,000 cubic 
meters as of the end of April change with recovery of shipment ?
It is no doubt that the arrivals will be less for the 
seasonal factor. It is watched with a great expectation when 
the market conditions will change."

<blockquote>


As part of a major nature conservation project 
centered in Russia, Greenpeace has announced
the first of a set of territories to be included in
the World Natural Heritage List, UNESCO's
"Nobel Prize" of natural objects. The Project's
intent is the full protection of Russia's most
valuable and extensive funds of biodiversity
both in the short term as Russia suffers an
environmental and economic crisis and in the
long term as catalysts in the search for
environmentally sound alternative investment
projects.



<P>After six years of unsuccessful attempts by the
government to prepare the nomination for
Lake Baikal and at the same time risking the
environmental balance of the lake and, in fact,
the majority of intact ecosystems left in
Russia, this ambitious project aims to protect
some of Russia's most valuable natural spaces.
Greenpeace Russia has taken the lead in
organising the nominations of several natural
areas to the List by tapping into the resources
and guiding the efforts of dozens of local and
national conservation groups, indigenous
peoples and government agencies. 
<BR><BR>
<a href="../pics/for39.gif">
<img  vspace=7 hspace=7 align=left lowsrc="../thumbs/for39t.gif" src="../pics/for39s.gif" width=175  height=140 border=0></a>

The list, administered by the United Nations'
organisation, UNESCO, also contains such
natural wonders as the Grand Canyon and the
Great Barrier Reef and provides a forum for
protection and recognition of the world's most
important natural and cultural sites. In order to
carry out the project, Greenpeace has had push
for the creation of entire new park and
conservation zone systems, lobby local
governments to devote the areas and promise
to conserve them and animate researchers and
conservation planners to make the project
effective. 

<P>Indigenous peoples and local communities have
played an important role in the development of
nearly all of the sites, demonstrating the need
for a fuller consideration of the sustainability
of lifestyles outside of both Western and
Eastern industrial paradigms and based on
closer relationships to nature.

<P>Greenpeace has already made the first
nomination to the list, the Komi Virgin
Forests, 3.3 million hectares of virgin forest
along the Ural Mountains in the Republic of
Komi, in Russia's North. The forests comprise
the largest untouched wooded area in Europe
and contain a variety of ecosystems and rare
species. In so doing, Greenpeace completed its
successful campaign to stop foreign logging
companies from using clearcut practices on
Komi territory.

<P>Current proposed nomination sites for the list
are the Sikhote-Alin Natural Complex and the
Bikin Valley in the Russian Far East (4 million
hectares and the home of the endangered Amur
tiger), the Volcanoes of Kamchatka (4 million
hectares), the Sources of the Great Ob of the 
Altai Mountains in Central Siberia (6.5 million
hectares of virgin mountain taiga), Vodlozero
Park in the Northwest of European Russia (1
million hectares, Europe's largest intact taiga
and wetlands complex) and the Ubsunur
Hollow in Tuva Republic (7.5 million
hectares, a Natural-Cultural project carried out
in conjunction with the Mongolian
government).

<table border=0 width=100% cellpadding=15><tr><td width=60% colspan=2 valign=top align=center>
Forming Europe's natural eastern border along
the Ural Mountains, the Virgin Komi Forests
are the continent's largest unfragmented
oldgrowth forests representing a wide variety
of integrated ecosystems ranging from boreal
forests in the southern part of the territory to 
subarctic tundra in the north. The forests,
mountains, wetlands and river valleys that
make up the system are a haven for rare
species and contain one of Europe's most
valuable stores of genetic and biological
diversity.


<P>In 1994 these forests came under direct threat
from many sides. A foreign timber company
began to carry out clearcut logging along the
Pechora and Ilych Rivers while one of the
world's largest oil spills destroyed the river
and villages downstream. There was no help in
sight: park officials can go months without pay
as nature conservation has been forgotten in
the economic crisis.


<P>While Greenpeace campaigners decried the
destruction downstream, Greenpeace
researchers got to work upstream to organise
a nomination to UNESCO's World Natural
Heritage List, Russia's first such nomination.
Once word of the nomination got out, the
loggers disappeared and efforts have turned
toward developing a sound management plan
for the enormous 3.3 million hectare nature
preserve.

<blockquote>

<P><B>Under the diligent watch of KGB, the forests
on the Russian border with Finland have been
off limits to logging for fifty years. Given the
almost complete loss of old-growth and
primary forests on the Scandinavian side of the
border, Russia's border forests are a priceless
heritage to the world. 
</B>
<P>Satellite images show the difference in stark
black and white: the Finnish forests appear as
white areas bereft of natural forests, while the
Russian side is dark with huge areas of highly
biologically and genetically diverse forests.
Crossing the border from the west is equally
telling, the Finnish forests being predominately
single-aged trees criss-crossed by drainage
ditches and marred by large open areas of
clearcuts. The natural old-growth forests of
Kostomuksha, Kalevala, Paanajarvi, Lapland,

and dozens of other areas with their varied
trees and landscapes come as a pleasing
change of something more than just scenery.

<P>However, logging of the area has begun and is
steadily increasing. Russian forest legislation
is being broken as foreign companies take
advantage of the economic crisis, carrying out
illegal logging to the doorsteps of the region's
nature reserves in order to feed the consumer
demands of Western Europe. Important nature
conservation possibilities are being
compromised, even with the involvement of
the Finnish Government, local authorities and
the Russian Federal Government, who should
instead be actively supporting a broad
conservation strategy in Karelia.

<P>In October 1995, Russian and European
environmental groups in a series of seminars
and joint press conferences demanded that all
remaining old-growth forests in Western
Russia be protected.  However, logging has
continued, and is already expanding into
biologically important but as yet unprotected
areas. Greenpeace is therefore calling on the
Governments of Karelia, Russia and Finland to
stop all logging of old-growth and primary
forests in Karelia and Finland, to establish
integrated conservation areas that cover the
whole of the border region, and to abandon
clearcutting in secondary forests that are
subject to logging.

<B><P>Greenpeace Russia is currently preparing a
World Heritage nomination for the Russian
side and is in dialogue with the Finnish
Government about the preparation of a joint
nomination. Proposals have been made to

include parts of northern Norway into the
conservation area as well.

<P> With it's extensive
experience in preparing World Heritage

nominations in Russia, Greenpeace will lead
efforts to prepare an extensive and complete
nomination and aims to convince the
governments to submit a nomination to
UNESCO that covers a continuous belt the
length of the border region some 1000
kilometres in length, including all the existing
and proposed conservation areas, buffer zones
and connecting corridors.

<td valign=top>
This fall, U.S. farmers will harvest the first crop of genetically engineered
soybeans. This represents a crucial step in the start of a massive genetic
experiment in which humans beings and the environment are the guinea pigs.    
<p> 
Roundup Ready Soybeans (RRS) are engineered by Monsanto to resist Roundup,
which is Monsanto's trade name for the herbicide glyphosate. RRS contains gene
sequences from a cauliflower mosaic virus (CMV), a petunia and a bacterium
(Agrobacterium sp).  While this year's crop accounts for less than 2 percent of U.S.
soybean production, Monsanto hopes that as much as 33 percent of the soybean crop will
be planted to RRS in the U.S. in 1997.  RRS is set to become the first
genetically engineered food to be distributed widely unless consumers and
farmers take action now.  As much as 60 percent of processed consumer food products
contain soybean material - from margarine to baby food and chocolate bars. 
<p> 
The U.S. produces most of the world's soybeans and exports about half its crop
to Europe and Asia. 
<p> 
Monsanto opposes separation of products containing Roundup Ready Soybeans,
which means that any of the thousands of food products containing soy material
might contain genetically engineered beans. The company even opposes labelling,
so consumers will not know that they are eating genetically engineered food. 
<p> 
Monsanto's hope is that Roundup Ready Soybeans will take over a substantial
portion of the huge soybean crop, including those grown in Argentina and
Brazil, in the next several years.    With the development of RRS, the chemical
industry and industrial agriculture are moving in a dangerous direction: they
are designing plants to adapt to chemical poisons. The use of Roundup Ready
Soybeans makes farmers dependent on a single corporation -- Monsanto -- thus
reducing their control over their land and seeds.    
<p> 
The genetically engineered soybean has brought the controversy surrounding the
use of genetic engineering in agriculture to a new level. The benefits of this
product accrues to Monsanto, which collects licensing fees from farmers and
assures itself more sales of Roundup, one of its most profitable  products.
However, Roundup Ready soybeans bring no benefit whatsoever to the consumer --
they are not cheaper, tastier or healthier. 
<p> 
Consumers are very suspicious of genetically engineered foods, and would prefer
not to buy them (<a href="roundup.html#app">see Appendix I</a>).    For soybean farmers, this reality should
be an urgent consideration.  Farmers can grow the GE-free soybeans that
consumers prefer and ensure that they are not mixed with the Roundup Ready
Soybean, or they run the risk of losing important soybean markets, and this may
hit soybean farmers in the pocketbook as well as the field.<p>

<font size=+1><b>Soybeans Are Everywhere</b><p></font>
The U.S. grows nearly half of the world's 135 million metric tonnes of soybeans
each year, and soybeans are the U.S.' second largest crop. Some form of soy is
found as much as 60 percent of processed consumer foods.   Rich in protein and natural
fat, most soybeans are processed into soy oil and soy meal. Most soy meal is
used to make high-protein animal feed; the remainder is used in food for human
consumption. The extracted oils, are supplied to food producers for further
processing. For numerous products, lecithin, which is obtained mainly from soy
oil, is added as a stabilizer and emulsifier.   
<p> 
Soy can be found in margarine, smoked herring, doughnuts, cakes, bread and
cookies, meat, baby food and diet foods, to name just a few. There are
literally tens of thousands of food products which contain soy in one form or
another.  Soy oil (and rape-seed oil) can be labelled "vegetable fats" or
"hydrogenated vegetable fat". Lecithin is sometimes labelled as E 322.  If
mixed with ordinary soybeans, consumers will have no idea whether RRS is
contaminating any of these products.
<p> 
<font size=+1><b>Bringing RRS to Market: No Consumer Right to Choose</b><p></font>   
Aware of the suspicion with which consumers view genetically engineered food,
Monsanto, together with the U.S. authorities, plans to mix RRS with ordinary
soybeans -- unlabelled -- thus contaminating the entire U.S. supply. So even if
products were labelled these actions would still make genetically engineered
food almost unavoidable and would rob consumers of the right to choose food
free of genetic manipulation, as well as robbing them of the right to know what
they are eating.   
<p> 
Now consumers are fighting back. A poll shows over 80 percent of consumers in
Germany, a major buyer of U.S. soybeans, are opposed to genetically engineered
food. Dozens of European companies, dealers and manufacturers have stated their
opposition to using genetically manipulated soy and are attempting to ensure
that they can obtain natural soybeans that have not bean mixed with the
RRS-soybean (<a href="roundup.html#app">see Appendix I</a>). In the U.S., some groups have called for a
boycott of certain brands containing soybean products.   
<p> 
In March, 1996 the Commission of the European Union (EU) gave the green light
for the export to Europe of Monsanto beans and their further processing in
Europe. The EU Commission even voted against the labelling of genetically
engineered products -- after the American government had threatened Europe with
trade sanctions. However the EU has delayed a decision on another genetically
Engineered crop, corn produced with genes patented by the Swiss company Ciba
Geigy.  This corn is being grown in the U.S.  Many  European countries have
objected to the distribution of this corn and there is a strong chance that it
will be rejected by the EU. The primary consern is that much of this corn is
used as animal feed and there is a high potential for anitbiotic resistance
developing in the animals and then being spread to humans.<p>

</td>
<td valign=top>
<font size=+1><b>Genetic Pollution</b><p></font>
Genetic engineering allows genes to be transferred between completely unrelated
species. This means that new organisms with unpredictable metabolic processes
are created. Genetically engineered organisms have the ability to pass alien
genes (i.e. those transferred from a different species) onto following
generations and even to related wild species. The spread of these plants could
result in a long-term change in natural ecosystems.
<p> 
Although Roundup Ready soybeans have been studied for their agricultural
properties in a few field tests, there are still large gaps in our knowledge.
With the leap from limited experimental release in small fields to large-scale
growth the risk also increases. Will the new bean force out other plants? Will
it enter other ecosystems? Will it genetically contaminate wild relatives or
traditional strains? Will it change in the long term due to its resistance to
toxic substances? Nobody can answer these questions.   
<p> 
In the case of genetically engineered oilseed rape, scientists have shown how
easily oilseed rape crossbreeds with wild relatives and  therefore how easily
transfer of the herbicide resistance gene could  occur. Within the first
planting season it is estimated that a substantial part of wild weed population
could  acquire the gene for herbicide  tolerance. (Joergensen & Andersen, 1994,
Mikkelsen,et al., 1996).
<p> 
U.S. soybeans are also exported to Asia, Australia and the Pacific islands, the
home to the original wild soybean. In those regions, there is risk of
cross-breeding with wild soybean species.  In this way the foreign genes will
find their way into the wild populations of the bean.  The impacts on the
evolution of flora and natural ecosystems are unpredictable and irreversible.
<p> 
<font size=+1><b>Potential for Allergies</b><p></font>
Monsanto claims their tests on rats, cows, chickens and fish show no change in
the risk of allergy compared to the standard soybean. But the Monsanto
application to the Food and Drug Administration show that the feeding tests
were conducted for a maximum of ten weeks. This means that it is impossible to
forecast possible long-term effects and the effects on future generations.    
<p> 
After the introduction of RRS, people would act as unsuspecting guinea pigs as
even slight changes in protein structure can trigger off new allergies. For
example, when a soybean strain to which the genetic engineers had added a gene
from the Brazil nut was investigated at the University of Nebraska, it was
discovered that the ability to trigger off allergies had also been transferred
(Nordlee et al., 1996) . Monsanto offers that these are only suspected risks,
for which there is no proof. But in the case of the food industry, proof will
come too late to prevent harm. 
<p> 
When sheep cadavers were fed to cows, nobody thought that this could lead to
the mad cow disease (BSE epidemic), and once mad cow disease emerged, no-one
wanted to believe that it could be transferred to humans eating beef. The risks
of RRS are unknown, and indeed, unknowable. A precautionary approach should
apply.
<p> 
In 1989, a Japanese company introduced tryptophan on the American market.
Tryptophan was a food supplement produced from genetically-engineered bacteria.
But 37 people  died  and 1,500 more were left permanently disabled after taking
it, suffering  symptoms including inflammation of the joints, skin-swelling,
headaches, and suppression of the immune system (Jaffe, 1994).
<p>                              
Greenpeace believes that the tests Monsanto has carried out on RRS to be
inadequate (detailed paper available, Greenpeace International July 1996). 
<p> 
Monsanto have not possibly have conducted enough tests on this product to prove
that it is safe. By releasing it into the environment Monsanto is conducting a
worldwide experiment with humans and nature.<p>

Monsanto is known in part as the company that developed and produced the
notorious defoliant Agent Orange used in the Vietnam War.  Monsanto was also
the inventor and world's main producer of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), now
banned but still a menacing soil, water and food contaminant worldwide. 
<p> 
In recent years, Monsanto has made large investments to exploit genetic
engineering and describe themselves as leaders in the field of biotechnology.
Monsanto trys to market RRS as an environmentally beneficial product. In their
promotional materials the company calls their soy creation "an intelligent
solution in favour of the environment."  But in Monsanto's hands, the purpose
of genetic engineering seems to be not environmental protection or feeding the
hungry, but rather increased sales of their chemical herbicide Roundup.    
<p> 
Roundup is a chemical weed killer.  Some 15 percent of Monsanto's total sales
is accounted for by Roundup. In the U.S. alone up to 11,800 tonnes annually are
sprayed on fields, roadside verges and gardens. The patent for this 25-year-old
herbicide expires in the year 2000 and the price will undoubtedly drop as the
herbicide is more widely produced. It is obvious that Monsanto hopes Roundup
Ready Soybeans will secure profits after the herbicide patent has expired in
the year 2000.   
<p> 
There is significant evidence that Roundup can cause harm to the environment
and human health. Monsanto argues that the herbicide is rapidly degraded in the
soil and that even after long-term application there are no effects on the
environment.  This ignores the fact that every kind of herbicide leaves traces
in the environment - after all its aim is to destroy unwanted plants in the
fields. Monsanto says Roundup is as safe as aspirin or table salt.  But in
California, Roundup has been identified as the third most commonly reported
cause of pesticide-related illness amongst agricultural workers (Cox, 1995 b,
Pease et al., 1993). 
<p> 
Increased use of the herbicide Roundup may result in pollution of water and
lead to a further decreased wild plant diversity.  It could also harm animals
and beneficial soil micro-organisms. Glyphosate is claimed to be immobile in
soil as it readily binds to soil particles, however a new study indicates that
glyphosate can be readily released from soil particles, and therefore able to
leach into water (Piccolo et al., 1994). The active ingredient of Roundup has
already been detected in drinking water in Germany (Greenpeace, 1995). Roundup
can be very toxic to fish. In some situations concentrations as low as 10 parts
per million of glyphosate can kill fish (WHO, UNEP & ILO, 1994).
<p> 
Monsanto proudly states above all that Roundup is rapidly degraded by natural
micro-organisms into carbon monoxide, ammoniac and phosphate. They claim that
after a few weeks there are no detectable traces left. Yet glyphosate residues
have been found in strawberries (Cessna & Cain, 1992), lettuce, carrots, barley
(U.S. EPA, 1993), and fish (Wang et al., 994, Folmar et al., 1979). These
residues persisted long after the glyphosate was used. For example, lettuce,
carrots, and barley contained glyphosate residues at harvest when planted a
year after treatment (U.S. EPA, 1993).  Because RRS are tolerant to glyphosate
at twice the recommended levels of usage, farmers may be tempted to use extra
or be less careful in their application rates.
<p> 
<font size=+1><b>Chemical Dependency of the Roundup Ready Soybean</b><p></font>   
To create RRS, Monsanto has inserted parts of genes from a virus, a bacterium
and a petunia. With these genetic alterations the soybeans can tolerate the
poison Roundup.  Roundup blocks the metabolic processes of normal plants, thus
leading to the death of the plant. 
<p> 
When using RRS, farmers can and indeed must use Monsanto's Roundup during the
entire growing period, making their dependence on both the seed and the
pesticide even greater.  Monsanto claims that fewer herbicides will have to be
spread over the soy fields. Yet this is just theory. It is also possible that
farmers will need to increase the amounts of toxic substances used over time.   
<p> 
There is also a serious danger of the emergence of new herbicide tolerant weeds
through increased reliance on glyphosate which will necessitate the further use
of toxic chemicals.  There has already been a recent report of a glyphosate
resistance in ryegrass that has appeared in the natural environment in
Australia (New Scientist, 6 July 1996, p.6).  
<p> 
In fact, genetic engineers still know much too little about the interaction of
the genes with each other and the environment to be able to predict whether
their "building block constructions" actually work. Monsanto has already been
through some disasters in connection with resistance to pests and have not
always been able to keep their promises, for example with regard to cotton.    
<p>
<font size=+1><b>The Cotton Flop</b><p></font>   
Another Monsanto experiment in genetic engineering has turned into a gigantic
flop. Monsanto promised that their engineered cotton would form a poison
against caterpillar attack without using chemicals, i.e. with a
"self-protecting gene" against insect larvae. Furnished with the gene from the
bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, the so-called Bollgard plants were supposed
to produce the Bt toxin in its own leaves. In the first year American cotton
farmers planted 700,000 hectares of this new strain. But Monsanto's
calculations went wrong: farmers found out that Bollgard did not produce enough
of the insecticide and not fast enough to protect the young shoots against the
caterpillars. The consequence was that in some fields up to 60 per cent of the
of the plants were successfully attacked by the caterpillars and at least 8,000
hectares in Texas were destroyed by the bollworm. The damage for this harvest
period is put at approximately 1 billion dollars (Nature Biotechnology Vol.14,
1996).  
<p> 
The negative  consequences for farmers and the environment will be much worse
if widespread planting of bollgard and other crops with the bt toxin gene cause
insect pests to become resistent to bt, as has been predicted by many
scientists.  Although the insect larvae are now exposed to the bt toxin, it
does not kill them, and this creates ideal conditions for them to become
resistant to this bacterial toxin.  Non-genetically engineered Bacillus
thuringiensis is a popular insecticide
particularly with organic farmers, but is used in ways much less likely to
create insect resistence. If widespread resistence to bt develops because of
its use in genetically engineered crops, organic foods may become more
expensive.<p>
<font size=+1><b>The Milk Hormone</b><p></font>   
Monsanto's best known genetically engineered product is probably recombinant
Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH), injected into cows to increase milk production.
Like RRS, rBGH is of dubious benefit since U.S. farmers already produce a
surplus of milk. On the other hand it does harm cows' health and is difficult
to use and expensive for farmers.    
<p> 
Monsanto managed to obtain registration of this drug with the American Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) in spite of protests from consumer and farmers'
organizations. But rBGH has not been a commercial success in the U.S. and is
still prohibited in the European Union until at least the year 2,000.
Monsanto's position on labelling of milk containing rBGH is the same as that
for RRS: they are militantly opposed. Food companies which marked their
products as being rBGH-free, have been sued. One example of this was an action
brought against the Pure Milk and Ice Cream Company in Texas to force them to
withdraw their labels. The case was settled out of court, but Pure Milk and Ice
Cream still labels their products.   
<p>  
<font size=+1><b>The Roundup Ready Kitchen</b><p></font>   
In the U.S., Monsanto already has authorization to market several genetically
manipulated plants: apart from soybeans and Bollgard cotton, an
insect-resistant potato line called NewLeaf has also been registered. And it
does not stop there. The company has announced the marketing of other
genetically manipulated plants in coming years.

<td valign=top> 
Greenpeace believes the spread of genetically engineered crops with their
potential for mutation, multiplication, and other unknown ecosystem effects are
one of the largest experiments with nature, our food supply, and our health
that humankind has ever embarked upon.   
<p> 
The future of agriculture and the world food supply lies in
environment-friendly, pesticide-free ecological farming. Roundup and the
Roundup Ready Soybean are a dead end.   With less than 2 percent of this year's
(1996) soybean crop Roundup Ready, there is still a chance prevent it from being used
in food products around the world. But time is running out. In Brazil, Monsanto
has submitted applications for growing the Roundup Ready soybean. In Argentina
permission to grow it has been granted. And in the United States the time for
harvesting and sorting the soybeans is at hand.   
<p> 
Greenpeace is calling on consumers to demand soybeans free of genetic
engineering and calling on farmers to refuse to plant the RRS-soybean in the
future. It is still possible for farmers to obtain markets for soybeans which
are sure to be free of RRS. It is equally possible for brokers and buyers to
find soybeans free of RRS.   Greenpeace is campaigning to ensure that the
entire U.S. supply of natural soybeans is not contaminated with Monsanto's
Roundup Ready Soybean.
<p> 
<font size=+1><b>GREENPEACE POLICY STATEMENT:</b><p></font>
In the light of the known risks of introducing  genetically engineered
organisms into the environment, Greenpeace is opposed to the growing,
production and marketing of genetically engineered crops and food. 
<p> 
<font size=+1><b>GREENPEACE RECOMMENDATIONS:</b></p></font>
Greenpeace recommends:
<ul>    
<li>that consumers, food retailers, soybean brokers and processors demand
soy products free from of genetically engineered  manipulations.</li> 
<li>that farmers avoid the Roundup Ready Soybean and plant only
non-gentically engineered soybeans and other crops.</li>

<td valign=top>
Monsanto's 'Roundup Ready Soybean' (RRS) is a genetically engineered variety of soybean which contains gene sequences from a cauliflower mosaic virus (CMV), a petunia and a bacterium (Agrobacterium sp).  One of the bacterial genes codes for resistance to glyphosate, the herbicide "Roundup" which is manufactured by Monsanto.  The other genes are intended to control the expression of the glyphosate gene.  As a result, the herbicide Roundup can be used to kill weeds in soybean crops without injuring the soybean itself. A determination of the potential impacts of RRS on the environment and human health must consider:
<ul>
<li>whether ecological effects may arise through the  unrestricted release and use of genetically engineered soybean containing 'foreign' genes</li>          
<li>how the pattern of use of the herbicide glyphosate could change and the effects of such a change on human health and the environment</li>         
<li>potential for harm to human consumers as a result of  the changes to the soybean</li></ul>
<p> 
This determination must take into account the context of the soybean market and its trading arrangements.  Soybean is an internationally traded commodity and Monsanto is a multinational corporation.  The most reasonable expectation of any safety assessment is, therefore, that this will have considered the environment most at risk.  This is one of the most striking shortcomings in Monsanto's environmental risk assessment for the US and European authorities which have relied only upon data from the United States, Canada, Costa Rica and Puerto Rico.  Not only are there methodological problems with the experiments in these countries per se but they do not reflect the ecological situation in
the Far East where ecological risks may be greatest.   
<p> 
This paper considers this aspect of Monsanto's risk assessment together with the rather optimistic assumptions they have made when coming to their conclusion of safety for human consumption and their neglect of the potential for harm arising out of changed patterns of use of glyphosate.     
<p>
<font size=+1><b>The Potential for Ecological Harm from RRS</b><p></font> 
Soybean, Glycine max, forms the world's most important source of both edible vegetable oil and protein supplement for livestock.  It also has a wide range of other food and industrial uses and is an important vegetable for human consumption in Asia.    Soybean is a globally traded commodity, shipped in huge amounts to many parts of the world for processing and end-use.  The United States, Brazil, China, and Argentina account for over 90 percent of world soybean production (Jewell, 1988).  The United States, Brazil, and Argentina are the principle soybean exporting countries supplying the markets of Japan and Europe.    
<p> 
Monsanto have conducted field trials of RRS in Argentina, Canada, Costa Rica,
Puerto Rico and the USA.  In 1994 they also conducted semi-contained trials in
Japan (Hino, 1994).  Monsanto have made it clear that RRS will not be separated
from other, conventionally bred soybean. From these data the inevitable
conclusion is that RRS will be grown and traded worldwide including the Far
East.   
<p> 
One of the main issues in the environmental risk assessment of genetically
engineered crops is whether the introduced, foreign gene can be transferred
through outcrossing to native, related species and cause genetic pollution.
Although cultivated soybean is mainly self-pollinating, pollen can also be
carried by bees to other soybeans and related wild or weed plants.  Soybean can
cross with other member of the genus Glycine which are found in Australasia
including Japan.  Natural hybridisation is known to occur between cultivated
soybean and G. soya, a common weed in Japan (USDA/APHIS, 1994). There are no
compatible relatives in the United States or Europe.  
<p> 
Thus the ecological dangers seem to be greatest in the Far East and the
potential for RRS to cause ecological harm should be evaluated in those
environments.   In Monsanto's determination of this risk, when seeking
permission to import RRS into Europe, they have only considered the possibility
of gene transfer in Europe where there are no related species of plants.  In
the USA they have made a similar argument.  Yet it is clear that it is not
Monsanto's intention that the growth and trade of soybean be restricted to
these countries.    
<p> 
Monsanto should evaluate the risk of gene transfer in Australasian countries
and not only where RRS may be grown but also where it may be imported.  As one
ecologist has recently commented: 
<blockquote><i>
"Given that crop seeds travel
hundreds of kilometres  between seed merchant, farmer and processing factory,
spillage in transport is inevitable - and more worrying  that pollen spread"
(Crawley, 1996).</i></blockquote>   
<p> 
Another important issue in ecological (and agricultural) risk assessment is
whether RRS could persist in the environment and displace natural flora and
fauna or become a troublesome weed.  Because soybean is susceptible to frost
this has been used by Monsanto to claim environmental safety.  However, the
experimental trials described by Monsanto in their petition for deregulation in
the USA and their market application in Europe have not properly investigated
RRS's potential for persistence in the environment.  Plots are routinely
destroyed by 'disking' after experiments designed to tests agronomic traits not
ecological impact.  
<p> 
In one trial volunteer RRS were detected in the following season, however,
these plants were destroyed by being 'disked' into the ground and the
observation seems never to have been investigated further.   In addition, and
of more concern, is that the potential for persistence in countries other than
the USA or Europe has never been addressed (for example, in the Far East where
frost will not regulate persistence).  This has not been considered at all by
Monsanto.   
<p> 
Furthermore, as with the potential for hybridisation, Monsanto have supplied no
quantitative data on invasiveness or weediness at all (Kareiva and Parker,
1994).  Monsanto have also used Baker's List to argue that RRS is unlikely to
become a  troublesome weed.  This is a list of characteristics which are said
to be commonly associated with weeds and which has been used to try and predict
the weediness of plants (Keeler, 1989).  The usefulness of this list has been
questioned by scientists who  have used it to see if it can predict the
weediness of existing, known weeds and have shown that it is not reliable
(Williamson, 1994).      
<p> 
Gene transfer and the persistence of RRS are important ecological questions.
The gene coding for glyphosate tolerance may not be ecologically neutral.  In
the presence of glyphosate it would be expected to give a competitive advantage
and thus the potential for the persistence and spread of RRS or related species
with which it crosses must be treated seriously.  Even in the absence of
glyphosate the gene may persist and cause genetic pollution.  Assumptions that
herbicide resistance genes would not persist in the absence of herbicide
because they would be 'genetic baggage' and thus confer a disadvantage have
been undermined by experiments which showed that genetically engineered oilseed
rape was no less able to survive than non-engineered rape (Crawley et al.,
1993).   Monsanto's ecological risk assessment for RRS is therefore deficient
in several important respects because it:           
<ul>
<li>presents an unjustifiably optimistic scenario by assessing risks only in
the U.S. and European context when RRS is likely to be grown and/or exported to
environments of  higher ecological risk in Australasia;</li>     
<li>has failed to use appropriate experiments to investigate ecological risk as
trials have concentrated on investigating agronomic characteristics not
invasiveness,  weediness or potential for hybridisation;</li>  
<li>has relied upon unreliable predictive methods to argue that RRS is
ecologically safe.</li></ul>   
<p> 
In the context of a global soybean market, Monsanto's determination of
ecological harmlessness for RRS cannot be relied upon.      
<p>
<font size=+1><b>The Potential for Harm to Human Health and the Environment from Changed 
Patterns of Glyphosate Use</b><p></font>   
RRS is obviously intended to be used in conjunction with the herbicide
glyphosate.  Glyphosate is a broad spectrum weed killer that acts systemically
in the plant.  This means that it is taken up into the plant, distributed
throughout it and then kills all parts of the plant rather than just those
parts it comes into contact with.   It is expected that the sales of Roundup
will increase as a result of the introduction of crops made resistant to it
(RRS), and  this is, of course, Monsanto's intention.  
<p> 
Claims are made that Roundup is a safe herbicide yet this is a contradiction in
terms because a chemical used for its toxic effects on plants cannot be
environmentally benign.  There is evidence that Roundup can cause harm to the
environment and human health even at current levels of use.   Increased use of
the herbicide Roundup may result in pollution of water and lead to a further
decrease in wild plant diversity.  It may also harm animals and beneficial soil
micro-organisms. Glyphosate is believed to be immobile in soil as it readily
binds to soil particles, however a new study indicates that glyphosate can be
readily released from soil particles, and therefore may leach into water
(Piccolo et al., 1994). The active ingredient of Roundup has already been
detected in drinking water in Germany (Greenpeace, 1995). 
<p> 
Roundup can be toxic to fish to an extent which depends on several factors
including the hardness of the water, the age of the fish and water temperature.
In some situations concentrations as low as 10 parts per million of glyphosate
can kill fish (WHO, UNEP & ILO, 1994).   
<p> 
Glyphosate also affects the growth and survival of earthworms. A study in New
Zealand showed that glyphosate caused a reduction in growth and increase in
mortality of the most commonly found earthworm in New Zealand (Springett &
Gray, 1992). Glyphosate as is also toxic to many beneficial mycorrhiza fungi
which help plants to take up nutrients from soils (Estok et al., 1989,
Chakravarty & Chatarpaul, 1990, Sidhu & Chakravarty, 1990, Chakravarty & Sidhu,
1987).   
<p> 
Spray can drift up to 400 to 800 metres away from the site of application
(Yates et al., 1978) and cause damage to wild plants and flowers.  In turn the
death of plants can have indirectly harmful effects on wild life such as
insects, birds and mammals which depend on the vegetation for food or shelter
(Cox, 1995 b). 
<p> 
Glyphosate residues have been found in strawberries (Cessna & Cain, 1992),
lettuce, carrots, barley (U.S. EPA, 1993), and fish (Wang et al., 994, Folmar
et al., 1979). These residues persisted long after the glyphosate was used. For
example, lettuce, carrots, and barley contained glyphosate residues at harvest
when planted a year after treatment (U.S. EPA, 1993).  Because RRS are tolerant
to glyphosate at twice the recommended levels of usage, farmers may be tempted
to use extra or be less careful in their application rates.   
<p> 
The Northwest Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides has undertaken a
thorough review on glyphosate's toxicology, human exposure and ecological
effects. They found that products containing glyphosate are acutely toxic to
humans. Symptoms include eye and skin irritation, cardiac depression and
vomiting (Cox, 1995 a).  In California they found that glyphosate was the third
most commonly-reported cause of pesticide related illness among agricultural
workers (Cox, 1995 b, Pease et al., 1993).   These toxicities seem to be a
result of the so-called 'inerts' in some formulations of the product and are
not fully understood.   Findings such as these throw into question Monsanto's
unsupported assertion for the benefits of Roundup such as that it is an
'environmentally acceptable herbicide'.  
<p> 
Other claims by Monsanto that the use of RRS and glyphosate may be cheaper than
other  options (which are never specified) go unsubstantiated and potential
drawbacks such as the encouragement of the emergence of herbicide tolerant
weeds through increased reliance on one herbicide go unmentioned. Recently
there has been a report of glyphosate resistance in ryegrass in Australia (New
Scientist, 6 July 1996, p.6).  Resistance could be further encouraged by the use
of herbicide resistant crops both through the increased use of a particular
herbicide and/or the transfer of resistance genes to weeds.   
<p> 
Therefore, Monsanto's evaluation of the human and environmental safety of the
change in use patterns of Roundup are inadequate because despite:           
<ul> 
<li>evidence existing which suggests that formulations of  glyphosate may be
causing health problems even at existing levels of use;</li>             
<li>the potential for harm to non-target plants and other organisms through the
increased use of a non-specific herbicide;</li>             
<li>the likelihood of increased residues in crops and groundwater.</li>   
</ul>
<p> 
Monsanto and the regulatory authorities have ignored the changing use of
glyphosate in their evaluation of RRS.  As a result no confidence can be placed
in claims that the use of RRS together with Roundup will be safe.      
<p> 
<font size=+1><b>The Potential for Harm to Human Health from Genetically Engineered Soybeans</b><p>
</font>
As well as the human health problems that may arise from the increased use of
glyphosate, the changes arising through the genetic engineering of the soybean
itself must be evaluated in human health terms.  The issue which is of most
importance is whether proteins produced by the plant could be toxic or
allergenic.   
<p>
RRS contains a gene from an Agrobacterium species which codes for an enzyme
5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSPS).  Glyphosate normally kills plants
by inhibiting the EPSPS which is an important enzyme in one of the biochemical
pathways of plants.  The new form of EPSPS (CP4 EPSPS) which has been
engineered into soybean is not sensitive to glyphosate and thus renders the
soybean tolerant to it.     
<p>
The biggest question mark hangs over the assessment of whether CP4 EPSPS could
be allergenic in soybean products which contain the protein.  There are no
predictive assays of allergenicity.  The latest findings that a gene from
Brazil nut, which encodes for a methionine rich protein, which was engineered
into soybean caused allergic reactions in sensitive humans despite earlier
evaluations being negative (Nordlee et al., 1996) This has highlighted the
potentially serious effects of transferring genes coding for novel proteins.    
<p>
The discovery of the allergenic potential of Pioneer's genetically engineered
soybean prior to its use as human food sources was thanks to a unique
advantage: the donor organism for the gene, Brazil nut, was a known food
allergen, and serum samples of persons known to be allergic to Brazil nuts were
available for testing. Monsanto has a special difficulty in assessing the
allergic potential of RRS because unlike the Brazil nut protein it does not
come from a source recognised to be allergenic.  Thus Monsanto have no specific
tests they can conduct to gather evidence suggestive of safety.  Monsanto have
had to rely on more questionable methods such as comparison to other compounds
rather than any empirical evidence.  For example, Monsanto have emphasised that
EPSPS does not have sequence homology with other known protein allergens.  Yet
one expert recently stated:
<blockquote><i>"...it is impossible to identify most
allergenic proteins prior to genetic manipulation.  These proteins do
not appear to have common amino acid sequences so comparison of  their
IgE-binding epitopes is probably fruitless" (Taylor,1994).</i>
</blockquote>   
<p> 
Monsanto also emphasise the small quantity of EPSPS that would be present in
diets and that most allergens are major proteins in the diet.   However, this
is not inevitably the case (Taylor, 1994) and the CP4 EPSPS gene is being used
in other crops too so exposure may not be restricted to soybean. CP4 EPSPS is
also produced in higher quantities in engineered soybean than normal EPSPS in
non-engineered soybean.  
<p> 
Taylor (1994) has also emphasised that assessments of digestibility should be
carried out both with the isolated protein and in the form it will be ingested.
It is not clear that Monsanto have conducted the tests with intact food under
realistic conditions.   Thus the Monsanto evaluation of the importance of the
risk of  allergenicity from RRS is deficient because:          
<ul> 
<li>the risk of allergenicity may be low but is essentially  unpredictable;</li>
<li>food containing RRS protein will not be labelled, therefore the most
important protective mechanism available to susceptible people, avoiding the
harmful food, will not be open should problems emerge;</li>             
<li>the bacterial EPSPS gene may also be present in other, non-soy based
products which will affect the risk.</li></ul>      
<p> 
The potentially serious risks associated with food allergies are unjustifiable
when they are unpredictable and untestable and the normal ways of avoiding food
allergens become unavailable.  Monsanto's evaluation of the safety of RRS
ignores these issues.

</td>
<td valign=top> 
The safety of RRS for human health and the environment has not been properly
evaluated by Monsanto or the regulatory authorities in either the US or Europe.
The relevance of the international nature of the soybean market and the company
involved have been ignored in the risk evaluation.  This has implications for
the ecological risks of genetic pollution and the displacement of native flora
or fauna.  These are risks which are irreversible in nature and should not
sanctioned under the principle of sustainability.   
<p> 
The whole issue of changed patterns of Roundup use has been ignored even though
Monsanto's intention is to increase sales of glyphosate through sales of RRS.
Impacts on the environment and human health are being left to large scale
uncontrolled experiment in the environment.   Whether the new form of the
protein present in soybean will be safe is unpredictable.  The nature of the
potential harm is  serious yet this feature and the impossibility of managing
or avoiding harm should it arise has not been considered. Therefore, no
confidence can be placed in assertions of the safety and benefits of RRS.  They
have excluded important factors from consideration.
<p> 
Investing in RRS is to sanction an experiment with the environment and human
health, the dangers of which may be unpredictable, irreversible and
unmanageable.  This experiment is being conducted in the interests of promoting
sales and use of a toxic chemical.  The package of chemical and resistant seed
may be only of short-term usefulness to farmers as resistance problems emerge.
Greenpeace believes these risks are not justifiable and food companies
encouraging such risk taking by using RRS in their products are acting in
Monsanto's not consumers' interests.    
<p> 
In addition RRS contravenes the principle of sustainability and the
precautionary approach which is embedded in European law both through the EU's
endorsement of the Rio Declaration and the precautionary basis of Directive
90/220 which covers the marketing of genetically engineered organisms.  Risking
irreversible damage to the environment which will be inherited by future
generations should no longer be tolerated.

<P><B>ENSO SUGGESTS JOINT AUDIT OF DEBATED AREA
</B> 
<P><B>Greenpeace has continued its activities against Enso </B>and
accused Enso of distributing incorrect information about the
Vuokkiniemi logging area. In order to clarify the situation
Enso proposes that environmental organisations, the
specialists in the working group on old-growth forests by the
Ministry for the environment, the Karelian authorities and
Enso audit the area together. This audit would then be used to
decide whether or not the area can be logged. The ministry for
the environment has taken a positive stance on Enso's
suggestion.
 
<P>According to their environmental principles published in June
1996 Enso does not log, buy or use as raw material wood which
originates from natural protection areas or areas assessed as
valuable by authorities or official working groups.
 
<P>The origin of the wood is monitored by personnel trained for
the job. The logging in Karelia is done by Finnish
entrepeneurs and Enso inspects each site before logging is
started.
 
<P>These principles have been adhered to in the Vuokkiniemi case
which was audited by Enso on July 9, 1996. As a result of that
audit the oldest part of the area was left outside the
logging.

</TD><TD WIDTH=50%>
<P><B>GREENPEACE ATTACKS RESPONSE BY ENSO TO KARELIAN OLD GROWTH
CRISIS
</B> 
<P><B>Greenpeace today totally rejected Enso's response </B>to dealing
with the disputed area of old growth forest in Karelia. At a
press conference today in Helsinki Greenpeace produced
conclusive evidence that an area in Karelia where Enso was
buying wood from is classified as old growth forest.
 
<P>Enso have already promised in a letter to BBC Enterprises Ltd
in the UK on 24/1/1996 that "Enso does not buy wood from old
growth forests.."  However a Greenpeace investigation has
clearly shown that Enso has been breaking its promise by
continuing to buy old growth wood from Karelia.   
 
<P>It is outrageous that Enso's only response in a press release
they issued today on this matter is to say that "in order to
clarify the situation Enso proposes that environmental
organisations, the specialists in the working group on old
growth forests by the Ministry for the environments, the
Karelian authorities and Enso audit the area together." 
 
<P>"Greenpeace is not prepared to have discussions about an area
in Karelia which has been clearly shown to be old growth
forest and is already partly logged. However if Enso is
serious about discussions with Greenpeace then it must
immediately stop all logging activities in this area and in
other old growth forest areas in Karelia and be prepared to
discuss our other demands. Otherwise Greenpeace will have no
option but to continue its campaign against Enso especially in
the consumer countries, "  said Tim Birch, Greenpeace
International Forest Campaign Coordinator.
 
<P>Greenpeace is calling on Enso to make available all maps that
detail Enso's logging activities in Karelia. This information
needs to be urgently assessed to ensure that Enso is not
logging in any other areas of old growth Karelian forest.

<P><B>Sunday 23rd June 1996</B>
 

<P>Yesterday we found that fishing vessels are now coming to the Wee
Bankie area.  Today is the first day of direct actions.  In the
early morning swimmers holding buoys with 'stop overfishing'
flags make the English industrial fishing vessel Omega B
(Fleetwood) stop and turn away. The next attempt to stop the
Omega is done with the oil-boom. Very effective because they haul
their nets and steam away.  In the afternoon several Danish
vessels were found fishing on the Wee Bankie. We tried out the
swimmers and oil-boom again. This time the clash started. The
Danes took in the oil-boom. Several vessels came to help each
other, there was a lot of chasing around. A Greenpeace float
(tiller inflatable) was caught by a net and turned over.  The
Fishermen tried to pull the inflatable aboard, but didn't
succeed. The Hooley towed the inflatable back to the Sirius while
the fishing vessels tried to run them over. No one was hurt.

<P><B>Monday 24th June 1996</B>
 

<P>When the Sirius arrives on the Wee Bankie 12 vessels stop fishing
immediately. They got violent right away,
shooting flares at the inflatables and throwing grappling hooks
at them and at the swimmers. Also shooting flares
at the Sirius. Then the 'Mette Eliase' comes in full
speed from starboard hitting the bow of the Sirius. The
flagpole with the puffin snaps off, but is repaired
straightaway. No further damage.
Later in the afternoon we attach barrels to the nets of a fishing
boat. It doesn't work: empty barrels get crushed
and full ones have the same weight as the water so don't
really interfere with the working of the net.
 

<P><B>Tuesday 25th June 1996
</B> 
<P>In the early morning about 5 Danish industrial vessels
are
fishing on the Wee Bankie. Also HMS Shetland, Fisheries
Protection vessel, is around. BBC Scotland television and some
print press are aboard the Sirius and a helicopter
with a camera man is arriving at the scene.  We start off with
the swimmers and buoys and also line in front of a
fishing boat. HMS Shetland calls ("this is Protection
Vessel Shetland....") the Sirius (reply - "this is
protection vessel Sirius...") on the radio and ask us to
refrain from interfering legal fisheries. They sent out
an inflatable to check the situation with the swimmers
and board the fishing vessel. HMS Shetland calls again
that we are endangering peoples lives and
strongly advises us to stop harassing the fishing boat.
Then the Sirius gets chased away by the 'Lone Dorthe',
skippered by a very angry Danish fisherman.  More vessels are
arriving during the day. We try out concrete blocks
with grappling hooks to get hold of the ground-line of
the
net or the head-line. Later when they haul the net we can see the
attached buoys reappearing, but the blocks seem
to have no effect on the performance of the net. Fourteen vessels
are now fishing within sighting distance. The
Hooley tries to get the painter line of the L 441 (Lone
Dorthe)  when they are setting their nets. This drives
them mad, they haul
the net and chase the Sirius for half an hour, encircling the HMS
Shetland and then further off.  The same thing
happened when we try to play with the painter line of
another vessel, the Britte Rock (E 443). We've found
their Achilles heel.
 
<P><B>Wednesday 26th June 1996</B>
 
<P>The number of fishing vessels is increasing every day.
Today we counted 17 vessels within a 3 mile radius and
some 10 more a bit further off. This is about
overfishing! We went for the painter lines of several
vessels again. They shot flares at the Hooley,  one
landed in the boat but was put over the side. Then they
threw two 'seal bombs' (small explosives, large fire
crackers). One of them landed in the Hooley but was
thrown in the the water and exploded there, the other one missed
the boats. The Sirius was chased for an hour by
the 'Papillon' (E 442) because he didn't succeed in
putting out his nets.

<P><B>Forget the Spaniards. Never mind the Euro-civil war, the fisherman's new 
bogeyman will be his most formidable yet - the greens are coming.</B>

<P>If the latest doomsday predictions prove correct fishermen can bid farewell to 
their occupation, because as far as the environmentalists are concerned, the 
game is up.


<P>"In my view the single biggest threat facing the fishing industry is the 
environmentalists," said Shetland Fishermen's Association secretary John 
Goodlad. "The environmentalists are now setting the agenda in the UK and in 
Europe."

<P>Some of the new demands are drastic: to avoid imminent disaster many mainstay 
fisheries will have to be closed. Fishermen will be paid to pack up until 
stocks recover. Boats left in the fleet will be forced to become less good at 
catching fish - not bigger and better ever again. Fishing as it is know it 
today will be discarded into the rubbish bin of history.

<P>Mr Goodlad has been thinking ahead and he has become "extremely worried". 
"Their concern is for fish and not for fishermen." It is his latest saying. 
Prepare to hear it often over the next few years.

<P><B>Cut ordered
</B>
<P>The aggressive confrontation between Greenpeace and mainly Danish fishermen 

over sandeels east of Edinburgh is set to be the first of many sea battles 
between the greens and North Sea fishermen.

<P>Mr Goodlad is very worried about where it is all going to lead: "The less 
responsible elements of the environmental movement are basing their whole 
campaign on their moral agenda. That moral agenda is very often set in the 
cities of Britain, Germany and Europe where folk in well-paid jobs have an 
idealistic view of life in the countryside and what the fishing industry is 
like. They don't actually have to live in a place like Shetland. They don't 
actually have to see how on earth can you create jobs in Shetland especially 
when the oil industry goes."


<P>Now it is being claimed that the greens already have allies within. Fishermen 
and their leaders are increasingly concerned by the tone of the statements 
emanating from officials and politicians in Brussels.


<P>Fishermen are beginning to wonder if the EC fisheries division DGXIV has 
anybody in it who is working for them. They certainly do not think Fisheries 
Commissioner Emma Bonino is on their side. "Bonino is the commissioner for the 
environment as well as for fisheries. I would like to know which she regards as 
the most important aspect of her brief," said Mr Goodlad.

<P>It is cold comfort too that the ex-UK fisheries minister John Gummer is now the 
UK's environment minister, he said.

<P>He believes the environmental lobby is behind not just the minimum 40 per cent 
fleet cut ordered recently but this week's plan to force fishermen to use huge 
110 millimetre square mesh nets which will catch nothing but the biggest fish 
in the sea.

<P>But it is next year when the guts will really hit the deck. Fourteen of the 
more-reserved international green groups have compiled a fat report called Seas 
at Risk for the North Sea Conference in Bergen which, if it makes headway with 
EC environment ministers, will change the life of Shetland
fishermen forever.The pressure group includes the Marine Conservation Society 
of the UK and Friends of the Earth International.

<P>Chief among their demands are an emergency meeting of the Council of Fisheries 
Ministers to temporarily close at least the North Sea cod, herring and plaice 
fisheries and impose tough restrictions on fisheries which take those species 

as a bycatch.

<P>They demand an urgent comprehensive review of the Common Fisheries Policy to 
radically alter the basic philosophy of fishing. The so-called "precautionary 
approach" which has been gathering vogue involves the fishing industry having 
to prove that it is not destroying stocks or the marine ecosystem - rather than 
the other way round.

<P>The fleet would be cut drastically to a level to suit the most vulnerable 
stocks. Total allowable catches and quotas would be done away with, discards 
banned, destructive fishing gear banned or barred in certain areas.

<P>All fishing boats would be tracked via transponders and all the EU's fishing 
vessels would be policed by one Euro-force.

<P>All industrial fisheries in areas that support important wildlife
populations would be closed immediately and permanently and the other 
industrial fisheries strictly controlled.

<P><B>No alternative</B>


<P>The much-feared 40 per cent cut in fleet size and loss of 55,000 fishermen 
"would not be sufficient to guarantee against a stock collapse or wider 
ecosystem damage," warns Seas at Risk.

<P>"There is only one way to be certain of securing the most depleted stocks and 
that is to stop fishing them, either entirely or to a very great extent. This 
may take the form of a fishery's temporary closure or perhaps the introduction 

of mesh sizes designed to leave all but the most mature fish in the sea," the 
document states.

<P>"Whichever option is chosen, fisheries managers will have to find the money to 
compensate fishers and help fishing communities through the dislocation that 

will inevitably result. This is not an option that anyone would normally 
choose, but for some stocks there is now no alternative."

<P>But Seas at Risk is also quite positive in its desire to free those fishermen 

who are left from the absurdities of the present quota system, to secure the 
jobs that remain, to improve their catches and their value. Lighter, more 
controlled fishing would help end the worryingly unpredictable nature of 
fishing businesses, it is claimed.

<P>Mr Goodlad said he thought the Bergen conference next year would be dominated 
by the environmental lobby and he could see "some swingeing measures" coming 
out of it.

<P>Greenpeace is now extremely active on the North Sea fisheries front. It has 
spent several years researching and preparing its case for drastic action. Four 
documents have recently been seen by The Shetland Times. They are typically 
well-argued and blunt in their demands.

<P>Greenpeace shares many of the same radical ideas as Seas at Risk and argues 
that we cannot afford to wait until the next major review of the CFP in 2002 to 
take action.

<P><B>Commercial extinction</B>

<P>The group states that 2.45 million tonnes of fish were caught in the North Sea 
in 1994 with over one million tonnes made up of industrial fish.

<P>It is stark in its warnings of a North Sea version of the cod disaster on the 
east coast of Canada which destroyed the livelihoods of 30,000 people.

<P>It also favours the "precautionary approach" which it sees as a means of 
preventing damage - not trying to repair it after mistakes, as occurs at 
present. It demands that such a system be in place within 10 years and an 
emergency recovery plan for the short term for all North Sea fisheries must be 
agreed next year.

<P>Greenpeace adds haddock, mackerel, hake, saithe and whiting to the list of 
North Sea stocks at risk of commercial extinction. It is also very concerned 
about the effect of trawls and dumped fish on the marine environment.

<P>The group calls for no more subsidies to be given to fishermen who want to 
expand.

<P>In one press release last month Greenpeace called on fish traders and 
processors to stop buying North Sea herring.

<P>It remains to be seen what direct action Greenpeace might take if its demands 
are ignored by politicians.

<P>Fishermen always maintain that they are the best natural conservationists 
because it is their future at stake. And the SFA's relationship with Greenpeace 
has been good so far. They talk. They understand each other. They have some 
common goals. "Our job is to look after the fishermen and we can't do that 
unless we look after the fish," Mr Goodlad said. Emotionally-charged

<P>Indeed, Shetland enjoys a special place in Greenpeace folklore due to its role 
in supporting last year's Brent Spar victory. It was even a Lerwick fishing 
boat, the Starina, which took the campaigners out on reconnaissance missions to 
the floating oil storage structure before they occupied it.

<P>Mr Goodlad said the industry was "more than happy" to sit down with 
environmentalists to try to thrash out what is best for the future. But only if 
ideas do not get whacky and out of control.

<P>The SFA has a good relationship with Scottish Natural Heritage too. Oddly 
enough the Government environmentalists share the same building.


<P>But Mr Goodlad feels a "frustrating and saddening" gap opening up with other 
groups who he believes, should be saying the same kind of things as the 
fishermen.

<P>"There is no group of folk going to be more affected by overfishing than the 
fishermen. The professional environmentalist at the end of the day won't be 
affected. He will move onto another campaign."

<P>Previous emotionally-charged campaigns have demonized the peoples of harsh 
remote communities who for centuries have hunted whales, seals and other 
mammals. "That whole swathe of world opinion is being focused against two or 
three folk in the Lofoten Islands who are trying to catch 300 whales," he said.

<P>He claims the environmentalists "pay no regard whatsoever to those folk trying 
to make a living there" and believes that merry hell would break loose if 
Shetland fishermen pushed their desire for a seal cull.

<P>"You would never win that argument because the seal is the same as the whale: 
It's become a symbol of the environmental movement and that shows what we are 
up against," said Mr Goodlad.

<P>As Shell discovered last year over Brent Spar, it would be extremely foolish to 
ignore the persuasive power of Greenpeace and the myriad other environmental 
groups. Now it seems that fish-killers are the new target.

<P><B>Catastrophic</B>

<P>"There is a very romantic, urban-centred idealistic view of the marine 
environment and they can speak very glibly of closing the North Sea.because it 
fits into the moralistic agenda. But for folk that have to live in a place like 
Shetland it would be catastrophic."


<P>Without doubt the days of industrial fishing are numbered. Nobody, it seems 
 can justify the catching of more than one 
million tonnes of tiny North Sea fish for oil and meal. They are either the 
foodstuff of bigger fish or would have grown into bigger, valuable fish 
themselves - if they had escaped the nets long enough.

<P>nstead they become anonymous products for humans and livestock in
margarine, biscuits and animal feed.

<P>Mr Goodlad said the SFA is against fisheries like those prosecuted by Norway 

and Denmark for Norway pout and sprats which, as a bycatch, kill immature cod, 
haddock and herring. "That's an absolute scandal. You are decimating the stocks 
from which mature fish come," he said.

<P>But there are two other types of industrial fishery which he does not want to 
see banned. Catching sandeels is fine, he maintains, as long as it is properly 
controlled - like the 3000 tonne Shetland sandeel fishery which is now 
something of a model North Sea fishery with only small boats fishing for a 
short part of the year and closely monitored.

<P>He says it is "one of the most regulated fisheries in the whole North Sea at 
the moment." It did not use to be until it was blamed for not helping the
collapse of seabird breeding in Shetland in the 1980s. Back in 1982 a total of 
52,000 tonnes was taken around Shetland.

<P>Shetland men were also players in the destructive Norway pout fishery of the 
1970s but he said the SFA had had "a good and long record of being totally 
opposed to industrial fisheries with a bycatch".

<P>"The world has moved on," Mr Goodlad said. "We will never return in Shetland to 
a situation we had in the 1980s where you could catch as much sandeels as you 
wanted. We recognise that the fishery will always now be controlled by quota." 
He agrees with Greenpeace that the Wee Bankie sandeel fishery off Edinburgh 
should be controlled at times of the year when a bycatch of small herring is 
being taken. But he objects to their tactics against the fishermen and the use 
of what he called "highly-charged slogans" such as the "hoovering" of fish.

<P>Where Greenpeace and John Goodlad part company on action to be taken on 
industrial fisheries is on the question of "clean" fisheries for the likes of 
blue whiting and the new Atlanto-Scandian herring fishery, neither of which has 
ready markets for human consumption. But at least they do not accidentally 
catch other species.

<P>Of this year's Atlanto-Scandian fishery he said: "It was properly
controlled. What's wrong with that? Greenpeace will say it is because it is 
being converted to fishmeal. That's because a value judgement is being placed 
on this - not science.

<P>"According to the Greenpeace line, those fisheries should be curtailed. Why? 
They are under no threat whatsoever provided you don't take out more than you 
should be allowed under quota. If you don't catch them that fish willdie of old 
age. It's a crazy situation."


<P>In its current campaign publicity Greenpeace has not made specific reference to 
those two "clean" fisheries.

<P>"I think where the fishing industry and the environmentalists have to meet is 
on the question of science. Where we depart is this question of where emotion 
takes over."

<P>Once the anti-sandeel fisherman campaign is over the fishermen wonder who will 
be next? They have endured years of feeling persecuted by government but they 
are used to fighting back too. The green machine presents them with a highly-
skilled potential new adversary.

<P>But Mr Goodlad is no mean communicator himself. He believes the fishing 
industry really needs to hone its act now and get its voice across to the 
consumer and the politician.

<P>To coincide with next year's conference in Bergen, fishing organisations from 
all corners of Europe are hoping to mount a counter-propaganda campaign to 
match the inevitable media campaign by the greens.

<P>Mr Goodlad said:"The world's media will be fed soundbite after soundbite, press 
release after press release of this moralistic agenda that fishermen are bad 
and fish are good and we must save the fish and it doesn't really matter what 
happens to the fishermen. There is another story that has to be told and that 
is the one about the fishermen and the fishing communities and
what it is going to mean right from the south of Spain to the north of Norway."

<blockquote>

<P><B>Friday 19th July 1996</B>



<B> 
<P>I read last week's front page lead item to find that the
'greens' are a-coming. It is possibly vexing that they had not
been spawned a long time back. And what ideas are they
proposing for the fishing industry that are so dastardly?</B>
 
<P>(a) Fishermen being paid to have a rest until stocks recover;
the SFA secretary speaks about 'morality' - what could be more
immoral than to allow the localised extinction of many fish
species, as has happened in the past. On page six of the same
paper no less than 11 lines were allocated to the fact (as in
one) halibut was landed last week. I recall 30-35 years ago
the small boat Pilot Us landing up to a dozen halibut each day
at certain times of the year. How times have changed.
 
<P>(b) Boats should not get bigger and better; ie smaller boats
with more employment. The fleet can either be comprised of a
few large pursers/mega-trawlers (with very well-off
employees), or the opposite. I think most fishermen would
prefer extra employment and steady moderate wages.
 
<P>(c) The green~s only concern is for the fish; I would hope the
fisherman~s concern would be likewise. No fish, no jobs.
 
<P>(d) Use of square mesh nets; anybody with any wit would favour
this. Is 110mm huge? I cannot see any difference between the
sustainable yield comprising, for example, 80 large fish
rather than 250 smaller ones. Remember the smaller ones will
reach full maturity in a  comparatively short time and there
is the significant bonus of at least five per cent more yield
during filleting.
 
<P>(e) The fleet must be cut to protect the most valuable stocks.
Okay, treat the fleet as sacrosanct, decimate the species, and
who wins?
 

<P>(f) Fishing boats should be tracked and policed by one Euro-
force; the honest fisherman would have nothing to fear. Every
other primary industry is governed, regulated or licensed to
some degree so why not fishing?
 
<P>(g) Destructive fishing gear banned or barred from, say,
spawning areas. Surely no comment needed.
 
<P>(h) No discards. Unanimous approval.
 
<P>(i) Lighter, more controlled fishing to help end the
worryingly unpredictable nature of the industry. Seems like
good sense.
 
<P>So what would this environmentalists~ nightmare result in?
Moderate-sized boats, more employment, steadier fishing, no
cheating, spawning areas protection, greater variety of
species, no discards, more food (ie sandeels), larger fish,
better prices. I think that fishermen could live with this.
 
<P>Damn the environmentalists, their presence means we can no
longer enjoy asbestosis, lead poisoning, pesticide residues,
the Great London smog, and a long list of others. No odds, we
are still enjoying BSE beef (people just crazy about it),
Chernobyl mutton (no need to cook), and plenty of other
pollution problems. Did you here the one about the fish off
the Norwegian coast which were so high in metal residues that
all fishing was banned (Shetland Times, January) ? A few of
these filets would certainly be a heavy meal.
 
<P>John Goodlad goes on to argue that fishermen have learned
their lessons from the past. Have they? He agrees that
sandeels were overfished in 1982 and all that was needed was a
1700 per cent reduction; then there was the fun and games with
Norway pout, the herring ban, the lobster collapse, etc. A
precautionary approach could well have prevented these
fiascos. What~s the expression - ~closing the stable door
after the horse has bolted~? And please don~t use seals as a
scapegoat; man, seals and fish have always co-existed since
time immemorial.
 
<P>Over-reaction and exaggeration are always counterproductive

and, far castigating them, fishermen should be embracing green
ideas. I am sincere in my belief that the SFA has a very able
secretary indeed with an exceedingly difficult task - he has
to carry out a balancing act between the pressure of his
members and the deviousness of politicians.
 
<P>Finally, on a drive into Lerwick one day, I said; 'Look at the
size of these fishing boats near the Shetland Catch.' There
was a pause and my wife replied: 'But they're not as big as
the St Clair' 
<P>I made no comment.

<P>Can I assume that you comply with that instruction, sir?

<P><B>John:</B> Not necessarily I'm afraid, because we have to continue with our campaign trying to prevent this damaging fishery on the Wee Bankie. So we feel we have to continue with our actions. But as normal they'll remain non violent direct action.

<P><B>Shetland:</B> I consider the action you've taken so far is

<P><B>Several vessels are trying to get their gear out, The Shetalnd stays very close-by. Hooley is interfering, lots of fireworks are fired. Pernille Kim (them again) turns up and also doesn't succeed to set their nets and start chasing the Sirius. Untill the 12 mile limit, followed by the Shetland. Later 8 Danish vessels start coming for the inflatables also heading direction Sirius. This lastest for over an hour. We kept 9 vessels from fishing for several hours.

I have asked the Sirius to desist, he is chosing to ignore that. At this stage I'm monitoring very carefully the actions of all parties concerned. That you do not make the situation worse by any form of retaliation.

<P><B>Long Forties:</B> I understand perfectly. Your job is to watch. We are not letting them go away. If they are coming outside the 12  
mile border again. I don't know what is happening, I can't tell you. You're welcome to watch it if that's the only job you've got. We can't just sit there. You've got two crew members on that Danish vessel which was attacked. They were not doing anything.  I don't know if you understand our situation, it's our fucking job to be here. It's only our job. We are not allowed to do our job. It is pushed to the limit now, far behind the limit. We cannot give garantee was is happening if he is coming outside the 12 mile border again.

<P><B>Shetland:</B>That is understood. 

</tt>
<P><B>15.00 hrs. Sirius is back on the Wee Bankie.</B>

<P>ALL THE FISHING VESSELS ARE GONE!!!!

<P>There is nobody left. Only HMS Shetland is still sailing around. The German Press Agency (a special news service mainly listening to foreign news) picked up news from radio Copenhagen stating that the Danish fishermen filed a complaint against the HMS Shetland for not protecting their legal rights to fish. Since they were not protected they would leave the area.

<B>Diary from the Greenpeace  ship Mv Sirius 21st July 1996
</B>
<P>Out of Dunbar harbour with room to spare, the <I>Hooley</I> acting as tug, and a farewell party of a couple of hundred Dunbar folk, including the cliff / break wall jumping lads. A quick right, and a return trip to land to dispose of the two young stowaways who had decided to purge their childhood years by donating all their teddy bears and dancing trophies to the Sirius. A final circumambulation of the Isle of May and we head East North East to Coppenhagen.

<P>We had an excellent open day in the harbour on Saturday with well over 1500 visitors coming aboard. The Edinburgh Greenpeace group was there in force and a warm breeze across the harbour was especially welcome after the unseasonally cold and blustery weather of the last few weeks. 

<P>As I write we are passing through a shoal of local Scottish trawlers, between 10
and 15 in the immediate vicinity - small boats each with between 3 and 4 people
on board; not a supertrawler employing a few. The campaign embraces a vital cross-over between social, economic and environmental issues -  I have to say that
this makes our work all the more rewarding.

<P><B>So it's goodbye to Dunbar, and the Wee Bankie for now, but the battle to save 
the North Sea, and all our seas, continues...</B>

    <H3>SOLOMONS MURDER AND CORRUPTION: LOGGING TAKES ITS TOLL
 </H3>
<p>HONIARA, SOLOMON ISLANDS 11 December 1995: Greenpeace today criticised the
Solomon Island government for failing to investigate the killing of an activist who opposed
a Malaysian logging company on Pavuvu, in the Russell Islands. 

<p>Martin Apa, a well-known local opposed to the logging, was killed in Yandina, the main
port. The post-mortem found his neck was broken and a sharp object had pierced it.  
 
<p>"It's been over a month since Martin Apa was brutally killed and the investigation hasn't
moved. But it's no surprise, as the government is hand in hand with the logging company
on Pavuvu," said Lawrence Makili, Greenpeace Solomon Island Forests Campaigner. "Is
this what logging brings to the people: death and destruction? The government must halt
the logging now." 
 
<p>Seven Solomon Island Government Ministers were charged on 4 December for receiving
bribes from Maving Brothers, the company logging Pavuvu. This is the second incidence
in two weeks of major corruption allegations involving government ministers.  

<p>"The stability of the region is under threat. The new arena for resource conflicts is the
'logging fields'. The last thing we need is more Bougainvilles or Ok Tedis," said Grant
Rosoman, Greenpeace New Zealand Forests Campaigner.
 
<p>Since 1989 Pavuvu landowners have been preparing to begin their own programme of
sustainable development. In 1993 they began working with Greenpeace to set up a village
based, ecoforestry project. This year, with support from the joint New Zealand timber
trade and environment organisation, the Imported Tropical Timber Group (ITTG), 12 Russell
Islanders were trained in ecoforestry techniques of timber harvesting.
 
<p>"Here is a community that has been trying to provide a future for their forests and children,
only to be thwarted by aggressive logging.  Martin Apa was a key supporter of ecoforestry
and we fear that he may have been targetted for the stand he took. Pavuvu landowners
are being intimidated into agreeing to further unsustainable logging," said Grant Rosoman,
Greenpeace New Zealand Forests Campaigner, and member of the ITTG. 

<p>In early January a Timber Rights meeting will be held in Russell Islands where Maving Bros.
will propose the logging of the remainder of Pavuvu Island.

<p><h3>OVERVIEW</h3><p>The issue of who develops, benefits and decides over natural
resources in the Pacific region has become increasingly volatile
in the last decade.  The increased rate of exploitation and the
money involved has brought governments, foreign companies and
landowners into conflict.  Landowner discontent and environmental
damage at the Bougainville copper mine was the catalyst for what is now a seven year old civil war.  One of the largest lawsuits
in the region is being brought by landowners along the Fly River
against the mining company at Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea. <p>These conflicts are happening predominantly in Melanesia, rich
in natural resources and where land and coastal areas are still
in customary tenure.  Melanesia includes Papua New Guinea,
Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and Kanaky (New Caledonia).  The
accelerating rate of logging by largescale commercial operations
in Melanesia has even come under severe criticism of the World
Bank.  The "logging fields" are simply the latest arena where
these conflicts are being fought, with increasingly high costs
to the local communities and the environment.

<p>The Solomon Islands lie to the northeast of Australia and east
of Papua New Guinea.  A land area of nearly 30,000 square
kilometres is spread over some 992 islands.  It has a population
of around 340,000 that is growing at 3.5% per year, and is
predominantly Christian.  Although a former British colony,
approximately 90% of the land in Solomon Islands is customarily
owned by family groups.  <p>Around twothirds of the Solomon Islands is covered with tropical
rainforest, and many of the people still live in villages that
depend on the forest for their survival.  This may either be
traditional use or more recently exploitation of their forests
for timber.
<p><center><a href="log6.gif">Gif <img src="log6t.gif" width=72 height=72></a> <a href="log6.jpg"> Jpeg</a></center>
 <p>The last 10 years has seen a wave of foreign logging companies
sweep through Solomon Islands.  The current level of official
production of 830,000 cubic metres, mainly whole log exports, is
running at nearly three times the sustainable level, according
to the 1994 Annual Report of the Central Bank of Solomon Islands. 
Considerable concern has been raised over this situation, from
in Solomon Islands and in the wider Pacific region, and also in
the international financial institutions the IMF and ADB.  With
more than 60% of government revenue coming from tariffs on log
exports to Japan and Korea, the country's economy seems locked
into a spiral of resource depletion and unsustainable development.

<p>Logging has become very controversial recently, with the public
exposure of bribes paid to government Ministers from logging
companies.  The Solomon Star newspaper reported on 10th November
that US$2.2 million was paid in bribes from the logging company
Integrated Forestry Industry Ltd, a subsidiary of Malaysian
company Kumpulan Emas, to Ministers and other government employees.  This revelation has shaken the country, with many
calls for the resignation or sacking of the Ministers concerned. 
<p><center><a href="banknote.gif">Gif <img src="shield.gif" width=144 height=144 border=0></a> <a href="banknote.jpg"> Jpeg</a></center><center><a href="banknote.gif">TO BRIBE IS TO SERVE</a></center>
<p>A  large protest march occurred in the capital, Honiara on 29th
November, called by the Union, Churches and NonGovernment
Organisations.  The journalist Duran Angiki, who reported the
story for the Solomon Star was sacked following pressure from the government and logging companies.  He is now taking legal action
against the newspaper for his dismissal.  However, on 4th
December, three of the seven Solomon Island Government Ministers
charged appeared in the Central Magistrates Court in the capital
Honiara on corruption charges. They are due to appear again and
are expected to make their pleas next month.
<p>Apart from government attempts to censor the media, it is of
serious concern for freedom of speech in Solomon Islands that at
the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM) meeting in
Auckland, the Solomon Is government was one of only two countries
to vote against the suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth
for the execution of 9 environmental activists.
<p>Additionally, some of the logging companies come with a track
record from the east Malaysian state of Sarawak, of destruction
of rainforests and tribal forest people's lives.  Logging by
Malaysian company Maving Brothers Ltd has been at the heart of
a controversy in the Russell Islands over corruption, land
rights, and environmental destruction.  Violence in the Russells
is escalating as logging predictably divides communities into
those who support the logging and receive payments from it, and
those who oppose it.  The conflict eventually turns the community
inward on itself.  With the longstanding armed conflict on
nearby Bougainville and tension between mining companies and
landowners elsewhere in Melanesia, logging is a major concern for
the continued stability and security of the region.
<p><center><a href="log4.gif">Gif <img src="log4t.gif" width=72 height=72></a> <a href="log4.jpg"> Jpeg</a></center>
<p>Logging has reached such heights of activity because of the huge
amounts of profits that can be generated.  However, less than 5%
of the profits actually stay with the resource owners, with the
companies and government taking the lions share.  Until recently,
the only opportunity for landowners to make a financial income
from their forest resources, was through logging.  It was part
of a dilemma that many faced: the need for cash for education,
health, housing and consumer goods but wanting to protect their
natural resources for the future. 
<p>However, a tide of smallscale alternatives is rising to challenge destructive foreign logging.  One of these landowner
alternatives is `ecoforestry', or harvesting timber in an
ecologically and socially responsible way.  Greenpeace has been
working with the Russell Island communities and with the New
Zealand Imported Tropical Timber Group (ITTG) to establish these
initiatives.

<p>The controversial government logging of Pavuvu Is in the Russell
Group has divided a peaceful community with the recent murder of
antilogging leader Martin Apa.  He was brutally killed on 30th
October as the Malaysian company Maving Brothers was making a
push to log the rest of Pavuvu Is.  Both the company and the Solomons government are implicated in the murder, the government
doubly so through failing after a month to send an investigative
team to find his killers. Previously, in July this year, tensions
reached a high point as frustrated local landowners set three
company bulldozers on fire.  Both of these incidents mark further
chapters in the sorry saga of a government supported foreign
company logging against the wishes of the local landowners.

<p><h3>BACKGROUND: A LEGACY OF BRITISH COLONIAL MEDDLING</h3><P>The Russell Islands lie 45 km northwest of Guadalcanal in Central
Solomon Islands.  12,427 ha Pavuvu Island is the largest of the
20 inhabited islands of the Russells group.  Few people currently
live on Pavuvu, because late last century missionaries, traders
and developers forced the indigenous people to move to outer
islands.  In the 1920s the British colonial Lands Commissioner
effectively stole the undeveloped areas of Pavuvu and leased them
to the British company Levers Pacific Ltd.  At that time
customary landowners agreed to the sale (for 500 pounds) of only
the areas already developed by Levers into plantations, not the
whole area as claimed by the British colonial government. <p>Considerable areas in northern Pavuvu have been cleared of
rainforest for coconut and cocoa plantations.  The 1000 yard
strip encircling the lower half of the island was not developed
(it has been logged now), and since the late 1980s Levers have
been unable to clear the forest due to a corporate policy that
prohibits clearing rainforests.  Levers Solomon Island Ltd, still
has a current lease over most of these areas, though Levers
International sold their interests in the company this year.  

<p>In the 1960s and 1970s the indigenous landowners of Pavuvu (known
as the Lavukal) began a campaign to have the lands leased by
Levers, or what is known as the `alienated lands' returned to
customary control.  They have been fighting ever since, with the
1990s seeing this intensified under the threat of logging.  The
main avenue to have the land returned is via legislation that
covers the Alienated Lands, where a requirement is that the
indigenous communities must have a viable development project for
the land.

<p>The forests on this beautiful hat shaped island (steep mountain
centre with coastal flat ground) are rich in valuable timber. 
An Australian aidfunded forest assessment in 1992 found that
Pavuvu contains more than 130,000 cubic metres of harvestable
logs, worth more than US$20 million.  However, the landowners
have ideas other than logging.  They have developed their own
resettlement scheme that involved establishing a landowner
company Lavukal Resources Development Ltd, and included small scale ecoforestry and ecotourism. As of November 1995 a total of
12 Russell Islanders had been through a six week ecoforestry
training course, with several now completing management plans in
preparation for harvesting on their customary land on Pavuvu
Island.  They are very near to harvesting and marketing timber
from their forests themselves.  The ITTGsupported ecoforestry
training has received funding from the New Zealand government.

company, Maving Brothers Ltd.  The Maving Bros company directors
include Solomon Islander Robert Belo, and Malaysians Hii Kiong
Mee and Hii Yew Mee.  Working with politicians, they have secured
a licence to log the alienated lands to pave the way for a
proposed government "development" and resettlement scheme.  They
tried to start operations in 1992 but were forced to back off
after landowners threatened to burn their machinery.  They
returned in 1995 with the support of the recently returned
Mamaloni government, and the government paramilitary defence
force.

'approval' to be given for logging to start by Maving Brothers
Ltd.  When the logging equipment arrived the landowners began a
peaceful sit in protest at the logging camp.  The government
responded by having a Paramilitary Field Force (PFF) move in and
make arrests.  The PFF has been stationed there ever since in
support of the company and vested government interests.
<p>Landowners have tried every peaceful means possible to have the
Solomons government halt the logging and address their concerns,
including many meetings, a petition and peaceful rallies. 
<p><center><a href="log1.gif">Gif <img src="log1t.gif" width=72 height=72></a> <a href="log1.jpg"> Jpeg</a></center>   
<p>The government has responded with military and police force, with
propaganda that all the landowners now support logging, with
censorship of the media and diversionary plans of a fake settlement scheme.  Alan Kemakeza, Minister of Forests, Conservation and Environment claims that "the Pavuvu alienated
lands are owned by the government, not the people of Russell
Islands".  Yet he also says the reason for the logging is for
resettlement and return of the lands to the customary owners.  
Since April the trees have been falling at a rapid rate.  The
only fresh water source on southern Pavuvu has been polluted with
silt and many shipments of logs have already been shipped to
Japan.  With the "alienated" lands almost exhausted the company
is now pursuing logging of the actual customary lands.  It is
expected that bogus "landowners" will sign agreements to log
these areas, pitting the actual landowners in further direct
conflict with the company and government.

<p><h3>ILLEGAL AND DESTRUCTIVE LOGGING</h3><p>An investigative mission by the opposition party in Solomon
Islands recommended that the logging be halted immediately and
the land returned to the customary landowners.  Furthermore, a
recent investigative visit by Greenpeace to Pavuvu confirmed
local reports of illegal and destructive practices.  
<p>According to Greenpeace Solomon Island Forests Campaigner
Lawrence Makili, both the government and the company are guilty
of lies and destructive practices.

<p><center><a href="log2.gif">Gif <img src="log2t.gif" width=72 height=72></a> <a href="log2.jpg"> Jpeg</a></center>
<p>"We found that more than half the logs at the Pavuvu camp were
undersize, there was illegal logging on customaryowned land, and
destructive practices such as cutting next to a stream and
hauling the log up the stream bed.  Yet before logging started
in April, the government promised landowners that the operations
would be controlled and monitored by government forestry, lands
and agriculture officers.  None of this has happened.  There's
only destruction," he said.  "When a company representative was
asked about the undersize logs, he said`they came from when large
trees have fallen onto small ones', but this does not account for
the large proportion and we observed freestanding small trees
that had been felled."<p>Despite widespread public condemnation of the logging, the
government has refused to halt it and address the concerns of the
landowners.  A public opinion poll in Honiara in June found that
85% of people agreed that landowners should have the first say
over any development of their land.

 <p>"This failure of the government to respect customary land rights
threatens the very foundation stone of Melanesian culture.  It
is not government for the people but basic profiteering for a few
people," Makili said.

<P>In 1992, the devestating collapse of the cod stocks off the east 
coast of Newfoundland forced the Canadian government to take 
drastic measures and close the fishery.  Over 40,000 people lost 
there jobs.  The communities are still struggling to recover.  The 
marine ecosystem is still in a state of collapse. 
  
<P>The collapse of this vital and important fishery sounded a warning 
bell to governments around the world who were shocked that a 
relatively sophisticated, scientifically-based fisheries management 
program, not unlike their own, could have gone so wrong.  The 
Canadian government had been warned by scientists and 
environmentalists that the cod stocks were overexploited and that 
there fleets were employing destructive fishing practices.  The 
refused to significantly reduce quotas sighting the loss of jobs as 
too great a concern.  The cost of their short term outlook and 
refusal to acknowledge ecological limits was devestating. 
 
<H3>THE STORY </H3>

<P>The ocean around the rocky shores of Newfoundland were once so full 
of cod  that explorer John Cabot marveled in 1497 that they 
virtually  blocked his ship.  In the centuries to follow, fish 
became the one of the only reasons anyone ever came to  
Newfoundland, or stayed.   Until the mid-twentieth century,  
 
<P>Canadians had traditionally fished  mainly in waters relatively 
closer to shore, in small craft using traditional techniques such 
as traps, jigging from a dory, or small inshore gill-nets, 
longlines or small trawlers.   They joined fishing boats from Spain 
and Portugal whose crews  had also traditionally fished in the 
northwest Atlantic since before Newfoundland was colonized. 
  
<P>The most productive cod fishing area in the vast northwest Atlantic 
region was located off southern Labrador and to the east of 
Newfoundland where the highly productive population of "northern 
cod"  had yielded an overall annual catch of about 250,000 tons for 
more than a century prior to the mid-1950s. 
  
<H3>INVASION OF THE DISTANT-WATER FISHING FACTORIES </H3>

<P>The northern cod fishery entered its boom-bust phase in the 
mid-1950s.    It was then that  Newfoundland's "banks" or "deep 
sea" schooner and dory fishery, which had been established in the 
late nineteen century,  was displaced by a new breed of 
factory-fishing vessel.1    Modelled on the distant-water whaling 
factory ships, these new "factory trawlers" came from countries 
thousands of miles away in search of herring, haddock,  flatfish, 
capelin, redfish, and, of course,  the valuable northwest Atlantic 
cod.  Up until the late 1970s these distant-water factory trawlers 
from Germany (East and West), Great Britain, Spain and Portugal, 
Poland, the Soviet Union,  Cuba and even from as far as east Asia 
had legally  fished to within 12 miles of the eastern Canadian and 
New England (US) seaboards.   They set and hauled their collosal 
nets from the stern,  quickly processing and deep-freezing nearly 
all the fish they caught, working around the clock in all but the 
worst weather conditions. 
  
 
<H3>DESTRUCTION OF THE NORTHERN COD </H3>

<P>With the increased effort by distant-water fleets, catches of 
northern cod increased in the late 1950s and early 1960s and peaked 
at just over  800,000 tons by 1968.3   The distant-water fleet were 
subjecting the northern cod to intense, unprecedented fishing 
pressure, and by 1975 the declining northern cod population was 
insufficient to yield even 300,000 tonnes, while various species of 
hake, and other groundfish populations showed dramatic drops too. 
Canada (and the U.S.),  concerned that stocks were being reduced to 
almost nothing,  passed legislation in 1976 to extend their 
national jurisdictions over marine living resources out to 200 
nautical miles.   The "foreign" fishing fleets were banished to the 
"high seas". 
  
<P>Catches naturally declined after the departure of the foreigners to 
just 139,000 tonnes in 1978, which is probably the level where the 
federal government should have capped it then, and left it for many 
years,  to give the stock the chance to recover.  Instead, 
government and investors in fishing were, like the foreigners, 
thinking big.   Soon, the stern factory-trawlers, or draggers as 
they became known, became the mainstay of Canada's Atlantic 
offshore fishing fleet, and the northern cod catch began a steady 
rise again as a result.   By the mid-1980s, it was the Canadians 
who were landing more than 250,000 tonnes of northern cod 
annually.4 
  
<H3>DESTRUCTIVE DRAGGER TECHNOLOGY </H3>

<P>Massive investments poured into constructing these huge "draggers". 
Draggers haul enormous, baglike nets, as long as a football field, 
held open by a combination of huge steel plates or "doors" and 
heavy chains and rollers that plow and scrape the ocean bottom. 
They drag up whole schools of fish and anything else in the way, 
inflicting immense  damage to immature target and non-target fish 
and the benthic (bottom-dwelling) community.     They were not only 
destroying critical habitiat, but they also contributed to 
destabilizing the ecosystem of the northern cod. 
  
<P>The draggers targetted huge aggregations of cod while they were 
spawning,  a time when the fish population is highly vulnerable to 
capture and to the physical impacts of the bottom-trawling gear on 
the environment.   Detractors of the technology claim that the 
excessive trawling on spawning stocks became highly disruptive to 
the spawning process, negatively impacting the reproductive 
behaviour of the fish.5  In addition, the trawling activity is 
thought to result in a physical dispersion of eggs and milt leading 
to a higher fertilzation failure.    Physical and chemical damage 
to larvae caused by the trawling action may also reduce their 
chances of  survival. 
  
<P>The effect of selective fishing on spawning grounds - that is, 
selectively over-exploiting one species in an ecosystem -- can have 
disastrous effect on the feeding relationships in that ecosystem. 
This contributes to the overall reduction of spawning stock biomass 
of the targeted species, but also an increase in the number of 
invertebrate and vertebrate predators such as crustacean and fish 
which will prey on cod eggs, larvae, and younger fish.6   It is 
little wonder that a species, like cod,  would eventually run into 
difficulties struggling to survive when its habitat is being 
continuously destroyed and the balance of their food chain has been 
disrupted. 
  
<H3>THE PERMISSIVE APPROACH TO FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT </H3>

<P>Throughout the 1980s, the annual catch of Canada's northern cod 
fishing fleet hovered around the 250,000 tonnes mark, as the 
Canadian government kept promoting more investment. 
Newfoundland's small-scale, inshore cod fishermen, however, were 
voicing concerns long before anyone else that the abundance of the 
northern cod population was not as healthy as scientists were 
reporting.    Contradictory to scientific data, traditional inshore 
fishermen in Newfoundland began to notice declining catches before 
the mid-1980s.    By 1986 the scientists also realized that the 
stock was declining, and by 1988 had recommended the total 
allowable catch be cut in half.   Instead of acting immediately, in 
a precautionary manner to protect dwindling fish stocks by 
substantially reducing catch quotas at the first signs of 
overfishing,  the federal government delayed conservation action, 
choosing instead quite moderate reductions of the total allowable 
catch beginning in 1989.   It wasn't until 1990, following several 
years of analysis and re-analysis of data from stock surveys 
(without simultaneously reducing catch quotas)  that the 
 
<P>Independent Review of the state of the Northern Cod stock concluded 
that the population, the biomass, the spawning population, and the 
spawning biomass of the Northern Cod were all in decline and that 
fishing-related mortality was at dangerously high levels. 
  
<P>By 1992, the biomass estimate for northern cod was the lowest ever 
measured.  The Canadian Minister of Fisheries and Oceans had no 
choice but to declare a ban on fishing northern cod.  For the first 
time in 400 years  the fishing of northern cod ceased in 
Newfoundland.  The fisheries department issued a warning in 1995 
that the entire northern cod population had declined  to just 1,700 
tonnes by the end of 1994, down from a 1990 biomass survey showing 
400,000 tonnes,  and showed no sign of recovery - just 1700 tonnes 
remained in a fishery that had for over a century yielded a 
quarter-million ton catches, year after year.   The fisheries 
department also predicted that, even in the unlikely event that the 
fish stock started an immediate recovery, it would take at least 15 
years before it would be healthy enough to withstand significant 
fishing. 
  
<P>Following on the heels of the '92 ban on northern cod fishing, 
fisheries for cod in other areas and for most other species of 
groundfish  around eastern Canada also had to be either severely 
curtailed or  closed altogether  because of serious depletion.   An 
estimated 30 thousand people that had already lost their jobs after 
the 1992 Northern Cod moratorium took effect, were joined by an 
additional 12,000 fishermen and plant workers following these 
additional cutbacks and closures.  With more than forty thousand 
people out of jobs, Newfoundland became an economic disaster area, 
as processing plants shut down, and vessels from the smallest dory 
to the monster draggers were made idle or sold overseas at bargain 
prices. Several hundred Newfoundland communities were devastated.  
 
<P>In response the federal government put up nearly a billion dollars 
as a stopgap measure to assist with social welfare payments and 
retraining of dispossed fishing people in 1993 and 1994.  But that 
would only be the beginning of the taxpayer funded payout to cover 
the calamity, with forecasts that the social welfare bill would hit 
at least another billion dollars, and possibly even more. 
  
<H3>LESSONS TO BE LEARNED: </H3>
  
<P>Government and industry must share the blame for allowing the 
seemingly limitless stocks of cod to dwindle to near-extinction. 
They were too busy,  following the takeover of the 200 mile zone, 
with making plans, setting expansive goals, and then allocating 
fish, and lots of it, instead of making sound, conservative 
business plans to match fishing effort with the limited 
availability of the resource.   Blame also lies with the federal 
government for its overly optimistic reliance on science in 
predicting a large increase in Canada's cod catch in the 1970s and 
1980s.    Instead of giving the severely stressed cod and other 
groundfish populations a respite from fishing pressure, Ottawa 
began freely issuing liscenses, and subsidies were provided big 
companies to build bigger ships and  processing plants.    Industry 
employment  rose 60 percent in two decades. 
  
<P>It is at such points that the dynamic known as "the ratchet effect" 
sets in, as it classically does in virtually all fisheries in 
modern times.    The "ratchet effect" takes hold in the initial 
stages of exploitation of a new fishery, expansion of an existing 
fishery, or deployment of a new technology or fishing method. 
During this stage, harvesting rates increase rapidly and stabilize 
at excessive, unsustainable levels.  Government, which is supposed 
to regulate the fishery, is motivated instead to remove obstacles 
so that profits from the fishery can grow.  Often, governments 
offer attractive subsidies, with ready takers drawn by high yields 
and substantial profits during this initially stable period. 
Investment in vessels and/or processing grows rapidly. 
  
<P>Conditions soon change, however, and yields start to decline. Then, 
when the results of additional scientific research and improved 
knowledge necessitate calls for reductions in the 
allowable catch, industry appeals to government for help or special 
consideration, because, by this point, substantial investments and 
jobs are at risk.   The typical response by government at this 
point is to delay a decision, pending the results of more research. 
Government procrastinates, arguing that no substantive data is 
available upon which to base a decision to reduce fishing effort, 
and without conclusive information the status quo is maintained.   
The scientific process required to acquire, analyse and respond to 
such information can take several years.  Government often agrees 
to commit even more subsidies to bolster troubled investors, which 
only masks the real problem -- the need for (often dramatic) 
cutbacks.   But, the overall effect of government subsidies is to 
encourage over-harvesting.   The ratchet effect thrives on 
government's failure to regulate the tendency for fisheries 
investments to expand during good periods, but applies strong 
pressure not to dis-invest at the first evidence of poor periods.  
 
<P>The Canadian Atlantic fisheries collapse illustrates how government 
support for the expansionist motivations of private  investors in 
fisheries often results in society at large being long term losers. 
The profits from capital intensive, hi-tech, industrial scale 
fisheries are privatised by investors during the 
boom years, while the costs of such irrational economic behaviour 
are 
socialised for years after the crash.  In Canada's,  case a two- 
billion dollar recovery bill may only be a part of the total long 
term costs. The human costs to individuals and desperate 
communities now deprived of meaningful and sustainable employment 
is staggering. The trauma suffered by some 40,000 workers and their 
families in Newfoundland cannot be measured in dollars and cents.  
 
<P>The Canadian calamity also demonstrates that we now have the 
technological capability to find and annihilate every commercial 
fish stock, in any ocean and sea, and do irreparable damage to 
entire ecosystems in the process.   Newfoundland and the Northern 
Cod fishery might still be thriving today if Canada had taken a 
precautionary approach to the development of its Atlantic fisheries 
back in the late '70s, instead of the permissive approach which 
doomed the fishery to collapse.

<P>On Sunday June 30 Danish industrial fishing boats left the Wee Bankie off the 
Firth of Forth, and have so far not returned.
 

<P>This briefing summarises the key points of the campaign to date, with emphasis 
on the UK, assesses the significance of the disappearance of industrial fishers 
from the Wee Bankie, and outlines some of the next steps in the campaign.
 


<P><H3>CAMPAIGN TO DATE</H3>
 

<P><B>On land:</B>
 
<LI> Since February this year Greenpeace has been in regular contact with 
Government Ministers and MPs concerning overfishing and the steps needed to be 
taken by the North Sea Conferences and through the Common Fisheries Policy on 
industrial fisheries, cod and herring stocks, and other issues. The industrial 
fisheries campaign is one part of this.
 
<LI> Greenpeace has successfully urged companies to avoid purchasing the 
products of industrial fishing from sensitive areas in the North Sea, and after 
meetings and some protests, UK companies including Unilever, Pura Foods, 
Safeway, Sainsbury, Tesco and United Biscuits have all committed to move out of 
such fish oil. Their main use was in margarine.  Greenpeace has urged a similar 
move on the main UK raw processor of such products, the company Biomar which 
owns a plant in Grangemouth, Scotland.
 
<LI> On May 7 Greenpeace met with the Danish industrial fishing industry 
(fishers and processors) in Copenhagen, to ask for a voluntary stop to 
industrial fishing in sensitive areas.
 
<LI> In the UK Parliament Elliot Morley MP (Labour Spokesman), Alex Salmond MP 
(SNP), Menzies Campbell (MP) and others have all either supported the 
Greenpeace campaign on industrial fishing or raised the issue and pressed for 
action from Ministers, for example with an Early Day Motion.
 
<LI>Greenpeace has contacted many biologists and other scientists with 
information and received support for the industrial fishing campaign for 
example from the Southampton Oceanography Centre.
 
<LI> In June Greenpeace obtained and sent to the UK Government, a legal opinion 
from Barristers Sands and Sheridan of Grays Inn, showing that it already has 
the powers to close the fishery on sensitive areas such as the Wee Bankie, and 

can then explain this to the European Commission and take up the matter in the 
EU Council if necessary
 
<LI>All the main environment groups in the UK and many fishermen and others 
have supported a joint statement calling for action from Fisheries Minister of 
State, Tony Baldry MP.
 </UL>


<P><B>At Sea:</B>
 

<P>Since April Greenpeace has monitored some 10,000 square miles of the North Sea, 
as part of a campaign to keep industrial fishing out of sensitive areas (map 
available with explanatory criteria). These areas are east of the Scottish 
coast and on the Danish, Dutch and German coast.  Information from sea and air 
surveillance and from other fishermen and mariners indicates that for almost 
all of this period, the industrial fishing fleet has kept out of the designated 
zone and fishing was restricted to a handful of incursions by one or two boats 
lasting a few hours. In normal years, industrial fishing is intensive in these 
areas, and information received indicates that the fleet stayed away due to the 
Greenpeace presence.
 

<P>Throughout May, the Greenpeace ship MV Sirius met with and delivered leaflets 
to more than twenty Danish, Norwegian, Faeroese and Scottish industrial fishing 
vessels at sea for example on the Dogger Bank and Long Forties off Aberdeen, 
asking them to stay out of the sensitive areas.  Campaigners went on board a 
number of vessels to explain the reasons for the campaign. There are up to 
eight UK industrial fishing boats and at least 115 Danish ships engaged in the 
1996 sandeel industrial fishing season.
 

<P>By mid June the Danish Government was indicating that it might yield to 
pressure from other Governments to cut back or stop another industrial fishery 
(sprat, mainly in the Baltic and off the Danish North Sea coast). Information 
from Denmark suggested that the fishermen were now "desperate" to exploit the 
sandeel fishery and would arrive on the Wee Bankie.
 

<P>On Saturday 22 June Greenpeace encountered three boats on the Wee Bankie.  The 
MV Sirius conducted an action against the English vessel Omega B when it began 
attempting to fish on Sunday 23. From Sunday 23 to Sunday 30 June there were up 
to 28 boats present at one
time, with 60 seen in total. Some 20 industrial fishing boats were within 3 - 6 
nautical square miles at any one time. Greenpeace conducted repeated actions to 
try and stop them fishing, using swimmers, an inflatable boom and inflatable 
boats to reach and try to stop the setting (putting out) of the nets.
 
<P>In this time Danish boats repeatedly fired flares, threw an explosive device 
into a Greenpeace boat, swung a ship into the bow of the MV Sirius, threw beer 
bottles, seized Greenpeace equipment, lashed out at inflatables with a knife on 
the end of a long pole, and tried to chase and ram the Sirius. The vessel 
Pernille Kim chased and threatened to sink the Sirius. At no time did 
Greenpeace use any form of violence in its protest,  nor did it cut any of the 
gear of any Danish or other fishing ship.
 
</P>From Wednesday 26 June the Fisheries Protection Vessel HMS Shetland was in the 
area.
 

<P>On Sunday 30 June the Danish Fishermen's Organisation informed Copenhagen Radio 
that the industrial fleet would leave the Wee Bankie because the UK Fisheries 
Protection Agency was not giving them sufficient support by stopping 
Greenpeace. They added that they would return to "sink the Sirius". Shortly 
before this statement was broadcast, some 13 Danish boats were actively fishing 
in the area, and up to seven were chasing the Sirius. By mid-afternoon there 
were no industrial fishing boats on the Wee Bankie, and aerial surveillance 
showed there were none elsewhere in the Scottish sensitive areas. Since then 
the only sighting on the Wee Bankie has been one Danish industrial fishing 
boat, which was not fishing but steaming towards Denmark, on Monday.
 

<P>By Sunday evening the Danish MP Kent Kirk who owns the industrial trawler Sand 
Kirk said that: "My information is that the Danish boats are returning because 
there are no more fish in the area" (Daily Telegraph 1 July). He added: "The 
fleet will be back, including my boat, when the fish return".
 

<P>On the afternoon of Monday 1 July the Danish fisheries spokesman Nils Vikman 
repeated this in an interview on BBC Scotland. He was then asked: "So they're 
leaving the area because there aren't any sandeels. Have they caught any 
sandeels in the area which clearly can't sustain the fishing ?"  He replied: 
"Well if they caught some it's ok for the environment, that's the
normal occurrence in fishing and when you go to an area where you find fish and 
when you can't find any more fish in that area you go to another area".
 

<P>He was then asked if this meant the area was overfished and said: "Well if that 
is the case that should have been the case for the past thirty years for each 
single area in the North Sea and it just happens that now is the time where the 
season is ending in that area for sandeels.  It might we be that in three weeks 
time you will find plenty of sandeel in that area again".
 

<P>This statement is factually wrong if for no other reason than because the 
sandeel fishery on the Wee Bankie started only in 1990, as is recorded in the 
Danish fish industry publication: "The Insignificant Sandeel" (Association of 
Fish Meal and Oil Manufacturers, K P Madsen).
 

<P>It is not possible to say with any certainty exactly how much of the sandeel 
from the Wee Bankie the Danish and other industrial fishermen have taken this 
year because the catch landing data from Denmark is not available for about 
eighteen months.  Nor can one say what percentage of the sandeels in the area 
have been taken because there are no baseline data (ie no population 
assessments).
 

<P><B>What can be said with a reasonable degree of certainty is:</B>
<UL>
<LI>The sudden departure of the industrial fishing boats on a day when they 
had been actively fishing certainly suggests a political decision by the 
fishermen, as they said in their original statement, rather than because there 
were no fish, as they claimed later, in which case one would have expected to 
see a more gradual disappearance.
 
<LI> Despite the lateness of the 1996 season, the fleet stayed off the Wee 
Bankie much longer than normal, and was fishing there (seven days) for a much 
shorter time than normal, although the effort has been more intense. If all 60 
vessels each landed 500 tonnes then some 30,000 tonnes may have been taken. 
This year was the first year that some of the boats had been to the Wee Bankie.
 
<LI> It may be expected (see footnote) that sandeel numbers may increase again 
on the Wee Bankie and that fishers may try to return, in the next few weeks. 
However, on the basis of previous years, the main part of the season is now 
over.
 
<LI>The exact long term impact of the current level of fishing cannot be 
ascertained but on the precautionary principle, the fishery here should be 
stopped and in the North Sea as a whole, strictly curtailed. The prescription 
of the Danish fishing spokesman, to go from place to place as stocks are 
depleted, is a recipe for overfishing. The present pattern in data from the
Wee Bankie may reflect an overexploitation - ie catches rising and then falling 
but there is inadequate baseline and fishing effort data.
 
<LI>This (early July) is at a peak time for feeding among breeding seabirds, 
for example on the Isle of May, and the activities of the industrial fishing 
boats will have removed large amounts of food from these birds. Sandeel can be 
over 90% of the food of young puffins on the Isle of May.
 
<BR>Without detailed at sea and on shore studies of both birds and fish, the exact 
impact cannot be ascertained.
 
<LI> Similarly the local whitefish will be affected, to an unknown extent, by 
the removal of a food species. Local fishermen assert that this is the case for 
example with haddock.  ICES studies show that fish in this area can contain 
high levels of sandeel in their stomachs eg 100% in cod in the 3rd quarter in 
1985, 97% 1st quarter in 1986, 65% and 75% in 1st and 3rd quarters in 1987.
 </UL>

<P><B>Next Steps</B>
 <UL>
<LI>  Now that industrial fishers have at least temporarily left the Wee Bankie, 
there is an immediate opportunity for Government action by the UK acting if 
necessary with others such as Denmark, to close sensitive areas.
 
<LI> Greenpeace will continue to campaign to show the rapidly gathering support 
for urgent action, for example the Anglo Scottish Fish Producers' Organisation, 
Menzies Campbell MP  Lib Dem, Fife NE, and  Henry McLeish MP Lab,  Fife 
Central, have signed the statement attached, since it appeared in The 
Independent on 1 July.
 
<LI>Greenpeace continues to patrol the sensitive areas of the North Sea.
 
<LI> Greenpeace will produce information regarding the wildlife of the Wee 
Bankie, for example birds, whales and dolphins.  In recent weeks Greenpeace and 
an independent observer have recorded wildlife including 26 minke whale 
sightings on one day, and 200 white beaked dolphins at one time.
 
<LI>  Greenpeace will produce information concerning the involvement of UK 
vessels in industrial fishing.

<LI> Greenpeace continues to press for a range of "emergency measures" by 
European Fisheries and Environment Ministers to protect the North Sea, 
including an end to the sprat industrial fishery which has a high herring by 
catch, the elimination of discards and effective elimination of bycatch in 
general, and substantial cuts in the catch of herring and cod.  [Full details 
of these demands are available].

</UL>
<BR><HR><BR>
<B>FOOTNOTE</B>
 

<P>In previous years the "season" has extended over at least 4 - 6 weeks and 
catches were (ICES data) as follows:
 
<P>1994
<BR>2nd quarter (ie April, May, June) - 33,900 tonnes
<BR>3rd quarter (ie July, August, September) - 8,100 tonnes
 
<P>1993
<BR>2nd quarter (ie April, May, June) - 102,000 tonnes
<BR>rd quarter (ie July, August, September) - 27,000 tonnes
 
<P>1992
<BR>2nd quarter (ie April, May, June) - 44,000 tonnes
<BR>3rd quarter (ie July, August, September) - 1,000 tonnes
 
The "season" can be expected to result from (a) availability of sandeels to 
fishermen, and (b) the impact of the fishing - ie when they fish the area out, 
and, (c) whether the fishers then go elsewhere to exploit other stocks. Local 
fishermen and other authorities say that on the Wee Bankie, the "normal" season 
since 1990 has been in May and early June.
 
<P>Sandeel are definitely present after this time: ie present in the water above 
the sand - most of the year they live buried in it. For example the study 
"Biology of Sandeels in the Vicinity of Seabird Colonies at Shetland" (Marine 
Laboratory Aberdeen Fisheries Report 15/93) included some research in the Wee 
Bankie area and for example notes underwater video recordings of sandeels 
shoaling from 22-26 July off the Isle of May.
 

<P>Sandeel populations are made up of different age groups and fishers may be 
exploiting different ones at different times. Within an age class sizes may 
vary considerably depending on conditions for growth after spawning, eg in 
Shetland in July 1990 the O class (the young of the current year varied in size 
from 4.5cms to 10cms. There is also local movement (though no evidence for long 
distance migration) within and between populations and sub-populations.

<BR><B>Overfishing in the North Sea now threatens the entire marine ecosystem 
and since the 1990s has placed virtually all commercial fish species, including 
cod, hake, herring, haddock, mackerel, plaice, saithe, and whiting at 
dangerously low levels and at risk of stock collapse.</B>
</td></tr></table>



<P>Were you asked to identify some of the most remarkable wildlife areas in the 
world, the chances are that you would list the tropical rainforests, the 
savannas of Africa, coral reefs or the Antarctic. What we all tend to forget, 
overlook, or take for granted, is one remarkable area right on our doorstep - 
The North Sea. 



<P>The North Sea is an extraordinary natural phenomenon. Warm ocean currents cross 
the Atlantic, keeping it free of the ice that would normally lock up a sea at 
this latitude for much of the year. Coastal rivers have historically delivered 
just the right amount of nutrients - neither too much or too little - to create 
an extremely productive system. The shallow waters of the North Sea have 
assisted in this process. 

<P>A diverse and extremely productive ecosystem has developed in these conditions. 
Plant and animal plankton of surreal beauty grow in profusion. They in turn 
provide food for over 200 species of fish. At the top of the food web are 
seals, porpoises, and dolphins, as well as leviathans such as Orca, minke and 
fin whales that, usually unnoticed go as they swim just offshore from some of 
the most industrialised parts of the planet. Around the sea's margins the 
abundance of life on rocky shores and shimmering mud flats attracts vast 
numbers of birds, including migrants from the Arctic, Antarctic and the 
equator,  giving the North Sea truly global importance. 

<P>Nevertheless the North Sea is today only a shadow of what it once was, and what 
it can become. In the fourteenth century, right whales still swam in the 
Channel. In the middle ages London apprentices are reputed to have rioted, 
complaining of their monotonous and cheap diet of salmon. Large sturgeon 
migrated up the rivers to spawn, where they were frequently caught as recently 
as the last century. Cod grew to full age, a length of over 2 metres, and a 
weight of 90 kg (200 pounds). They and herring were of legendary abundance; the 
Scottish fishers alone, with their small boats and simple nets, were landing 
three quarters of a billion of each species little more than a hundred years 
ago. In the 1920s and 30s huge halibut and skate were still being caught, that 
had to be individually winched off the boat's deck with a crane. Tuna were 
still present, feeding on the herring, in large enough numbers to support a 
fishery until the mid-1960s. 

<P><a href="../pics/nsea01.gif"><img align=top src="../thumbs/nsea01t.gif"></a>


<a href="../pics/nsea02.gif"><img align=top src="../thumbs/nsea02t.gif"></a>
<font size=-1><BR>1938 - World record Tunny catch. Blue Fin Tuna caught off the Dogger Bank, in the North Sea. 
 In 
1953, it was estimated that 3-4000 tunny were caught, since 
then tunny has diappeared from the North Sea.</font>



<P>Fish such as herring and pilchard, have always been notorious for their fickle 
nature, shifting their grounds or even disappearing from view, disrupting local 
fishing communities. But the pace of change has accelerated. The size of fish 
being landed is going down, and fishing boats have to go further afield for 
their catches. North Sea mackerel and herring stocks collapsed in the 1960s and 
1970s. The mackerel never recovered. Herring did, only to fall to dangerously 
low levels again in the 1990s. The same fate has met virtually all other 
commercial fish species, including cod, hake, haddock, mackerel, plaice, saithe 
and whiting. According to the latest (intrinsically over-optimistic) official 
assessments, haddock and possibly whiting and saithe may have gained a 
breathing space, but the overall situation remains grim.

<H3>THE IMPACT OF FISHERIES</H3>

<P>The deterioration of the North Sea has many causes, from land reclamation 
stretching back hundreds of years, to pollution during the later part of this 
century. But fishing has been by far the most significant. For issues such as 
pollution there is often heated debate about the extent of its effects. For 
fishing there is no dispute; each year fishing in the North Sea now kills 
billions of fish, threatening the entire ecosystem. People have always striven 
to find easier and more effective ways of doing things. Fishing is no 
exception. 

<P>The major changes have come in the space of little more than a century. Most 
significant was the arrival of first steam and then diesel power. This in turn 
allowed trawling, which requires a large amount of power, to be developed and 
used effectively for the first time. A second change, gaining speed in the last 
40 years, has been the use of ever more powerful sonar and other electronic 
aids which have allowed fishers increasingly to remove the guesswork. Finally 
there has been the disastrous implementation of fisheries policies that ignore 
natural biological constraints. Together these have created short term gains. 
But this is at an enormous and escalating cost to the marine environment and 
fishing industry itself.
 
<H3>INNOCENT CASUALTIES</H3>

<P>Methods such as beam trawling, principally carried out by the Dutch, where 
heavy gear is dragged over the seabed are immensely destructive to life on the 
seabed, such as shellfish, worms and brittlestars which - while not the most 
glamorous of species - are vital parts of the marine ecosystem. Each sweep 
appears to kill between 15 to 55% of the animals, depending on the species. 
Fishing is so intense in the southern North Sea that, on average, any one area 
is likely to be swept by gear between one and four times each year. Certain 
habitats, such as the fragile tube reefs built up by serpulid worms, which 
provide an important habitat full of nooks and crannies for other species, have 
been wiped out by such fishing methods. In the early 1990s a research team 
intending to compare undisturbed and trawled areas in the south-eastern North 
Sea was unable to find any untrawled areas. 
<BR><BR>
<table width=100% border=2 cellpadding=5><tr><td>
<B> Up to 7,000 porpoises are killed in the North Sea each year due 
to destructive fishing practices. Death on this scale could be as significant as for the dolphins in the tuna fisheries during the 1980s.</B>
</td></tr></table>
 
<P>Birds may also be affected by fishing in several ways. They get caught in nets, 
particularly fixed nets and abandoned gear. There is also concern about the 
possible effects of industrial fishing, which takes the same fish that the 
birds feed upon. In recent years the industrial fisheries have been moving into 
areas such as the Wee Bankie in the Firth of Forth, off the east coast of 
Scotland, that are also heavily exploited by seabirds gathering food for their 
young, despite warnings that this could have a significant effect. But the 
biggest identified effect of fishing on seabirds appears to be an unnatural 
increase. Fulmars and seagulls in particular exploit the huge amounts of offal, 
discards and by-catch dumped by the fishing vessels, making available food that 
would otherwise be beyond their reach. Perhaps as many as 2.5 million birds 
take advantage of this temporary bonanza. Nevertheless bird protection 
organisations, such as BirdLife International, consider this an unnatural and 
undesirable distortion of the ecosystem. They, like others, consider that 
fisheries must become ecologically sustainable so that the future of all parts 
of the North Sea ecosystem becomes secure.

<P>One of the most worrying effects of fishing is upon marine mammals such as the 
porpoise. For example a partial survey of Danish fishing vessels in the North 
Sea, Skagerrak and Kattegat in 1983 recorded an average of one porpoise killed 
every trip. This means that the Danish fishing fleet alone was killing some 
3,000 porpoises a year. Research conducted in 1993 suggests that the situation 
may be even worse. Danish gill-netting (between five to ten thousand kilometers 
of nets are set each day to catch mainly turbot, sole, plaice and cod) was 
estimated to kill 7,000 porpoises every year. Death on this scale could be very 
significant - one unofficial estimate is that it could represent 5% of the 
North Sea population. If true, this would be at least as significant as the 
deaths of dolphins in the tuna fisheries of the 1980s. 

<H3>DWINDLING FISH</H3>

<P><B>Unsurprisingly, the most obvious impact of fishing is upon the fish. </B>

<P>Coastal waters were the first to be affected by changes in fishing methods. In 
April 1884 a single haul of one of the new trawls around the Isle of May, in 
the Firth of Forth, produced 598 fish - a catch impossible today - including 
haddock, cod, whiting, ling, skate, thornback ray, witch, plaice, lemon dab and 
flounder, as well as hundreds of Norway lobsters. 

<P>Soon such catches were only memories, and the trawlers had to go further 
offshore. Here too, the stocks were rapidly depleted. The strongest evidence of 
this comes from size of catches before and after the Second World War. For six 
years fishing was severely restricted. When the British fleet started operating 
at full scale in 1947, the catch, for the same effort, was more than double 
that for the 1930s. But it fell rapidly: within four years it was virtually 
back to the pre-War levels. 

<P>The next big development was the Danish or purse seine. This allowed a curtain 
of net to be drawn completely around an entire shoal of surface swimming fish 
such as herring, mackerel or sprat. Once encircled the net was both drawn in 
and pulled tight at the bottom, capturing most of the shoal. This new method 
proved very effective - too effective. For the first time in the North Sea, 
fish stocks actually collapsed under the pressure. In fact, in the 1960s and 
1970s, two stocks collapsed; the indigenous North Sea mackerel, and the 
herring. Mackerel has never recovered. Fishing for herring was banned in 1977 
and the stock did recover. But unfortunately the lesson was not learnt, and 
fishing pressure once more began to grow. Now once more the herring is in 
severe trouble.

<P>In the 1960s, when herring were severely depleted, members of the cod family - 
cod, haddock, saithe and whiting - unexpectedly increased between two and 
fourfold. Many believe that this was because herring, which feed on the larvae 
of these fish, were too scarce to have as great an effect. If true this 
indicates the scale of the knock-on effects that our activities can have. 
 
<P>But since that brief interlude, the numbers of cod and its relatives have been 
declining. The situation is now grave. The stock of cod is barely one third of 
what scientists believe is the minimum safe size. They even warned that, 
ideally, all fishing for cod in the North Sea should be stopped. The problem is 
that cod swim in mixed shoals, with other members of the cod family. Stopping 
cod fishing may also require a significant reduction in the catches of haddock, 
whiting and saithe. However, the stocks of these species are not in much better 
shape. In 1995 North Sea environment ministers endorsed a report that stated 
that cod in the Kattegat, and cod, haddock and saithe in the North Sea were all 
below 'safe biological limits', and they also expressed concern about trends in 
whiting stocks.

</td></tr></table>


<P>Until recently there seemed to be one stock, North Sea plaice, that was able to 
withstand the enormous fishing pressure it was under. But now this too has 
fallen below what is believed to be the minimum safe population size, and there 
is also concern about English Channel sole. In effect, since the start of the 
1990s, virtually all of the major stocks fished for human consumption in the 
North Sea have become threatened.

<H3>INDUSTRIAL FISHERIES</H3>
 
<P>Last, but not least, there are the industrial fisheries. Fish were first 
deliberately targeted for the production of fish meal and oil, rather than for 
human consumption, in the 1950s. Since then the industrial fisheries have grown 
enormously. They were one factor in the collapse of mackerel and herring, since 
which time they have moved on to smaller species such as sandeel, sprat and 
Norway pout.
 
<P>One problem with industrial fisheries is the sheer size of the catches.  
Typically, each year the industrial fisheries now take over a million tonnes of 
fish - more than half the weight of all fish landed from the North Sea.  The 
second problem is the 'accidental' catch (by-catch) of immature fish that are 
already threatened - such as haddock, whiting and herring.  Last, but not 
least, is the unknown scale of impact on the marine food chain as the species 
prosecuted by the industrial fisheries are important prey for many other fish, 
sea mammals and birds. 

<P>The large-scale sandeel fishery in the North Sea is unregulated with no catch 
limits and takes between 8 and 20 billion fish each year.  Incredibly, a recent 
European Commission regulation stated that: 'In the case of certain stocks 
fished mainly for reduction to meal and oil, it does not appear necessary to 
make quota allocations'  (EC Reg 3074/95).

<H3>MANAGEMENT FAILURE</H3>


<P>The 'management' of fisheries in the North Sea is a total disaster. The problem 
originated with the managers who set up the policy in the 1970s. They were not 
biologists, and they ignored biological advice and scientific warnings that the 
sea was being overfished. Instead, the managers thought the problem was simple; 
the EU imported too many fish. In their eyes the solution was equally simple - 
catch more fish! The result was that from the 1970s until the early 1990s the 
main thrust of policy was to build new ships and modernise old ones, even 
though it was known that  the fish stocks were heavily overexploited and that 
less fish, not more, would be caught by fishing more intensively.

<P>By the late 1980s it was obvious that fish stocks were declining. But, because 
decisions to reduce catches would be politically difficult, significant reform 
was continually put off. As the
situation got worse, the extent of the necessary measures grew more severe, 
even further discouraging action. As a result, what was supposed to be a major 
reform of the CFP in 1992 did no more than tinker at the margins.

the short-term answer and that means if you can get away with increasing the 
quotas for this year the pressure is taken off your back. Then it is somebody 
else's problem next year." Lord Selbourne, House of Lords - Fish Stock 
Conservation and Management.
</B>
</td></tr></table>
 
<P>To make matters even worse, the system of regulating national catches - that of 
setting a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for individual species - was, and is, 
absurd. Once again managers ignored biological reality; in this case that many 
fish, such as the cod family (cod, haddock, whiting, saithe), and herring and 
sprat, swim together in mixed shoals. The result is that when the quota for one 
species is reached these fish are dumped over the side (or sold on the black 
market) while fishing continues for those species where the quota has yet to be 
reached. This compounds yet another problem; that, as the stocks have been run 
down, vast numbers of immature fish are being caught. Where these are less than 
the minimum size that can legally be landed, these too are discarded. Either 
way the effect is disastrous - under natural circumstances, and even in a well 
regulated fishery, fish such as cod would breed many times before they die. But 
at present, fish such as cod are caught by the time they are 2-3 years old, by 
which time they will have been lucky to have bred once.

</B>
</td></tr></table>

<P>In response to these problems, there has been increasing noises from fisheries 
managers both about the need to reduce fishing pressure and to take account of 
the wider ecological effects. In practice the only significant attempt to take 
action has been through decommissioning of fishing vessels. But even this 
limited action has been a failure. Some countries, such as the UK and the 
Netherlands, have not even met the agreed targets, and in all countries it 
tends to be the older, less effective, vessels that are taken out of 
circulation. Due to advances in technology the net effect of decommissioning on 
fishing capacity has been minimal, as even the European Commission concedes.
 
<H3>POLITICAL WEAKNESS
 </H3>
<P>The ultimate irony is that the cost of the necessary reforms would be covered 
by the increased profitability of the fishing industry. According to Mike 
Holden (head of EC fisheries 'Conservation' section from 1984 to 1990) , the 
compensation costs of bring fishing capacity into line with what the sea can 
sustain, throughout the European Union, would have been around 3 billion  ECU 
(2 billion sterling) in 1992, spread over 5 to 10 years. But if the stocks were 
well managed the annual profits would increase to between 0.66 - 2 billion ECU 
(1-3 billion sterling).

<P>The problem is not the economics. It is simply the lack of political will to 
radically overhaul fisheries management in Europe. What is clear is that we 
simply cannot afford 'not' to act. We already have a terrible warning from the 
collapse of the Canadian Northern cod fishery. This was once the largest cod 
fishery in the world. Even in decline, in the late 1980s it provided about 
30,000 jobs in Newfoundland and Labrador, and a catch in 1989 of 235,000 
tonnes that had a landed value of 140 million Canadian dollars, and a 
product value of some 350 million. 

<P>Faced with conflicting scientific advice about the need to reduce fishing 
drastically, politicians decided to hope for the best, and take minimal action. 
The stock collapsed and with it went the jobs and the money. Too late, in 1992, 
a moratorium was introduced. The result has been enormous social, economic and 
environmental costs, and the cod stock shows no sign of
recovering.

Myers, Dept of Fisheries, Canada. ]

<P>There is now a very real chance that such collapses will happen in the North 
Sea, with similar ecological, social and economic consequences. Evidence, such 
as that from the War years when fishing effort dropped, and of the herring 
stock recovery in the 1970s, suggests that stocks can recover if action is 
taken soon enough. The North Sea mackerel, and the Canadian cod, warn of the 
consequences of leaving action too late. We do not have the luxury of waiting 
until 2002, when the next major review of the Common Fisheries Policy is due to 
take place. Action is needed NOW.

<H3>GREENPEACE DEMANDS</H3>

<B>Greenpeace wants governments to use another emerging approach to fisheries to 
keep fish stocks at safe levels and reduce environmental impacts of by fishing. 
The precautionary approach is now well established in international law.  Put 
simply, it places the burden on the fishing industry to prove their fishing 
activities are not likely to pose a substantial risk to the environment.  To 
bring back depleted fish stocks and conserve the marine environment, massive 
reductions to the billions of fish killed each year during fishing of all North 
Sea fish stocks is needed.  Once this happens, the increase in size and age of 
the fish stocks will allow fishing to become more profitable and predictable, 
while taking less of the stocks.
 
<P>Greenpeace demands implementation of a precautionary approach to fisheries as 
an over-arching principle of European fisheries management.
 
<P>While governments implement this long-term approach, they must also address the 
more short term crisis facing the North Sea.  All North Sea fisheries need an 
emergency recovery plan.  This plan must increase all threatened stocks such as 
cod, plaice and herring to levels that are safely above the minimum sustainable 
stock biomass, and it must cut the number and size of fishing vessels to bring 
fishing capacity into line with the available resources. 

<P>Greenpeace demands that North Sea fisheries and environment ministers agree an 
emergency recovery plan for North Sea fisheries when they meet in March 1997 at 
their Interim Ministerial Meeting (IMM).  Because if they fail to act, North 
Sea fisheries could be heading the same way as cod off eastern Canada.

<H2>FROM FISH TO FODDER</H2>
<BR><BR><BR>
<P>For most people, North Sea fishing is linked to images of
fishermen fighting the elements to catch cod, herring or
plaice.  But during the last 40 years a huge "industrial"
fishery has grown up largely unnoticed by the public, despite
its massive size.  It catches fish not for the table, but to
be ground up into industrial products such as fish meal and
oil.  
 
<P>Many consumers will be surprised to know that they are eating
industrial fishery products either indirectly (used as food
for livestock, poultry and farmed fish) or directly but
anonymously, as "animal fat" in cakes, biscuits and margarine. 

<P><B>Astonishingly, this industrial fishery lands over a million
tonnes of fish each year, more than half of all fish landed
from the North Sea.  These ~industrial~ fish are the food that
many other marine species depend upon. The rapid and poorly
regulated growth of this industry, and its potential for major
ecological damage, gives cause for alarm.
</B>

<H3>A CONTROVERSIAL HISTORY</H3>
 
<P>Industrial fisheries developed from the processing of waste
from normal fisheries into fertiliser and other products. 
With the 1950s came the increasing realisation that it was
profitable to catch fish specifically for industrial products.
This, coupled with over-fishing of fish for human consumption,
and new technology such as sonar and the Danish or purse seine
net, led to the rapid development of industrial fishing during
the 1960s.
 
<P>Major problems soon followed. Mackerel and herring, already
under pressure from normal fishing, were initially targeted by
the industrial fisheries because of their large size and high
fat content.  Pressure increased drastically during the late
1960s and there were warnings that the stocks could not
withstand such an onslaught. However the industry argued that
there was no proof. The inevitable happened.  First the North
Sea mackerel stock collapsed in 1970 and, despite a great
reduction in fishing since 1970, the stock has never
recovered.  Then in the mid 1970s the herring stock collapsed. 
The fishery was forced to turn to smaller species,
particularly Norway pout and sprat, until these catches also
declined; some believe that the decline in sprat was also
associated with over-fishing. 
 
<P>From 1985 to the 1990s sandeels constituted approximately two-
thirds of the catch. The average total industrial catch
between 1987-91 was some 1.3 million tonnes a year. This
included an 'accidental' catch (by-catch) of 170 thousand
tonnes of fish such as herring, whiting, haddock and saithe
that otherwise would have grown and been available (and far
more valuable) as fish for the table.  Unfortunately, very
little effort has been put into monitoring the North Sea
industrial fisheries.  What effort is made is often erroneous;
catches are misidentified, the area in which they were caught
is falsified, by-catch is underestimated. Monitoring of the
health of stocks remaining in the sea is, if anything, even
worse.
<P clear=all> 
<img width=396 height=270 src="../pics/foodweb1.jpg" BORDER=0>
<P>Sandeels illustrate some of the problems.  The total landings
of sandeels have grown since the 1960s until levelling off,
since the mid-1980s, at around 700,000 tonnes or more. 
Attempts to estimate this as a proportion of the total stock
vary from under one-quarter to almost half of the entire
population caught each year.  Moreover, this 'population' is
not of one species, but five; but it is considered uneconomic
to monitor them separately.  It was also assumed until very
recently that sandeel populations were composed of a couple of
large homogenous North Sea stocks.  It now appears that this
includes many, relatively local and sedentary stocks and that
the overall catch figures could conceal major depletions.  For
example, in 1993 the total catch from the important area in
the north-west North Sea (Area 1A) was some 187,000 tonnes.
But 115,000 tonnes came from just one small site - the Wee
Bankie area, off the Scottish Firth of Forth.  Often, after a
few years of intensive fishing in an area, the catches fall
and the boats move elsewhere - a pattern worryingly consistent
with massive overfishing.

<H3>IMPACT ON FISH</H3>
 
<P>There is much evidence that industrial fishing has caused the
collapse of fish stocks. Outside the North Sea most experts
agree that industrial fishing contributed to the collapse of
the Californian sardines in the middle of this century, the
Peruvian anchovy in the 1970s and more recently the disastrous
situation in the Japanese pilchard fishery.  Closer to home,
in the 1980s capelin stocks collapsed in the Barents Sea as
did herring stocks in the Norwegian Sea, both after being
subjected to intense fishing pressure.  The links between
industrial fishing and the depletion of mackerel and herring
in the North Sea have already been described.  
 
<P>Such evidence counters the claim still sometimes made that,
because each female fish may lay vast numbers of eggs each
year, it is virtually impossible for fishing to cause any
harm.   By the time the fish are large enough to catch only a
handful of these offspring will have survived and additional
pressure on these few survivors from fishing may indeed have a
serious effect. 
 
<P>Industrial fishing may also have an effect on other species of
fish.  There are two possible ways in which this may happen. 
First, other fish may be caught accidentally by the industrial
fishery - the 'by-catch' problem. Second, species targeted by
industrial fisheries may be important food for other fish. 
 
The catch of herring by the industrial fishery for sprat is an
example of the by-catch problem. In theory, following the
collapse of herring in the 1970s, industrial fishing for
herring is no longer allowed.  But young herring and sprats
swim together in shoals, and industrial fishing for sprat is
permitted. Fishers are allowed to catch a maximum of 10% of
herring mixed in with the sprats.  But in practice this limit
is ignored and vast amounts of herring are still caught.
Indeed, in 1991 more herring than sprats were landed by this
'sprat' fishery.  This pressure, combined with fishing for
human consumption, has once more brought herring to the brink
of disaster.  There is also a by-catch problem with Norway
pout. Here it is mainly young whiting and haddock that are
caught. 
 
<P>In 1992 a study carried out by the EU fisheries Commission,
DGXIV, concluded that a 40% reduction of the North Sea,
Skagerrak and Kattegat demersal industrial fisheries
(essentially for Norway pout) would result in significant
increases in whiting and haddock landings - at a net economic
benefit.
 
<P>For sandeels it is the reduction in food available to other
fish that has attracted the greatest attention.  It is
sometimes asserted that whiting is the only serious predator
of sandeels.  But other research indicates that whiting,
saithe and haddock can all be important, each taking between
75,000 and 250,000 tonnes of sandeels each year.  And while
some state that relatively few sandeels are taken by cod, it
is clear that in some areas, such as Horns Reef (off the
Danish coast), cod are 'full of sandeel' at certain times of
the year.  In any case cod are now so scarce, particularly in
the southern North Sea, it is inevitable they will take only a
small proportion of the sandeels. But their requirements may
change if the stocks are allowed to recover.  
 
<P>Under natural circumstances, fish are by far the most
important predators of sandeels.  But the industrial fishery
can be a severe competitor.  Indeed, in some years it takes
significantly more sandeels than any fish species. To allow
industrial fisheries to continue unregulated and on this
scale, while asserting that it can have no possible effect, is
totally indefensible.
 
<H3>IMPACT ON BIRDS</H3>
 
<P>Because of their small size, many fish exploited by the
industrial fishery are also vital to birds. Sandeels have been
recorded in the diets of all species commonly occurring in the
North Sea. More sandeels are eaten by birds than all other
fish added together.  During the breeding period  over 90% of
guillemots examined in the north-western North Sea had fed on
sandeels, and they are known to be similarly important for
other seabirds including great skua, puffin and fulmar.  
 
<P>With the exception of the birds around Shetland, oil-rich
sprats are also significant, and are extensively taken as food
for puffin chicks at sites such as the Isle of May in the
Firth of Forth. Norway pout are also eaten where available by
all birds with the exception of shearwaters and petrels. 
Moreover, in the breeding season, when birds are tied to their
colonies, and need to find food for their chicks as well as
themselves, the birds can require a significant proportion of
local fish.  Few detailed studies have been made, but around
the Shetland Isles between 1981 and 1983 birds are thought to
have consumed one-quarter of the local sandeel stock - a
similar amount to the local fishery.
 
<P>At the very least such figures suggest that competition
between seabirds and the fisheries is possible.  The major
potential area of conflict is off the coast of Scotland and
northern England. This area is of importance to both birds and
the industrial fishery.  A Danish report produced in the early
1990s warned that: 'changes in the distribution of fishing
activities resulting in the exploitation of sandeel
concentrations close to seabird colonies could have a serious
effect on prey availability to seabirds'.  Since that time,
and despite that warning, the industrial fisheries have moved
in to areas such as the Wee Bankie, which are of prime
importance to the seabirds.
 
<P>There are two ways in which an effect on the birds may be
manifested.  The first, and most likely, is changes in bird
populations that occur slowly, over many years.  The second
effect is a catastrophic breeding failure.  Fishing was
suspected when Shetland seabirds repeatedly failed to breed in
the 1980s, due to the scarcity of sandeels.  In the event,
changes in sea currents are the prime suspect, although
precautionary restrictions on the fishery that were imposed at
the time remain in force. 
 
<P>Catastrophic effects associated with fishing have occurred in
the seas off north-west Europe; the breeding population of
guillemots in northern Norway and Bear Island, south of
Spitzbergen, collapsed from a population numbered in hundreds
of thousands to just one-tenth of this in the late 1980s,
following the crash of the capelin fishery.  Similarly the
Norwegian puffin colony at R st Island, numbering over a
million pairs in 1977, had more than halved by 1988,
coincident with the fishery-induced collapse of local herring. 
Despite this record, and concerns regarding the impact on
birds in the North Sea, the industry has so far refused to
take precautionary measures elsewhere.
 
<H3>IMPACT ON MARINE MAMMALS</H3>
 
<P>There are approximately 70,000 seals in the North Sea whose
total annual food consumption is in the order of 100,000
tonnes.  Seal diet is very varied, and it is difficult to be
certain of their food whilst foraging away from haul-outs.
However the analysis of faeces left at haul-outs indicates
that sandeels can make up over half of their diet.  Grey seals
also eat Norway pout. While common seals may stay in coastal
waters and eat coastal fish, grey seals range much further. 
The general implication is that seals have little overall
impact on the fish, but that the collapse of stocks targeted
by industrial fisheries, particularly sandeels, would have
serious implications for seals. 
 
<P>Very little is known about the possible impact on cetaceans. 
Of the baleen whales that enter the North Sea, both the fin
whale and minke are known to feed on herring, sandeel and cod-
fish - indeed one old English name for the fin whale was
herring hog.  Bottle-nosed dolphin, Orca and porpoise all
include mackerel and herring in their diet. Some experts
believe that over-fishing is one reason for the decline of the
porpoise.  As with birds, a collapse caused by industrial
fisheries could do significant harm to marine mammals.
 
<H3>THE FUTURE</H3>
 
<P>Given the ecological importance of fish targeted by industrial
fisheries, near the bottom of the marine food web, one would
expect that the industrial fisheries would be especially
carefully regulated.  But, astonishingly, the opposite is
true.  Until now this industry has had the most lax set of
controls of any fishery in the North Sea. 
 
<P>With the exception of the small Shetland sandeel fishery, no
controls are imposed to prevent possible over-exploitation of
the stocks. Instead there has been a half-hearted attempt to
reduce the by-catch of human consumption species that has
conspicuously failed, for example with herring.  Most
incredible of all, the industrial fishery for North Sea
sandeels has no limit of any kind.  There are of course other
major fishing problems in the North Sea such as the crisis
facing stocks for human consumption, and the environmental
impact of fishing activities. Change is never easy, and
compensation of various forms may be necessary.  
 
<P>Other problems and difficulties are no excuse for the failure
to take action on industrial fisheries.  They are the clearest
possible example of the need to apply precautionary measures.
Denmark and Norway, the principal countries involved in these
fisheries have, to their credit, long applied the
precautionary principle elsewhere in environmental policy. 
They have often been in the vanguard, demanding precautionary
action by others that was both difficult and controversial. 
Now Denmark and Norway face their moment of truth. 

<H3>GREENPEACE BELIEVES:</H3>
 
<P>Greenpeace demands that the precautionary principle be applied
to North Sea industrial fisheries and give the marine
environment the benefit of the doubt.  Regulations should be
set which reflect the uncertainties of the impact of
industrial fisheries.   In addition, there must be a complete
ban in <B><a href="areas.html">specific sensitive areas </a> </B>where the fishery is in
conflict with the needs of other marine species, such as sea
birds and mammals as well as other fish stocks, such as
haddock, cod, herring and whiting.

For most people, North Sea fishing is linked to images of fishermen fighting the elements to catch cod, herring or plaice. But during the last 40 years a
huge "industrial" fishery has grown up largely unnoticed by the public, despite its massive size. It catches fish not for the table, but to be ground up into
industrial products such as fish meal and oil. 

Many consumers will be surprised to know that they are eating industrial fishery products either indirectly (used as food for livestock, poultry and
farmed fish) or directly but anonymously, as "animal fat" in cakes, biscuits and margarine. <BR><HR>

The industrial fisheries lands over a million tonnes of fish each year, more than half of all fish landed from the North Sea.
These ~industrial~ fish are the food that many other marine species depend upon. The rapid and poorly regulated growth of this industry,
and its potential for major ecological damage, gives cause for alarm. 

Under natural circumstances, fish are by far the most important predators of sandeels. But the industrial fishery can be a severe competitor. Indeed, in
some years it takes significantly more sandeels than any fish species. To allow industrial fisheries to continue unregulated and on this scale, while
asserting that it can have no possible effect, is totally indefensible. <BR><HR>

<tr>

<td width=90% >

<table width=90% border=0 cellpadding=7>
<tr><td>

<P>Records kept by the United Nations Food 
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) also indicate  that of the 
world's 15  main fishing regions, four are depleted and nine are 
declining. This global fisheries crisis is primarily a result of 
overharvesting.  The world's marine catch has increased more than 
four times in the past 40 years -- from 18.5 million tons in 1952 
to 89 million tons in 1989, but  that growth is at great cost to 
the environment, and ultimately, perhaps to world food security. 
  
<P>Several decades of overfishing in most of the world's major 
fisheries has pushed many commercially important fish populations 
into steep declines <B><a href="cancod.html">Canada's northern cod collapse, for example.</a></B>
Catches are falling, despite the fact that expanding fleets are 
fishing harder, spending more time, effort and money than ever 
before in trying to maintain them.  Some commercially important 
stocks are in such a critical state that all fishing has been shut 
down, or sharply curtailed.   Hundreds of millions of people 
traditionally dependent on fishing for food and livelihoods face 
resource depletion, competition from industrial and distant water 
fleets, and loss of access to traditional marine food supplies.   
 
<P>The biological diversity of the world's oceans is threatend by the 
highly competitive race to catch enough fish to keep pace with 
rising international demand. 
  
<P>Rising demand and decreasing stocks have led to increased 
mechanization, over-capitalization of the industry and the buildup 
of excessive  fishing  fleets,  particularly  of  the larger-scale  
fishing vessels that are responsible for the bulk of overfishing 
related problems worldwide. A modern 'factory' supertrawler can be 
longer than a football field and capable of catching and processing 
into various products up to 200 tons of fish daily.  One of the 
world's biggest trawl nets could encircle more than a  dozen "jumbo 
jet" Boeing 747 aircraft at its opening.  Ships deploying such nets 
have a capture rate of about ten tons of fish per hour. 
 
<P>Since 1970, the world's fishing fleet has expanded twice as fast as 
world catches. The fishing fleet in China, the world's leading fish 
producer,  is now around six times the size it was in 1979.   As a 
result, excess fishing capacity has reached  alarming proportions.  
There are about 3.5 million vessels boats currently fishing in the 
world's oceans.   Intense competition between countries and rival 
fleets over access to fishing grounds has sparked numerous 
international disputes over fishing rights in recent years. 
  
 
<H3>FISHING  FOR PROTEIN </H3>

<P>Since 1989 the world~s annual catch has been dropping.  Many argue 
that this decrease is an indication that fishing has oversteppped 
natures~s limists.   
  
<P>The FAO warns that the rising demand for fish and fish products, 
combined with shrinking global catches from declining stocks, will 
soon lead to the point where there will be a shortfall of fish for 
human consumption of more than 20 million tonnes each year. Average 
annual consumption of fish caught in marine and inland waters could 
fall from 10.2 kilograms  per person in 1993 to somewhere between 
5.1 and 7.6 kilograms by 2050. This threatens the one billion 
people, mostly in developing countries, who rely on fish as a 
principle source of protein. 
  
<H3>WASTEFUL AND DESTRUCTIVE PRODUCTION</H3>
 
<P>The increased fishing pressure and the competition  amongst fishing 
nations  and  their  fleets  severely  stresses  fish  stocks and 
the marine environment.   The  widespread  use  of unselective 
fishing gear and indiscriminate practices  result in  one-quarter 
of the all the fish brought on board fishing vessels each year 
being discarded, usually dead or dying, back to the sea. 
 
<P>Commercial fishing vessels throw back on average about 27 million 
tons of unwanted fish annually.  That amounts to about half of all 
the fish caught from the oceans each year that are consumed 
directly by humans.    Along  with  these,  millions  of  other 
marine animals are being incidentally captured and killed  in 
fishing operations. 
  
 
<H3>DESTRUCTIVE FISHING GEAR </H3>

<P>Some fishing gear is particularly deadly for certain animals in 
some situations.  Longline fishing boats kill many tens of 
thousands of albatross each year in southern hemisphere oceans. 
Driftnets indiscriminately killed millions of marine creatures, 
while targetting for just one or two commercially valuable species. 
Marine mammals are frequently killed in great numbers in trawls, 
set nets and purse seine nets.   In addition there is severe damage 
caused  by fishing operations that use destructive gear  and 
fishing  practices,  like bottom trawling, that physically disturbs 
marine habitats such as the ocean floor, sea grass beds or coral 
reefs. 
 
<H3>THE POLITICS OF OVERFISHING </H3>

<P>Today, there isn't a fishing region in  the  world  that  does  not 
suffer from fisheries  management  decisions  designed  to  satisfy 
short-term economic or political objectives (or both)  rather  than 
protecting  the  marine  environment   and   conserving   fish 
populations.  The bulk of the problems  stem  from  twenty  fishing 
countries whose fleets land 80 percent of the  total  marine  catch 
worldwide.

<P>Commercial fishing in most of these countries has been very  poorly 
managed.   Even  in  a  few  countries  where  relatively  advanced 
fisheries management systems have been in place for many years they 
have, almost without exception, failed to  control  the  conditions 
and stem the  abuses  that  lead  to  overfishing  and  destructive 
environmental impacts.  Indeed, in many countries, governments have 
played an important part in fueling the expansion of excessive 
fishing capacity and overexploitation by providing lucrative 
subsidies, taxpayer funded handouts.  On a global scale, these 
destructive subsidies run up to $50 billion a year. 
  
<P>The chronic failures of fisheries management in European waters  of 
the northeast Atlantic and North Sea  are  particularly  noteworthy 
since this area has probably  the  longest  standing  and  greatest 
single  concentration  of   fisheries   research   and   management 
institutions in world.  Yet, Europe's fish stocks  are  plagued  by 
overfishing, and massive excess fishing capacity. 
  
<P>The member countries  of  the  European  Union    regularly  ignore 
scientific advice when setting their annual  catch  quotas:    when 
scientists from the International Council for  the  Exploration  of 
the Seas recommended a 40 percent cut in the  1995  hake  catch  to 
protect the stocks, EU fisheries ministers agreed to  a  mere  five 
percent cut.  In the EU, as elsewhere, it seems that a fishery must 
be proven to be on its death bed  before  any  remedial  action  is 
taken. 
  
<P>In  the  United  States  a  similar  picture  of  failed  fisheries 
management prevails.   According to the  National  Marine Fisheries 
Service (NMFS), the federal agency overseeing  U.S. fisheries,  80 
percent of the known commercially valuable  fish populations  (122 
aquatic species)  are  currently  either  fully or  overexploited;  
67 species of these,  among them bluefin tuna, swordfish, oysters, 
hard-shell and soft-shell clams and red snapper -- are 
overexploited.  A further  79 species continue to be exploited  
even though the  status  of  their populations is unknown.  Little 
wonder why this is so.   The country's eight regional fisheries 
management councils are primarily composed of those interests who 
benefit directly from increased catches: commercial  fishers  and  
other  industry  user  groups. 
  
<P>It does say much for fisheries management regimes elsewhere in the 
world , if the European Union and the United States are considered 
to be amongst the leaders in the field of fisheries conservation 
and management. 
  
<P>Quite simply, nature's limits have been breached by too many 
fishing vessels catching too many fish, very often  in wasteful and 
destructive ways, and it cannot allowed to continue if the oceans 
and the human communities around the world that depend on them are 
to survive.   Governments and industry are responible for ensuring 
swift action to bring about urgently needed reforms, including 
substantial fleet reductions and substantial cutbacks in allowable 
catches, the elimination of destructive subsidies,  major 
reductions in bycatch and waste, and more stringent environmental 
controls over fishing operations.   The full utilization of 
available  fish  stocks and profit maximization for industry have 
been  the  key  goals  of short-sighted fisheries development, 
while protection for the environment has taken a back seat.   This 
has proven to be the formula for disaster in fishery after fishery, 
the world over, with the disastrous consequences for marine 
ecosystems and humanity already plainly visible around the world.

GREENPEACE is calling for urgent regulation of industrial 
fisheries in the North Sea.
Catch limits should be set for these fisheries based on the 
precautionary approach,
by-catch of non-target species should be eliminated and 
industrial fisheries should not be allowed in sensitive areas.
 
<P>GREENPEACE therefore calls on North Sea Governments to formally 
identify sensitive areas in the North Sea in which no industrial 
fishing should take place as
a matter of urgency.
 
<P>WHAT ARE SENSITIVE AREAS?
 
<P>Those areas in the North Sea where there are reasonable grounds 
for suspecting that industrial fishing may have a 
disproportional impact, either upon the target
species, or upon other parts of the marine ecosystem.
 
<P>All areas can be identified temporally and/or spatially. This 
identification may be
permanent, seasonal or temporary.
 
<BR>Some major features of sensitive/critical areas include:-
  
<BR>a. nursery areas, spawning areas, or areas with high abundance 
of juveniles, of non target species and/or
 
<BR>b. areas where there may be a significant bycatch of other 
species and/or  
<BR>c. areas where there may be significant risk of damaging 
competition with natural
predators eg. other fish, birds or marine mammals and/or
 
<BR>d. areas where the target species is particularly vulnerable 
(eg. discreet local populations and/or relatively rare species)

 
<P>GREENPEACE, considers it likely that the following areas will 
fulfill these criteria
when North Sea Governments complete identification of such areas 
and therefore recommends that in the interim industrial 
fisheries be excluded from these areas immediately.These areas 
may overlap. This list is not intended to be comprehensive.

<P>It has been subject to fishing restrictions because it is a 
nursery area for plaice and
cod (Daan et al. 1990) Currently, fishing vessels over 300 Hp 
are not allowed within the box.
 
<P>'In the fisheries policy special attention is given to the 12 
mile zone. This is
because the areas has a special function as a nursery area. It 
is in the interest of
the fishing industry to protect nursery areas. EU policy support 
this objective. An

commercial whaling, and commence their slaughter of 425 minke whales,

smuggling nearly six tons of whale meat into Japan, it is clear that

<P><B>An Open Letter To The People of Norway From Paul And Linda McCartney
</B>
<P>Dear People of Norway,

<P>On Tuesday, May 21st a small group of your countrymen will once again
take up the "tradition" of whaling and will set to hunt down and kill
425 minke whales.  By this action, this minority is going to earn your
country the contempt and the scorn of the rest of the world and we
believe you should realize that.

<P>The whalers say that they are doing this because it is a long
established Norwegian tradition.  You know and we know that this is
nonsense.  The cloak of "tradition" is being used to disguise the fact
that - with the price of whale meat at  290 a kilo -this whole bloody
exercise is being done for a huge profit.

<P>But who will really profit from this massacre?  Probably not the
people of Norway.  A few whalers will make a lot of money and a few
rich businessmen in Japan will be able to grotesquely impress their
dinner guests.

<P>But the losers will be you and your country.  Just as, years ago, the
right-thinking world condemned slavery, so too your beautiful land
will be stained and despised on account of the handful of
traditionalists who are going to tarnish Norway's name through their
action.

<P>As you know, we have many friends in Norway.  When we have toured
there, it is one of the best places to be.  In our experience, the
overwhelming majority of Norwegians - especially young Norwegians -
are kind and forward-thinking. They are concerned about ecology and
open to new, better ideas like whale watching.

<P>Our friends in Norway have told us that most Norwegians don't eat
whale meat anyway and, as Greenpeace has alerted, this whole sad and
sick exercise is being conducted not to uphold tradition but for
greed.

<P>Last year, the Norwegian whalers slaughtered 232 minke whales.  This
year they intend to double the slaughter. Last year the International
Whaling Commission (IWF) called on Norway to "halt immediately all
whaling activities".

<P>That's not just men in suits passing a resolution.  That IWF ruling is
the world calling.  The whole of the rest of the planet - with the
exception of the few hypocrites who whale for the "scientific
purposes" that don't fool or impress anybody - is imploring Norway to
stop or be shamed.

<P>We don't believe that the people of Norway want or deserve that shame.
 We believe that you have it within your power to stop this killing. 
Call on your leaders to write to Mrs. Brundtland, and demand a ban on
Norwegian whaling. You could earn the praise and respect of the world.

<P>With love,

<P>Paul & Linda McCartney

<P><B>Statement of James Baker, Administrator of the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration and US Commissioner to the 
International Whaling Commission
</B>

<P>Today, the US issued a strong protest against Norway's plans to 
begin commercial whaling next week in the North Atlantic. 

<P>The United States is deeply opposed to commercial whaling, which 
has caused drastic declines in a number of species and driven 
some stocks to near extinction. In 1982, nations from around the 
world imposed a moratorium on on commercial whaling under the 
auspices of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). The 
United States recognises that Norway lodged a formal objection
to  this moratorium, and therefore is technically not bound by
it.  However, the United States reiterated its call today for
Norway  to join the nations of the world in refraining from
whaling.

<P>The United States believes that the process by which Norway 
calculated its quota of 425 minke whales did not have adequate 
international oversight. Norway's quota was issued shortly after 
a meeting of a working group of the IWC's scientific committee 
earlier this month.  The working group developed a consensus 
estimate of the stock of minke whales in the North East Atlantic. 

<P>The United States is committed to science based solutions to 
international environmental problems and it welcomes the working 
group's consensus estimate. However, this estimate has not yet 
been considered by the IWC's scientific committee, which will 
meet to review this matter next month, or by the Commission 
itself. 

<P>The United States is also concerned about reports of illegal 
exports of whale meat from Norway. The United States calls on 
Norway to take strong measures to enforce its export ban.

<H2>THE CASE AGAINST WHALING</H2>

</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<table border=0 cellpadding=20><tr><td align=center>

<P><B>The history of modern commercial whaling is one of repeated over-
exploitation, as whaling companies strove to maximise their 
short-term profits despite the longer-term implications for the 
very species on which their livelihood depended.
  <P>Now, past mistakes are being acknowledged by the modern-day 
whaling lobby in their campaign to convince the world that 
whaling today will be different and will be done in a sustainable 
manner for the first time. In fact nothing has changed. 
<P>  The relatively few whales that remain are highly vulnerable, 
and the factors that led to their over-exploitation in the past 
have not changed. Here are the key arguments against whaling. </B>
</td></tr></table>

<P><H3>WHALES ARE NOT FISH</H3>

<P>Whales are mammals, not fish, but they have historically been 
treated as fish by the whaling industry.
 <P> The vast majority of fish species reproduce by releasing huge 
quantities of eggs into the water for fertilisation by the male, 
although under normal conditions only a small percentage of these 
will develop into mature adults. Whales on the other hand have a 
long gestation period and usually give birth only every one or 
two year, to a single calf that requires more than a year of 
maternal care before it can survive on its own. Even then, whale 
calves take many years to reach maturity. For these reasons 
whales can never recover quickly from exploitation.
  <P>These factors are compounded by our lack of knowledge about 
many aspects of whale biology. Even after decades of research, 
the growth rate of whale populations is unknown because of the 
difficulty of studying these highly migratory, long-lived, slow-
reproducing animals. Nor are there reliable estimates of live 
birth rates or of the natural mortality rates of calves and 
juveniles.
 <P> Fishing industry representatives who stir up concern that a ban 
on whaling would lead to a ban on fishing are deliberately 
confusing the public and disregarding the vastly different 
characteristics of two entirely unrelated groups of species.

<P><H3>WE CAN'T COUNT WHALES ACCURATELY
</H3>
<P>Modern scientific methods cannot count whales accurately. 
Determining how many animals exist in a population is crucial for 
any calculation of kill quotas. The size of most populations of 
whales is known no more accurately than plus or minus 50 percent. 
Since populations change so slowly, it is impossible to tell if 
a population is growing or shrinking in the course of a few 
year's study.
 <P> All population estimates are based on a count of the whales 
sighted on each side of a survey vessel as it zig-zags its way 
through a designated stretch of water. Since only a small 
percentage of the whales in any given population will be visible 
on the surface as the vessel passes, extrapolations must be made 
from the number sighted to give an estimate for the entire region 
under study. Thus all population estimates are based on sightings 
of a tiny fraction of the population.
 <P> Mathematical formulas are used to calculate the total numbers, 
from the small number of actual sightings. These attempt to take 
into account numerous variables such as the fact that certain 
species of whales tend to cluster in certain areas. It is in 
these formulas that an enormous potential for compounded error 
exists.
  <P>This is borne out by the evidence. For example a 1986 joint 
Japanese/Antarctic survey off Antarctica in Area 5, one of the 
six sectors into which the Southern Ocean was divided for 
management purposes and the one in which minke whales are 
believed to be most abundant, recorded a population estimate of 
280,000 minke whales. Five years later, a Japanese survey 
estimated just 56,000. This does not mean that the whales have 
declined, it simply illustrates how uncertain these numbers are.
  <P>Likewise, in 1992 the IWC accepted a Norwegian estimate of 
86,736 minke whales off Norway. Norway proceeded to use that 
number to set quotas. In 1995 an IWC scientific working meeting 
found serious errors in the computer models used to calculate 
this number. Norway reduced its estimate to 69,600 and set a new 
quota but when the full Scientific Committee met it agreed that 
it was not able to provide a valid estimate for the population 
and so it would not be able to offer advice on quotas.

<P><H3>SUSTAINABLE WHALING IS ECONOMICALLY UNSOUND
</H3>
<P>Common sense would seen to suggest that because whale populations 
grow very slowly, it would be in the long-term interests of the 
whaling industry to maintain whale populations at a healthy 
level, and to avoid over-exploitation that might lead to a 
terminal decline.
 <P> But mathematician Colin Clark showed, in a classic paper called 
"The Economics of Overexploitation" published in the journal 
Science in the early 1970s, that exploitation of slow-growing 
populations will naturally lead to their severe depletion and 
even to their extinction. This is because if the profit to be had 
from catching the entire population of animals at once is greater 
than the profit that could be made by conserving the population 
and taking only a certain quantity each year, then it is good 
business to catch as many animals as possible, as quickly as 
possible - even though it is bad management from the biological 
point of view.
<P>  Economic logic, divorced from the realities of the living 
world, dictates that high levels of short-term exploitation will 
bring the best financial return. In other words, sustainable 
whaling is economically unsound.

<P><H3>KILLING MORE WHALES WON'T RESTORE THE ECOLOGICAL BALANCE
</H3>
<P>There is little doubt that overfishing has devastated fish stocks  
in many parts of the world. The whaling lobby is now arguing that 
this means that whales should be killed to protect the remaining 
fish.
 <P> In fact, whales are far from being the only consumers of fish, 
huge quantities are eaten by other fish and by seabirds. In any 
case, killing a whale does not release the fish that it would 
have eaten to a commercially valuable fish. It is just as lightly 
to be eaten by another species altogether. There is not a single 
case world wide where it has been demonstrated that a catch of 
whales has increased the take of commercially valuable fish.

<P><H3>WHALES LIVE IN A CHANGED OCEAN</H3>

 <P> Whales evolved over tens of millions of years and are superbly 
adapted to the marine environment. But this environment is now 
under a sustained threat from the consequences of human 
activities, including climate change, increased UV-B radiation 
from a diminishing ozone layer, pollution by organochlorine 
compounds and increasingly intensive fisheries.
 <P> Organochlorines have been shown to cause reproductive failure 
in marine mammals and to be potent suppressors of mammal's immune 
systems.  Whales and other marine mammals concentrate these 
artificial compounds through the food chain so concentrations in 
the animals may be a million times higher than in the surrounding 
seawater. Recent work suggests that some classes of compounds, 
called endrocine disrupters, exert very powerful negative effects 
on reproduction at extremely low concentrations.
 <P> UV-B can affect the plankton which are at the base of the ocean 
food chain. Some species are extremely sensitive and others are 
more resistant, so species composition may change. In some 
species UV-B damages the sensory cells that respond to light and 
gravity, causing them to swim randomly and lose their optimum 
position in the water column.
 <P> Even the most oceanic of whales no longer live in a pristine 
environment. Anything less than a precautionary approach is 
unacceptable in the effort to conserve whales. The benefit of the 
doubt must be given to the environment. A failure to do so my 
extinguish any hope of long-term protection for the world's whale 
populations.

<B>In the summer of 1993, Norway shocked the International Whaling

unprecedented response from heads of many IWC delegations that

whaling". A similar statement, in which 15 Commissioners 
expressed their "profound regret at Norway's declared 
intentions", was issued as the 1993 IWC meeting drew to a close. 
<P>The 1994 meeting saw many delegations expressing concern when the 
basis of the population estimate used by Norway to set its 
unilateral quota was called into question. At the 1995 meeting 21 
nations voted for a resolution calling on Norway to "halt 
immediately all whaling activities under its jurisdiction". 
<P>Norway refused to listen, saying that its whaling is a long-
standing tradition, one which has never harmed the population on 
which it depends. Sadly, neither of these assertions is true.</B>
</td></tr></table>

<H3>THE HISTORY</H3>

<P>Modern Norwegian minke whaling began around 1930 and for four 
decades was subject to weak regulations that did little to 
restrict operations. No actual catch quotas were set until 1975 - 
more than 40 years after the start of modern minke whaling in 
Norway. Allocation of quotas to the individual whaling vessels 
did not occur until 1984, one year before the IWC's moratorium 
was to come into force and more than half a century after the 
industry started. The introduction of quotas was generated by the 
IWC, not by the government of Norway. As minkes became scarce 
around the main hunting area of the Lofoten Islands, the whalers 
began to travel further away in search of whales
<P>  The hunt began with a catch of 10 a year in 1930. Before the 
end of the decade it had soared to 1,000 a year, in the 40s it 
went through 2,000 and year and topped 3,000 a year by the end of 
the decade and in the 50s it briefly reached 4,000 a year. After 
that it declined. Despite this, Norwegian whalers and government 
figures regularly call for a return of the hunt to a level of 
2,000 whales a year.

<H3>THE SCIENCE</H3>

<P> With scientific evidence showing that these whales had been 
reduced to below 54% of their original population size - the 
IWC's protection threshold - the Commission declared them a 
"Protected Stock" at its 1985 meeting. Norway filed an objection 
to this decision, and thus is not bound by it, but has never been 
able to prove its position on scientific grounds. In 1991 the 
IWC's Scientific Committee, including all Norwegian scientists, 
confirmed that the N.E. Atlantic minkes had suffered a 
significant decline over the 30 year period 1952-83. A new 
analysis of Norwegian data presented to the 1993 Scientific 
Committee meeting showed that the NE Atlantic minke whales have 
been reduced to less than half of their original number - 
certainly to well below the IWC's protection level of 54%.
<P>  In 1992 the Scientific Committee accepted a Norwegian estimate 
that there were 86,736 minke whales currently in the N.E. 
Atlantic. Norway did not supply the data on which this estimate 
was based until after it was accepted. Once the data were 
examined by non Norwegian scientists, doubts about the accuracy 
of the population estimate began to emerge. Because of these 
concerns the IWC set up a special working group to closely 
examine the Norwegian estimate and in 1995 the group found that 
there were serious errors in the computer model used to calculate 
the population estimate. At the 1995 IWC meeting the entire 
Scientific Committee concluded that it had been wrong to accept 
the Norwegian estimate in 1992, that it no longer considered this 
estimate valid and that it was currently unable to provide an 
estimate for this population.


<H3>WHALERS CHEAT</H3>

<P>In any case, there are no guarantees that Norway's whalers will 
respect quotas or other regulations. Violation of regulations and 
weak enforcement have plagued Norwegian operations. Norway never 
accepted application of the IWC's International Observer Scheme 
to its minke whaling operations. Recently published reports by 
the few whaling inspectors who were employed in the period 1980-
87 reveal widespread illicit activity in that period, including 
serious over-catching. One of these inspectors who reported a 25% 
overcatch and other violations on the vessel "Ulla" which he 
monitored in 1986, wrote: "The crew on the 'Ulla' is neither 
better nor worse than other whalers... they represent the 
Norwegian catcher mentality where there is not enough concern for 
the ecological balance in the sea. The commercial interests are 
put before consideration towards nature."
 <P> Cheating by whalers is not a thing of the past. During the 1994 
hunt one ship, the 'Dag Senior", returning after having caught 
its full quota caught an extra whale on its way back to port. 
This was reported to the police by another ship that saw the 
incident and the crew was fined and the catch confiscated. The 
inspector on board claimed that he knew nothing about it because 
he had been asleep.
 <P> In October 1993, a shipment of whale meat bound for Japan via 
Korea, in violation of Norway's export ban on whale products, was 
seized in Oslo airport. It was in boxes marked as frozen prawns 
and had been cleared for shipment by customs; it was only when a 
box broke open that the airline staff realised that something was 
wrong.

<H3>UNCED</H3>

<P>In the action program "Agenda 21" adopted at the UN Conference 
for Environment and Development, countries endorsed the principle 
that if living marine resources are to be managed and utilised it 
must be on the sustainable basis. Due to the unique problems 
affecting cetaceans UNCED noted that the responsible 
international bodies (the IWC in the case of minke whales) could 
set stricter regulations-including the prohibition of 
exploitation-if desired.

<H3>REVISED MANAGEMENT SCHEME</H3>

<P>Norway alludes to the draft revised management scheme (RMS) 
adopted by the IWC at its 1992 meeting and asserts that this 
allows for the resumption of minke whaling in the N. E. Atlantic. 
This is not true. A scientific procedure for calculating catch 
limits was agreed but is was also agreed that this is only part 
of what is needed to complete the RMS. Not all of these elements 
have been completed or agreed. Furthermore, the Commission's 
insistence on them is not stalling or filibustering, as has been 
suggested. They are necessary requirements as the experience of 
the 'Ulla' shows. Norway as the only member of the IWC to vote 
against the 1992 resolution adopting the draft RMS.
 <P> The Scientific Committee has not calculated any quota for the 
N. E. Atlantic minke whales under the Revised Management Scheme. 
This is because the Commission has decided that the Committee 
should only calculate quotas when it is specifically asked to, 
and such a request has not yet been made. Whaling nations have a 
history of treating scientific recommendations as a starting 
point for a political process to obtain the quotas that they want 
while avoiding responsibilities such as inspection and public 
data scrutiny. The fact that Norway's population estimate was 
wrong underlines the wisdom of the Commission in refusing to be 
pushed into use of the RMS.


<H3>LARGE SCALE OF OPERATIONS</H3>

<P>Norwegian spokespersons are quick to say that the vessels used 
average 60 gross register tons and to paint a picture of small 
ships operating out of isolated villages. In fact 12 of Norway's 
whalers weigh over 100 tons (the 'Ulla" was one of these) and the 
largest weighs 310 tons. Many Norwegian whalers act as mini-
factories, some ranging many hundreds of miles from their home 
ports and staying at sea for weeks at time; catching whales, 
flensing them on board and refrigerating the products for 
eventual sale. By the mid 1980's, some of the richest whaling 
grounds were off Russia, not Norway. Norwegian officials maintain 
that the hunt is strictly for local consumption but in the 1995 
season prices paid for whale blubber shot up 60 fold on the basis 
of rumours that the government would lift the export ban. The 
largest whale meat dealer in the Lofotens gave an interview in 
June 1995 in which he said that he had hundreds of tons of whale 
products ready to ship, that contracts were signed with Japanese 
buyers and that he was just waiting for the export ban to be 
relaxed.

<H3>THE BOTTOM LINE</H3>

<P>Norway's whaling may use small ships but it is neither small 
scale nor traditional. It has depleted the population of minke 
whales of the N.E. Atlantic. The present hunt is intended as the 
forerunner of a much larger, export oriented industry. The 
Norwegian government should immediately announce that it is 
suspending all commercial whaling, withdrawing its objections to 
the moratorium on commercial whaling and to the protected stock 
classification and that it will abide by IWC decisions in the 
future.

<P>From:    Greenpeace crew on the Altair heading for the Spar 
<br>Date:  Monday 26th June  
<br><head><H4>Subject:  Brent Spar update.</H4></head><body>



  
  

  
  
<P>The Greenpeace support vessel, Altair left Lerwick today at about
11.15 a.m. We are going out to take up following the tow of the
floating Brent Spar again.  Paula, our Greenpeace pilot, took her
helicopter out yesterday and found the Spar.  At 17.00 hours
Sunday they were approximately 60 miles west of the north of
Shetland. We expect to rendezvous the Spar by 20.00 hours
tonight.  

<P>Paula and the heli will be staying on board the Altair for the
time being. Jon Castle is still the skipper.  Shell decided not
to take any legal action against him for his part in the initial
occupation of the Brent Spar. 
  
<P>Dave, our photographer, got some new photos yesterday - We are 
pleased to say that the Spar still has Greenpeace banners and
flags flying - "Save Our Seas" 
  
<P>The Altair will follow the Spar until it reaches the parking
location - which will probably be in Norway.  Shell has not yet 
formally asked for this although we expect them to today. The 
earliest that they can reach Norway is next weekend.   
  
<P>We are passing on any information that we have about companies
who are interested in working on dismantling the Spar on land 
to Shell. According to information from Norway there is already
strong competition from companies for the contracts.
  
<P>ne of the more imaginative proposals is from an Austrian 
entrepreneur who wants to turn it into a floating casino!  

<P>More as it happens

INTRODUCTION:
 
THE NEED FOR A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH FORESTS 
 
Humanity depends for its survival on the healthy functioning of
the planet's natural ecosystems, including forests.  Forests are
home to the vast majority of the earth's rich evolutionary
heritage of species.  In conserving this heritage, Greenpeace
seeks ways to value all living beings without devaluing humans. 
 
 
Forests provide many essential services such as regulating
climate
and cycling nutrients and water.  They are sources of food,
fibre,
fuel, medicines, and building materials which underpin the human
economy, and of cultural and spiritual values which give meaning
to human societies.  
 
Forests sustain us, but we are not sustaining them.  Centuries
of
escalating predatory human use of forests has reduced, degraded,
destroyed and even completely eliminated forest ecosystems.
Hundreds of thousands of forest-dependent species face extinction
in the next few decades from destructive forest use.
 
Today many of the principal threats to forests come from
industrialised societies.  This is due to the large-scale and
intensity of forest exploitation practices, and to wasteful and
irresponsible consumption of forest products.  
 
Greenpeace believes that industrial societies must redefine their
relationships with forest ecosystems.  Rather than predatory
relationships towards forests, Greenpeace calls for respectful
relationships.  Both production practices and consumption
patterns
must be adjusted to levels which do not threaten the biological
diversity and sustainability of forest ecosystems.
 
To further this goal, Greenpeace advocates that management of
forest ecosystems be based on the study and application of the
ecological properties of natural forests.  Management processes
must mimic natural processes and maintain ecosystem integrity. 
In
effect, the lead role for determining how to manage forests
should
be provided by nature. 
 
At present, human knowledge about the ecological properties and
species composition of natural forests is profoundly limited.
Extensive and comprehensive protected areas are necessary as a
precaution against inadvertent and irreversible damage from
forest
use.  Only in this way can the full diversity of forest
structures, functions and dynamics be protected and maintained. 
 
Precedents for respectful human relationships with forests do
exist among many indigenous peoples. In this regard, upholding
their rights, respecting their cultures and incorporating their
ecological wisdom into forest management planning will be an
essential and necessary step towards the goal of establishing a
respectful relationship between industrial societies and forests.
 
FORESTS ARE MORE THAN JUST TREES
 
Forests are diverse communities of species forming a complex web
of life.  Together they sustain the whole, not the production of
any one part or commodity.  The web of mutual dependencies in
forests exists at all scales, from the microscopic to the global.
 
Trees, the most obvious part of a forest, are critical structural
members of a forest framework.  However, living trees are only
a
portion of the structure needed for a fully functioning forest. 
There are no isolated components in a forest, only steady
transitions between various living and non-living parts.
 
 
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT
 
Worldwide, the public is well aware that forests are under attack
and that the harvesting practices widely used by logging
industries are intolerably destructive.  Furthermore, the
environmental and human rights movements have demonstrated that
destruction of temperate and tropical forests is often stimulated
by consumer demand in distant markets, particularly in
industrialised countries.  Growing consumer markets in
industrialising countries are also playing an increasing role.
 
Many individuals, corporations and governments now acknowledge
their responsibility as consumers in causing forest destruction. 
Some are taking steps to end that negative role, and play a more
positive one.  This new consumer ethic is progressively altering
the international marketplace for forest products.  
 
Greenpeace believes that consumers have an obligation to minimize
their impacts on forest ecosystems through strengthening markets
for ecologically sound forest products, and by reducing, reusing
and recycling the forest products they use.  
 
Inevitably, forest industry claims of sustainable forest
practices
are proliferating.  These are based on a range of different,
often
conflicting, and typically inadequate standards.  They provide
little information or confidence to either consumers, or the
groups challenging destructive forestry operations.  
 
Greenpeace is involved in efforts to develop international
criteria for respectful forest use.  Our work has included input
to the draft standards of the Forest Stewardship Council, and
dialogue with governments, industry, communities and small-scale
operations.  
 
In response to inquiries from policy makers, producers and
consumers of forest products, Greenpeace is making available the
following principles and guidelines which it has developed for
ecologically responsible forest use.  
 
Greenpeace believes that these principles and guidelines are
globally applicable.  We are preparing reports that describe the
more detailed application of these principles in several specific
forest regions.  We are also working on the development of
guidelines for the social and economic aspects of forest use,
with
particular attention to the rights of indigenous peoples and
forest-dependent communities.
 
We foresee an evolutionary process of further development and
periodic revisions of these principles and guidelines.  Comments
and suggestions are desired and welcomed. 
 
 
 
I. PRINCIPLES OF RESPECTFUL HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS WITH FORESTS.
 
I.1. CONSERVATION OF BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY
 
I.1.1  Forest ecosystems must be protected and maintained at all
scales, from the microscopic to the ecosystem level.
 
I.1.2. The native biological diversity of forests must be
protected and maintained at all spatial scales and through all
time frames. 
 
I.1.3. The ecological structure, function and dynamics of
forests,
including water, soil, and nutrient cycles, landforms, and micro-
climate must be protected and maintained, or where degraded by
past human activities, restored.
 
I.1.4 The ecological knowledge of indigenous peoples in relation
to forests must be recognized, respected, valued and applied as
a
critical part of defining ecologically responsible forest use.
 
 
I.2. THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE
 
I.2.1.  Where there is a threat of reduction or loss of
biological
diversity or other irreversible environmental impacts, lack of
full scientific certainty shall not be used a reason for
postponing measures to avoid such threats.  
 
I.2.2  Forest planning and practices shall err on the side of
precaution.
 
 
I.3. RIGHTS AND PARTICIPATION
 
I.3.1.  The customary rights of indigenous peoples to own, use,
manage and conserve their lands, territories, and resources must
be recognised and respected in all forest management plans. 
 
I.3.2   The public has the right to open and accountable planning
processes for forest use.  Forest use decisions must provide for
the meaningful participation of those sectors of the public
affected by proposed and on-going uses.  This shall include but
not be limited to indigenous peoples, local communities and non-
governmental organisations.
 
I.4. FOREST PLANNING
 
I.4.1. In order to maintain forest structure, function and
dynamics, forest planning shall first determine what to leave,
and
then what to take.
 
I.4.2. Impacts to forest ecosystems from one use must not
compromise the potential for other uses.
 
I.4.3. Forest planning shall favour uses and products which have
the lowest environmental impacts over their life cycle.
 
 
============================
II. GUIDELINES FOR RESPECTFUL FOREST USE
 
II.1.     Forest use areas shall be defined after the
establishment of a protected ecosystem network within each
landscape used by human beings. 
 
     II.1.1    Protected ecosystem networks shall be respectful
of
indigenous peoples' customary rights.
 
     II.1.2    Protected ecosystem networks shall be designed
based on the principles of conservation biology and ecosystem
management.
 
     II.1.3    Components of a protected ecosystem network
include: large protected reserves, riparian ecosystems,
ecologically sensitive sites, culturally significant areas,
representative and ecologically viable areas of all forest types
and successional phases, interconnecting corridors, naturally
rare
habitats, and habitats for rare and endangered species and
species
of special scientific significance.  
 
     II.1.4    If a landscape has insufficient native forest to
make up a protected ecosystem network, restoration of forest
areas
must be carried out as an integral part of the determination and
development of appropriate human use areas.
 
II.2. For every forest use area representative reference sites
must be identified, set aside and fully protected. Reference
sites
may correspond to a number of production areas.
 
     II.2.1    Reference sites shall be representative of the
native forest in the forest use area as determined by landscape
characteristics, biotic and abiotic components and the
naturalness
of the reference site including its history.
 
     II.2.2    Reference sites may be selected from, but are not
limited to, areas set aside within a protected ecosystem network.
 
 
     II.2.3    Reference sites should be as close to natural
ecosystems as possible.  Where such sites are not available,
restoration must occur.
 
II.3. Forest use areas shall be managed to mimic reference sites
in structure, function and dynamics. 
 
     II.3.1    Reference sites serve as models for corresponding
use sites.  Inventories of structure, function and dynamics of
reference sites shall be used to establish minimum standards
necessary to design ecologically responsible forest use.
  
     II.3.2    Inventories shall occur on forest use sites to
determine any differences between the site being planned and the
reference sites.  These differences shall be used to strengthen,
but not weaken, the minimum standards established from reference
sites. 
 
     II.3.3    Forest operations will seek to minimise
differences
in structure, function and dynamics between the reference sites
and the forest use sites over time.
 
     II.3.4     A management plan appropriate to the scale,
intensity and frequency of forest operations must be prepared. 
Management plans will be for specific forest sites and/or
ecosystems and must include provisions on the protection and
maintenance of adjacent and interconnected sites and/or
ecosystems
as relevant.
 
II.4. Independent monitoring of the impacts of operations in the
forest use area shall occur.  Procedures for regular review and,
if needed, revision of the management plan must be established.
 
     II.4.1    An environmental assessment shall take place prior
to and following extractive activities to make sure that forest
structure, function and dynamics are being protected. 
 
     II.4.2    Frequent inventories of the structure, function
and
dynamics of forest use areas - as appropriate to the intensity,
scale and frequency of forest operations - and of their reference
sites shall occur to determine progress towards minimising
differences between them. 
     
     II.4.3    All assessments, inventories and management plans
must be documented and available to the public.
 
 
 
 
=======================================
III.  SOME PROHIBITED MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
 
In practical terms, the above guidelines mean that many presently
applied forest management practices must be avoided.  The
following is a partial list of those practices whose use should
be
prohibited.  Prohibited management practices include use of:
 
- bio-accumulative, toxic and/or persistent substances; 
- genetically modified organisms (GMOs);
- clearcutting;
- highgrading;
- direct manipulations of soils such as ploughing, harrowing,
and/or drainage of forest lands and peatlands.
- replacement of natural forests by tree plantations.
 
=======================================
ANNEX: DEFINITION OF TERMS
 
Biological diversity - "the variability among living organisms
from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and
other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which
they are part; this includes diversity within species, between
species and of ecosystems." (Convention on Biological Diversity)
 
Restoration - The recreation of communities of organisms
resembling, in structure, function and dynamics, those prior to
degradation, and protected from further human degradation. 
 
Clearcutting - The cutting of all trees in a forest stand and
removal of the merchantable logs, which is damaging to the
structure, functions and/or dynamics of the forest.  
 
Clearcut - An opening in a forest from clearcutting.

<P>Date:    Wed 19-JUL-95 
<P>Subject: Update from RW for Internet Diary </H4></head>
<body>
 
<P>We're 150 miles from Rarotonga, with our ETA there tomorrow
morning at 1000 hours.  We have been invited to an official
function with the Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey Henry, and
opposition MPs, on Thursday night at which he plans to make a
major announcement about the Cook Islands Government's action on
French testing.  This will be followed on our side by a public
meeting at 8pm on the ship.  On Friday we will be doing some
school talks.
 
<P>We've been wallowing around a bit in choppy seas today, so
queasiness has hit a few of the crew.  But spirits are high as 
we
approach Rarotonga and the famous "Tere's Bar"... the only place
to be on a Friday night in Rarotonga!
 
<P>Richard Leney (mechanic) will leave the ship in Rarotonga to go
to Auckland to help find new zodiacs.  A new mate, Derek 
Nichols,
will be joining us.
 
<P>Our ETD from Rarotonga is Saturday morning, and we are scheduled
to arrive in Fiji one week later, on Saturday 29 July. We've 
been
really encouraged by all the amazing work GP offices have been
doing around the world -- sorry if we haven't had time to 
respond
to you all, but we really appreciate it!  We're also feeling 
good
about the flotilla plans which seem to be shaping up well in New
Zealand and Australia.  Along with the decision to send the MV
Greenpeace to Moruroa too, it looks we'll be giving the French
military something to really worry about soon!
 
<P>Cheers, Stephanie

<br>Subject: Diary Update</H4><body>


<P>Dear all,
 
<P>Update Friday July 7:
 
<P>We are currently 150 miles west of Moruroa in calm seas.  We did 
some boat training and had a swim stop this afternoon.  We had 
another visitor a little earlier, but of a more welcome sort:  a 
curious fin whale who surfaced near us several times.
 
<P>Our other "ghost" is still tracking us at 12 miles.  
 
<P>We anticipate a release going out later tonight re an open letter 
to Chirac as we approach Moruroa.  Then there is likely to be at 
least one more tomorrow regarding any surviellance we come under, 
as we get closer to the zone.

<P>Cheers
Stephanie</body></html>

<head><title>Manutea Diary 18 September</title></head><body>


 
<H4>From:  AUDREY CARDWELL, SV MANUTEA OUTSIDE 12-MILE ZONE
</H4>
 
<p>Here it is 1800 and I am on watch.  I just came down from the
cockpit where under a cloudy evening sky, we are racing to our
special destination for tonight, the glow of Moruroa off to
starboard and far behind us, not often seen but felt, we are
followed by a French warship.  Funny, how you get used to
things...being followed, circled, and harassed by warships, jets
and helicopters are so commonplace now, we simply note the times
of flyovers and chart the position in our log.  All of us feel
the constant menace that stepping over the unseen line, or even
being related to something stepping over an unseen line, will
probably bring soldiers aboard our ships.  

<p>At least our purpose here is clear to us.  When asked by
reporters after the first test if we were all going home now that
we had lost we replied that we are not here just to stop a test. 
We are here to end nuclear testing.  A simple, even simplistic,
answer, but the truth for those of us here.  And it still holds.
 
<p>When we first arrived, delayed by weather, we were in as much
shock as the other boats over the taking of the Rainbow Warrior
and the MV Greenpeace.  We got busy setting up sort of base --
contacting all the boaters and providing space, communications,
information, and a sense of security -- ensuring them that
Greenpeace was definitely still here!  David McTaggart's presence
inspired the boaters -- he is someone who had been here before
in a small boat taking on the military machine with whom they
could identify.
 
<p>The action with the two Greenpeace inflatables going into Moruroa
the next morning told everyone that we were going to keep up the
pressure even with two of our vessels seized by the French.  

<p>The Boat meetings became a gathering of partners with Greenpeace
-- people who had struggled to get here to make a statement about
the kind of future they want for themselves and their children. 
They came together with creative ideas, sharing resources,
providing moral and human support.  We have shared food, water,
fuel, mechanics, inflatables, clothes, ideas, hope and
determination.  We have shared actions together and have a few
more ideas in the wings.  The group has changed as boats come and
go, but the determination is the same -- we are here to maintain
a witness and, whenever possible, a hindrance to a great wrong
that is being done here.  

<p>What we can do by sending folks into the test sites and keeping
the pressure on, we think is worth all the effort here.  The news
has been encouraging: the strong reactions around the world after
the first test; the moves by the OAS, the Pacific Forum, the
European Union and US Congress to condemn French testing; and,
the plans to take on France in the World Court, the UN and in
their own European Union.  All of this gives us the clear
impression that France is being surrounded by critics of its
blind and stupidly regressive testing policy.  We feel that
victory is more possible than ever before, and we become more and
more determined to keep up the fight here and make our presence
felt.
 
<p>Peace,
Audrey</body></html>

<H4> DIARY UPDATE FROM RAINBOW WARRIOR:
<P> FRIDAY 16TH JUNE</H4> 
</head>            

<body>

 
<P><I>A wild sort of a night last night, gusting to 40 knots. </I> With the
most rudimentary of sail up, the Warrior still managed 9 knots. 
But with more rolls than a Swiss bakery and several flying
sleepers in the night.  This morning saw a rather subdued ship
with sleepy eyes.

<P>Nine o'clock Friday morning, and suddenly its Thursday again as
we cross the dateline -- very strange.  The first mate claims he
felt the bump, the deckhand says he saw a white line, but
Madeleine the third mate, in charge at the time, declares that
we should have two Fridays instead. Why?  Friday is shower day
in the water saving regime on board and everyone wants two
showers.  No! says the chief engineer, you can't have two shower
days in a row!  The arrival of a large yellow-fin tuna on the
fishing line off the stern gives the cook the last word: two
fridays of fresh fish.  The crew relents and is happy for the
news.

<P>We continue to make our way toward the French test site.  News
from around the world makes its way to us via the computer and
ongoing calls from the media all over the world.  We know that
political opposition is growing with the European Parliament 
passing a resolution condemning France's plan to resume nuclear
testing in the South Pacific just yesterday.  We are thrilled by
that news.  That is a strong addition to the countries that have
already condemned or opposed the plan to test:  Australia, New
Zealand, the South Pacific Forum, Japan, Chile, the Netherlands,
Ireland, Finland, Luxembourg, Norway, Brazil, Belgium, Denmark,
Sweden and the US. 

<P>The EP resolution stated that party nations are "shocked by the
decision of French President Chirac" and urged France to
reconsider its decision.  It also condemned the continuing
nuclear tests by China and warned that if nuclear powers breach
the spirit or the letter of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT), other states could follow suit.
 
<P>The resolution will now be forwarded to the Council, the
Commission, to all Governments who signed the NPT and to the
Chairman of the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.
 
<P>We here that Greenpeace offices are calling on all of the EP
heads of state to bring the issue to the table of both the G-7
Summit now meeting in Halifax, Canada and to the Summit of
European Union Heads of State to be held on the 26-27 of June in
Cannes, France.
 
<P>Meanwhile we also hear bits of news about the other raging
Greenpeace issue:  the effort to stop the dumping of Shell's
Brent Spar oil platform into the Atlantic.  This campaign is also
picking up tremendous steam and we send our well wishes.

<P>More from this rough and tumble boat as we make our voyage.

<H4> DIARY UPDATE FROM RAINBOW WARRIOR:
<P>SUNDAY 18TH JUNE</H4> 
            

<body>

 
<P><I> We have decided to put
in to Rarotonga, capital of the Cook Islands. </I>  The Cook play a
long-running part in the story of French nuclear tests -- they
are the independent South Pacific nation nearest to Moruroa where
the French carry out their underground tests; there is a New
Zealand Government seismic monitoring station there which has
often provided the first indication to the world that France has
conducted yet another test; and it is the place where, on
Hiroshima Day, August 6th 1985, the nations of the South Pacific
signed the Treaty of Rarotonga which declared the region a
nuclear free zone.

or <a href="rw22.jpg">29KB JPG.</a> Greenpeace/Morgan 

<P>Many countries from outside the region also signed the treaty,
but France the UK and the US were conspicuous by their refusal
to sign.  A stop in Rarotonga will allow us to fully reprovision
the Rainbow Warrior should we be refused entry to Tahiti.  On
board, the increasingly pleasant weather results in a barbecue
on the poop deck at sunset.  A guitar, tea-chest bass (knocked
up the day before in the fish hold) and a pair of spoons fuel a
musical evening.  We need some serious crew song practice for our
approaching ports of call as singing is a pretty essential part
of Pacific island life.

<P>We've heard reports from a number of Greenpeace offices around
the world that opposition to French testing continues to grow. 
We are grateful for that.  But we've also heard that the French
consulate in Perth, Australia was fire bombed on Saturday.  While
we encourage non-violent protests of ALL types, we must condemn
using violent tactics to try to stop the French.  It is a sad
reminder to us on board the new Rainbow Warrior of what the
French did to our first Rainbow Warrior almost 10 years ago.  The
bombing in New Zealand left one crew member dead and shook the
world when the news came out that it was not only the French, but
that it was, in fact, an act of state terrorism.  Violence is not
acceptable in any situation and we call on all those concerned
out there to PLEASE use restraint.  Carry out marches, fax, e-
mail, write or call the nearest French Embassy and your
government to call for it to voice opposition to any re-start of
nuclear testing.  If you want to, stop using French or Chinese
(remember, they just tested a nuclear weapon too!) products if
you think that will work.  But don't destroy property or people. 
In the end, such acts are the same when carried out by the French
government or by individuals and just as destructive in both
cases.

<P>More news as we continue our journey.

<H4> DIARY UPDATE FROM THE CREW OF THE RAINBOW WARRIOR:
<P>MONDAY 19TH JUNE</H4> 
</head>            

<body>


<P><I>Best weather we've seen yet on our voyage</I>.  That makes everyone
in the crew happy since it means we can sleep through the night
without being tosses from our bunks and that food can be prepared
without the prospect of flying fruits, vegetables and, worst of
all, soup.

<P>We have become very concerned about reports from the USA that
President Clinton is not only under pressure from the Defense
Department and the Pentagon to resume underground nuclear tests
in Nevada, but that he is actually considering it!  With the Cold
War over and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ink still wet
(which formally agreed to pursue a ban on all nuclear testing as
swiftly as possible and to use "utmost restraint" until it is
established), this is an unbelievable outrage.  Greenpeace in the
US is now being forced to think, all over again, about how to put
a stop to any nuclear test plans!

<P>An op-ed in the Washington Post by Mary McGrory on Chirac's visit
to DC reads:

<P>"LAST WEEK'S White House visitor, Jacques Chirac, prime minister
of France, looks like the droll Danish pianist Victor Borge: same
diagonal eyebrows, same mobile face. But Chirac brought no
laughter in his portfolio, only the discouraging news that France
will break the nuclear moratorium and start testing again....
Irate Down-Underers, listening to French insistence that the
tests will do no harm, ask why, if that is so, they don't test
them in Bordeaux. .....[Cinton] is under similar pressure [to
that by French military and nuclear proponents] from the same
people to open up a loophole in the test ban. They want him to
allow for testing of small weapons, low-level testing of bombs
of 200 to 500 tons. These are so-called "useful" nukes, which
have a small yield and can be delivered precisely, as to the
bunker of Saddam Hussein....It was a poor week for arms control.
Those [nuclear proponents in the US] who once thought we could
never have enough nuclear weapons are now passionately committed
to the proposition that we can never be done testing them. 
They're shouting "Vive la France," but nobody else is."  

<P>Some good news.  Today we heard from the Australian Greenpeace
office that 500 protesters attempted to storm the French Embassy
in Canberra!  It must have been a beautiful site.  Clearly the
French announcement to begin testing again has hit a nerve in the
Pacific region and we applaud their efforts!  Also, we've learned
that the Social Democratic parties of four Nordic countries --
Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden -- agreed Sunday to make a
joint protest against French testing decision.  The protest will
be published later this week.  The Social Democrats are in power
in three of these four countries!  And, perhaps the most
remarkable, the Flemish daily newspaper De Morgen published a
remarkable editorial last Saturday showing two pictures of French
President Chirac. On the left one, above the text "Chirac resumes
nuclear testing" he looks normal. The picture on the right, 
however, shows a picture of Chirac as a radiation victim, without
hair and with his face pocked and pimpled. The text under this
photo says: "We wish him all the best".  This "oped" was signed
by the editorial staff of De Morgen, with the words: "As an
independent newspaper we have to give signals. Sometimes even
alarm signals. De Morgen".  This is a great inspiration to all
of us on the Rainbow Warrior.

</H4> 
</head>            

<body>


 
<P>Chers amis,
 
<P>Il y a une semaine, le navire amiral de Greenpeace, le Rainbow
Warrior, a quitte le port d'Auckland en Nouvelle-Zelande en
direction des atolls de Moruroa et de Fangataufa dans le
Pacifique sud. A son bord, 22 hommes et femmes qui souhaitent
exprimer leur solidarite avec votre manifestation de ce soir. 
 
<P>Nous partageons le meme espoir : que l'arret des essais
nucleaires francais contribue a l'adoption immediate d'un traite
interdisant totalement les essais nucleaires en quelque pays que
ce soit. La manifestation de ce soir a Paris et dans d'autres
villes de France va montrer a l'opinion publique mondiale que
tous les citoyens francais n'acceptent pas le cynisme de leur
president de la republique. Elle va montrer que tous ne sont pas
resignes a cette fuite en avant. Elle va montrer que le mot
"irrevocable" n'est pas francais.
 
<P>La reprise des essais nucleaires en Polynesie risque d'aneantir
une chance historique de faire un pas dans le sens de la paix.
La
securite de la France, pas plus que celle des autres nations, ne
peut s'appuyer sur une strategie de guerre froide qui fait bon
marche des veritables facteurs de paix et de securite : le
developpement des nations les plus pauvres et la protection de
notre planete commune. Notre mission a Moruroa representera, nous
l'esperons, aussi, votre indignation et vos espoirs et la volonte
de millions d'autres personnes de par le monde qui veulent que
leurs enfants ne connaissent pas le chantage nucleaire.
 
<P>--Jean-Luc Thierry, Greenpeace France, 19 June 1995
  Now on board the Rainbow Warrior sailing toward the French   
  nuclear test site.

<P>TUESDAY 20TH JUNE 07:22:07 GMT  Part I.</H4> 
</head>            

<body>




<P>A quiet Monday morning, just moving into second gear, when 
wheeooo, wheeooo and the fire alarm propels bodies out of every 
corner of the ship onto the deck.  The last watch leap from their
beds, the cooks come from their soup, the campaigners from 
their computers and the videographer from his pulp western.  
False alarm (the engineers forgot to turn off the smoke detector
before doing some osxy-acetylene cutting) but the mate calls 
"carry on" so we do a live drill.  All went pretty smoothly too, 
which is always good to see.

<P>With the swell down to 1-2 metres, the afternoon is taken up with
boat training.  Two inflatables are launched and using 
continually rotating crews old hands brush up their skills and 
newer ones receive some tuition.  Today the main points to 
practice are launching procedures and the transfer of people to
and from the ship. A deep red setting sun puts the seal on a 
lovely day, one that will no doubt set the pattern for the week 
ahead.

<P>We have heard from our colleagues in France that a large
rally\march is taking place in Paris this evening with over 90
environmental, labour, church and peace groups joining together
to protest against Chirac's announcement. Also we've heard that
50 other towns will join in protest outside of Paris and a
national day of protest against testing is being planned for 1
July, 3 pm in Paris as well. These protests are taking place at
perfect time as a political envoy from Australia was meeting with
French officials on the issue today.  A recent Reuters poll
reporting that 75 per cent of French people are opposed to the
resumption of nuclear testing is good news to us. With opposition
growing world wide its good to know that the French public are
adding their voices.

<H4>From:    Alice Leney and crew on SV Rainbow Warrior
<P>  TUES 20-JUN-95 14:41:04 GMT -- Part 2</H4> 
<P>Early afternoon, and bright warm sunshine on deck.  The crew
gather for a discussion on various aspects of non-violent
protest.  Moving from a general talk on the theory of non-violent
action and the use of it by Greenpeace as a force for change, we
arrive at the specifics of the sort of response we might expect
from the French military authorities as we approach the French
test site. Greenpeace's past experiences at Moruroa and on other
quite different campaigns is discussed.  

<P>Commitment to non-violence is of course not a problem amongst the
crew and there is a wealth of experience that will serve use well
in coming weeks.  But group discussion and clarification of
different courses of action is an essential part of creating a
body of people -- in this case the crew -- who can work together
as a team under difficult conditions.  A cohesive, well co-
ordinated crew is a sweet thing to see as it swings into action
-- look out Moruroa!

<P>News from around the world has given us a great boost. If the
giant Shell oil company can be convinced to see the
irresponsibility of dumping tonnes of industrial waste (ie
a used oil platform) at sea, perhaps then M. Chirac can be
convinced of the absurdity of resuming nuclear weapons tests. 
And for whom are your bombs intended, M. Chirac?

Subject:  Rarotonga

<P> The smell of rich tropical earth and misty mountains on the
horizon tell us that Rarotonga is ahead of us with the morning
sun.  An escort pilot arrives at 10 a.m. on board the Rainbow
Warrior and by 11 we are being treated to a vivacious display of
gyrating Cook Island dancers!  The Deputy Prime Minister of
Rorotonga gave the main address: a message of strong support from
all the people of the Cook Islands for our mission, and a call
for the French to change their decision.  "Lives are more
precious than bombs" and "French bomb sucks" proclaim the hastily
made banners from the locals (they only heard we were coming two
days ago!).

<P> The ship is inundated with well-wishers and gifts.  Giant bunches
of bananas are now hanging in the rigging; two enormous pizzas
arrive at dinner time; and a beautifully moist rich chocolate
cake appears miraculously through a port-hole just after supper! 
The warmth of feeling for the Warrior and her work is wonderful,
one can't help feeling sad for those in the world who wish to
poison the tranquillity and generosity of the South Pacific
Islands with their nuclear weapons.

<P>As the ocean outside the harbour of Roratanga is to the leeward
(sheltered) side of the island, we make use of the calm waters
for a few hours of more boat training.  It certainly makes a
change from the steep swells we battled further south, and allows
for practice of a different set of manouevres.  Also some good
"man overboard" training, where we practise gettting bodies out
of the water.
 
<P>Some crew remained behind on board where, throughout the course
of the day, several hundred school children of a wide variety of
ages toured the Rainbow Warrior.  It is always a great boost to
the crew to be infected by the enthusiasm of the kids.  Their
clear sense of (in)justice on this issue uncomplicated by
politics or economics: why should anyone want to build bombs that
can kill millions of people all at once, and test it in somebody
else's backyard?  Why indeed.

<P>More as we continue our journey -- Alice.

<P>Thursday 23rd JUNE10:12 GMT </H4> 
</head>            

<body>




<P>Friday afternoon is usually pretty laid back in the Cook Islands
as everyone winds down for the weekend (not that anyone seems to
get wound up here at all!)  But this Friday is different.  A few
locals have gotten together and at the drop of a hat -- just a
mere three days ago -- organised an anti-testing march here.  The
coconut radio obviously works well here, as about 2,000 people
turn out -- of a total population of around 8000!  At 3pm the
whole troupe march the kilometre from the Rainbow Warrior to the
civic centre. Protest marching is not normal or even usually
acceptable here in Polynesia, so the turn out -- the largest
march anyone can ever remember here in Rarotonga -- is even more
exceptional.

<P>At the civic centre, with music provided by a band put together
for the occasion by local musicians, we are addressed by
impassioned speeches from local church leaders, community elders,
Members of Parliament and the Prime Minister himself, Sir
Geoffrey Henry, who asked why should anyone wish to develop new
weapons to kill people when so many people are being very
effectively killed around the world already...
 
<P>The banners said it all: "Shame on you, Chirac", "We love our
children, don't the French too?"; "Fry eggs not people"; "Chirac
- go fishing, not fission"; "Test your bombs in your own
backyard."  

<P>This pleasant, friendly and sociable event, passing without an
ounce of agression, provided a poignant contrast to the violence
and arrogance of the French Government's decision to resume
nuclear weapons tests.

<P>We learned the other day that France is threatening to withdraw
aid from small South Pacific states who come forward to protest
its resumption of nuclear testing.  To do so would be such a
direct act of blackmail to these islands and an attempt to take
away their right to protect their own environment.  I fear that
it shows the lenghts to which France will go to pursue its own
agenda in spite of growing world opposition to any resumption of
nuclear testing.  After spending time with people from this
region, nothing, in my view, could be more cynical.
 
<P>More tomorrow -- Alice.

</head>            

<body>



<P>Back to sea today from Roratanga, but as it is pitching rather
than rolling we're sliding from our bunks again.  A fresh
easterly, right on the nose, so no sail at all today.  But as the
day wears on the wind slowly dies down to an eight knot breeze
and the sea settles to a gentle heaving calmness.  

<P>Late morning Tom the radio operator gives the crew a run through
of the hand-held radio equipment and a refresher course on radio
protocol and use.  After lunch there is more boat training:
practising our launching proceedures to refine them and more
general boat techniques and manoeuvres.  Some crew are new to
this work, and the more comfortable everyone is in a small boat
the better.  A wise sailor never loses respect for the sea -- and
it is important to shake down the equipment, and identify and
rectify any problems or potential problems.

<P>After a long voyage across the Pacific and the five weeks
maintenance in Auckland over the last few months the boats
haven't seen much use lately. 

<P>More as we continue our Journey -- Alice
<HR>
<H4>Campaign Update</H4>
 
<P>Two Tahitian representatives of Te Ihutai No Te Hau - The
Flotilla for Peace - will give a press conference tomorrow at the
Cannes Summit of European Union Ministers.  We hope it will help
keep nuclear testing on the political agenda in Europe, where
most EU members have been noticeably reticent about criticising
France's decision to resume nuclear testing in anything but weak
terms.
 
<P>However, the momentum may now be building more strongly.  After
a high-profile Greenpeace action in Amsterdam blocking French
minesweeping vessels entering port, the Dutch Government said it
would ensure French testing was discussed at the Cannes EU
meeting.  Even German conservative politicians have rebuked Kohl
for not raising the testing issue at the G7 summit in Halifax on
June 17, and have called for him to raise it at the Cannes
meeting.  European Socialist leaders at the
weekend condemned the French testing decision.  And reports from
Paris, where mobilisation for a national demonstration on July
first are in full swing, suggest a huge turn-out is likely.
 
<P>Meanwhile, the ship had a call from Oscar Temaru, the leader of
Tavini Huiraatira (the Tahitian independence party) and the mayor
of Faa'a, Tahiti today.  Pressure is also building there -- an
around-the-island protest march started yesterday, and is slowly
building to a large demonstration to welcome the Rainbow Warrior
when we arrive there on Thursday morning.  We've had no word from
the French authorities about entry into Tahiti, so are presuming
that they will take the sensible approach and permit us entry
into port there.

Warrior

<P>Thursday 27th June </H4> 
</head><body>         


<P>With the deep blue of the Pacific gently undulating beneath us
and a bright sun beating down on hot decks, what else can you do
at three in the afternoon but have a swim stop?  With a little
time up our sleeves before our arrival in Papeete, the captain is
easily persuaded.  It is an extraordinary sensation, to swim in
4000 metres of water, the nearest land hundreds of miles away. 
When you dive off the ship, as you head downward into the abyss,
you can touch infinity; just like star gazing on a clear night,
except in this instance you are totally enveloped.  Always good
for crew morale, a swim stop!

<P>Dinner time, and we are treated to spaghetti as it should be,
courtesy of our Italian second engineer...
 
<P>Alice on board the rainbow signing off for now....
<HR>

<P>From:    Greenpeace Vessel SV Rainbow Warrior            
<br>Date:    Tuesday 27-JUN-95 
<br>Subject: Campaign update

<P>We are hearing of more and more protests and demonstrations
around the world.  Yesterday, Greenpeace Japan's protests outside
the French Embassy ran front page in Japanese newspapers; more
than 1000 people marched in Auckland, New Zealand, on Monday, and
today France's Defence Minister Charles Millon had to run the
gauntlet of protestors when he visited his British counterpart in
London.  In Sweden, Greenpeace supporters picketing the airport
are urging travellers to France to wear a badge expressing their
opposition to testing.
 
<P>Even more cheering, an e-mail letter from French scientists and
researchers protesting at testing has been sent to us.  The group
says they regard nuclear testing as dangerous from an ecological
point of view, from the point of view of contributing to the arms
race, and because the decision "exhibits an inadmissible contempt
for the people of the Pacific area".
 
<P>There is still no word from the French authorities about our
entry into Papeete.  We are hoping that there will be no trouble:
the Rainbow Warrior heard again from journalists in Tahiti today
that huge crowds are expected to welcome the ship in on Thursday.

<P>Signing off, 
<br>Steph on board the Rainbow Warrior

</head> <body>         



<P>A day out of Tahiti and a good swell is right on the bow.  At an
evening crew meeting we run through the forthcoming events in
Tahiti.  This week a two-pronged march has been circling the
island of Tahiti, one half going clockwise, the other anti-
clockwise.  This anti-nuclear march is due to converge on the
wharf at Papeete around the time the Rainbow Warrior docks in
port.  Many thousands of people are already involved, opposition
to the testing of nuclear weapons covers a very broad spectrum of
organisations in French Polyensia - not only environmental and
peace groups, but most of the churches, the independence
movement, and several of the political parties.  Even the long
time president of the local assembly, Gaston Flosse, has had to
reflect the prevailing sentiment.  Previously an avid supporter
of testing, he has swung with the wind: two weeks ago opposing a
resumption, now "indifferent" (after a trip to Paris he declared
himself neither for nor against).  In Tahiti, as everywhere else
in the Paciifc, most people would prefer that if the French must
test their nuclear weapons, they should test them in France. 
French people would surely react to that!

<br>Subject: Campaign update</H4>

<P>President Chirac got chewed out at a dinner party during the
European Union heads of government Summit in Cannes earlier this
week: the Dutch Prime Minister led a strong complaint joined by
"most other European governments", according to the Swedish Prime
Minister.
 
<P>At the same time, tensions are rising 12,000 miles away in
Tahiti.  Already 3000 people have joined a march organised by one
of the political parties, with more than 5000 expected in the
town centre tomorrow to coincide with the entrance of the Rainbow
Warrior into Papeete harbour.  Meanwhile, riot police have been
flown in to Tahiti by the French authorities, who have also
indicated that the Rainbow Warrior will be barred from docking at
the main quay.  The authorities may try to hide the Rainbow
Warrior amongst military and industrial dockyards, but the
international media have descended on Tahiti and it is clear that
France cannot make invisible the depth of protest from both local
people and the world community.
 
<P>Bye for now,

<H4> DIARY UPDATE FROM THE CREW OF THE RAINBOW WARRIOR:
<P>Thursday 29th June </H4> 
</head> <body>         



 
<P>Arrival in Tahiti destroyed the rhythms of the ship.  A huge
demonstration of 15-20,000 people was underway as the Rainbow
Warrior arrived at the entrance to Papeete harbour.  She was to
be berthed at the public quay -- the Quai d'Honneur -- but at the
last minute the authorities decided otherwise.  So a stand-off
developed: the ship refused to come in unless we could be near
the local protests against nuclear testing (rather than shuffled
into an obscure dock a couple of kilometres out of town and under
the close eye of the French Navy).  Finally, the Warrior was
allowed in to anchor on a temporary anchorage a few hundred
metres off the point where the protestors had blocked the main
western highway into the city.  The eastern highway was also
blockaded.
 
<P>Some of the crew joined the blockades overnight, picnicking on
tinned beef, crackers and spa water in the middle of the road and
sleeping on the tarmac.  The commitment of the people here is
amazing -- sitting all day through 35 degree heat, and then
sleeping on hard asphalt all night.

<P>Steamy Friday 30 June, Papeete:

<P>1100 hours: We held a packed press conference in the mess with 
Monsigneur Gaillot (Catholic Bishop from France), Oscar Temaru 
(leader of Tavini Huiraatira), Pastor Temarama Apatari of the 
Eglise Evangelique (protestant church) representing Te Ihutai No 
te Hau (the peace flottilla coalition.)

<P>The High Commission has invited us, via our shipping agent (!) to 
meet with him.  We submitted a delegation list of Jean-luc 
Thierry, I and Philip Pupuka (Greenpeace Pacific).  
However, he has refused to lift the expulsion orders against 
Philip and me preventing us go ashore for the meeting, so we are 
going to ask him to meet us on board the Rainbow Warrior.  
Jean-Luc and I wish to hold the meeting jointly with him.  We
may not receive an answer until tomorrow, who knows.
It is unclear how productive a meeting would be anyway, as if the 
only substance of the meeting is to repeat the offer of a tourist 
trip to Moruroa for a day, which we have already rejected as a 
public relations exercise, not the comprehensive scientific 
investigation which is required.

<P>Meanwhile, the demonstrators are still blocking the eastern and 
western access roads into Papeete.  The leaders of the 
demonstration - the coalition Ihutai No te Hau - met today to 
reaffirm their determination to act together in a unified way; 
they will decide this afternoon how or whether the protest will 
continue.  The word from is that President Chirac's decision is 
irrevocable, and that no referendum is possible.  However, no 
official answer has been conveyed back to the marchers yet.
The blockades may run until Monday.  After that further 
demonstrations are being planned.

programme) will occur on Sunday morning, and Greenpeace crew will

<P>1500 hours: We have just been moved to the quai de cabotage, a 
commercial dock on the opposite side of the harbour from the 
city (the quay they wanted to put us on yesterday).  We had no 
choice if we were to take on fresh water, fuel and supplies.  It 
is possible that some of the demonstrators may come around here, 
according to a local journalist who has just visited.  We have a 
couple of police cars parked within 20 yards of the boat 
observing us all the time, which makes it rather difficult to 
keep private in the cabins on the port side of the ship.

<P>Gaston Bernandino who was on the Rainbow Warrior in 1990 has just 
visited.  He is very active in local ecological struggles, 
including the 104 day occupation of a valley threatened by a 
large hydro-dam development.
 
<P>1700 hours:  The awning has gone up on the bridge deck which has 
cut the blinding heat. Our last minute supplies and stores are 
being loaded, and our departure time for Monday from Papeete is 
now set for 4.30pm in the afternoon (Monday, July 3).

<P>Fifteen members of the US Congress, including the ranking
member of the House International Relations Committee, Lee H.
Hamilton (D-Indiana), Asia-Pacific Affairs Subcommittee Chairman
Doug Bereuter (R-Nebraska) and International Operations and Human
Rights Subcommittee Chairman Christopher H. Smith (R-New Jersey),
have joined Congressman Eni Faleomavaega as co-sponsors ofa
resolution opposing a resumption of French testing.  

<P>"I find it significant that several senior members of the House
International Relations Committee have reached bi-partisan
agreement that it is patently unfair and unconscionable that
France force the peoples of French Polynesia and the South Pacific
to bear the price of French nuclear adventurism," said
Congressman Faleomavaega.  "If the government of France must
conduct nuclear tests that undermine the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty and impede good faith negotiation of a
comprehensive test ban treaty, then let it detonate and spread
its nuclear poison on French soil."
 
<P>State Department Assistant Secretary for East Asian And pacific
Affairs, Ambassador Winston Lord, testified this week before the
House International Relations Committee and confirmed that the
U.S. would maintain its nuclear testing moratorium to create
favorable conditions for a successful CTBT negotiation in 1996. 
Congressman Faleomavaega noted, "I applaud President Clinton's
world leadership on this issue and would urge that his
administration aggressive pursue the achievement of a genuine,
zero-yield, Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
 
<P>Faleomavaega concluded, "The South Pacific Forum nations
should be commended for their intensive efforts protesting
France's planned resumption of nuclear testing - especially
Australia, New Zealand, Western Samoa, Papua New Guinea, Nauru
and Kiribati for sending the delegation to Paris to meet
firsthand with the French Government.  By introduction of this
legislation today, I and my colleagues in Congress send a strong
message ofsupport for the island nations of the South Pacific
that seek Frances' reconsideration of this ill-conceived
decision."

<P>The blockade has now been in place for three days.  Tensions have
been building, but it looks as if the barricades will be lifted
today.  Protest marches have also taken place on five other
islands and on Tahiti the marches actually began more than a week
ago and circumnavigated the island.  The people are demanding a
referendum on the subject of a resumption of nuclear testing:  a
fair enough demand, as they are the people who must live with the
immediate and long-term consequences of the testing.  There is
tremendous feeling over this issue and concern for their children
and children to come.
 
<P>For the Rainbow Warrior, apart from active participation in the
various anti-nuclear demonstrations, it is a time for last minute
preparations.  The ship is fully supplied again, to sail for who
knows how long?  Using the medium of the local press, it is made
quite clear to us that the military authorities will not tolerate
the ship entering the military exclusion zone around the atoll. 
What is in store for us remains an open book...

<P>The next leg of the campaign commences.  It has been a busy day:
last minute preparations and arrangements to accommodate our new
"fellow travellers".  Joining the crew are five journalists (from
Agence France Presse, the London Times, Channel 9 in Australia
and a French company), and also Mgsr. Gaillot, a French bishop,
Pastor Temarama - a local anti-nuclear campaigner, and Oscar
Temaru, long-time anti-nuclear campaigner and mayor of Faa'a, the
largest town in French Polynesia.  Oscar Temaru also played a
major part in the blockading of Papeete and the anti-nuclear
marches that have paralysed Tahiti over the last week.  He is a
man of great mana (loosely translated as power and charisma)
amongst the Polynesian population.

<P>During the day the ship has received literally wagon loads of
fruit, vegetables and other provisions.  Around three in the
afternoon a crowd of several hundred people gathered on the quay
side, and a long celebration/ceremony ensued to wish us well for
our forthcoming voyage.  A tattooed warrior went around the
crowd, exhorting the people.  Then he called the two priests and
Oscar Temaru to the ship and went through a ceremony to give them
a safe passage on the voyage.  Finally, at around 4.30, the
Rainbow Warrior, bedecked along her rails with the leaves of the
sacred outi tree, slipped her lines and headed out of the harbour 
With the power of many thousands of people in Tahiti - and many
millions of others all around the world - pushing her through
the waves, the Rainbow Warrior has struck a course south-east,
direct to Moruroa.

<P>The local papers in Tahiti are still dominated by
the issue of nuclear testing: President Gaston Flosse has invited
other political leaders, notably Oscar Temaru, to a "picnic" at
Moruroa between July 16-18 to show how "safe" the atoll is.
 
<P>News about demonstrations and activities continue to pour in to
the Rainbow Warrior -- from marches in Copenhagen and Chile to
The Cure denouncing French testing at a rock concert in Belgium
and demonstrations in Mexico.
 
<P>A delegation from Medecines Sans Frontieres, an aid organisation
of medical professionals, has arrived in Tahiti to get a picture
of the health impacts of testing.  They tell me that all the
health authorities they have phoned for meetings or information
have been totally unhelpful.  Meanwhile, our Australian film crew
have had a two hour delay at Customs, only to discover that the
camera gear could not be used until they got on board.  So they had
further entanglements with the bureaucracy here trying to
sort that out.
 
<P>Observers at the nuclear test ban talks in Geneva say that
recent events have hardened anti-testing positions there. 
France has announced the resumption of nuclear testing, the
Chinese tested just three days after the end of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty talks, and the indications are that
both the US and UK are considering resuming tests of low-yield
explosions.  Many non-nuclear states had until recently been
prepared to turn a blind eye to low-yield explosions (say
under 200 tonnes) in order to get a test ban treaty that
included all the nuclear powers.  Now, they feel betrayed by
the nuclear weapon states and feel a treaty that is not truly
"comprehensive" is hardly worth having.  They are demanding
that zero tests means zero, not a "threshold" treaty which
would not impede nuclear proliferation and would permit the
nuclear club to use enhanced technology to develop new nuclear
weapons.
 
<P>Bye for now,

<P>Another barbeque aboard this evening, the second of teh voyage. 
As today has been one of getting down to final preparations and
our appointment at Moruroa draws near, there is a fealling
amongst the crew that this may be possibly our last "social"
event together.  if we look to past experience as a guide, almost
the crew crew were deported in 1992 when the Rainbow Warrior went
to Moruroa, spread around the four corners of the earth!
That was for breaking the 12 mile exclusion zone just to collect
plankton and coral samples to check levels of radioactivity. 
This time, we are on a voyage of protest; the moral issue is
clear: the world no longer wants nuclear weapons.
 
<P>News from France: former President Mitterrand has condemned
Chirac's decision to resume testing.  He too declares that it is
time the nuclear arms race ended.  Why cannot you understand that
too, Mon. Chirac?

<br>Subject: Campaign update </H4><br>
 
<P>The news that former President Mitterrand has publicly condemned
- for the first time since the announcement on June 13 - the
decision by President Chirac to resume nuclear testing is a
boost.  It seems a green light is being given to the Socialist
Party in opposition to really move on this issue.  Already, the
Socialists have endorsed the public campaign by Pacific region
countries to change Chirac's mind, saying they disagree with
Chirac's remarks that such opposition from the Pacific is
"irrational".  
 
<P>It also clearly shows that the old bi-partisan elite consensus on
the need for nuclear testing and deterrence is falling apart. 
Mitterrand not only condemned testing, but said it was time to
end the nuclear arms race.  Hopefully this could signal a growing
debate in France about the role and purpose of nuclear weapons
and the need for nuclear disarmament, not the development of new
nuclear weapons systems.
 
<P>Meanwhile, Greenpeace Italy staged a very dramatic action at the
French Embassy in Rome, with a famous Italian rock star joining
five climbers on the balcony of the embassy to protest nuclear
testing. The protest joins a long list of ones done or planned
world-wide, building up as we approach the 10th anniversary of
the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior and July 14th - Bastille Day.

<head><H4>UPDATE FROM HEREHERETUE - "GREY FRIEND" ON THE HORIZON</H4>

 

 
</head><body><P>
We have been joined by a "friend" keeping a 12 mile distance on
the horizon -- a French warship of some kind (too far away to
identify but probably a frigate).  It is maintaining a steady
distance from us.
 
<P>We have arrived off the island paradise of Hereheretue (population of
approximately 20!), where some of the crew will go ashore to be welcomed by
the inhabitants.  This visit is a courtesy call at the request of the
mayor of the island, as we visited them in 1992 to take some
"control" samples of coral and biota before going on to Moruroa.
 
<P>Hereheretue is a classical coral atoll, a ring of coral with a
few small motu (islands) along the ring covered with coconut
trees. It is a contrast with Moruroa in many ways -- a pacific
island in the real sense of the word, with no installations,
military personnel, reef and lagoon damage etc.
 
<P>The local people are coming out to take us over the reef (the
pass is only about 1.5 metres wide, so the RW is moored
outside), and we will have lunch with them before proceeding
onwards later today.
 
<P>Cheers,
<br>Stephanie

<H4>FRENCH WARSHIP REFUSES CONTACT WITH RAINBOW WARRIOR</H4><body>
 
 
<P>Pacific Ocean, Thursday July 6 1995:- A French warship tracking
the Rainbow Warrior en route to Moruroa atoll has refused to make
either radio or physical contact with the Rainbow Warrior.
 
<P>The vessel, most likely a frigate, has maintained a distance of
between eight and 12 miles from the Rainbow Warrior for more than
24 hours.  This morning, Captain Dave Enever launched an
inflatable to deliver a letter and small gift to the captain of
the navy ship, and also attempted to make radio contact with the
vessel.

<P>The vessel refused to respond to the radio call and steamed
briskly in the other direction at a rate of 20 knots when a
Greenpeace inflatable got within six miles of it.  When it was
clear the French vessel had no intention of permitting the
inflatable to catch up with it, the inflatable was recalled to
the Rainbow Warrior.
 
<P>Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills said the surveillance by the French
navy vessel clearly indicated that the full resources of the
French navy would be deployed against Greenpeace's peaceful
protest.  The vessel failed to comply with international maritime
regulations, as it steamed last night without navigational lights
on, but was clearly visible on the Rainbow Warrior's radar.
 
<P>"We hope that President Chirac is not as deaf to the
international community as this vessel has been to our courtesy
call," she said.  "France's own interests will be endangered if
President Chirac does not steer a course away from nuclear
testing."
 
<P>The letter from Captain Enever to the captain of the naval vessel
read:
 
<P>"From one seafarer to another, I send you and your crew warm
greetings from myself and all on the Rainbow Warrior.  We aboard
the SV Rainbow Warrior bear no ill feelings to you as fellow
human beings; we are in the area to bear witness on behalf of the
people of the South Pacific and the world who oppose the testing
and development of nuclear weapons.  This is not a protest
against France, but against nuclear testing: France's resumption
of nuclear testing could be the excuse for Great Britain, the US
and Russia to resume testing, dangerously undermining progress
towards a comprehensive test ban treaty."

is expected to arrive off the 12 mile exclusion zone around the
test site within the next 72 hours.<br>

<P>Yesterday the ship made a stop at Hereheretue, a beautiful atoll
half way between Tahiti and Moruroa.  This is how Moruroa itself
must have looked once upon a time: the whispering of coconut
palms instead of the roaring of trucks and planes, the distant
pounding of ocean instead of the thunder of bomb tests.
 
<P>The twenty-odd people who live on Hereheretue came out to the
ship to welcome us, and ran several parties ashore through a pass
only 2-3 metres wide!  Ashore, they had prepared the most
wonderful welcome feast, with cooked and raw reef fish, local
fruit and vegetables.  After the meal the mayor sent us on our
way with a very warm and heartfelt speech, wishing us the very
best for our attempts to stop this testing madness, and saying
that the people of Hereheretue might not be with us physically

<P>These people live simple, full and very human lives: yet they
have had to live with the immediate effects of nuclear weapons,
things for which they have no use, and which play no part in
their lives whatsoever.  This is the same pattern across the
Pacific: the people who pay the largest price for nuclear testing
are the ones for whom these weapons are most alien as a way of
conducting relationships.  And the "Great Powers" who construct,
test and threaten to use these weapons claim to represent the
"developed", "civilised" world.  A world that has developed into
collective insanity, perhaps?  Well, it feels like it is time
that those of us - who are after all in the vast majority - 
reasserted human values against the values of the bomb.  Time to
stand up and be counted, as we sail toward the test zone.

<head><P><H4>From:    Greenpeace Vessel SV Rainbow Warrior          
<br>Date:    Friday  7-JUL-95
<br>Subject: Campaign update</H4></head><body>

<P>Nothing to add on the French warship front, all quiet on board.
 
<P>Political news: The Group of 21 non-aligned countries at the
Geneva Conference on Disarmament have launched a critique of
France and China's testing programmes.  They described France's
decision to resume testing as a 'serious setback' for the
Comprehensive Test Ban negotiations, and urged all nuclear weapon
states to observe a moratorium until a CTB enters into force. 
They argue that, consistent with the CD's negotiating mandate,
the CBT should be 'an instrument against both horizontal and
vertical nuclear proliferation and should effectively contribute
to nuclear disarmament'.  They are therefore calling for the
scope of the comprehensive test ban treaty to ban all tests in
all environments.  Reacting to news that the US might look to
exempt low-yield tests from the ban, they have called for a test
ban that really means zero.
 
<P>Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian Foreign Minister told the Conference
on Disarmament that during the Non-Proliferation Treaty talks,
the nuclear powers had agreed to exercise "utmost restraint" on
nuclear testing.  "Therefore we would hardly agree with those who
say that the continuation or resumption of nuclear tests does not
contradict this provision.  The 'utmost restraint' here should be
the same for everyone and all," Kozyrev said. 
  
<P>Sri Lanka and Argentina also criticised China and France.  
Argentina said they hoped that France's decision "will
be the last announcement of any new nuclear tests ever to 
be made."
 
<P>Meanwhile, 113 members of the US House of Representatives on
Wednesday July 5 called on President Clinton to continue
negotiations aimed at a conclusion of a Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).  The letter to the President recommended
that the Administration reject proposals to forgo a CTB and
instead conclude a low-threshold test ban that would allow
continued nuclear testing.
 
<P>"Considering the Administrations's previous review of this issue
and your subsequent commitment to pursue a comprehensive treaty,
we find it disturbing that this issue is being reopened, and that
Pentagon officials reportedly now are being afforded the latitude
to resurrect the threshold issue just as CTB negotiations enter
their decisive phase," said the Democratic and Republican
lawmakers in their letter to the President.
 
<P>The letter also noted that the proposed 500 ton low-threshold
treaty would allow sizable nuclear explosions that could be used
to develop new generations of nuclear weapons.  As the lawmakers
noted, "Recall that a truck bomb loaded with two tons of chemical
explosives - 250 times less than the threshold that some in the
Pentagon now reportedly are proposing to be adopted - was
sufficient to destroy the federal building in Oklahoma City and
severely damaged other buildings in the vicinity."
 
<P>Also on Wednesday, the Chilean Senate passed a draft agreement
expressing its opposition to nuclear testing and urged inter-
parliamentary agreement between other Pacific Rim countries to
consult on the issue.
  
<P>On Easter Island, the President of the Council of Senior Citizens
(Elders) have condemned French tests, saying that they would
"jeopardize all marine life... pollute all our oceanic patrimony
and goes against an ecosystem established for the benefit of 
man".  
  
<P>The Chilean section of the Democratic Association of French 
Citizens in Foreign Countries (ADFE) has categorically condemned 
the resumption of the French nuclear tests and the 
French-Chilean Friendship Corporation said: "We are forced, Mr
President, as defenders of France, its image and its principles
to let you know of our point of view in reference to your recent
decision. Resuming the nuclear tests would give modern Chile a
terrible image of France."
 
<P>National and international unions have also expressed their
opposition to further tests by France at Moruroa. 
 
<P>Bye for now,
Steph on board the Rainbow Warrior</body></html>

<P><H4>HEALTH IN FRENCH POLYNESIA: A MEDICINS SANS FRONTIERES TEAM
QUESTIONS THE EFFECTS OF FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING.</H4>

<P>Although the French authorities affirm that they monitor closely
the effects of their nuclear testing programme on the
environment, they have made no effort to monitor the possible
medical effects on the population of Polynesia.

<P>In early July 1995, a team from the international relief agaency
Medecins Sans Frontieres (<SF) carried out an evaluation mission
in French Polynesia.  The terrirotry has a population of about
200,000.

<P>The MSF team found that the general health of the Polynesian
population, as well as the  level of care to which they have
access, have evolved over the past 30 years in a manner
consistent with the socio-economic development of the Territory.

<P>The team was particularly concerned with the possible medical
effects of exposure to nuclear radiation. MSF examined
information available for two populations: the estimated 8-13,000
Polynesians who have worked at the sites of Moruroa and
Fangataufa since the setting up of the nuclear testing programme;
and the estimated 1,100 inhabitants of Tureia Island and the
Gambier group, who were almost certainly exposed during the
period of atmospheric testing, from 1966 to 1974.

<P>The team did not meet any major obstacles from the authorities.
In spite of this cooperation, however, it was not possible to
gather the relevant epidemiological information.  This was
because certain raw data, as well as the analyses of these data,
currently do not exist either in the Territory or in metropolitan
France.

<P>1.  Cancer statistics.  The official cancer register of French
Polynesia only exists since 30 May 1985. Before that date, no
reliable figures for cancer incidence were kept. Even as late as
1988, the Public Health Department of the Ministry of Health in
Papeete estimated that the sensitivity of the register was quite
low: only 60 percent of cancers were being recorded.  Moreover,
death certificates only became compulsory after 1981 and the
cause of death is not always certified by a doctor.  In summary,
therefore, noone has ever studied the number of cancers occuring
in the Territory before 1985, and even since then, the
information is incomplete.

<P>Given this situation, it is impossible to analyse the incidence
of cancers in the Territory over the nuclear testing period. It
is also impossible to compare cancer death rates with those of
other countries.

<P>2.  Statistics on congenital malformations.  The Public Health
Department of the Ministry of Health confirmed that there is no
official register of congential malformations.

<P>3.  Medical follow-up of populations at risk.  As far as the
mission could determine, no-one has ever conducted medical
follow-up of persons that must be considered especially at risk:
the 8-13,000 former workers at Moruroa and the inhabitants of the
islands of Tureia and the Gambier group.  It is important to
remember that cancers linked to low levels of radioactivity may
appear between 10 and 30 years after exposure.

<P>Given the psychosocial situation in which the nuclear testing
programme is being implemented, the lack of medical data is a
cause for major concern within the Polynesian population.

<P>MSF has neither the means nor the expertise to measure the
environmental risks or consequences associated with the nuclear
tests.

<P>On the other hand, MSF is alarmed by the lack of concern on the
part of the French authorities for the medical effects on the
population exposed.  The inadequacies in the medical data
available do not justify their conclusion that the tests are
harmless.

<P>The French authorities maintain that the level of radiation to
which the population at risk may have been exposed, during the
period of atmospheric tests, was very low.  They maintain that
this level is insufficient to cause negative effects on the
health of individuals exposed.  These conclusions are based upon
surveillance of the environment, not upon surveillance of the
people concerned. The three accidents that are acknowledged by
the authorities to have occurred during the previous tests
reinforce further the need for on-going medical follow-up of the
populations.

<P>The lack of follow-up for persons at risk carries with it another
problem of medical ethics:  it is only by early detection that
any cancers can be treated adequately and hopefully, cured.

<P>Whatever the real level of risk may be in French Polynesia,
Medecins Sans Frontieres considers that the French authorities
are not fulfilling their ethical responsibilities towards the
populations that have been potentially exposed.

<P><H4><head>Stephanie Mills Address at Suva Cathedral, Hiroshima Day, August 6 1995</H4></head>
<body>

<P>Bula [Hello], and greetings from the Rainbow Warrior and her
crew.

<P>It is a privilege to have been asked to speak to you this
morning.  It is an historic day, because today, fifty years ago,
at 8.15 am on a beautiful fine morning like this one, a nuclear
bomb, codenamed "little boy" was dropped on the Japanese city of
Hiroshima. 45,000 people were killed instantly by the heat and
blast from the explosion.  Many people were vaporised, leaving
only their shadows behind. Eye-witness accounts describe
traumatised people wandering around with skin trailing from their
bodies. All recorded pregnancies within a two-mile radius of the
centre of the blast resulted in miscarriage or stillbirth. 4.1
square miles of the city were completely destroyed.  Bomb
survivors called themselves the hibakusha and many are still
affected today. Radiation sickness and cancers over the past
decades as a result of that one bomb put the final estimated
death toll of the Hiroshima bomb at around 200,000 people.

<P>The dawn of the nuclear age, fifty years ago, was well before I
was born.  But the horror of Hiroshima and the threat of nuclear
annilihation of our whole planet has been one of the forces that
has shaped my life.  Because although no bomb has been exploded
in anger more than 2,000 of them have been exploded in nuclear
tests, and there are still the equivalent of 400,000 Hiroshima
bombs in the arsenals of the nuclear powers.

<P>The fact that many of these tests have happened in the Pacific --
named as the ocean of peace, but one which has repeatedly been
scarred by nuclear terror from outside powers -- is something
that I - like many of you, cannot tolerate.  The fact that the
nuclear powers have tested their bombs on the  people of the
Pacific, and their own innocent people, cannot be tolerated. The
fact that the United States -- just to give one example -- a
country committed to democracy and human rights, could have fed
plutonium to children, disabled people, black people, without
their knowledge, to experiment on the effects of radiation, is
intolerable.  To me, one of the worst horrors of the nuclear age
has been this loss of moral integrity, the secrecy and lies of
scientists, politicians, and governments who have put their
nuclear addiction ahead of the lives of their own peoples, who
have put the obscenity of a "nuclear balance of terror" ahead of
the health and survival of the planet; and who are prepared to
leave a legacy of human suffering, genetic damage, birth defects
and environmental pollution for children for many generations to
come.
<P>Challenging the enormity of the nuclear issue is not easy. I
often think of my grandmother, who argued, campaigned, wrote
letters and generally bugged people all her life to try and stop
the nuclear threat.  I remember the women of Greenham Common, who
camped outside the Cruise missile base in Britain  -- accused of
being mad, bad and unpatriotic -- until the missiles were
removed.  I think of Senator Anjain of the Marshall Islands who
fought the might of the US government to get justice for his
people who had been victims of US tests. I remember the hibashuka
of Hiroshima, who even today, in spite of their own ill-health
and the lonng years of campaigning, continue to protest the
nuclear threat.  I remember Fernando Pereira,  murdered ten years
ago when French secret service agents blew up the Rainbow Warrior
in Auckland as she was about to set sail for Moruroa.  And I
remember the people of Tahiti, in their thousands, who camped for
three days and nights on the streets of Papeete when we arrived
there in July, to protest at French testinng.

<P>It can be difficult, frustrating, exhausting and deeply
depressing to do the work we do.  But I would not have it any
other way.  The courage, spirit, good humour and humanity of the
people I work with -- whether it is in Tahiti, in Nevada, Fiji,
in Russia, in Britain or the crew of the Rainbow Warrior --
inspires me to continue.  It keeps me going when the strength of
the nuclear powers seems too much, when being a David against the
Goliath of the superpowers seems not only an impossible task but
a stupidity.

<P>I was asked a few weeks ago what makes people like me and the
crew prepared to bear witness at Moruroa, and put our bodies on
the line to stop French testing.  I don't have a simple answer,
because every person has their own motivation.  But all I can
say, is please dont think that any of us in Greenpeace are
extraordinary.  We are not.  But we believe that TOGETHER we can
change things, and that the "optimism of the action is better
than the pessimism of the thought".  Of course we need to think,
to analyse, to inform ourselves. But to act -- whether it is to
write a letter, make a phone call, organise a meeting, hold a
demonstrtaion, take non-violent aaction -- is to become part of
the solution , rather than part of the problem.

<P>The funny thing is, that it can activism can become a habit.  The
first step is the hardest, but the energy and fufilment that you
get from knowing that what you do is right and important and CAN
help channge things is one of the most satisfying and liberating
experiences you can have.  Being stroppy can become a way of
life!

<P>Today, as we remember the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and
all those affected by nuclear testing and radiation over the past
50 years, I would urge you to join us in the "optimism of
action":  the optimism that indeed we are winning, that we can
make progress and abolish the nuclear threat. We have a choice -
a world free of nuclear weapons or a nuclear-free-for all.
France's decision to resume nuclear testing in our backyard is
the most tangible example of the threat we can all do something
about.  Please join us and millions of people around the world in
opposing that threat, and ACT in your own way -- whether by
letter, lobbying , prayer or protest to stop it. Thank you.

<P><H4><head>Update 7 August 1995</H4></head>
<body>

<P>

The fiftieth anniversary of the first nuclear bomb attack on
Hiroshima marked a growing crescendo of protest against French
plans to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific.

<P>In the week leading up to Hiroshima Day, the Japanese Parliament
unanimously condemned tests by both China and France, naming both
states for the first time.  (Diplomatic etiquette normally
requires refering to countries simply as "a nuclear weapons
state").

<P>A row errupted in Europe as the acting President of the European
Council, Spanish Foreign Minister Solana, backed France's
position at an ASEAN meeting in Brunei, and said Asian nations'
calls for an immediate end to testing were "unacceptable".
Greenpeace called on European governments that had made strong
statements domestically against French testing to clarify whether
the the European Union was representing the views of Europeas, or
the views of President Chirac.

<P>Meanwhile on Hiroshima Day, public protest errupted globally.  In
Moscow, activists  formed a peace symbol in Red Square, while
demonstrators held vigils and demonstrations outside French
embassies in from Budapest to Bonn and from Prague to Peru. In
Paris, demonstrators gathered at the Eiffel Tower to call on
"Hiro-Chirac" to stop the testing.  In response, French
politicians launched an offensive to try and halt the growing
domestic tide of opinion against them, with the French Youth and
Sports Minister writing to sports bodies urging them to "keep
politics out of sport".  Another minister floated the idea of
having seven rather than eight tests, a notion which met a frosty
response internationally.  One New Zealand MP noted:  "It's good
news -- if it means that every week between now and September
France cuts one test, then hopefully there will be none by the
time they were due to start."

<P>Finally, Japanese news reports quoted "informed sources" as
suggesting that China might test around August 15th.  Such a move
would underline the fact that France's decision to resume testing
has given comfort to other nuclear weapons states to continue
with plans to test and modernise new nuclear weapons, betraying
the pledges made at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty talks
just three months ago.

<br>Date:    Received MON 14-AUG-95
<br><H4>UPDATE FROM THE SOUTH PACIFIC</H4></head>
<body>
<P>
 
Two months to the day after President Chirac's decision to resume
French testing, Greenpeace's vessel Rainbow Warrior departed
Suva, Fiji yesterday enroute to joint an international peace
flotilla gathering near Moruroa.  About 200 people gathered on
the dock to say farewell -- with strains of "Now is the Hour" and
traditional Fijian songs of farewell in our ears, we pulled out
on time at 12 noon.
 
<P>Our departure also coincided with protests at the Pacific Games,
which have just begun in Tahiti.  Anti-nuclear activists are
protesting at the Games, and at least four South Pacific
countries are boycotting them.  Meanwhile, 9000 people
demonstrated in Western Samoa at the weekend - a huge turnout for
a nation of around 160,000 people.

<P>President Clinton's announcement on Friday that the U.S. will not
carry out any news nuclear tests is good news.   He has said that
the US will support a comprehensive, zero-yield test ban treaty. 
He has decided to over-rule the military, who wanted low-yield
and hydro-nuclear tests of up to a few hundred tonnes. It's a
pity President Chirac is not paying so much attention to public
sentiment about testing -- although France announced similar
intentions on Thursday, their eight eminent nuclear tests speak
more loudly about lack of commitment to disarmament than any fine
words at the Conference on Disarmament going on now in Geneva.
 
<P>We're motoring into the wind with cloudy skies and a slight
swell.  We expect to arrive in Papeete on August 23rd.

<P>More news as our journey continues.

<P>From:    SV Rainbow Warrior            http://www.greenpeace.org
<br>Date:    MON 14-AUG-95 
<br>Subject: Internet update from Alice Lenney on board the Rainbow Warrior


<P>Back to sea - finally. Heading to Moruroa, by way of Tahiti.
Suva in Fiji was good to us -- very good, and we were sad to
leave all our friends, new and old, on the dockside; but their
powerful farewell gave us strength and courage for the weeks
ahead. 

<P>The time in Suva has been busy: repairs to the Rainbow Warrior
from the ramming by the French naval tug on July 10;
reprovisioning stores and fuel; much of the crew has changed --
only seven of the originals remain; and your humble correspondent
has had his own mission to fulfill, that of re-equipping the ship
with inflatable boats as the French military seized all but one
of the ship's complement after the Moruroa action.  The following
tale illustrates the depth of support for the protest against
nuclear testing in New Zealand.
 
<P>Arriving in Auckland from Rarotonga on a Saturday, by Sunday
morning I had a volunteer assistant who was already supplied with
a list of tasks.  On Monday it became clear that in order to ship
boats and engines to Suva in a container before the Rainbow
Warrior set sail, we had to catch a ship that left on Thursday. 
Last day for accepting freight was Tuesday!  By pleading with the
shipping company, we got an extension till Wednesday morning 10am
for freight acceptance.  So, working flat out until 1 a.m.
Wednesday morning, we loaded and tied down three inflatable
boats, five outboard engines, a dozen fuel tanks, safety
equipment for all those boats and various other items.  This was
all done in a friend's back yard, where the container was
delivered midday Tuesday.  Some of it was equipment requisitioned
from Greenpeace New Zealand, including two old outboard engines
that were part of the original Rainbow Warrior's eqipment and
were rescued from the bombed Rainbow Warrior I.  One engine was
donated by a local outboard shop: built out of parts and 20 years
old, they worked until 8pm Tuesday night to get it ready. It has
since proved to be a very fine machine.  One inflatable boat was
purchased second hand, and also a second hand engine, to give the
Rainbow Warrior a full -- if rather varied -- complement of boats
again.  

<P>People were marvellous, helpful at every possible opportunity. 
Also, because Greenpeace ships are run from Amsterdam, and
everything happened so fast, the container was packed and sent
off before money arrived from the Amsterdam office (they are 12
hours behind NZ time, so Tuesday daytime is Monday night in
Europe).  Things were given to us on credit, so that it wasn't
until later in that week that I could go around and settle the
accounts!  But in New Zealand, and elsewhere in the South
Pacific, this isn't a problem when working on the issue of French
nuclear testing. Business and private individuals alike are
totally enthusiastic in their support.

<P>On returning to the ship (after picking up loose ends and
gettinng together the things that didn't make it into the
container) early the next week, we set about the task of hanging
motors on boats and breathing life into a bunch of old outboards,
ranging from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s.  In spite of their
age, they are as gutsy as any we had on board before, so we feel
well prepared for the voyage to Moruroa.

<P>More as we make our way there -- Alice on board the Rainbow
Warrior.</body></html>

<P>Howling winds and raging seas.  The last two days the ship has
been virtually immobilised by a vicious low pressure system that
has obviously been sent to test our resolve! The old ship
shudders as she crashes into the powerful easterly swells, the
biggest ones knocking us over to a 30 degree roll.  It's at times
like these that a firm grasp on your bunk is required unless you
want to conduct an intimate inspection of the cabin's carpet!
Gecko fingers would definitely be an advantage in this weather. 
At least we've discovered everything that wasn't well tied or
bolted down.
 
<P>Work has come to a virtual standstill.  To stand on the main deck
is to get a brisk saltwater shower every 30 seconds, whilst five
metre swells leer at you threateningly over the rails.  The grey
of the sky merges with the grey of the sea around a indistinct
horizon.  This is not the SOuth Pacific we know and love!  At
lest we have the relative comfort of a larger ship, but
meanwhile, to the south, the yachts of the Peace Flotilla must do
battle with the southern edge of this foul weather.  Brve people
they are too:  its no fun to be at sea in a small yacht in those
conditions.  But we can be sure that they -- just as we -- will
not be discouraged in our task by the weather; and our resolve
and moral strength will be enhanced, not diminished by the trial
of the voyage.  However, as we watch yet anaother wave pound the
bridge windows, one thing we won't lose is our respect for the
power of the sea!

<P>China's 20-80 kiloton test at 0100 GMT on 17 August has raised a
storm of international protest.  Japan is threatening to review
its aid to Beijing, while Indonesia, the Philippines, New
Zealand, Australia and a host of European countries expressed
outrage.  France was strangely silent, remarking that their eight
tests between September and May were somehow "different" from
China's.  In fact, China is planning fewer tests than France in
the next year but the aim is the same: to develop new nuclear
weapons for the 21st century.  Both countries clearly put their
own nuclear arsenals ahead of their international pledges to non-
proliferation and nuclear disarmament, and are thereby risking
the successful conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty.
 
<P>Coming just two days after six leading Greenpeace activists
demonstrated in Tianamen Square in Beijing, the test sparked
protest from Greenpeace around the world:
 

<pre>
 
* the French office had activists chained to the Chinese Embassy
demanding a meeting with the Ambassador.
 
* the Irish office successfully occupied the Chinese Embassy but
were eventually thrown out
 
* the UK office held their demonstration until 4.30 local time,
when CND took over for a 24 hour vigil
 
* the Belgium office held a protest and were granted a meeting
with a Chinese official.
 
* the Norwegian office had 3 people arrested for invading the
Embassy. 
 
* the Chile office have organised a demonstration due to commence
at 1 pm local time.
 
* the Argentinian office have a demonstration planned to begin
at 4 pm local time. 
 
* the US office have a demonstration planned to begin at 2 pm
local time.
 
* the Austrian office will be doing an action tomorrow

* most offices have faxed letters and jammed up the Chinese
Embassy switchboards with phone calls.
</pre>


<P>Meanwhile, Greenpeace Canada accused its government of complicity
in France's nuclear testing programme by continuing to sell
Canadian uranium that can end up in French nuclear bombs.
Greenpeace activists blockaded the gates of the Cameco Uranium
refinery which sends nuclear material to the French nuclear
weapons program. During the protest Greenpeace revealed
documentation of the trail - which includes the Cameco refinery - 
linking Canadian Uranium and French Nuclear weapons.  A poll
released today by Greenpeace shows that 81% of Canadians think
that Canada should suspend nuclear cooperation with France while
that country continues to test nuclear weapons.

<head><H4>Update from Alice and Stephanie - 18 August</H4></head>.
 

<body> 
<P>At least the sun come out today! This miserable weather is
finally subsiding; we managed to do some work today, although it
takes  along time to do a little in these conditions.  However,
by later in the afternoon it was even possible to do a bit on
deck, albeit cowering in the shelter of the foc'sle, as the spray
shot over our heads from the foredeck.
<P>After dinner, an impromptu discussion of boat driving techniques
and a run through some preparatory work that still needs
attention.  Unfortunately, this rough sea has severely disrupted
our work schedule.  Attention to detail is what makes the
difference.  But there is a very experienced crew on  board;
hopefully tomorrow the waves -- now dowm to three metres or so --
will be settled enough for some boat training.
<P>The boat discussion evolves into an exchange of views on the
merits of a consumer boycott of French products.  On the one
haand, the issue about nuclear testing and the development of new
nuclear weapons by the French government and military -- not a
campaign against the French people or France. On the other, it is
a form of protect to which many people can subscribe; nd also
sends a message to France about how strong the feelings of those
from other countries is on this issue.  Economic leverage is also
one of the most powerful forms of pressure in modern materialist
socieites -- there's nothing like a slap on the wallet to make
some people react.  Actions speak louder than words... Yes, but
as long as French people understand that the issue is anti-
nuclear, not anti-French.  The debate goes on...
 
<P>Alice (Richard) Leney, 18 August 1995
 
<P>Update from Steph:
 
<P>Tahitians have brought a case on human rights grounds against
France's nuclear testing programme in the European Commission on
Human Rights this week.  They are arguing that nuclear testing in
French Polynesia threatens their right to life, and their right
to enjoy their homes and environment.  The full case is expected
to be heard in the second week of September.
 
<P>Meanwhile, New Zealand's case against France's resumption of
nuclear tests is due to be lodged in the International Court of
Justice (World Court) in the Hague early next week.  Australia,
Nauru and possibly Denmark and the Philippines are supporting the
case.
<P>At the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva there is renewed
optimism that after President Clinton and France's pledge to
agree a "zero" test ban treaty, that one might be concluded next
year after all.  China's test this week was soundly opposed by
many countries at the CD, and there is increased pressure on
China, the UK and Russia to publicly support a fully
comprehensive test ban treaty as soon as possible -- preferably
by August 24th, when a working group on the treaty negotiations
convenes.
 
<P>Meanwhile, Greenpeace has launched an appeal in Europe for a
peace flotilla to go to Paris on September 1 in solidarity with
the Moruroa flotilla.  The flotilla will meet on the Seine in
Paris near the Elysee (Presidential) Palace, and assist in the
delivery of an international petition signed by millions of
people around the world opposed to nuclear testing.

<P><H4>Alice Leney, August 19
 </H4>
<P>At last the weather is fine enough to get a good day's work in
on deck.  There is always plenty to attend to on a sailing ship,
especially one headaing for the jaws of the French military beast
at Moruroa!  The inflatable boats have taken a bit of a beating
out on deck from the storm, but by the end of today things are
looking much more shipshape.
 
<P>On the daily evening radio schedule we hear from the other boats
of the Peace Flotilla: boats converging on Moruroa from each side
of the Pacific.  Most are makaing good progress; amongst the
crews of the other boats are some friends and acquaintances of
sailors on the Warrior.  It is good to hear that all is well and
send the odd "hello".  Most of these people of the flotilla have
gone to great personal risk and expense to register their
opposition to nuclear weapons tests: knowing that they have the
skills and equipment -- a boat -- to do so, they have gone to sea
not only to express their own feelings but also on behalf of all
those - countless - people who would love to do so if only they
could.  For some the perils of the sea are matched by the
financial perils of the voyage:  one skipper I spoke to in
Auckland needed money for a new radio, but the only way to get
it in the time available was to sell his car.  Then he wouldn't
be able to rung around to do all the other things he needed to
do!  Brave people, who recognise quite clearly that this
particular battle over nuclear weapons effortlessly transcends
the mundane realities of self-interest.  This is nothing if not
a fight represnting a community of interest amongs the peoples
of the world. Already over 150 countries have officially said
"NON!" to President Chirac... This is one issue that is globally
unifying; an issue of true civilisation.  And ultimately a issue
of survival.

<P>More later, 
Alice on board the Rainbow Warrior

 
<P><H4>Update from Stephanie</H4>
 
<P>News today is that the African National Congress has issued a
statement strongly condemning a resumption of nuclear testing in
the Pacific by France. "This action comes at a time when there
is emerging international consensus on the need to stop such
testing and to move towards the elimination of nuclear arms and
technology," the statement said.  " Our new democratic government
has taken an important lead in the recent debates about the
non-proliferation treaty and has been applauded for the example
it has set by unilaterally taking a decision to dismantle South
Africa's nuclear capacity. The development of nuclear bombs and
the continuation of nuclear testing constitutes one of the most
serious threats to humanity and a healthy environment. The ANC
calls upon the French Government to immediately halt this nuclear
testing. The ANC expresses its support and solidarity with all
those organisations who have come out in protest against such
testing."
 
<P>Meanwhile, a Greenpeace protest yesterday in Istanbul against
China's nuclear test earlier this week marked the arrival of the
Greenpeace ship "Altair" in Turkey.  Forty activists were held
and interrogated, but later released, by the Turkish police
outside the Chinese embassy in Istanbul.  The Altair is on an
anti-nuclear tour in the Mediterranean Sea. The tour will
continue until mid-November, visiting Israel, Cyprus, Lebanon,
Greece, Italy, Tunisia, France and Malta to mobilise public
opinion against nuclear testing and in favour of nuclear
disarmament.

<P>The Pacific is finally beginning to live up to its name; sea and
wind are slowly subsiding to the conditions we know and love.
While the South Pacific can have its hurricane rages, for the
most part it is a pleasant, sunny place.
 
<P>The people of the islands of the South Pacific are, for the
most part, of a similar temperament.  Their values are intensely
human; their relationships with others genuine; and what counts
is the person you are, not your position in life or the way you
dress.  These are the last people in the world who would have use
for nuclear weapons, yet they have borne the brunt of the nuclear
states' weapons tests for the past 50 years.  

<P>Still today, in the Marshall Islands, at Christmas Island in
Kiribati, in Australia and in French Polynesia, the arrogance of
those who seek power through the most abominable means ever
conceived must be suffered.  That such a gentle, peaceful part
of the world should be subjected to the fancies of some of the
most misguided - yet clever - minds on the planet would be
farcical if the consequences were not so horrendous.  All in the
name of "civilisation".  All in all, a rather strange idea if you
look at some of the governments who claim to be civilised!
 
<P>Still, soon the Pacific will really regain its peace, and the
bombers will be sent on their way home.  The power of the will
of the world's people cannot be stopped by a tiny coterie of
megalomaniacs - surely?  If you agree, make sure they know:
protests, letters, boycotts, whatever you thing best.  Every
little thing counts!  (Editor's note--send an E-mail to the
French and Chinese governments and let them know that their
nuclear testing program are unacceptable!)
 
<P>More later.

<P><H4>Update from Stephanie Mills, Anti-nuclear campaigner on the
Rainbow  Warrior:</H4>

<P>We will be arriving in Tahiti tomorrow, will meet up with co-
workers on the ground there and will hold a press conference at
11:30 to let everyone there know our plans.
 
<P>The Greenpeace yacht Vega has just arrived off the 12-mile
exclusion zone at Moruroa, to re-join the Danish vessel Bifrost
which remains out there.  The vessels are monitoring the
situation at the test site, alert for any sign of an early
nuclear test by the French at the atoll.  Media reports have
speculated that France might test earlier than the September
timetable set by President Chirac, to ignore possible disruptions
from an international flotilla of peace vessels which will arrive
there in early September.
 
<P>Meanwhile, between 25-30 vessels are en route to Moruroa, while
a European flotilla plans to sail up the Seine to Paris, arriving
on September 1st in solidarity with the Moruroa fleet.
 
<P>In Tahiti, activists are preparing for a major demonstration on
Saturday August 26th, which has been called by the main
Protestant church, the Eglise Evangelique, and is supported by
the coalition of anti-nuclear groups there, Te Ihutai No te Hau.
 
<P>In further international protests against France's proposed
testing programme, the head of UNESCO, Director General Federico
Mayor, has criticised France and urged it to join a global
moratorium.  In Norway, anti-nuclear activists from the group
Green Warriors, staged a protest outside the French Embassy,
while the French cosmetics group Yves Rocher took out full page
advertisements in Germany on August 19, declaring itself against
nuclear testing.

<P>In Australia, trade unions have widened their industrial action
against services to French embassies and consulates to include
the Chinese embassy, after last week's test. Meanwhile, New
Zealand has lodged its case against France in the International
Court of justice in the Hague, while French Greens protested
against President Chirac outside his holiday retreat on the
French Riviera yesterday.

<P>More as we make our way to the test site.

<P>A lush tropic island faintly stains the horizon to the south-
east, notifying us that tomorrow morning we shall be in Papeete
harbour nestling under the verdant green mountains of Tahiti.

<P>The island of Tahiti is very steep, with only the coastal fringes
supporting human settlements.  Tahiti is one of the Society
Islands, so called by Captain Cook because of the warmth and
sociability of its people.  Today they are still warm and
friendly but their good humour has been tried, both
psychologically and physically, by the pollution of nuclear bomb
testing.  However, they are fighting hard - and have been for
many, many years -- to end this maelevolence.
<P>As we are due in port tomorrow morning, we must prepare the ship
after the voyage.  Things are stowed neatly again after the
disturbances of the storm; the decks are scrubbed and hosed; and
the mooring lines snake out of their nest (though unfortunately
not under their own steam -- they are heavy ropes) and find their
places around the bollards fore and aft.  The alley ways are
given a good clean and everything generally gets a dash of spring
cleaing in readiness for the inevitable rush of visitors that
Tahiti will bring -- assuming the authorities let us in.

<H4>From: From Stephanie Mills aboard Greenpeace Vessel SV Rainbow Warrior

<P>South Africa has expressed grave concern about the effect of
China's nuclear test last week on the pace of nuclear disarmament
by the nuclear powers.  It said the test could lead to non-
nuclear countries showing renewed interestt in developing their
own nuclear weapons.  Meanwhile, the South Pacific Forum, which
has spear-headed regional protest at testing at Moruroa, has also
condemned China's test.
 
<P>Meanwhile, the Prime Ministers of Australia and the Philippines
President met in Canberra yesterday to discuss both China's test
and France's plans to resume testing next month.  France has
called on Australia and New Zealand not to protest against French
testing any more strongly than they have against the Chinese
tests, threatening that Paris would "ill understand" it if
Australia and NZ reactions were stronger to French tests than to
China's test.  This follows threats of economic retaliation by
France against Australia because of public boycotts there of
French goods.
 
<P>President Chirac has suffered another blow to his popularity,
with the latest opinion polls in France showing 55 percent of
voters were confident Chirac could deal with France's major
problems, down from 61 percent in May when he took office. Those
lacking confidence in him leapt from 24 percent in May to 37
percent in August.
 
<P>A Fijian vessel chartered by Fijian anti-nuclear groups, the
Caunitoni, left Suva tonight, while a traditional canoe from the
Cook Islands, Te Au o te Tonga left Rarotonga yesterday (August
21) to sail for Moruroa to join the international peace flotilla. 
Meanwhile, Parliamentarians for a Nuclear Free Pacific, which had
hoped to organise a vessel of international MPs, is now focussed
on activities in Papeete on September 2nd and 3rd.  The Japanese
Finance Minister, Masayoshi Takemura, along with Australian, New
Zealand, Italian, German, British, Danish, Norwegian and other
MPs will gather in Tahiti on the 2nd of September for a rally and
protest. 
 
<P>In Britain, a coalition of anti-nuclear groups has launched an
advertising campaign urging consumers to boycott French wines. 
Britain is the second largest importer of French Bordeaux wines,
with 17 percent of volume and sales.  In Japan, a citizens groups
have demanded that Japan cancel its bilateral nuclear agreements
for plutonium reprocessing with France because of the possible
use of Japanese nuclear material in France's military programme.
A report commissioned by the groups says that France does not
distinguish nuclear power's civilian use from its military use,
and that plutonium extracted from Japanese spent fuel could be
used for nuclear warheads to be tested next month at Moruroa.

<P>The Rainbow Warrior arrived in Papeete today, docking at 10am.
The captain Jon Castle was handed a copy of a decree banning
vessels entering the 12 mile exclusion zone around Moruroa, and
three crew members -- Stephanie Mills, Philip Pupuka and Derek
Nicholls, who were on the Rainbow Warrior when it breached the 12
mile zone in 1992 -- were banned from going ashore.

<P>The crew were welcomed by local anti-nuclear leaders, afterwards a press
conference attended by 120 local and international TV crews
and journalists crowded onto the bridge.  Members of the
crew visited the peace village in the main Place Tarahoi at 4pm
this afternoon and got a very warm welcome (and fresh loads of
bananas and other tropical fruit!) from local activists.

<P>The Rainbow Warrior will be departing tomorrow at 2pm local time
and is expected to arrive at Moruroa on August 27 or 28.  The
crew will include a farmer from the Larzac region of France, a
Tahitian activist, 10 journalists from France, Germany, Japan,
Australia and Britain, and two additional crew, bringing the
total to 37.  Five of the journalists will transfer to other
Greenpeace vessels at Moruroa. The campaigners on board are
Stephanie Mills and Jean-Luc Theirry.

<P>Two other yachts will also be leaving Tahiti for Moruroa
tomorrow; the Fijian vessel Kaunitoni departed from Fiji
yesterday, and the total number of vessels en route to Moruroa
reporting in to a daily radio schedule is now 30.

<P>In a dusty park, under some huge shady fig trees, right in the
centre of Papeete you can find the Tahiti Peace Village.  Three
traditional houses, built of local materials -- coconut woven
matting and palms -- stand in the space between the local
Territorial Assembly building and the French High Commission,
challenging the legitimacy of these institutions in the most
peaceful way possible.  Lines of brightly coloured red, yellow
and black flags flutter in the breeze, and anti-nuclear slogans
fall from the boughs from which they are hung.  The Peace Village
has been manned day and night since July 3rd, when it was
established after a three day blockade of Papeete.  The group who
has maintained this vigil is the local organisation Hiti Tau, an
environmental and anti nuclear group.
 
<P>The crew -- those allowed off the boat who don't have exclusion
orders banning them from setting foot on French Polynesian soil -
- were invited to the Peace Village for a ceremony on Wednesday
afternoon:  a huge pile of fruit and vegetables was laid out on
banana leaves and in baskets woven from cocnut palms.  This was
the produce of the hands and gardens of the Maohi people of
Tahiti-Polynesia, and was presented to us, along with bunches of
sacred alpi leaves, to feed us and protect us on our journey.  A
representative of Hiti Tau has joined us on the ship too, an
illustration of our shared task: to stop this nuclear testing
once and for all.

<P>The Rainbow Warrior left Papeete at 2pm local time this afternoon
and is proceeding south-east from Tahiti towards Moruroa.  Our ETA
off the 12 mile zone is late Saturday August 27 local time.

<P>We have 37 people on board, including 10 journalists, five of
whom will be transferred to the MV Greenpeace when we rendezvous
with them on the 27th.   Our communications systems are therefore
very overloaded, so please bear with us if you
have trouble calling in to the ship.

<P>The crew include Roger Teaotea of Hiti Tau, an anti-nuclear group
in Tahiti and Joseph Bove of the Larzac farming region, who has
been active in successfully opposing French military plans to
establish a missile test base in the region over the past decade.
His group has been visiting Tahiti in solidarity with the people
of Polynesia who are trying to get rid of nuclear testing on
their soil.
 
<P>The French military have been reported as saying that they will
not permit Greenpeace vessels to even cross the 12 mile zone, let
alone enter the lagoon at Moruroa.  Some journalists are being
flown to Moruroa this weekend but on the understanding that they
will leave the atoll before a test takes place.  There are many
conflicting rumours about when the first test will occur.  In the
meantime, the large demonstration planned for Saturday (August
26) by the Eglise Evangelique (Protestant Church) and other
groups will coincide with the visit by the Minister of Overseas
Territories, M. Perretti to Tahiti to attend the closing
ceremonies of the South Pacific Games.

<P>A superb morning: calm seas, clear skies and the sun waiting to
rise in the east.  Scanning the horizon for the exact place where
the sun would rise from the ocean, we beheld a precious and rare
thing: for half a second an intense blue then green point of
light; a moment later the orange sun rose out of the sea.  This
is the legendary green flash. A very fortunate morning to decide
to check the bearing of sunrise.

<P>This afternoon, boat training again.  A chance too, for some of
our new shipmates (the ship's complement has swelled from 19 to
37) to experience the Rainbow Warrior sailing on the
ocean.  And a glorious sight it is too, especially on such a
lovely day as this.  A more incongruous setting than the South
Pacific as a place to develop bombs to kill millions at the push
of a button would be hard to find.

<P>The Solomon Islands, Western Samoa and Australia formally
supported the New Zealand Government's case against French
testing to the International Court of Justice in the Hague this
week.  Greenpeace applauded their decision to support the case,
saying it was turning protest into legal action, and urged Japan
and Peru to follow suit.
 
<P>Meanwhile, members of the European Commission have met with French
authorities to discuss whether France's programme of testing at
Moruroa breaches their obligations under the European nuclear
treaty, Euratom.  The Treaty requires environmental impact
assessements and monitoring of particularly dangerous activities
by the Commission: France has not previously submitted
detailed information about whether or not it complies with the
Treaty to the Commission.
 
<P>Meanwhile, a French military vessel today visited the NZ
Government vessel Tui to give them a copy of the decree
suspending the right of innocent passage within the 12 mile zone
around Moruroa and Fangataufa.  Vessels of the peace fleet may
also be delivered copies of the decree as they arrive, and the
Rainbow Warrior was also given a decree banning air flights over
the exclusion zone to an unlimited height before leaving Papeete.
 
<P>The Cook Islands traditional voyaging canoe arrived in Papeete
yesterday along with its government support vessel.  A New
Zealand vessel, Aquila d'Oro is expected to arrive in Papeete
tomorrow, and another flotilla craft, the New Zealand catamaran
Triptych will be at the 12 mile zone by early next week.

<P>Rendezvous at Moruroa, and the shape of things to come.  Mid-
morning some twenty miles off the atoll, and the Vega, Bifrost
and Rainbow Warrior are tied up together, hove to.  The New
Zealand naval vessel Tui also steams close by, but under orders
from the New Zealand government no to communicate with
Greenpeace, she soon sails away.  The Bifrost, a 45 foot replica
of a Viking longboat, has been in the area now for some 45 days,
standing sentinel while the Vega and Rainbow Warrior withdrew to
organise our next moves.  The three crew on board  - two Danes
and an Ozzie -- are very glad of fresh fruit and veg, a hot
shower and a glass of beer!  Vega has been back on station at
Moruroa for a week or so, after a break in Papeete.  Of course
our usual minders are also present, two French warships, although
they decline to join in the general bon hominie.

<P>The morning is spent transferring food, fuel and water supplies on
the calmest seas: nature smiles on us yet again.  After a laid-
back afternoon (it is Sunday!) where everyone sat around on the
Rainbow Warrior and caught up with each other; a barbeque on the
bridge deck rounds the day off nicely.  WIth the three boats tied
together in a long line, the sailors can relax for a while as
drift.  But the party ends early: with the weather closing in and
the warships continually steaming back and forth close by, it is
not easy to forget why we are here.  The MV Greenpeace is only
hours aaway and more boats will araive over the next few days. 
The heat is on Mon. Chirac.  Why not be a real statesman, a true
democrat and listen to the people?  Stop the tests NOW.

<P>The Rainbow Warrior made a rendezvous with the Viking ship Bifrost at
8am local time and the Vega at 9am.  With two French warships,
the frigate Prairial and the fast attack patrol vessel Tapaguese
circling them all day, the three yachts tied up to each other and
spent the day re-supplying the two small yachts.  This evening,
the three crews held a barbeque on board, closely monitored by
the two warships.

<P>Over the past week, sightings of flares and objects consistent
with a submarine have been noticed by mates on watch. Today, a
French journalist asked the captain of the Prairial whether a
submarine was operating in the area.  He replied:  "That is not a
good question, I refuse to answer that question."
 
<P>Meanwhile, the MV Greenpeace is approaching the three vessels
from the north east, and will rendezvous at dawn tomorrow.  The
Greenpeace has been buzzed by a French military helicopter and is
being shadowed by two additional warships.

<P>The New Zealand naval vessel Tui is also in the vicinity.  The

the New Zealand government is still refusing to let journalists
on board the Tui contact Greenpeace.  Another New Zealand peace
flotilla vessel Triptych is expected to arrive off the atoll in
the next 2 days.

<P>The flotilla is growing by the day now, with the arrival of the
MV Greenpeace this morning.  It certainly didn't please the
French navy to discover that the helicopter that came with it
could out perform the one on their ship!  The crews of the four
vessels here - Rainbow Warrior, Vega, Bifrost and Greenpeace --
get together for some fraternising. Old friends from across the
world are coming together here in this obscure corner of the
Pacific, driven by their determination to end this nuclear
delirium.

<P>The MV Greenpeace is a beautiful old ship: built in 1958 in
Holland as a tug it was the largest tug in the world at the time. 
She is a very well equipped, comfortable ship, that is
affectionately known as the "Black Pig" among her crews;  her
appearance does lend itself to a porcine interpretation with her
blunt, up-turned nose.

<P>The Frech have also joined the Peace Flotilla in a big way: they
have brought four warships and a couple of helicopters along! 
Can't see any banners hanging off the side of their ships though,
but give them a few days and maybe they'll get it together!  We'd
like to get together and talk to them, but their radio
communications always seem a little stiff.  Let us hope that soon
they will see the error of their ways.

<P>FROM THE EXCLUSION ZONE:
 
FRENCH MILITARY SURVEILLANCE STEPPED UP AS GREENPEACE VESSELS
                    MEET OFF MORUROA
 
 
<P>As the MV Greenpeace made a rendez-vous with the SV Rainbow
Warrior and Vega 25 miles north west of the Moruroa nuclear test
site today, the French military authorities stepped up
surveillance of the Greenpeace fleet.
 
<P>A Greenpeace helicopter shooting film footage was pursued in a
brief cat-and-mouse chase by a French military helicopter, while
two frigates and a fast attack patrol vessel closely circled the
Greenpeace ships.
 
<P>The three Greenpeace vessels met outside the test site at 1000
local time, accompanied by the Danish vessel Bifrost.  
 
<P>Meanwhile, in Paris yesterday prominent scientists accused France
of lying or concealing information about the environmental
dangers of nuclear testing.  French and British scientists
attending a Greenpeace press conference said the only question
was how long it would take for leakage to occur.
 
<P>Greenpeace also yesterday published an advert in Le Monde,
appealing to French companies avoid a damaging boycott of French
products by the international community by urging President
Chirac to reverse his decision to resume nuclear testing.
 
<P>Finally, Defence Minister Charles Millon reiterated last night
on French television that France would begin its testing
programme as early as September 1.

<P>From Stephanie, temporarily on the MVGP Greenpeace for morning
tea!

<P>Dear all,

<P>NB WE ARE NOW OPERATING ON TAHITI TIME ie 12 hours behind Central
European Time.

<P>Vessels are starting to arrive at the 12 mile zone -- in spite of
a fairly breezy day with a moderate swell, it is great to see all
the white sails arriving on the horizon.

<img align=top src="rw159t.gif" alt="GP activists debate tactics.">65KB GIF</a>
or <a href="rw159.jpg">23KB JPG.</a> Greenpeace/Morgan  

<P>The Cook Islands vaka (traditional canoe) with its escort vessel,
the Cook Islands government patrol boat Te Kukupa arrived around
8am this morning.  The Te Kukupa was warned about entering the 12
mile zone by a French warship.

<P>The NZ trimaran Triptych has also arrived off the 12 mile zone. A
French patrol vessel called it up around 9am to say it wanted to
deliver a letter about the exclusion zone restriction. The
Triptych said it would accept the letter on the condition that
the French vessel would take one from those on board to President
Chirac protesting the tests.

<P>A single-hander Chilean vessel the Bebinka has arrived, along
with the French yacht Kidu; both have come from the Gambier
Islands south-east of Moruroa.

<P>The Ukrainian yacht Lelitka is also around, as is the Bifrost and
Vega.  Quite a party.

<P>There are two frigates, the Vendemiarie and the Prairial still
with us, and we have just put the helicopter up to make a
reconaissance and film from outside the 12 mile zone of the
atoll.   Two French military helicopters were immediately put in
the air to closely monitor the Greenpeace chopper, but one has
since landed back on the Vendemiaire.  Other French patrol
vessels are also around monitoring the flotilla.

Rainbow Warrior Captain Jon Castle has locked himself up in the crow's nest with a radio and is in contact with the MV Greenpeace.  Meanwhile two of the inflatables have made it into the Moruroa lagoon and two Greenpeace divers are now in the water under the test platform.  MV Greenpeace campaigner Xavier Pastor has told the French military that they cannot go ahead with the test with the divers in the water.  The test, we understand, is imminent. </body></html>

<head><title>Friday 1st September - Diary</title></head><body>


<H4>Friday 1 September</H4>
<P><font size=+1>2.30am</font>         Manuel, Joseph and Olivier launch in the first
inflatable, with no lights. The French frigate Prairial seems to
take little notice.

<P><font size=+1>3am:</font>       Alice and Kate, Mimo and Raoul, Paul and Roger launch,
again little attention from the Prairial.

<P><font size=+1>3.30am:</font> Sarah and Morai, Todd and Gilly launch. The crane
breaks down on the last launching - Gaia on our side again! 
Derek reports the hangar doors on the Prairial's heli deck appear
to be open.  Little bit of stress as Todd's boat refuses to go
into forward gear.  Lots of shouting from the bridge and between
them and Morai. It's finally sorted - a rope around the prop.

<P>Lines from the bow and stern are lowered.
Jon leaves.  I ask Tim to alert Taupo Maritime Radio that we may
want to speak to them later.

<P>Around 4.45:          Warnings from the Prairial as we cross the
line.  At least two warnings about use of force. Alert to
Reuters, and Tahiti Team.

<P>We also hear the Vendemiaire warning the MV that Tweety is inside
the zone.  I tell Thomas.  the MVGP is also trying to call the
Vega. No response from what I can hear.

<P><font size=+1>5.20</font>        We're boarded: one inflatable with a dozen commandos
comes over the starboard side. They get a ladder up but it nearly
falls off/crushes the third guy, who has to do a somersault into
the boat, so after that they just pile on.  The first thing they
do is clear everyone away from the bridge windows and spray paint
the windows with green, grey and orange paint.  Then they take
grinders to the doors - from the film in the radio room all we
can see is massive sparks flying everywhere.  The camera is
knocked out of Tim's hand so we lose our vision from outside the
bridge.
<P>They get into the bridge and then seem not to know exactly what
to do.
<P>Derek says they then went with grinders to the front hatch door
on the lower deck, the bridge hatch and the engine hatch (aft). 
The front hatch has a crude half circle burnt in it. I haven't
seen the bridge hatch but they didn't get through it.  They got
in the engine hatch and then got Rob out and disabled the engine. 
It's unclear exactly what they did but they seem to have caused
considerable damage to the propellor controls.
Meanwhile, one of the guys burning through one of the doors
caught himself afire.  He was wearing just commando overalls, not
proper protective gear.  Helene Crie from Liberation said he
dived over the side of the boat into the water; then a zodiac
came alongside, didn't see him and hit him in the head!  I guess
he got taken home as a war casualty!  Another commando who was
very grumpy with us all day and spent a lot of time guarding the
front hatch also burnt himself and had a finger bandage.

<P>Meanwhile, I'm in the radio room talking to Reuters.  First the
inmarsat goes dead.  Taupo asks if they should state an
emergency. Tim says negative.  Tim tries to get the squisher
going, but the line just rings in London. He calls Comms, gets
through, shouts at them, tries to squish again.  The line is cut,
the lights flicker.  We lose Taupo radio, they must have cut the
radio antennae.  I'm still talking to Jon on the VHF, the
commadnos are grinding the radio room door and there is a lot of
banging and crashing going on.  We have gas masks around our
necks in case of tear gas, but its stiflingly warm and by now I
guess that they will not need gas.

<P>Tim switches to channel 16 VHF and declares an emergency - PAN,
PAN, PAN PAN, This is the SV Rainbow Warrior.  The French
commandos have taken over our ship, they have taken our safety
communications and disabled our ship, they are cutting it up, PAN
PAN..."

<P>I keep talking to Jon, who is also talking to the MV.  He can't
hear Derek anymore, but then tells us he is on deck with Rob. I'm
relieved. Jon is still talking to the MV, and they have not been
boarded yet when three commandos break in through the radio room
door and the black polythene we have taped over the entrance. 
They go for Tim and Pierre-Emmanuel then try to grab the VHF mike
out of my hand.  I struggle with them, trying to keep the
transmit button down and shouting to Jon, until they pull it so
hard they break it off its cable.  

<P>They lift the three of us out of the radio room and on to the
foredeck.  Clearly they have had instructions to be gentle with
us - the captain (Laurent ISZARD(?), according to the paper they
wanted us to sign this morning) - keeps saying "doucement,
doucement".  I burn my arm on the still-hot radio room door that
they have drilled right through with a grinder as they cart me
out of the room by my wrists and ankles, like a sack of potatoes.

<P>On the bow are all the journalists, three visitors and PHilip,
Rob and Derek.  They put the three of us on the lower deck. It's
chilly in the early morning breeze, flat out on the cool iron of
the deck and I'm lying in a squalid pool of oil from the broken
crane.

<P>Meanwhile, Tweety is overhead, with Paula making spectacular
passes over the boat, pursued by two French Super Puma
heliopters. Tony is filming frantically.  We hear later that they
get all the footage back and squished (making two tape drops)
flying for 3 and a half hours before landing back on the mVGP.

<P>An hour or so later, some of the commandos get called off to go
and intercept another inflatable -- they must be inside the
lagoon by now, so we feel heartened about that.

<P>As usual, chaos and indecisiveness then hits them. We spend hours
just sitting on the deck chatting, winding them up by asking for
food, toliets etc and refusing to be interrogated.  They escort
us everywhere and don't allow us to go on the bridge.  At one
point they tell me that if I go up and talk to the people on the
foredeck that I can't come back down to the lower deck.  I laugh.
And ask half way up the stairs to the bow whether I should be
going up or down.  ANyway, Philip is OK (the reason I go up) -
they let him get his malaria pills. Eni seems happy, Oscar and
Vito are cool, they get stuck into the pamplemousse and bananas
and have water and fruit juice.

<P>We have no idea what is happening, so I get the emergency food
supplies out of the radio room (which freaks them out!) and we
settle down on deck.

<P>After midday, they decide to put us under tow.  The Centaure
comes over with a light looking tow rope, which surprise,
surprise breaks within an hour in a great creak and snapping. 
They come over later with a wire cable more suited for ocean
towing.  Rob is scathing about their skills, saying if they were
a commercial towing operation they would have lost the job by
now.

<P>The journos get bored pretty quickly, and start hassling the
military to get back to Moruroa.  Jean-Marc is great.  Eventually
they process the journalists (about 11am?) and I think they will
go soon. But no. Midday or so, we hear on Radio Australia (Tim
Lambon still has his radio) that the MVGP has been seized as
well. A reporter on the Tui says they heard their MAYDAY from the
radio room, as they were being boarded by commandos from
helicopter.  They also say that Jon is still up the crow's nest. 
It's rather hilarious that the rest of the world knows via radio
news that Jon is still on the boat, while the French military
still haven't worked this out.  Instead, they accuse Derek and
then Tim (both bearded) of being the captain.

<P>The journos manage to negotiate using Christophe's $15000
portable sat com phone. It's rather surreal sitting on the lower
deck hearing Christophe's distinctive German echoing overhead
(he's on the bridge), but comforting the rest of the world now
know where we are. Andy is pleased because he calls ITN in time
to get live on the late news.  Tim calls Comms and also talks to
Reuters. Blair tells him the divers did get into the lagoon and
under the barge.
Still no sign of getting us off the ship.

<P>At about 5pm they ask if the crew will transfer to Moruroa, or
stay with the ship, be towed with it to Hao and then flown to
Tahit.. We agree that until we know the whereabouts and status of
both the rest of our crew and captain, we will stay with the
ship.  They refuse to say anthing about them, just say we have 30
seconds to make up our mind.  We stay.  Later they tell us the
rest  of the crew will be flown to Tahiti early tomorrow and get
there at 5am.  We ask what the MVGP is doing - they say the crew
will stay with the ship too.

<P>By this time we are all pretty hungry after just fruit and nuts,
bananas and chocolate all day. So I get some crackers, cheese,
olives etc together, Andy or Christophe pulls out a plastic water
bottle of whisky and we declare cocktail hour. We're all too
tired to drink but a couple of the journos manage it.

<P>Sometime after 10.30pm, all of us crew are completely zonked out
and have been allowed to go to our cabins to sleep.  At midnight,
they transport the seven journos and 3 visitors to Moruroa on
board the tranpsort vessel.</body></html>

<head><title>Saturday September 2nd - Diary</title></head>
<body><H4>Saturday September 2nd</H4>

 <P> I wake fully dressed at 5.15am, and then again at 8.15am. We're
still under tow, going around in circles outside MOruroa!! 
WIthout them having worked out how to get the steering or the
engines operating, they probably don't think its safe to tow us
to Hao, and even then they would have the problem of what to do
with the ship.

<P>We clean up the mess and the deck.  Rob and Derek have both had
contact with Jon via hand signals and the odd shout this morning.
He's OK.

<P>At about 11am we're off the pass at Moruroa.  There is the
rectangular striped tower north of the pass, looks like its on
the end of the reef but it could be behind it.  THere is another
rig, the triangular red and white one working in the south west
corner (intially it looks as if its actually otuside the Lagoon,
but that is just because the reef is very low there).  There is
water or some other liquid being pumped out the back of the rig. 
Its either at the stage of still drilling OR putting the concrete
in over the top of the warhead.

<P>There is also a white barge with containers on it that is in the
mouth of the pass, could be buoyed.

<P>Around 12 noon: The commandos have realised that something is
going on in the crow's nest.  Derek has asked earlier whether he
can go up the mast to do some repairs to the radar, but this has
been refused "because Greenpeace is claiming that someone is up
there".  Eventually, the commandoes get out the fire hose and
seem to be prepared to hose Jon down.  Unfortunately for them,
Rob has turned off the pressure in the foc'sle, so the water
rushes out the chain locker, and there is only a miserable spray
of water coming out the fire hose.  They give up on that and call
up the Centaure, which comes alongside a bit.  We're worried the
tug might use high pressure hoses on Jon.

<P><font size=+1>12.30pm</font>        Jon shouts out that he will come down, but only
with the assistance of his crew, not with them.  After a bit of
wrangling they agree to this.  Derek and Philip get the bosun
chair rigged and I sneak out the camera that Tim has found (its
Gilly's).  I get a great picture as Jon is halfway down the mast,
but it's taken too much time to focus, and the commando captain
is alerted. As he and another commando jump me, I push the camera
down my front.  They pull both my arms behind my back and force
me face down on to the deck, grab the camera from under me and
the commando throws it over the side.  The captain is not too
brutal but the other guy is only too pleased to twist my arm and
sit on me.  They push the rest of the crew back inside, Jon
shouts at them.

<P><font size=+1>1pm</font>        Jon is down. They send their own commando up the mast
in an incredibly uncomfortable looking plastic strap harness
because they can't work out how to get into the bosun's chair. 
He gets a bucket sent up and they lower the steering controls and
Jon's bag down the mast.  They seem triumphant to have found the
controls, because they still haven't worked out how to get the
steering operational.

<P>The day drags on.  They take Jon up onto the bridge to be
interrogated, and then into the office.  I make some pasta for
lunch around 3pm, the first real meal we have had for 36 hours.

<P><font size=+1>4.30pm </font>         Jon is still being questioned.  We are still off
Moruroa.  Jon says they tell him that the MVGP crew refused to
leave the ship at Moruroa, but most of them were taken off with
just a few key people left on board.  Jon is charged with
crossing the 12 mile limit, not obeying navy orders to stop, and
says they are seizing the ship on the basis of Customs
infractions relating to the entry into territorial waters of our
inflatables without Customs authorisation!

<P><font size=+1>8pm ish </font>         We're finally going somewhere - heading north away
from Moruroa. The commandos have left.  We end up having quite a
cheerful if robust conversation with them before they leave. 
One, the guy who has acted as their chef, sports a t-shirt which
I first think is mufti, and then he tells me is a special unit t-
shirt, limited edition.  It has "Nautile 1995" (the name of the
operation against Greenpeace) and the unit insignia on the front,
and on the back -- a picture of the Rainbow Warrior!  Bizarre. 
We try to get him to do a swap, which he is quite happy to do,
but the commando captain forbids it.    As they leave, one of the
commandos tells Pierre-Emmanuel that we're right, and we're doing
a good job.

<P>One of the customs officers that comes on is Tahitian.  When I
greet him in Tahitian, he starts talking to me in Tahitian... I
tell him I can't really speak the language, but it seems to have
been an entre, because he comes over surreptiously and asks us
how the Tavana (Oscar) is.  He says Papeete has been blocked for
the last 24 hours while Oscar has been on the ship and detained.

<head><title>Sunday September 3 - Diary</title></head><body>
<H4>Sunday September 3</H4> 
<P><font size=+1>0700</font>      We start hassling the gendarmes about our status, as
the garde a vue has technically expired.  We demand communication
with our lawyer, Tahiti, our families.  Finally, they say we're
"free", but as the ship is seized we cannot leave and cannot go
to the radio room, bridge or engine room, and cannot communicate
with the outside world.  

<P><font size=+1>0800</font>        They've locked up the radio room door, but not very
effectively, and they are pretty loose now about guarding it.  So
Tim gets the door open and passes me out bits of radio, which I
smuggle under the bedsheets in my cabin.  We don't know whether
we've got enough or the right bits to set up communication but
its worth a try.

<P>Derek makes peanut brownies. I'm bored. The Tahitian customs
officer gives us a few lessons in Tahitian -- We're going to Hao,
the food is good etc.

<P>Around midday they tell us that we are now "under military
authority" and that they have had formal authorisation to use
force against us if necessary.  Later in the afternoon they tell
us that we will be permitted a communication with our lawyer, but
only indirectly -- we must write a letter which will then be
transmitted via military radio to Moruroa and then to Papeete.

<P>We write out a text:

<pre>Sunday 3rd September 1430 Moruroa time.   Without Prejudice.


To: Stanley Cross, Avocat

We, Jon Castle, Tim Gorter, Stephanie Mills, Derek Nicholls,
Philip Pupuka, Pierre-Emmanuel Neurohr and Rob willighagen, have
been held incommunicado for 55 hours since 0700 Friday 1st
September on board the SV Rainbow Warrior, which is not en route
to Hao, estimated time of arrival Monday morning 4th September. 
We are under tow by the tug Centaure. The vessel will require
repair before she can proceed to sea under her own power.
We have been denied access to all ship's communications and
equipment, even though we are not longer under garde a vue.  We
have been permitted this single communication to you via the
French military authorities.  We urgently require legal
representation.  Please advise us urgently if you can be present
at Hao when we arrive.  Please also check with the Greenpeace
representatives in Papeete that our total crew are accounted for. 
I am charged with (1) crossing the 12 mile limit (2) not obeying
navy orders, and there are possibly customs infractions.
Jon Castle, Master, SV Rainbow Warrior.</pre>


<P><font size=+1>8pm  </font>       Radio reception is theoretically better at night, so
Tim has set up the radio in my bathroom, and we run an aerial
wire out the cabin window and along (via some gymnastics with a
broomstick) outside the ship to Derek's cabin.  It all has rather
the flavour of a spy novel... I get rum and ice and we have a
small party as a "cover" for the radio operation.  

<P>Tim and I meanwhile crouch over the radio, trying to hear some
news.  But its mainly crackle and pop, with some distant
unfocussed Dutch language news.  At 9pm and 10.30pm, and then
later in the night, Tim tries to call Taupo and Kerikeri radio:
"This is Tim, this is Tim.  We are being held incommunicado, we
have been held hostage for 60 hours.  Any vessels hearing this
message please relay to Kerikeri radio."

<P>We don't know whether anyone will hear it, but it seems worth a
try.  The reception is so lousy we decide the port side of the
boat might be better, so we deconstruct the radio and smuggle it
bit by bit into Tim's cabin, do the same trick with the aerial
and broom stick and try it there.  I'm suddenly exhausted, and
collapse asleep in my cabin with the emergency light still going,
fully clothed at about 11pm.

<head><title>Monday September 4
- Diary</title></head><body>
<H4>Monday September 4
</H4> 
<P><font size=+1>0500 </font>       I wake early, thinking we could be arriving at Hao.
But we're still in open ocean.

<P><font size=+1>0700  </font>     Still no sign of land.  I'm starting to feel even more
bored and frustrated.  It is as if we are suspended in a time
warp, somewhere between a Kafka novel and Inspector Closeau.  It
makes you realise how much communication and information are
vital elements of being "free". Even the gendarmes seem to think
the situation is ridiculous. It's rather like being under house
arrest, I suppose -- you have plenty of food, a bed and a place
to be, but are completely isolated from the world.

<P>I vacuum my cabin, read a book in the shade on deck, try to
switch off the fact that the paratroopers keep staring at me all
the top. I feel objectified, so I just try to turn my receptors
off and pretend they are not there.
11am      The Centaure stops for a change-over of gendarmes. 
They tell us we are now going to be waiting until 6am Tuesday to
enter Hao -- it was to have been noon today "because of the
tide".  Apparently the delay is to wait for the MV Greenpeace ,
which apparently left Moruroa under tow on Sunday with 7 or 8
crew on board.  They also tell us that three sailing boats were
arrested in the zone on Sunday and two zodiacs got into the
lagoon at 5.30am today.  In fact, we find out later that only the
Kidu, a French yacht, was arrested on Sunday although other peace
flotilla vessels had been in and out across the 12 mile limit.

<p>The paratroopers are young grunts with seemingly less
intelligence and personality than even the commandos.  They're
like tanned and muscular Ken dolls, not emoting, just being. 
They spend a lot of time in the mess playing cards (tarot), which
Pierre Emmanuel joins in, and heating up ghastly looking ochre-
flesh coloured meat in tins in the galley.  They've arrived with
heaps of plastic  and garbage - mineral water and soft drink
containers, plastic wrappings, tins and small plastic/paper
containers in their ration boxes - and they simply don't get our
waste separation system. Alice would be furious!

<P><font size=+1>5.30pm  </font>         Another small victory -- they have had an order
from Moruroa that the French High Commission in Papeete has
authorised me to send a note to my family.  Obviously the
combined pressure of the Mills family and the NZ government is
having some effect.  The chief gendarme tells me my letter will
be read by the Admiral, but not censored by him. I tell him he
can stuff his bloody Admiral.

<p>I write:

<P>6.45pm Moruroa Time, Monday September 4

<pre>To my dear family:

We have now been held for 84 hours incommunicado on board the SV
Rainbow Warrior. We are being held illegally: the "garde a vue"
which expires after 48 hours, ended two days ago.  We have been
told we are "free" but we are not allowed on teh bridge, the
engine room, or in the radio toom, and they have orders to use
military force against us if we "disobey".  There are several
gendarmes and about a dozen military personnel on board. We are
okay, although when I took a photograph of Jon Castle coming down
the mast on Sunday, two commandos jumped on me, forced me to teh
ground and threw the camera over the side.
As far as we are concerned, our enforced detention is as illegal
as France's nuclear testing programme.  We protest, and will
continue to protest, at both our imprisonment and at nuclear
testing.  We demand to see a lawyer immediately, and will seek
all legal remedies to assert our democratic rights to protest
peacefully and to get legal redress against those who have
detained us unlawfully.  
Please call the families of all the crew on board:  Philip
Pupuka, Tim Gorter, Jon Castle, Pierre-Emmanuel Neurohr, Derek
Nicholls and Rob Willighagen, for me.  They have been fantastic. 
My love to you all, I know you are thinking of me as I of you. I
couldn't do it without you!  My special love to Michael.
Arohanui, Stephanie
PS I have been told that this letter will not be censored. I hope
you recieve it as soon as possible.</pre>

<head><title>Tuesday September 5
- Diary</title></head><body><H4>Tuesday September 5</H4>

<P>1100      We're still hassling the gendarmes about getting
communication with the outside world.  Eventually they tell us to
put our demand in writing.  We do:

<P>1130 local time, Near Hao, Tuesday September 5th

<pre>To: The Gendarmerie Maritime

We have now been held against our will on board the Rainbow
Warrior, without access to communications equipment, for five
days.  This is clearly illegal.
We demand the right to direct communication with our lawyer and
our families.
We therefore demand you immediately permit us to repair our
Inmarsat and HF radio equipment in order that we can communicate
directly with whoever we choose.</pre>

<P>They also permit Jon to send a message to the owners of the
Rainbow Warrior:

<pre>To: Marine Services, Greenpeace International
2310 GMT  Tuesday 5 September Aboard the Rainbow Warrior II

This is the first time they have permited to me to communicate
with you in any form since the ship was boarded at 1800 GMT on
Friday 1st September.  We have been under tow by the tug Centaure
since that date.  At present we are outside Hao and are supposed
to be entering and mooring there within the next 24 hours.  On
board are: Jon Castle, Derek Nicholls, Rob Willighagen, Tim
Gorter, Philip Pupuka, Stephanie MIills and Pierre-Emmanuel
Neurohr.  We are all in good health and good spirits.  I am not
sure of the intentions of the French military, but it seems that
they are preparing to hold the ship at the atoll for a long
period.  Please try to make sure that we recieve legal advice at
Hao via the "Tahiti Team".</pre>
<P>Jon Castle.

<P>2pm       We've established a reasonably civil, friendly even
relationship with the gendarmes and customs guys, and with the
naval officer in charge.  But a discussion after lunch about
nuclear testing suddenly errupts into fullscale acrimony.  Pierre
Emmanuel and I end up in a shouting match with them, me furious
with myself for loosing my temper, for my limited French, and for
their arrogance - the officer, who is a doctor, saying that
testing is necessary and at least if they do it down here in the
South Pacific fewer people will die!  They admit that there will
be environmental contamination but argue that testing is
indispensible for France's security.  I feel so much anger that I
decide I'd better quit.  I put on Beethoven's 6th symphony very
loudly and they start to leave the mess.  It's horrible, my heart
is pounding and I feel sick with rage and frustration. 

<P>I don't know how I would cope with indefinite house arrest, as
people in South Africa had had to.  The indefiniteness of it is
the worst -- it's getting on all our nerves today.  I'm sick of
feeling like the Ancient Mariner, lost and wandering on the ocean
wave. 

<P>The young officer says 10 commandos tipped out of a boat boarding
the MV Greenpeace and could have been injured -- and that
therefore WE are violent. I don't know whether to laugh or cry,
it seems we are so much poles apart in how we see the world.

<P>They have just done an inspection of the ship, doing an inventory
of all the equipment including that broken or missing.  Clearly
they are preparing for a long legal battle...

<P>They've conceeded, somehow in the middle of all this row, that we
fix EITHER the phone or the radio today.  During the afternoon,
Tim fixes the cable to the Inmarsat phone, and at about 6pm we
get our first call out to Tahiti.  We first talk to Ulrich, then
to Michael and later to Dad. The bad news is that the first test
happened this morning -- about 12 noon Tahiti time, an 8-20
kiloton test at Moruroa.

<P>Michael says that the French authorities are saying that the
reason we have not yet reached Hao is because of bad weather. 
This disinformation astounds me -- I tell him the weather is
perfect, and ask the naval officer in the room to confirm that
the weather is excellent, which he does in French-accented
English.  Poor guy probably doesn't realise he's being taped!
It's fantastic to get some news and message from the crew. 
Michael says Sarah McNab, the cook from the RW, reminds me that
there is a bottle of wine near the celery in the fridge if I need
it.  He says there was quite a violent boarding of the MV
Greenpeace, and that Peter, Paula, Ken Ballard, Mike Zulu the
engineer, Jean-Luc, Mili, Caik, and Sake are still on board.  The
Machias has left Tahiti.  5000 people marched there on the
weekend, and the roads were blocked while Oscar was held. There
were demos there today when the news about the test came through.

<P>Meanwhile, Chirac gave a press conference last night, where
apparently he said 6-8 tests would take place, maybe they would
occur more quickly than through to May. Apparently officials have
also been quoted as saying there would be a 3 week gap between
each test.  Cousteau has resigned as chair of the President's
advisory council on the environment. 4.5 million petitions have
been delivered to Paris, but the Beluga and 40 other vessels were
barred from entering Paris.  A land-based demo was also banned,
but a rally went ahead anyway, with people wearing gags over
their mouths. 260 people were arrested - some merely for wearing
GP badges.  There are now about a dozen boats off Moruroa,
including the Vega, Manutea, Tucker Thompson, Triptych, Tui,
Photina, Caramaba and La Ribaude. There have been a few
infringements of the 12 mile zone, but only the small French
yacht has been arrested. The two inflatables that went into the
lagoon on Sunday were from the Manutea; their crews are being
flown out to Tahiti.  Overnight, two people went in on kayaks;
they were on the atoll for about 24 hours, and are being flown
out.  NZ has re-called their ambassador from France, as has Chile
and Nauru and the US has "regretted" today's test; there have
been demos and actions everywhere both against the test and our
detention. There is a big rift between France and Sweden and
France and Japan because of them sending cabinet ministers to the
demo in Tahiti on Saturday.

<P>Dad says he's sent me a fax and is surprised it has not yet
reached me.  He says that the NZ Consul has told him that we may
be at Hao until September 11, as that is the first civilian
flight out of the atoll. Groan! </body></html>

<head><title>Wednesday, September 6</title></head><body><H4>Wednesday, September 6</H4>

<P>0600      We "certainly" are going to disembark at Hao, this
morning, it seems.  The atoll is on the horizon and approaching;
we can also see the MV Greenpeace under tow from a frigate, a few
miles from us.

<P>The grunts are still occupying much of the mess, and have started
playing some ghastly music.  One of them starts chanting a
National Front slogan: "Emigre Dehors" (Immigrants, out!)  I
can't believe my ears, but Pierre-Emmanuel says I'm hearing
right.  He tells them to shut it.

<P>0900      A tug comes along side and passes over heavy chains and
bolts to be used for anchoring the vessel. The gendarmes start to
get nervous, telling us we must go into the mess once we get near
the pass into Hao.  We initially refuse, but Jon eventually asks
us to go in.  We lean out the portholes in the mess as the pass
approaches, but the grunts pull us back and lock up the
portholes. The pass is narrow and the tide flushes turbulently
out around us as we go in.

<P>1000      We have all agreed to stay together, regardless of what
they want us to do.  They tell us we must all disembark, except
for Jon, who has to be further interviewed in relation to the
customs charges. We refuse to leave without him. They start
getting more and more irate.  They take us individually into our
cabins to pack our gear.  Mine is already packed, and they tip it
out unceremoniously onto the floor to search it.  I refuse to re-
pack it for them, and they start shouting at me.  I lie down on
my bunk and refuse to pack it.  Eventually, they do it
themselves.

<P>Back in the mess, we are still refusing to leave without Jon. 
They have also refused to let me or anyone else take my disks and
papers.  They also get incredibly stubborn about refusing to let
me take some tapes - as if Beethoven and Schubert have somehow
become seditious!

<P>Finally, the chief gendarme just snaps.  He tells us he's had
enough, we're going to be taken by force.  Tim, Pierre-Emmanuel
and I lock arms around the back of a table in the mess.  Rob and
Philip get taken out first, while the paratroopers peel us off
one at a time.  Derek and the three of us are carried out by
wrists and ankles, or in my case, by the arms of my t-shirt,
banged along the corridor, out onto the deck, and into the tug
alongside.

<P>After a short trip in the tug, we're again carried out and dumped
on the dock with our baggage.

<P>There's a new set of gendarmes dealing with us, and as usual
their first reaction is unadulterated hostility. When I refuse to
move from the dock without Jon Castle coming off the boat, they
tow me by arms and legs into an office. There is no attempt to be
gentle -- my back scrapes along the coral and they drop me none
too gently several times.  It seems an interminable trip as they
sweat and swear over me. Eventually I end up in a bare office
with several more gendarmes and an air force officer.  The air
force officer looks both embarassed and concerned and tries to
act as interpreter.  The others look like they could quite easily
drop me down a dark hole.  I lie on my back on the floor while
Derek gets taken into an adjacent room and Philip comes in my
one.

<P>An hour or so later, Paula Huckleberry turns up.  Then they carry
me through to another office and dump me on the floor.  A very
angry police officer -- one of the ones who first boarded the
Warrior last weekend -- tells me I'm ridiculous.  I try a
contemptuous stare although its a bit difficult on your back in
bare legs streaked with grime and your clothes dishevelled.  They
read me yet another version of the expulsion order from French
Polynesia, translated nervously by the only woman gendarme
present, then drag me back to the office.

<P>The day grinds on.  They bring in some lunch which I'm not hungry
for, but Paula tucks in to it.  She and I strike up conversation
with the gendarmes guarding us, she playing good cop, me bad cop. 
She wants to get home and wants her luggage back, so that takes
some time.  She and I end up more outside than inside the room,
she chain smoking, drinking the chateau cardboard red wine,
knitting a garish baby blanket and making friendly conversation
with the gendarmes while I hassle them simultaneously about
lawyers, phone calls, where the crew is....

<P>All they keep telling us is that we can't phone because we're now
under an expulsion order (although one says, yes you can if you
pay for it yourself; I offer to do this and he says I can't
unless I have a telephone card, I offer to buy one and he says I
can't because the post office is shut...Kafka again!).  They also
say that Jon is "about to arrive" all the time; and that the crew
are "free" in the civilian village on Hao, but are not allowed to
come and see us.

<P>3pm       Peter Schwarz, the captain of the Greenpeace, arrives
in our room.  He's OK, has refused to do an inventory of the ship
for them and is taken off to be searched.  So they find the
passports, finally!

<P>5pm  Derek and I are taken to another office by a patronising
sleazy plainclothes officer.  He is Pierre Merglen? I think, from
the High Commission, or military intelligence.  They have
permitted the NZ consul in Tahiti to ring us to check on our
health and status. While we wait for the call to come in, he
rings Tahiti.  Obviously there's bad news:  he comes off the
phone red with anger and starts shouting at us: thieves, looters,
killers... Derek and I don't know what the hell is going on.  "If
someone is killed in Tahiti, you're responsible," he shouts at
me, shaking a finger at me.  It's almost comical as we don't have
a clue what he's talking about; when we ask him to explain, he
refuses to.

<P>Still no sign of Jon.  Whenever I ask the gendarmes, they tell me
he is coming, will be here in half an hour etc.  I don't believe
them, but there is nothing I can do.  When I ask about the rest
of the crew, they say they are "free" and are in the civilian
village, but are not allowed to contact us as we are on a
military base and under an expulsion order.

<P>Eventually the NZ Consul calls.  She sounds SO kiwi.  The
gendarmes refuse to leave the room during the phone call and turn
the speaker phone on so they can hear what she is saying too. 
She repeats the rubbish they have told the NZ government (the
weather is bad, we've been free etc) so we go into a lengthy
conversation about exactly what has happened.

<P>6pm       It's clear we are going somewhere, but unclear where. 
They go through the passports and tell us to get our bags
together.  I end up conversing with one of the gendarmes about
racism and the National Front.

<P>8pm       We're loaded into a truck with our gear, and head
through the darkened base out toward the airstrip.  We can see
the lights of the RW and MVGP in the lagoon. I'm still hoping
that when we get to the plane Jon and the rest of the crew will
be there... It feels awful to be leaving the Warrior on her own.

<P>8.30pm         We're put on board a military jet, a souped-up
Caravelle with "Republique Francaise" on the side. They say we
are going to Papeete.  A gendarme -  Jean-Paul  - has assigned himself
to me. I've caught him staring at me before during the day, I
don't know whether this means he is super hostile or more
friendly than the others.  He sits between me and aisle and
accompanies me to the toliet.  They claim the toliet door isn't
working (it is), and put a set of handcuffs down on the floor
around the door so it doesn't close properly. Not quite the
service of UTA...

<P>10pm      This plane goes 3-400 miles an hour, so it is clear by
now that we are NOT going to Papeete.  Maybe because of the
rioting, but probably because of some other plan we don't yet
know about.  I've been extra friendly to  Jean-Paul, asking about where
he's from, answering his questions about me, Greenpeace, my
family, am I married etc.  I gently grill him about where we are
going, and he finally whispers that we are going to Los
Angeles...  Apart from picking at some rather untasty food, I
doze uncomfortably between the gendarme and Derek.  The gendarmes
move around a lot, talking and smoking, and Jean-Paul sits stiffly
beside me, making sleep rather difficult -- I don't know whether
he is just uncomfortable too (he's very tall, and the plane is
definitely not designed for big people), whether he feels obliged
to stay awake to keep an eye on me, or whether he's just twitchy
about being physically close to me as a strange woman in the
enforced intimacy of long distance travel.</body></html>

<P>0500 (Tahiti time)       Groggy, we've arrived at Los Angeles.
The gendarmes ask Paula to get her luggage and disembark. We all
want to go with her but are told we are not permitted to do so.
I tell a contract cleaner/caterer who comes on board that we are
being held hostage against our will by the French military on
board the plane.  He seems about as interested as if I'd asked
him what the weather was like.  We demand to be taken off; they
refuse.  The plane is re-fuelled, some new aircrew come on.  I
ask to change clothes, which they finally allow.  My feet have
been freezing, so I get out of my shorts and barefeet into jeans
and socks.  We take off: destination unknown.

<P>Later:  Jean-Paul confirms that yes, we are going to Paris.  We don't
know whether its an arbitrary decision, if the plane was going
there anyway, whether we will be expelled, or whether they want
to put us in a French gaol.  It's all very bizarre, like being a
victim of an outrageous hoax or in a bad spy movie.  I read, doze
again.  I go to the loo and sit for a while trying to collect my
thoughts.  The gendarmes obviously feel I have been in there far
too long, and one who has been particularly hostile comes and
swings open the door.  I bang it shut and lock it again.  I come
out feeling contemptuous, hostile, invaded. I tell  Jean-Paul angrily
that they show no respect and that we are not murderers or
dangerous criminals, that they have denied us basic human rights.
He looks almost fearful of my rage, says it is nothing to do with
him, he's just doing his job. I ask him if he likes the job he is
doing.  Sometimes they seem more intimidated by us than vice
versa.</body></html>

<P>October 2nd 1995.
 

<P><H4>Update from the Greenpeace UK protestors on the day of the second
French test
</H4>




<P>We've just completed a brilliant action here in London.  

<P>At 0730 hours sixteen activists equipped with ladders went into      
the French Ambassador's back garden in Kensington Gardens in
Central London and managed to get onto the roof.
 <P><a href="rw196.gif">
<img align=top src="rw196t.gif" alt="photo1.">74KB GIF</a>
or <a href="rw196.jpg">24KB JPG.</a> 
<P>Before getting to the garden they were accosted by a soldier
carrying a lance on horseback [the soldiers were practising in
the field next door to the diplomatic houses]. He came up, took
one look and then galloped off. The cavalry arrived too late. If
you want your windows cleaned we have sixteen skilled ladder
climbers now in Greenpeace UK.
 
<P>The activists started to blow foghorns and whistles making onme
helluva racket. They also were waving French flags saying 'NON'
across them and some saying 'DE-TEST-ABLE'.
 <P><a href="rw195.gif">
<img align=top src="rw195t.gif" alt="photo1.">88KB GIF</a>
or <a href="rw195.jpg">28KB JPG.</a> 
<P>They took the message straight to the ambassador over his coffee
and croissants 'Greenpeace wants no more nuclear tests, the
people of the UK don't want anymore nuclear tests and the people
of the world don't want them either!!!'
 
<P>About 0900 the fire brigade arrived and sat there scratching
their heads trying to figure out how to get them down. After some
negotiation everyone left, with the last person being plucked off
a chimney pot at 1000 hrs by a fire engine "cherry-picker" type
affair.
 
<P>The sixteen were arrested for tresspassing on embassy property
and are in a police station awaiting release at the moment.

<FONT SIZE=+1><P><B>Statement from John Mate on the Greenpeace Sailing Vessel <I>Caramba</I> at the 12 mile
zone on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the United
Nations:</B></font>


<P>Friends;


<P>Greetings of solidarity from the Greenpeace SV Caramba and the
New Zealand Peace Flotilla SV "Joie", located just outside the
military-enforced exclusion zone around French occupied
Moruroa in the South Pacific:


<P>We arrived here early Sunday morning, 22 October, on the
occasion of the United Nations' 50th Anniversary celebration
with a singularity of purpose - to stop France's nuclear
atrocities. Aboard the 2 vessels are 2 Tahitians, an
aboriginal Australian, a Canadian, a Dutchman, 2 New
Zealanders, 1 British, and 2 American crew members.


<P>The United Nations embodies the very highest principals of
humanity in the pursuit of a just, peaceful, and
environmentally safe world. In stark contrast, current French
nuclear explosions at Moruroa and Fangataufa represent the
very worst crime, the greatest evil that humans can commit
against all life.


<P>The shameful history of France's nuclear colonialism in
Polynesia is one of brute military force, lies, treachery,
bribery, violations of basic human rights, contempt for
democracy, and a negligent disregard for the health and
welfare, and the opinions of the people of the region.


<P>Of course the peoples of the South Pacific have also been the
innocent victims of American and British nuclear explosions.


<P>Now these three nuclear powers are announcing that they will
become signatories to the 1986 Nuclear Free South Pacific Zone
Treaty in 1996 - conveniently giving France enough time to
complete the last of its current set of nuclear explosions.


<P>While this announcement should be welcome news for the whole
world and especially for the purpose of the South Pacific, its
timing can only be seen as damage control for President
Chirac. Mr. Chirac's participation in this announcement is
analagous to a serial rapist promising that after only 6 more
rapes he will stop terrorizing the neighborhood.


<P>The great French author, Victor Hugo, once wrote, "There is
nothing so powerful as an idea whose time has come."


<P>Clearly the time for a nuclear free Pacific and an end to
French nuclear colonialism is right now, not next year.


<P>The French should not only immediately cancel all further
nuclear explosions, France should also provide a written
contract with a  100,000 years guarentee to compensate the
Polynesian people for any further injury that they or their
environment may suffer as a result of France's present and
past nuclear activities.
<BR>We came to Moruroa, territory which the French stole from the
Tureian people, and to this date, illegally occupy, to bear
witness to France's nuclear evil and to do whatever is in our
power to prevent further evil from occurring. 


<P>However, we are not naive to think that we can physically stop
the French military, but we are convinced that world public
opinion can and will stop Mr. Chirac and his gang of nuclear
terrorists.


<P>What is needed is a chorus of voices from around the world
achanting in unison "Honte a la France! Honte a Chirac!"
"Shame on France! Shame on Chirac!"


<P>A chorus that wakes up the French public after the great shame
that the Chirac government is bringing on France.


<P>We also need strong reaction from governments. Instead of
sharing a platform with Chirac, President Clinton should
expell the French Ambassador, and all the other countries
should do likewise should France explode another bomb. France
does not deserve to be a part of the community of civilized
nations as long as it acts as a terrorist country.


<P>We great you from this tragic place which not too long ago was
paradise, and is now a nuclear graveyard.


<P>Please let us hear your voices all the way to Moruroa, and let
them hear them all the way to the UN:
"Shame on France! Shame on Chirac!" "Honte a la France! Honte
a la Chirac!"


<P>Together we shall, we must, stop this evil. Together we shall
rid the world of the nuclear nightmare. The future demands
this of us.

<P>PAPEETE, March 20th, 1996  

<P>Both the Rainbow Warrior and 
the MV Greenpeace, seized by the French military during protests 
against nuclear testing at Moruroa last September, have been 
freed.  Greenpeace vessels Vega, La Ribaude and Manutea were 
released from captivity at Moruroa last week.

<P>The MV Greenpeace, seized in international waters last 
September, left Hao atoll at around 6pm local time, and was 
joined by the Rainbow Warrior which sailed to meet her just 
ouside the French exclusion zone.  The captains of the two 
vessels now plan to proceed westward, testing the condition and 
sea-worthiness of the ships.

<P>From on board the vessels, Greenpeace crew are still testing 
much of the equipment badly damaged when French commandos 
boarded and seized the vessels.  A final destination for the 
ships will depend on the captains' assessment of their condition 
over the next 48 hours. 

<P>All of Greenpeace's five vessels are not free, just a few days 
before France, the United States and Britain sign the long-
sought after South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty in Suva, 
Fiji, on March 25th. 

<P>"With nuclear testing now ended in the Pacific forever, 
Greenpeace is calling on its supporters world-wide to write to 
the Chinese Premier Li Peng, urging China to stop testing," said 
Greenpeace's Janet Dalziell on board the MV Greenpeace. 

<P>China is currently a major obstacle to achieving a Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty, as it still plans tests this year prior to the 
treaty's conclusion, and wants so-called "peaceful nuclear 
explosions" exempted from the treaty.

<H4>CREWS AND SURVEYOR LEAVE FOR MORUROA TO FREE GREENPEACE YACHTS                        
</H4>
       
<P>Papeete, March 13th:
<P>Greenpeace crews and a marine surveyor
nominated by Greenpeace will leave at 6am this morning
for Moruroa atoll, to free three yachts
seized by the French military during anti-nuclear protests there
last year.

<P>The presence of the surveyor, who will assess the safety of the
yachts, was only agreed on Monday by the French authorities,
after many months of negotiations by Greenpeace.

<P>Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills said the presence of the surveyor, an
independent and internationally recognised expert, was a victory
for common sense.

<P>"Greenpeace sincerely hopes that the French authorities will
adopt a similarly open approach to future proposals by indepedent
scientists wishing to assess the condition of Moruroa itself,"
Ms Mills said.

<P>Twelve crew, Greenpeace legal representatives and the surveyor
will take possession of the Vega (Canadian registered), La
Ribaude (French registerd) and Manutea (US registered).

<P>"We are looking forward to the release of our vessels, but they
should never have been seized in the first place," 
Ms Mills said. "France used massive military might to try and block
peaceful protest, but the fact is the presence of the peace
flotilla at Moruroa last year forced France to reduce its number
of tests and agree to support a 'zero yield' test ban treaty."

<P>"With France, the United States and Britain having agreed to sign
the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty on March 25th,
Greenpeace is now calling on China to end its testing programme."

<P>China is the only nuclear weapons state still testing nuclear
weapons, and is stalling negotiations for a test ban treaty by
insisting that the treaty allow nuclear tests for "peaceful"
purposes.

<P>"Greenpeace continues to focus on an end to all nuclear testing
and is actively campaigning for conclusion of a test ban treaty
this year," Ms Mills said.  "We urge France to exercise leadership
and work with China to ensure this happens."

<P>The Vega, La Ribaude and Manutea will head for Papeete to enable
further assessment of the state of the vessels before heading to
New Zealand (Vega and La Ribaude) and the United States
(Manutea).  Meanwhile, crews for the MV Greenpeace and Rainbow
Warrior will fly to Hao atoll over the next week.  The
destinations of the larger ships will be decided once their
seaworthiness has been assessed.

<H4>THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS!</H4>




<p>Greenpeace would like to congratulate all of you out there who
joined the international protest against French nuclear testing
in the South Pacific.  

<p>Without the millions of individuals and 160 Governments who
joined in the protest, Moruroa and Fangataufa could be facing
another two nuclear explosions.  Six tests were too many, but
eight is worse.

<p>Whether you joined the internet fax protest, wrote letters,
signed petitions, joined demonstrations or simply argued against
testing with other individuals -- you helped this protest. 

<p>Special thanks to the members of the peace flotilla who sailed from all
corners of the world to Moruroa.

<p>There are more battles ahead.  China could test again in February.  And
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) is currently under
negotiation.  If it is strong, it will mean a permanent ban on
all nuclear testing. 

<p>Certainly the Polynesians need much more help to protect their
ocean from contamination due to testing at Moruroa and Fangataufa.

<p>And the French Government still has our boats -- ask your
government to demand that Chirac release the Greenpeace ships
arrested during peaceful protest.

<p>But right now you, our supporters, deserve to celebrate what we
all have achieved, working together for a nuclear free future!

<p><center>THANKS!!</center>

<H4>GREENPEACE WELCOMES IMMEDIATE RESUMPTION OF CTBT NEGOTIATIONS  </H4>


<P> GENEVA 23 January, 1996
<P>Greenpeace today welcomed the 
decision to immediately resume the negotiations on a nuclear 
test-ban treaty (CTBT) with the utmost priority taken today at 
the first meeting in 1996 of the Geneva-based Conference on 
Disarmament. 
 
<P>"This is exactly the start to the Conference's work which is 
needed, if a test-ban treaty is to be finished this year," said
Greenpeace's Simon Carroll.  "The decision sends a strong signal 
that the international community wants to achieve a treaty as 
soon as possible which will end nuclear testing for all time."
 
<P>In order to further reinforce this commitment, Greenpeace again
called upon China and France to cancel their remaining nuclear 
tests and for China and Russia to formally commit themselves to 
the so-called "zero option" - a treaty which would ban all 
nuclear explosions.

<P>Blair Palese, Greenpeace Communications: +44171-833-0600
<BR><HR><BR>
<P>Editor's Note:

<P>The treaty is still being negotiated. There are a number of 
issues of importance that need to be resolved, including:
 
<P>1.  Preamble:  A commitment to nuclear disarmament and reference 
to specific steps which lead to the elimination of nuclear 
weapons should be contained in the preamble.

<P>2.  Scope:  The treaty must ban nuclear explosions of any size, 
no matter how small, for any purpose.  China and Russia have not 
formally committed to a zero-yield treaty in the Geneva 
negotiations as yet.  In addition, China is seeking to exclude 
so-called "peaceful nuclear explosions" from the treaty.

<P>3.  Verification:  The treaty needs to include a package of   
methods to ensure compliance with its provisions.  An essential 
element of the package is on-site inspection.  

<P>4.  Entry Into Force of the CTBT: There should be no barrier to 
achieving rapid entry into force of the treaty, following its 
signature in 1996.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE




<H4>RAINBOW WARRIOR SAILS FOR TEST SITE AS PRESSURE ON FRANCE MOUNTS</H4> 
            



<P>Auckland, Tuesday June 13 -- (GP) The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow
Warrior leaves Auckland harbour today for France's Moruroa test site
amid mounting international pressure on President Chirac not to
resume nuclear testing.
 
<P>President Clinton will discuss France's threatened resumption of
testing with President Chirac when the two meet at the White House
tomorrow (Wednesday June 14), and the issue will also be on the table
at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament where negotiations on a
comprehensive test ban treaty continue this week.
 
<P>An emergency resolution is to be tabled in the European Parliament
on Wednesday, urging France not to break the three year old
moratorium  on nuclear testing.  Meanwhile, the Chilean Government
has joined Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Island states in
formally protesting any resumption of French testing in the South
Pacific, and the President of French Polynesia has said he now
opposes tests at Moruroa. Russia has also expressed concern.
 
<P>Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills said President Chirac must listen to the
voice of the international community or risk France becoming
ostracised for its refusal to honour its nuclear disarmament
commitments.
 
<P>"There is no doubt that the international community is united in
condemning any resumption of French testing," Mills said. "It would
be a scandal if the vested interests of the nuclear military
establishment domestically are allowed to over-rule France's real
interests.  If testing resumes, this flagrant contradiction of
commitments made just last month at Non-Proliferation Treaty talks
on nuclear disarmament will severely undermine France's international
reputation."
 
<P>The SV Rainbow Warrior, which is sailing to Moruroa to attempt
to prevent further nuclear tests, will depart Auckland's Princes
Wharf at 12 noon local time on Tuesday June 13.  The ship will be
formally sent off at a ceremony on the dock at 10.30 a.m., by the
Mayor of Auckland, Mr Les Mills, local musicians, political party
representatives and elders of the Ngati Whatua Maori tribe in a
traditional farewell ceremony.  An escort of small boats will
accompany the Rainbow Warrior from the port.
 
<P>"The Rainbow Warrior sails on behalf of millions of ordinary people
all over the world -- including a majority of French people -- who
want an end to testing now," Greenpeace France's Jean-Luc Thierry
said. "By bearing witness at Moruroa, Greenpeace aims to ensure
President Chirac cannot remains deaf to their plea to rid the world
of this nuclear threat."

<H4>
             CHIRAC ANNOUNCEMENT TO RESUME NUCLEAR TESTING CONDEMNED; 
            <P> RAINBOW WARRIOR GOES FULL STEAM TOWARD MORUROA</H4> 



                                               


 <P>Off New Zealand coast, 19:35 GMT Tuesday June 13 -- The Rainbow Warrior
will go full steam ahead to Moruroa atoll Greenpeace said in response to
France's announcement this evening that it will resume nuclear testing in
the South Pacific.

 <P>Greenpeace said France's decision to resume testing in September with eight
undergound nuclear tests was a black day for the world's hopes to see
progress on nuclear disarmament.  It called on the international community
to condemn President Chirac's move, and for President Clinton to cancel a
planned meeting with M. Chirac tomorrow in protest against the decision.

 <P>"It is an outrage that France has chosen nuclear proliferation over nuclear
disarmament and more tests instead of a comprehensive test ban treaty,"
Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills said from aboard the Rainbow Warrior. "Even
one test is one too many. This will shatter hopes of achieving a
comprehensive test ban treaty this year and put the Pacific at risk from
further radioactive contamination."
 
 <P>France will be betraying its commitments to non-proliferation and nuclear
disarmament made as recently as last month at the United Nations
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) talks, Greenpeace France's Jean-Luc Thierry
said from the ship.
 
 <P>"France is making a mockery of solemn pledges made at the NPT and putting
at risk its relationship with the rest of the international community to
return to testing," he said.  "With the Cold War over, there can be even
less justification than ever for testing new bombs to add to a stockpile
of nuclear weapons that could already destroy the planet many times over.
France is sacrificing its long term strategic interests for short term
internal political reasons," he said.
 
 <P>President Chirac's announcement comes as Greenpeace's ship Rainbow Warrior
leaves New Zealand following a brief commemoration ceremony for the ten
year anniversary of the bombing of the original Rainbow Warrior there.  The
original ship was destroyed 10 years ago next month by French secret
service agents killing one crew member as it prepared to set sail to
protest French testing in the Pacific.

              EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TO VOTE ON EMERGENCY RESOLUTION 
               CONDEMNING FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING</H4>

<P>BRUSSELS, Tuesday June 13 - (GP) The European Parliament (EP)
will vote Thursday on an emergency resolution condemning any
resumption of nuclear testing by France.
 
<P>After an appeal last week from the EP's "Intergroup on Peace and
Disarmament," all political fractions decided to put the
emergency resolution on the agenda of this weeks session in
Strasbourg. 
 
<P>The resolution urges France to maintain its testing moratorium
until a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), currently being
discussed at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, is agreed.
It comes in response to France's Defence Minister Charles Millon
welcoming a report by military experts last week recommending a
resumption of nuclear tests at France's Moruroa atoll test site
in the South Pacific.
 
<P>Greenpeace's Eloi Glorieux said the resolution was a test of
Europe's resolve to put pressure on France to make progress on
nuclear disarmament.
 
<P>"The non-nuclear members of the European Union effectively failed
to challenge France and Britain on their failure to disarm during
Non-Proliferation Treaty talks last month.  They now have a
responsibility to hold France accountable, and to send a message
to President Chirac that testing is completely unacceptable,"
Glorieux said.
 
<P>Today, Greenpeace's flagship the Rainbow Warrior departed from
Auckland, New Zealand, for the Moruroa test site in an attempt
to prevent any resumption of nuclear tests by France.
 
<P>"A strong resolution from European parliamentarians to their
colleagues will reinforce the message from the international
community that France could shatter an historic opportunity to
end nuclear testing forever if it decides to resume testing now,"
said Glorieux.
 
<P>Governments from Latin America and the Pacific region have
already lodged formally protest with France about a resumption
of testing.  President Chirac is to meet with President Clinton
in Washington on Wednesday to discuss the testing issue.

<P>On board the SV Rainbow Warrior, June 14 -- (GP) New Zealand and
Australia's decision to freeze military cooperation with France in
response to a resumption of French nuclear testing in the Pacific and
growing international condemnation of the French decision was welcomed
by Greenpeace today as a first step.
 
<P>Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, the United States and the South
Pacific Forum, representing the states of the Pacific region, have also
expressed deep regret at President Chirac's decision to undertake eight
tests at the atoll from September this year until May 1996.
 
<P>Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills aboard the SV Rainbow Warrior said  further
diplomatic, economic and practical action should be taken to ensure
President Chirac is left in no doubt about the political, environmental
and ethical costs of the French decision.
 
<P>"Urgent international action is now required to reverse President
Chirac's decision," Mills said.  "France has put at risk the  future of
the comprehensive test ban treaty and flouted its own  commitments made
at the Non-Proliferation Treaty talks.  This  decision is an arrogant
slap in the face for non-nuclear nations, particularly in the Pacific,
who have been calling for a test ban for more than 25 years."
 
<P>Mills said a strong response particularly from the other nuclear weapon
states (US, UK, Russia and China) and France's European neighbours was
essential. 
 
<P>"President Clinton, who is meeting with French President Chirac today,
must demand that the French not go forward with testing and that Chirac
live up to his international agreements to end testing and work for
nuclear disarmament," Mills said.  Greenpeace in Washington, DC will
hold a protest today in Lafayette Park near the White House where Chirac
and Clinton are meeting.  A protest is also being held at the French
embassy in London this evening.

<P>Greenpeace's flagship Rainbow Warrior is currently en route to Moruroa
atoll with the aim of preventing tests resuming at the atoll.
 
<P>"We have the support of millions of people around the world who want to
see an end to nuclear testing forever, now.  But we cannot succeed on
our own.  The international community must take responsibility now to
persuade President Chirac he has made a costly mistake, or else see the
historic opportunity to agree a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty slip
through its fingers this year, and perhaps forever."

<P><I>ANNEX:  CHRONOLOGY OF OPPOSITION TO A RESUMPTION OF NUCLEAR
                    TESTING IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC</I>
 
<P>-May 7: Jacques Chirac is elected President of France
<P>-May 8: The South Pacific Forum, in a formal statement welcoming the
election President Chirac, said France's relations with the region would
be damaged if tests resumed.
The New Zealand and Australian governments reiterate their opposition
to a resumption of nuclear testing.
<P>-May 9:  Denmark, on behalf of the five Nordic countries, issued a
statement at the NPT Review and Extension Conference, calling for a
continued moratorium:  "The negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban
treaty should be concluded as soon as possible.  Until that has been
accomplished all nuclear-weapon States, including China, must refrain
from nuclear testing." (NPT/CONF.1995/31
<P>-May 12:  Australia issues a formal statement welcoming the indefinite
extension of the NPT and opposing French nuclear tests. Foreign Minister
Gareth Evans said: "I repeat my appeal to the new French President to
maintain the suspension of nuclear testing in the South Pacific..."
<P>-May 22:  French Prime Minister Alain Juppe tells Parliament that France
would soon be in a position to decide if it needed to resume nuclear
weapons tests.
<P>-May  23: The Philippines President, Fidel Ramos, urges France to
abandon any plans of resuming nuclear testing in the Pacific. He said
in a statement the Philippines was deeply concerned with the issue of
nuclear testing in the Pacific because of the environmental damage it
caused and other hazards it posed to countries in the area. "The
Philippines calls upon France to display the sense of global
responsibility that it has shown on many other occasions, by not
resuming nuclear testing in the Pacific," Ramos said.
-June 6: France's Defence Minister Charles Millon welcomes a report by
a military experts panel, headed by Admiral Lanxade, recommending a
resumption of nuclear testing at Moruroa.  The panel said up to ten
tests would be 'politically palatable', and should occur as soon as
possible.
<P>-June 6: Greenpeace announces in Paris that it is sending its ship the
Rainbow Warrior to Moruroa.
<P>-June 7:  The South Pacific Forum protests the suggestion that 
France will resume testing.
<P>-June 7: The Director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
John Holum, said the US hoped France would not resume testing. "When the
world is in the process of eliminating, dramatically reducing their
nuclear weapons, no country really needs to be modernising and updating
their nuclear capabilities." 
The Fiji Government sends a diplomatic note to the French ambassador to
Fiji protesting any resumption.
<P>-June 7: The Australian Federal Cabinet endorses a joint diplomatic
offensive with New Zealand and other Pacific Island states to deter
France from resuming.  New Zealand's Prime Minister personally rebukes
the French Ambassador to New Zealand over any resumption. The leader of
the Labour opposition party calls for a suspension of joint military
cooperation with France in the South Pacific.
<P>-June 7: The Foreign Affairs Minister of Chile announces that the
Chilean Government will make an official protest to France about any
resumption of nuclear testing  and would work with other Latin American
Governments to prevent further tests.
<P>-June 7: The secretariat of the Nuclear Free and Independent Pacific
Movement, the Pacific Concerns Resource Centre, calls for an immediate
suspension of France's South Pacific Forum Dialogue Partner status
should French testing resume.
<P>-June 9: Germany's opposition Social Democrat Party (SPD) calls on
France not to resume nuclear testing, saying it would be a slap in the
face for those countries which had accepted indefinite extension of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<P>-June 10: President Gaston Flosse of French Polynesia withdraws his
long-time support for nuclear testing and says he opposes resumption of
nuclear testing at Moruroa.
<P>-June 10: Chile, Ecuador and Peru, meeting at  a session of the
Association of American States, issued a statement urging France not to
resume tests at Moruroa atoll. The General Secretariat of the Permanent
Commission for the South Pacific representing Colombia, Chile, Ecuador
and Peru announces its opposition to further testing in the Pacific.
<P>-June 12: President Chirac presides over a meeting of the Conseil de
Defense (Defence Council) during which a resumption of testing is
agreed.
<P>-June 13:  President Chirac announces France will resume testing at
Moruroa atoll.  Eight tests will take place between September 1995 and
May 1996, he says, before France agrees to a comprehensive test ban
treaty. The Socialist opposition oppose the decision.
<P>-June 14:  Australia announces it is freezing all military cooperation
with France at existing levels.  New Zealand dismisses the French
ambassador from a meeting with Foreign Minister Don McKinnon, and also
freezes military cooperation and says it is not ruling out sending a NZ
frigate to the test zone. Japan says it deeply regrets the decision and
regards it as a betrayal; and Belgium officially condemns the decision
to resume testing.  The United States says it 'regrets' France's
decision to resume testing.

<P>COOK ISLANDS GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS RAINBOW WARRIOR MISSION</H4>
<body>
<P>Rarotonga, Cook Islands, Wednesday June 21 (GP):- The Cook
Islands Government today endorsed the Rainbow Warrior's mission
of protest against French nuclear testing as the ship arrived in
Rarotonga this morning.
 
<P>The Deputy Prime Minister welcomed the ship on behalf of the Cook
Islands Government, along with a large crowd of local elders and
church leaders, school children, a traditional dance party and
local environmental activists.
 
<P>"Make no mistake, these people are here not to protest, but to
support your voyage," Deputy Prime Minister Hon. Inatio Akaruru
told the ship's crew.  "The Cook Islands Government and its
people support your mission and wish you well."
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior is calling at the Cook Islands en route to
the French nuclear test site at Moruroa atoll in French
Polynesia. 
 
<P>"We are here to show our support for Pacific nations' protest
against a resumption of French testing, and to appeal to the
United States, Britain and France to respect the wishes of
Pacific peoples and sign the Treaty of Rarotonga," Greenpeace's
Stephanie Mills said.  The Treaty, banning nuclear tests and
declaring the South Pacific a nuclear free zone, was signed in
1985, but these three nuclear weapon states have refused to sign
its protocols.
 
<P>Greenpeace sent a message to President Clinton of the U.S. and
Prime Minister John Major of Britain today, urging them to sign
the Treaty urgently as a signal of their commitment to an end to
testing and a comprhensive test ban treaty.
 
<P>"By signing the Treaty, the two nuclear weapons states could
indicate to France that its position on testing is isolated and
out of step both with Pacific island nations and the rest of the
international community," Mills said.
 
<P>She said a delegation from the Rainbow Warrior crew would meet
the Cook Islands Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey Henry, tomorrow
(Thursday) to discuss further steps that could be taken by
Pacific Island nations to urge President Chirac of France to
reverse his decision.

<P><head><H4>FRENCH REFUSE RAINBOW WARRIOR ENTRY TO PUBLIC QUAY IN TAHITI</H4></head>
  <body>           
<P>3pm local time, 29 June 1995, Papeete:- French authorities today 
refused to allow the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior to dock at 
the main public quay in Papeete, as more than 15,000 Tahitian 
anti-nuclear protesters blocked roads demanding an end to nuclear 
testing and a berth for the Rainbow Warrior at the public quay.
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior was initially due to dock at the Quai 
D'Honneur at 10am this morning.  However the French authorities 
barred the ship from berthing there late last night.  This 
morning, more than 15,000 protestors who had been due to welcome 
the ship set up human road blocks on all roads into Papeete, 
paralysing the city.  French authorities also reportedly flew in 200
riot police from New Caledonia for today's protest.
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior is calling into Papeete, the capital of
French Polynesia, to support local protest against a resumption
of French nuclear testing at Moruroa atoll, 650 miles east of
Tahiti. 
 
<P>Greenpeace's Jean-Luc Thierry said:

<P>"President Chirac must listen to the concern and outrage of the people of Tahiti, whose
land and sea are being violated by yet more nuclear tests."
 
<P>Stephanie Mills, campaign coordinator aboard, said France had tried 
to suppress public opposition to nuclear testing by intimidation by 
riot police and harrassment of the Rainbow Warrior.  
 
<P>"Clearly this has failed.  The people of Tahiti will not be silenced 
in their condemnation of nuclear testing.  French authorities have 
used the pretext of a threat to public order to try and stop the 
people of Tahiti from welcoming the Rainbow Warrior.  Ironically, 
the public order problem is of their own creation: first, because 
of the decision to resume nuclear testing, and secondly because of 
a petty decision to restrict access to the ship and prevent Greenpeace 
crew joining a peaceful demonstration."
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior is now moored in a temporary anchorage in the 
middle of Papeete harbour, pending a decision by the authorities.
Meanwhile, Greenpeace crew plan to join the demonstration outside 
the French High Commission in Papeete this afternoon.
 
<P>Two crew members deported from Tahiti in 1992 after a previous 
protest voyage by the Rainbow Warrior have been banned from 
landing in Tahiti.  The two, Stephanie Mills and Philip Pupuka, 
have been informed that they will be deported on the first plane 
out if they go ashore.
 
<P>Mills said such banning orders would not stop Greenpeace's 
protest.  She said sustained protest in Tahiti was necessary,
together with opposition in France and around the world, to
overturn President Chirac's decision.
 
<P>While in Tahiti, Greenpeace plans to meet with local anti-nuclear
groups, community leaders and Tahitian authorities.  Tahitian
activists have staged almost daily protests over the past ten
days.
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior is scheduled to depart Papeete for Moruroa
early next week.  Leading anti-nuclear activists in Tahiti will
join the ship on its protest voyage to Moruroa, including the
mayor of Faa'a and independence leader Oscar Temaru, and a
representative of Hiti Tau (a local anti-nuclear group), Pastor
Temarama Arapari.
 
<P>Meanwhile Foreign Minister Gareth Evans is in New Zealand for
talks with the New Zealand government on the response of South
Pacific nations to the proposed resumption of French nuclear
testing in the Pacific.

<H4>PRESS RELEASE
 
RAINBOW WARRIOR DEPARTS PAPEETE FOR MORUROA ATOLL
 </H4><body>
<P>Monday July 3 1995 1630 local time, Papeete:- The Rainbow
Warrior departed Papeete this afternoon bound for the French
nuclear test site at Moruroa.
 
<P>Hundreds of Tahitian supporters blew conch shells, waved flags
and decorated the ship and its crew with lei (floral necklaces)
and greenery as it departed Papeete at 4.30pm local time, with a
crew of 31 on board.  The crew include the French Catholic bishop
Monsigneur Gaillot, Tahitian anti-nuclear activist Pasteur
Temarama, and  the anti-nuclear pro-independence leader, Oscar
Temaru.
 
<P>Moruroa atoll is 1000 kilometres (650 miles) east of Papeete, and
the voyage time to the atoll is estimated at 3-4 days.
 
<P>While in Papeete, the crew of the Rainbow Warrior participated in
demonstrations and events opposing nuclear testing, which saw a
record 15,000 people on the streets on Thursday, a commemoration
of the 29th anniversary of the first nuclear test at Moruroa on
Sunday, blockades of Papeete for  72 hours, and an ecumenical
open-air mass and protest drawing several thousand people on
Sunday afternoon.
 
<P>"We set sail for Moruroa with the knowledge that the people of
Tahiti and millions of people worldwide back our call for an end
to nuclear testing, everywhere and forever," Greenpeace's
Stephanie Mills said.  "The risks we face in challenging the
resumption of French testing at Moruroa are real and serious; but
they are worth taking if we can stop the greater danger to
nuclear non-proliferation posed by more tests by France."
 
<P>Greenpeace France's Jean-Luc Thierry said President Chirac had
seriously underestimated public opposition to a resumption of
nuclear testing in France, Tahiti and internationally.
 
<P>"This voyage challenges the dangerous illusion of nuclear
grandeur, the lack of democracy and the disregard for the
environment and peoples of the South Pacific inherent in Chirac's
decision," he said.  "We hope that when we return to Tahiti the
nuclear cloud will have lifted over both this country and the
Pacific."
 
<P>The crew of the Rainbow Warrior are aged between 21 and 70, and
come from ten different countries, including France, Tahiti,
Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United States, New
Zealand, Australia, Fiji and the Solomon Islands.

<head><H4>GREENPEACE WELCOMES CALL BY MITTERRAND FOR END TO NUCLEAR
ARMS RACE
 </H4></head><body>
<P>Pacific Ocean, Tuesday July 4 1995:- Greenpeace today welcomed
former President Mitterrand's public condemnation of President
Chirac's decision to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific.
 
<P>The former president also told a French weekly news magazine,
L'Express, that "the time has come to put an end to the nuclear
armaments race".
 
<P>Greenpeace France's Jean-Luc Thierry, on board the Rainbow
Warrior which is en route to the Moruroa test site to protest the
resumption of testing, said Mitterrand's comments showed that bi-partisan
consensus in France on nuclear deterrence was now a
thing of the past.
 
<P>"President Mitterrand may have had a belated conversion to the
only sane and rational position - that the nuclear arms race
must stop - but at least he is several steps ahead of President
Chirac," Thierry said.  "President Chirac is trying to portray
the international opposition to France's decision to resume
testing as a conspiracy against French interests, but the
statements by the former President show how controversial
Chirac's decision is domestically in France."
 
<P>Thierry said Greenpeace was confident millions of people in
France and globally supported the organisation's voyage of
protest to the test site.  The Rainbow Warrior is currently
around 200 miles south-east of Papeete, Tahiti.

<H4>GREENPEACE CALLS FRENCH CLAIMS OF SAFETY AT MORUROA A CRUEL
HOAX</H4>

<P>Pacific Ocean, July 4 1995:- Greenpeace today said a
"confidential report" from the French Government claiming that
nuclear tests at Moruroa were safe was a cruel hoax on the people
of the Pacific.
 
<P>The report has not been released, but samples taken included
elevated levels of the radionuclide Cobalt-60, most likely
attributable to atmospheric testing, according to a scientist
involved in the project that has spoken to Greenpeace.
 
<P>The "confidential report" was a short and limited study of
approximately twenty samples taken at random from four areas of
the Moruroa lagoon late last year, under the coordination of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, according to other scientists
involved in the project.  The samples included crustacean, fish,
shellfish and soil samples. 
 
<P>One official involved in the sampling said it was a small and
limited study and could therefore draw only limited conclusions
about the safety of nuclear testing, certainly not ones related
to the long term impacts of underground nuclear tests. 
 
<P>Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills, aboard the Rainbow Warrior en route
to Moruroa atoll, said it was outrageous that the French
authorities could claim that the data showed no risk, and yet
refuse to release the report itself.
 
<P>"This issue is too important to the people of Tahiti and the
Pacific to use for cheap publicity shots to try and dilute
opposition to nuclear testing. The French authorities have a
moral obligation to fully disclose all the data they have to the
people of Tahiti," she said.
 
<P>Greenpeace France's Jean-Luc Thierry said: "If testing is so
safe, why have the the medical records of workers at Moruroa been
kept secret, and why has no long-term follow-up study of worker
health at Moruroa been conducted? It is simply not credible to
make claims of complete health and environmental safety  on the
basis of a few samples.  It is now indisputable that fallout from
atmospheric testing will lead to 430,000 excess cancer fatalities
world-wide by the year 2000.  To claim that atmospheric tests had
no ecological or health consquences goes against all the evidence
from other nuclear weapon states and from the international
scientific community."
 
<P>He said that concluding from a few samples that underground tests
pose no threat either now or in the future indicated the French
authorities either severely underestimated the risks or were
willfully misleading the public.  He said multidisciplinary teams
of scientists independent of the nuclear industry were needed to
do a wide-ranging, comprehensive assessment that would require
many hundreds of samples and tests to be undertaken.

<head><H4>FRENCH WARSHIP TAILS RAINBOW WARRIOR AS IT NEARS MORUROA </H4></head><body>
<P>
 
 
Pacific Ocean, 2200 hours local time, Wednesday July 5:- A French
warship today began tailing the Rainbow Warrior as the ship
sailed toward the French nuclear test site at Moruroa atoll.
 
<P>The French warship, which is monitoring the Rainbow Warrior from
a distance of around 12 miles, first appeared on radar at 0400 am
local time.  It has stayed continuously on the horizon since then
and is now following the Rainbow Warrior at a range of 9.3 miles.
 
<P>Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills said French surveillance of the
Rainbow Warrior would not deter Greenpeace from its protest
mission to Moruroa.
 
<P>"The threat of force and military surveillance will not stop us
from undertaking non-violent action to prevent a resumption of
nuclear testing at Moruroa," she said.  "France may make a show
of its military might, but this cannot stop the force of world
opinion which is so clearly opposed to further nuclear testing."
 
<P>The Greenpeace crew today visited the atoll of Hereheretue,
midway between Tahiti and Moruroa, at the invitation of the local
people.  The remote atoll, which has a population of around 20
people and is visited only once a month by ship, was visited by
the Rainbow Warrior in 1992 on a previous voyage to Moruroa.
At an outdoor meal of traditional Polynesian food, the chief of
the village endorsed Greenpeace's mission to Moruroa.
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior is now under sail toward Moruroa and is
expected to arrive near the 12 mile zone within the next 72
hours.

<P>Pacific Ocean, 7 July 1995, 12 noon NZ time -- The French warship currently
tailing the Rainbow Warrior suddenly changed course today in order to evade two
Greenpeace inflatables approaching the naval vessel to deliver a letter of
protest.<br>
In an apparent attempt to disguise its presence, the French naval vessel also
turned off its navigation lights temporarily, in violation of maritime law.

<P>The French warship is thought to be the Dumont D'Urville, which was last seen in
Tahiti five days ago. The ship, which is armed with surface-to-air missiles,
40mm guns and carries a helicopter, has now resumed its position and is again
monitoring the Rainbow Warrior from a distance of around 12 miles.
 
<P>Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills said armed surveillance of the Rainbow Warrior
would not deter Greenpeace from its protest mission to Moruroa.
 
<P>"The threat of force and armed surveillance will not deter us from our
non-violent protest to prevent the tests resuming at Moruroa," she said. "The French
military may try to make a show of its military might, but they cannot stop the force of
world opinion which is clearly opposed to nuclear testing."

<P>The Rainbow Warrior is now under sail towards Moruroa and is expected to arrive
near the 12 mile zone within the next two days.

<H4><head>RAINBOW WARRIOR LAUNCHES APPEAL TO PRESIDENT CHIRAC ON EVE
               OF ARRIVAL AT MORUROA TEST SITE</head>
</H4><body>
 
<P>West of Moruroa, July 7, 2100 local time -- (GP) On the eve of
its arrival at the Moruroa nuclear test site, the Rainbow Warrior
has sent an open letter to French President Jacques Chirac,
urging him to reconsider his decision to resume nuclear testing
at the atoll.
 
<P>Greenpeace's Jean-Luc Thierry, on board the Rainbow Warrior, said
President Chirac would do more for the grandeur of France by
honoring France's commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty and continuing to respect the testing moratorium than by
developing new nuclear weapons.
 
<P>"Like the fission reaction which is required to create a nuclear
bomb, the danger is that France's decision to break its
moratorium on nuclear testing could set a whole chain reaction
of nuclear proliferation in train," he said.  "The signal to the
other nuclear powers is that they can follow France in developing
new nuclear bombs, and the message to non-nuclear countries is
that France is prepared to betray its own commitments to exercise
the "utmost restraint" over testing."
 
<P>Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills said France was endangering the
completion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as well as its own
international reputation by resuming nuclear testing at Moruroa
atoll.  
 
<P>"The peaceful protest at President Chirac's decision is
unstoppable," she said.  Claims by the French authorities that
they could outnumber Greenpeace's ship and inflatables would not
deter the Rainbow Warrior, she said.
 
<P>"We know the French authorities have greater resources than
Greenpeace, but on our side is the force of international public
opinion and the commitment and creativity of our crew," she said.

<P>"The determination of the small group of people on board the
Rainbow Warrior to peacefully protest nuclear testing is greater
than the force of a military force defending an unjust cause far
from home."
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior is due to arrive off the test site within the
next 24 hours.

<P>TEXT of Appeal to M. Jacques Chirac, President of the French
Republic
 
<P>ON this day when the Rainbow Warrior appraoches France's nuclear
test site in the Pacific, we address to you a new appeal.  On
board our ship carrying our hope for a "green peace", we - 26
citizens of 10 different nationalities - are also citizens of a
world which is becoming more and more inter-related in both the
progress it makes and the conflicts that beset it.
 
<P>Together, we share the conviction that an immediate and
comprehensive treaty banning all nuclear tests would ensure the
international community would find new paths to assure its
security and its future.
 
<P>Arguing that you are defending the supreme interests of France
and the integrity of its national deterrent, you have taken the
decision to proceed with further nuclear tests.  But where now
are France's enemies, and how would its deterrent assure its
security?  The fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold
War offers the world a unique opportunity to opt for a safer
future.  And French diplomacy, whose voice is heard and respected
in many international fora, is now  criticised by dozens of
countries, among them many of its traditional friends.  Hasn't
France taken a wrong turn?
 
<P>Fifty years after having light the nuclear fire, humanity
continues to multiply the ways of mastering these weapons which
threaten the destruction of our planet.  Like the fission process
which creats this bomb of such enormous destructive capability,
the French decision to break its moratorium on nuclear testing
can set another kind of chain reaction in train.  Not only could
nuclear powers who have continued to respect the moratorium
follow France in modernising their nuclear weapons but other
countries tempted by nuclear weapons will see that there is only
weak pressure against those who seek to acquire the status of
nuclear powers.  This would be a dark day in the history of
humanity.
 
<P>We urge you today to listen to the voice of a handful of people
aboard a ship of peace, but also to listen to the strong concern
of millions of people around the world.  M. le President, in
reversing your decision to go ahead with nuclear testing, in
honouring the commitments of France to the Non-Proliferation
Treaty, you would do more for the grandeur of your country than
nuclear warheads ever will.
 
<P>Yours sincerely
 
 
 
<P><pre>Jean-Luc Thierry                Stephanie Mills

<H4><head>VETERAN GREENPEACE VESSEL VEGA JOINS RAINBOW WARRIOR 
                 FOR NUCLEAR TEST SITE PROTEST</head></H4><body>
 
<P>Saturday July 8, 1600 hours local time -- (GP) The Rainbow
Warrior rendezvoused today with veteran Greenpeace protest vessel
Vega outside the Moruroa test site while four French military
ships waited in the vicinity tracking Greenpeace's movements. 
Military aircraft have also been reported in the area.
 
<P>The two Greenpeace vessels, which are to be joined by the Danish
ship Bifrost, are currently hove to an estimated 25 miles off
Moruroa atoll, where France plans to resume nuclear testing.
 
<P>The Vega sailed to Moruroa in 1972, 1973, 1981, 1982 and 1985. 
In 1972 the Vega was rammed by a French frigate and in 1973  a
Greenpeace activist nearly lost an eye after being badly beaten
by French commandos.

<P>As the two vessels met 40 miles from the test site, French
military surveillance moved closer, with the frigate Vendemiaire
closing in from a 12 mile range toward the two sailing vessels
at a speed of 15 knots.  It is currently one nautical mile from
the Rainbow Warrior.
 
<P>"Greenpeace's commitment to oppose nuclear tests, by whatever
nation, is absolute and uncompromising regardless of the scale
of military force which opposes us," Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills
said from on board the SV Rainbow Warrior. "We have always said
that as long as France tested at the atoll, we would return to
Moruroa.  The participation of the Vega in our protest voyage
signals Greenpeace's consistent challenge over more than 20 years
to those who wish to continue the madness of nuclear testing."
 
<P>The Vega, which sailed from Panama five weeks ago, is a 12 metre
ketch.

<H4><head>RAINBOW WARRIOR AND GREENPEACE INFLATABLES ENTER 
                    FRENCH MORUROA TEST SITE</head>
</H4><body>


  
<P>Sunday July 9 0500 hours local time -- (GP) Defying the warnings
of the French navy, the Rainbow Warrior and its inflatables have
entered the 12 mile exclusion zone around Moruroa atoll,
attempting to delay preparations for French nuclear tests
underway at the site.
 
<P>At 5 a.m. local time, on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the
bombing of the first Rainbow Warrior, the ship's namesake crossed
the 12 mile test zone limit established by the French. 
Simultaneously, four inflatables were launched from the Warrior
at 2 a.m. and 3.30 a.m., ten miles apart from each other, and
entered the zone around the Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls.  Four
French warships are now circling the Rainbow Warrior, while two
other military vessels have been pursuing the Greenpeace vessel
Vega and the Danish vessel Bifrost.
 
<P>"We aim to delay tests at the atoll by attempting to disrupt the
testing facilities in the Moruroa lagoon," Greenpeace's Stephanie
Mills said from on board the Rainbow Warrior. "The safety of our
ship and crew are paramount, but we are prepared to risk the
force of the French military if we can stop the greater danger
of nuclear testing at Moruroa and Fangataufa."
 
<P>"The bombing of the Rainbow Warrior and Fernando Pereira's death
on 10 July 19085 is in all our minds," she said.  "We feel the
best way to honour Fernando's memory is to help ending nuclear
tests forever."
 
<P>Greenpeace France's Jean-Luc Thierry said President Chirac would
do more for the grandeur of France by keeping its promises under
the Non-Proliferation Treaty than by developing and testing new
nuclear weapons.  He said Greenpeace's protest reflected public
anger at Chirac's decision in France, French Polynesia and around
the world.
 
<P>The crew of the four inflatables are: Madaleen Habib (Australia)
and Julien Prieur (France); Philip Pupuka (Solomon Islands) and
Mimo Casa (Italy); Todd Thompson (New Zealand) and Letitia
Rastoin (France); Richard Leney (UK) and Kate Lecci (New
Zealand).

<H4><head>FRENCH COMMANDOS USE TEAR GAS TO STORM RAINBOW WARRIOR.  </head>
</H4><body>

  
<P>Sunday July 9 19:45 GMT - (GP) Some 150 French Commandos surrounded
and stormed the Rainbow Warrior earlier today.  Commandos threw tear gas 
cannisters on board and doors onboard the ship were knocked down and
windows smashed. Monsignor Gaillot, a French Roman Catholic bishop on
board the ship, was removed by the French and taken away on an
inflatable. 

<P>Communication with the ship were cut and no communications have taken
place since the boarding.  The safety and whereabouts of the boat's crew
and the five journalists on board is still unknown.

<P>The raid took place as the Rainbow Warrior entered the 12 mile exclusion
zone around the Moruroa test site, where activists hoped to delay
preparations for French nuclear tests underway at the site.  The Rainbow
Warrior came within 4 miles of the atoll's lagoon before being boarded
according to the last phone contact with the ship's crew.
 
<P>At 5 a.m. local time, on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the bombing
of the first Rainbow Warrior, the ship's namesake crossed the 12 mile
test-zone limit established by the French.  

<P>Just prior to that, Greenpeace launched four small inflatables. At
least one of the inflatables reached the lagoon inside Moruroa
Atoll. 

<P>"Storming the ship and using tear gas is an outrage against
peaceful protest and world opinion that these tests are unacceptable.
Despite this act of blatant aggression Greenpeace is pledged to continue
its non-violent campaign to stop the resumption of nuclear testing at
Moruroa.

<P>The people in the four inflatables were: Madaleen Habib (Australia) and
Julien Prieur (France); Philip Pupuka (Solomon Islands) and Mimo Casa
(Italy); Todd Thompson (New Zealand) and Letitia Rastoin (France);
Richard Leney (UK) and Kate Lecci (New Zealand).

everyone is safe and that they are free to leave but must
ascertain whether the Rainbow Warrior is in fact seaworthy. 
Stephanie reports that the ship was rammed quite hard by a French

on its own.

<P>A press release from the Rainbow Warrior will follow shortly.

Off Moruroa atoll, 1230 a.m. local time July 10 (1030pm GMT) --
The Rainbow Warrior is now being towed under duress from the
Moruroa nuclear test site into international waters by the French

the Vega, with three people aboard is still in the vicinity of
the test site.  Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills, on board the
Rainbow Warrior, said France should stop preparations for tests
while the activists remained undetected in the area.

<P>The activists aboard the inflatable are David McTaggart,
(Greenpeace's honorary chairman and a veteran of protests at the
site), Henk Haazen (Dutch) and Chris Robinson (Australian).  The
Greenpeace vessel Vega and a Danish vessel Bifrost are also near
the test site, in international waters.

<P>So far unreported by French authorities, Greenpeace activists
yesterday occupied the nuclear test drilling rig inside the
Moruroa lagoon in protest at France's decision to resume testing
there in September in an unprecedented breach of military
security at the test site,.
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior was boarded just off the pass into the lagoon
by French commandos who broke into the bridge and used tear gas
to force crew from the ship at 0630 a.m. local time. Commandos
split open the radio room door with an axe and used tear gas to
drive two crew (Thom Looney, radio officer and Stephanie Mills,
campaigner) to climb out of the porthole and onto the bridge
above.  The Rainbow Warrior was rammed by a large tug, causing
damage to its bow, before being towed to a mooring point inside
the lagoon.  
 
<P>Greenpeace France's Jean-Luc Thierry said the French military had
taken the easy resort to violence so stop Greenpeace's peaceful
protest.  "But no amount of force can weaken Greenpeace's
determination to stop nuclear testing at Moruroa and worldwide,"
he said. "President Chirac cannot ignore the strength of
international opinion against a resumption of testing at the
atoll." 
 
<P>Three out of four Greenpeace inflatables -- launched outside the
12 mile exclusion zone around the atoll at 2 a.m. and 3.30 a.m.
yesterday local time -- suceeded in entering the lagoon and
reaching the drilling rig, in spite of French navy claims last
week that the French authorities had sufficient resources to
repel Greenpeace.  Two activists, Richard Leney (British) and
Madaleine Habib (Australia), scaled the drilling rig and occupied
it for more than 20 minutes.  The Greenpeace inflatable crews
were then boarded by commandos after a two hour chase through the
exclusion zone and lagoon.
 
<P>The 23 crew from both the inflatables and the Rainbow Warrior
were then transferred to Moruroa and held and interrogated by
French military police for more than 15 hours.  Crew identified
themselves merely as Fernando Pereira, the Greenpeace
photographer who was killed by French secret service agents when
they bombed the first Rainbow Warrior in Auckland harbour on July
10 1985.
 
<P>"The best commemoration of Fernando's death we could offer was
our action today," Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills said.  "An end
to nuclear testing now and forever is what Fernando would have
wanted us to be fighting for."
 
<P>The French authorities have demanded that the Rainbow Warrior be
towed into international waters without three out of four of its
inflatables and their safety and navigational equipment. The
Greenpeace crew refused to return to their vessel without this
equipment, and staged a sit-in at the Moruroa dock.  Around 100
French Foreign Legionnaires surrounded the crew and eventually
bodily lifted people into a transport vessel which ferried them
to the Rainbow Warrior.
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior is now under tow, under duress, by the French
Navy, and will be taken into international waters outside the
atoll's 12 mile exclusion zone. The French Navy have said they
will escort the vessel once it is in international waters for an
unspecified time afterwards.
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior's skipper, David Enever (UK), said the
Rainbow Warrior would remain in the vicinity of the test site
while further protest activity was discussed.  Stephanie Mills
said Greenpeace would be uncompromising in its oposition to all
nuclear testing worldwide and would scale up its protests
internationally at France's plans to resume testing in September.

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 
    
  
<P>Off Moruroa atoll, Monday July 10, 1600 hours local time -- The
Rainbow Warrior is making a rendezvous with the Greenpeace yacht
Vega and the Danish vessel Bifrost today, 12 hours after being
towed by the French Navy into international waters outside the
Moruroa test site.
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior was boarded and towed into the Moruroa lagoon
yesterday before she and her crew being released by French
authorities.
 
<P>Meanwhile, a Greenpeace inflatable with three crew on board
remains undetected in the vicinity of the test site. 
Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills, on board the Rainbow Warrior, said
Greenpeace would continue to scale up its protest as long as the
French authorities continued to prepare for a resumption of
nuclear testing at Moruroa.  She said the inflatable crew would
remain at the test site and was prepared stay around or go into
the atoll to further disrupt preparations for testing there.
 
<P>The three people aboard the inflatable are Henk Haazen
(Netherlands), Chris Robinson (Australia) and honourary chairman
of Greenpeace, David McTaggart (Canada).  All are very
experienced seafarers, equipped with full emergency and safety
gear and able to communicate with Greenpeace.
 
<P>The three sailing vessels will meet to discuss further plans for
protest against French nuclear testing in the South Pacific and
to re-supply the Bifrost which has been at sea since leaving the
Cook Islands on June 29.  They will also celebrate the 39th
birthday of Steve Sawyer, currently on board the Vega.  Steve was
celebrating his 29th birthday on July 10 1985, when the first
Rainbow Warrior was bombed by French secret service agents in
Auckland harbour, killing photographer Fernando Pereira.
 
<P>Also aboard the Vega is Manuel Miroglio (France) and Jean-Marc
van Chinh (France).

<H4><head>RAINBOW WARRIOR SAILS FOR TAHITI FOR BASTILLE DAY; 
OTHER VESSELS CONTINUE TO MONITOR TEST SITE</head>
</H4><body>
 
<P>Off Moruroa, 12pm July 11 local time:- The Rainbow Warrior today
sails for Papeete, Tahiti from the nuclear test site at Moruroa,
to support Tahitian protest against nuclear testing on Bastille
Day, July 14th.
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior, which was boarded and tear-gassed by French
commandos two days ago, is now in international waters outside
the nuclear test site.  Two other protest vessels, the Vega and
the Bifrost, are hove to outside the test site, and a Greenpeace
inflatable with David McTaggart, Henk Haazen and Chris Robinson
aboard remain undetected in the vicinity of Moruroa.
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior will sail from Moruroa this afternoon local
time and expects to arrive Papeete by midday July 14th.  Its
arrival will coincide with protests at French embassies and
consulates around the world at President Chirac's decision to
resume nuclear tests at the atoll in September.
 
<P>Greenpeace France's Jean-Luc Thierry, aboard the Rainbow Warrior,
said the Rainbow Warrior would show solidarity with the Tahitian
people in their strong opposition to nuclear tests.
 
<P>"The real revolutionary spirit of Bastille Day will be more
present in the streets of Papeete with those who protest the
resumption of testing than amongst the military preparing their
deadly task at Moruroa," he said.  "The vision of liberty,
equality and fraternity is meaningless for the people of
Polynesia while tests continue."
 
<P>Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills said liberty from nuclear testing
would be the best present France could offer the international
community on Bastille Day.
 
<P>"The Greenpeace protest will continue and increase both at
Moruroa and around the world," she said.  "Our inflatable crew
remain undetected in the vicinity of the test site, the Vega is
on the edge of the 12 mile exclusion zone, and the Rainbow
Warrior will be back."

<H4><head>VEGA HARRASSED BY FRENCH MILITARY HELICOPTER</head>
</H4><body>
 
<P>
 

<P>Off Moruroa, 1200 hours local time, Thursday July 13:- The
Greenpeace yacht Vega was this morning harrassed by a low-flying
helicopter as it remains on stand-by outside the Moruroa test
site.
 
<P>The helicopter passed several times one hundred foot or less
above the vessel, creating havoc with the Vega's sailing rig.
But Steve Sawyer, the skipper on board the Vega, said the crew
remained undeterred.
 
<P>"Dangerous flying by helicopters, the presence of warships and
other surveillance will not intimidate us or stop our peaceful
protest," he told the SV Rainbow Warrior by marine radio.  "It
is
ironic that as France invokes the spirit of "liberty, equality
and fraternity" on Bastille Day, the French military is trying
to
prevent us exercising our democratic right to protest."
 
<P>The Vega is prepared to stay off the Moruroa test site
indefinitely, and is currently accompanied by the Danish Viking
vessel, Bifrost.  The Rainbow Warrior is en route to Tahiti, and
is expected to arrive in the harbour of Papeete at 0900 local
time, Friday 14 July to join Tahitians protesting at nuclear
testing.

<H4><head>    GREENPEACE PROTESTERS ON STILTS 
        DISRUPT FRENCH AMBASSADOR'S BASTILLE DAY PARTY</head>
</H4><body>
 
<P>
 
                                 

<P>LONDON, 14 July, 1995 -- A secret Bastille Day celebration held
at the French Ambassador's residence in London was disrupted
today by over 100 Greenpeace activists - some of them twelve foot
tall on stilts.  The protesters jumped over fences and invaded
a garden party held at the Ambassador's residence in Kensingston
Gardens. 

<P>Greenpeace took this action to protest against proposed nuclear
testing by the French Government at Morurua Atoll in the South
Pacific.  French President Chirac has now confirmed that some of
these tests are for the development of new warheads for the next
century.
 
<P>Janet Convery of Greenpeace UK said "Bastille Day is
traditionally a celebration of liberty.   Rather than liberating
the world from nuclear testing, France has now admitted that they
plan to extend their nuclear arsenal into the next century."
 
<P>To escalate the campaign against French testing Greenpeace will
today call on people throughout the world who can join the
environmental organization aboard their own vessels at Moruroa
Atoll to prevent the resumption of tests in September.  "We want
people to come together in a Peace Flotilla to Moruroa.  France
must acknowledge the force of world opinion and listen to the
people of Polynesia and everywhere. It must cancel these tests
immediately."
 
<P>Today's protest at the Ambassador's residence coincides with
similar protests across the world. Greenpeace is organising
demonstrations and protests in Australia, Austria, Brazil,
Greece, Ireland,Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Slovakia, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland and the USA.
 
<P>The Greenpeace ship, the Rainbow Warrior, is due to arrive in
Tahiti to mark Bastille Day protests there. Earlier in the week
the ship was towed out of the 12 mile exclusion zone around
Morurua Atoll.  Three Greenpeace activists remain somewhere
within the exclusion zone. They promise to remain there to
disrupt the preparation's for the nuclear tests.

<title>FRANCE  TESTING NEW NUCLEAR WEAPONS - AUST  MUST  UPGRADE
PROTEST</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>FRANCE TESTING NEW NUCLEAR WEAPONS - AUSTRALIA  MUST  UPGRADE
PROTEST</h2>
<p>
 

 
<p>SYDNEY,  July  14, 1995 - The Australian government  must
pull out all stops in its protest action after admissions
by  the  French government that it will test new  nuclear
weapons in the Pacific which threaten to restart a global
arms race.
 
<p>French  President Jacques Chirac reportedly  told  French
senators overnight that: "we want to try our new  nuclear
warhead,  then to carry out two tests on the safety,  the
security and the effectiveness of our detonators and  the
effect  on  ageing  on them." This was the  first  public
admission  that  the French government were  testing  new
weapons rather than testing existing weapons for "safety,
security   and   eliability"  and   developing   computer
simulation technology.
 
<p>Australian  Foreign  Minister Gareth Evans  had  defended
Australia's  soft  reaction to  the  French  decision  to
resume nuclear testing on the basis of an assurance  from
French  Foreign  Minister  Herve  de  Charette  that  new
weapons would not be tested.
 
<p>Yesterday a spokeswoman for Senator Evans reportedly said
"The French foreign minister gave us an assurance that no
new  warheads were being developed...so we're not  taking
further
action."
 
<p>However   Jane's   Defence  Weekly,  the  internationally
respected  defence journal, reported on June  24  1995  :
"military sources said another major reason for the tests
was  to  carry out vital preparatory work on two  weapons
systems  that are to form the backbone of French  nuclear
defences after the year 2000. These
are  the M-5 missile that is to equip the country's fleet
of    SSBN's    from   2010   and   France's   long-range
air-to-surface ASLP missile which the new Rafale  fighter
aircraft will carry".
 
<p>The  scientific  Journal New Scientist on  June  24  also
reported  France would use the Pacific nuclear  tests  to
design  a  new  warhead. It quotes Marc  Launois,  deputy
director   of  the  military  applications  division   of
France's  Atomic  Energy Commission as saying  the  tests
would be used to "perfect" French weapons.
President   Chirac   on  March  16   1995,   during   his
presidential  campaign, stated on French television  that
his  "first  task"  was  to ensure the  modernisation  of
France's strategic nuclear forces.
 
<p>Greenpeace national nuclear campaigner Ben Pearson  said:
"Australia  has  clearly  been  deceived  and  needs   to
urgently  strengthen  its response given  that  the  real
purpose  of  these  tests is now  known  to  develop  new
nuclear  weapons. "The development of new nuclear weapons
by  the  French risks starting a new arms race  and  also
undermines  international talks on a  comprehensive  test
ban treaty."

<P>
<P><H4>Below is an open letter sent to the Admiral in charge of French 
Pacific forces  in order to clarify all the inaccurate claims 
made by the French Government about Greenpeace's protest at 
Moruroa
 </H4>
 
<P>Admiral Philippe Euverte
Supreme Commander of French Armed Forces in French Polynesia  
 
 
<P>Papeete, 14 July 1995
 
 
 
<P>Admiral Euverte,
 
<P>I am writing to you in your capacity as the Supreme Commander of 
French Armed Forces in French Polynesia, in response to some of 
the grossly inaccurate claims which have been made about
Greenpeace's recent protest actions at Moruroa.
 
<P>I strongly object to the misinformation which is being
spread about the Greenpeace's intentions in exercising our 
legitimate right to peaceful protest against the decision by 
France to resume testing of nuclear weapons in the South 
Pacific. I further object to the unlawful, excessive and 
inappropriate use of force employed by the armed forces acting 
under your orders against the Rainbow Warrior and her crew.
 
<P>Specifically it has been alleged, in justification of your 
actions, that:
 
<P>     -Greenpeace intended to scupper the Rainbow Warrior or 
drive       it aground at Moruroa;
 
<P>     -the degree of force employed by French commandoes was     
        necessary in order to rapidly gain control of the 
Rainbow       Warrior;
 
 <P>    -the Rainbow Warrior was not rammed, but damaged while 
under      tow;
   
<P>     -the crew of the Rainbow Warrior was not under arrest and  
    were free to walk around the atoll.
<P>All the above claims are untrue and grossly inaccurate and I can 
only conclude that they have been made in order to mislead the 
media and public from the critical issues and divert attention 
from the excessive and inappropriate use of force by troops 
acting under your authority.
 
 
 
 
<P>I stress that Greenpeace:-
 
<P>     -has never had nor has any intention of scuppering the     
       Rainbow Warrior at Moruroa.  On the contrary, the safety 
of      my ship and crew has always been paramount;
 
<P>     -has always and will always adhere firmly to the principles 
     of non-violence as we have repeatedly stressed and which   
   ought to be well known from our previous activities.        
The use of tear gas in a confined space, particularly           
   against three crew members in the radio room when you        
      already had control of the ship, was totally unnecessary, 
     wholly unjustified and grossly violent.
 
<P>     -the Rainbow Warrior was rammed by your vessel, the
     "Rari", subsequent to the boarding of the Rainbow Warrior  
      and the throwing of tear gas onto the bridge.  It took 
place      after I had already disabled the engines and left the 
     bridge.  This incident caused the damage to our bow, and   
   took place several hours before towing of the Rainbow      
Warrior into the lagoon. The ramming was filmed and has been    
   viewed by millions around the world.  The claim that it was  
    not rammed is incomprehensible. The ramming was, like the   
   boarding, illegal, unnecessary and violent.
     
<P>     -If in fact the crew of the Warrior were not under arrest, 
     then their interrogation for 15 hours, fingerprinting and  
    photographing were not compatible with international legal  
    norms. My crew and myself were certainly not free to walk   
   around the atoll. On the contrary, we were forcibly kept in  
    three separate locations on the atoll, and attempts to move 
     were blocked by  physical force. Moreover, as no legal     
 charges have been laid against us, it appears that the      
seizing of the three inflatables and safety equipment from      
my ship has no legal  foundation.
 
<P>Greenpeace vessels and crew have a right to peaceful protest and 
free navigation under international law and will continue to  
exercise that right. Conversely, France has no right to impose a 
military exclusion zone around Moruroa atoll for the purpose of 
underground nuclear testing, let alone when no testing is taking 
place, any more than France had a right to impose a 200 mile 
exclusion zone in 1973 or a 30 mile zone in 1985.
 
<P>I can assure you that Greenpeace intends to pursue its peaceful 
protest against the decision by France to resume testing of 
nuclear weapons in violation of its international commitments. 
Our objective is to ensure that all testing of nuclear weapons 
is permanently halted. 
 
 
 <P>Accordingly, I wish to receive your assurance that forces acting 
under your orders will be given new orders which require them to 
refrain from the excesses displayed in ramming, boarding and 
seizing the Rainbow Warrior at our protest. 
 
<P>I trust, also, on the basis of the information contained in this 
letter, that French authorities will accurately reflect our 
intentions and capabilities and that the misleading claims will 
cease to be made.
 <P>This letter is written without prejudice to our right to seek 
legal redress under applicable law. 
              
 
 
               <P> Yours sincerely,<br>

RAINBOW WARRIOR SAILS FOR FIJI TO PREPARE FOR FLOTILLA AT MORUROA</H4>
 
<P>Papeete, July 17 1900 local time --  The Rainbow Warrior has
sailed tonight from Papeete for Rarotonga and Fiji, to prepare
for a return to Moruroa with a flotilla of protest vessels.
 
<P>Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills said the Rainbow Warrior would
appeal to South Pacific Forum governments based in Fiji to
further press President Chirac to reverse his decision to resume
nuclear tests at Moruroa in September.
 
<P>Commenting on reports that the Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel has said France would "modify" its decision to test
eight nuclear tests in the South Pacific, Stephanie Mills said:
 
<P>"The only acceptable "modification" of France's plans is a
complete end to testing immediately. But it is encouraging that
President Chirac appears to have opened his ears to the strong
opposition of the international community. If the reports are
accurate, it is clear that public pressure to stop testing is
working, and must continue and increase."
 
<P>She said the crew of the Rainbow Warrior also applauded the New
Zealand Government's decision to send an official vessel to
Moruroa along with a fleet of citizens' yachts, and welcomed
Prime Minister Bolger's announcement that it would pursue the
possibility of taking France to the World Court.
 
<P>"President Chirac's decision has touched a raw nerve world-wide,"
she said.  "The will of the international community is clearly
for progress toward nuclear disarmament and an immediate
comprehensive test ban treaty, not further nuclear proliferation
by France or any other state."
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior will arrive in Rarotonga, the Cook Islands,
in three days time.

        MV GREENPEACE TO JOIN MORUROA NUCLEAR TEST PROTEST 
                   AS PRESSURE ON FRANCE GROWS
  </H4></head><body>
<P>LONDON, Thursday July 20 -- The MV Greenpeace will sail next Monday
(July 24) from Barcelona to join the Rainbow Warrior, Vega and an
international peace flotilla at the Moruroa nuclear test site in the
South Pacific, Greenpeace announced today.
 
<P>In an escalation of pressure on France's President Chirac to reverse
his decision to resume nuclear testing in September, the MV
Greenpeace will join other vessels at Moruroa in late August.

<P>Greenpeace's Xavier Pastor, on board the MV Greenpeace, said the
ship's 20,000 kilometre voyage symbolised the opposition of millions
of Europeans uniting with protestors in the Pacific region against
nuclear testing.
 
<P>"We challenge European governments to listen to the anger of their
people and to oppose France's resumption of testing with the same
determination, urgency and commitment as Greenpeace," Pastor said.
"International condemnation of France's decision must increase over
the next few weeks if President Chirac is to see sense and abandon
the testing programme."
 <P>Speaking from the SV Rainbow Warrior en route to Fiji, Greenpeace's
Stephanie Mills said Greenpeace's presence at Moruroa -- currently
the yacht Vega, the Danish vessel Bifrost, and an inflatable hidden
in the vicinity of the test site -- would be dramatically increased
by the end of August.
 
<P>"We appeal again to the international community to join us in yachts
and boats outside the test site, to show President Chirac the
strength of opposition to nuclear testing," she said.  "The crew of
the Rainbow Warrior are committed to return to Moruroa, not alone but
with an international flotilla of protest."
 
<P>The MV Greenpeace will travel via the Panama Canal and its transit
to Moruroa is expected to take 40-50 days.  The ship will provide
support to the Rainbow Warrior and a fleet of vessels sailing from
New Zealand, Australia and other parts of the world.<br>

<H4>  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<p>         MCTAGGART AND GREENPEACE TEAM RETURN TO VEGA</H4>
 <BODY>
<P>COOK ISLANDS, 22 July, 1995 -- (GP)  Greenpeace today reported
that Hon. Chairman David McTaggart and the other two activists
on board the fifth Greenpeace zodiac have returned to the vessel
Vega after having been in the vicinity of the test site for two
weeks.
 
<P>According to Greenpeace, McTaggart and crew were near the French
test site but because radio communication is likely to be heavily
monitored by the French, the team could not give exact details
of where they were throughout their two week stay.  All are safe
and in good health.  The Vega crew report that the team were on
a nearby atoll outside the test site as reported by the French
Military but only briefly, not throughout their entire two weeks. 
A French warship remains near the Vega and Bifrost just outside
the 12-mile exclusion zone.
 
<P>"Now that David McTaggart and the other two activists have
returned to the Vega, we are making plans to meet with them to
discuss Greenpeace's next steps in our ongoing protest against
French nuclear testing," said Greenpeace Executive Director Steve
D'Esposito.  
 
<P>Greenpeace's major campaign effort to prevent the testing from
going forward has turned to organizing a sizable peace flotilla
of vessels from around the world to congregate around the test
site in September. 
 
<P>"Our political work and preparations for the peace flotilla are
well under way.  We believe this will be the most effective way
to demonstrate the international outrage and condemnation of a
resumption of nuclear testing," said D'Esposito. 
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior and the MV Greenpeace will lead the peace
flotilla near Moruroa as soon as both ships are equipped and the
Rainbow Warrior is repaired.  Both will attempt to stay in the
area for as long as possible.
 
<P>The fifth Greenpeace inflatable left the Rainbow Warrior on the
evening of Saturday July 8, 12 hours before the Rainbow Warrior
and four other inflatables entered the 12-mile exclusion zone
around Moruroa.  The original four inflatables reached the
drilling rig in the lagoon and two activists chained themselves
to it as the Rainbow Warrior was boarded by French commandos and
the crew tear-gassed.  
 
<P>French authorities have reported that the three Greenpeace
activists aboard the fifth inflatable were not inside the 12-mile
exclusion zone at any time.  Greenpeace radio contact with the
team confirms that although the activists did spend some time on
an atoll outside the 12-mile exclusion zone as the French
reported, they were there only briefly over the last two weeks.

<H4>  A FAIRE PARAITRE IMMEDIATEMENT

<p>         L'EQUIPE DE MCTAGGART ET GREENPEACE DE RETOUR SUR LE VEGA</H4>
 <BODY>
<P>ILES COOK, 22 Juillet 1995 -- (GP)  Greenpeace a annonc&eacute; aujourd'hui
que le president David McTaggart et les deux autres militants &agrave; bord du cinqui&egrave;me
zodiaque de Greenpeace sont rentr&eacute;s &agrave; bord du vaisseau Vega, apr&egrave;s
avoir pass&eacute deux semaines dans la vicinit&eacute; de la zone de tests.
 
<P>Selon Greenpeace, McTaggart et l'&eacute;quipage &eacute;taient pr&egrave;s du
site des essais, mais parce que les communications radios &eacute;taient tr&egrave;s
certainement surveill&eacute;es par le gouvernement fran&ccedil;ais, l'&eacute;quipe
ne pouvait pas donner de d&eacute;tails pr&eacute;cis quant &agrave; leur location
durant ces deux semaines. Tous sont sains et saufs.
L'&eacute;quipage du Vega a report&eacute; que l'&eacute;quipe a bien &eacute;t&eacute;
sur un atoll voisin de la zone d'essais, comme l'on dit les militaires fran&ccedil;ais,
mais seulement bri&egrave;vement, et non pas durant les deux semaines enti&egrave;res.
Un navire de guerre fran&ccedil;ais reste toujours pr&egrave;s du Vega et du Bifrost 
juste en dehors de la zone d'exclusion de 12 miles.

<P>"Maintenant que David McTaggart et les deux autres militants 
sont rentr&eacute;s a bord du Vega, nous pr&eacute;parons une r&eacute;union
avec eux, pour discuter des prochaines &eacute;tapes de la campagne contre les essais 
nucl&eacute;aires fran&ccedil;ais", a dit Steve D'Esposito, directeur 
g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Greenpeace.
 
<P>Le principal effort de  la campagne de Greenpeace
contre la reprise des essais est l'organisation d'un rendez-vous d'une
flotte pacifiste, un nombre consid&eacute;rable de vaisseaux venant du monde entier, 
se r&eacute;unissant
autour de la zone d'essais en Septembre.
 
<P>"Notre travail politique et les pr&eacute;parations
de  la flotte pacifiste sont bien avanc&eacute;es. Nous pensons
que c'est le meilleur moyen de montrer l'intense indignation internationale 
et de condamner la reprise des essais nucl&eacute;aires," a dit D'Esposito.


<P>Le Rainbow Warrior et le MV Greenpeace seront &agrave; la t&ecirc;te de cette 
flotte pacifiste pr&egrave;s de Moruroa, d&eacute;s que les deux vaisseaux sont
&eacute;quip&eacute;s et que le Rainbow Warrior est r&eacute;par&eacute;. Tout  
deux vont essayer de rester dans la r&eacute;gion aussi longtemps que possible.

<P>Le cinqui&egrave;me zodiaque de Greenpeace avait quit&eacute; le Rainbow Warrior  
le soir du Samedi 8 Juillet, soit 12 heures avant que le Rainbow Warrior et les quatres 
autres zodiaques n'entre dans la zone d'exclusion de 12 miles autour de 
Moruroa.  Les quatres zodiaques ont atteint le puits de creusage dans le lagon 
et les militants s'y sont ensuite encha&icirc;n&eacute;s, alors que le Rainbow Warrior
&eacute;tait pris d'assault  &agrave; l'aide de gaz lacrymog&egrave;ne.


<P>Les autorit&eacute;s fran&ccedil;aises ont report&eacute; que les trois militants &agrave;
bord du cinqui&egrave;me zodiaque n'avaient jamais &eacute;&eacute; &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur
de la zone d'exclusion de 12 miles.
Des contacts radio entre Greenpeace et l'&eacute;quipe ont confirm&eacute; 
que les militants avaient bien pass&eacute; du temps dans un atoll &agrave; 
l'exterieur de la zone d'exclusion, mais seulement bri&egrave;vement durant
ces deux semaines.

                         ESSAIS NUCLEAIRES:
    GREENPEACE ET CHIRAC DEVANT LE CONSEIL D'ETAT
</H4></head><body> 
<P>PARIS, 26 Juillet 1995 -- Cette semaine &agrave; Paris, Greenpeace 
a d&eacute;pos&eacute; un dossier  au Conseil d'Etat  contre la d&eacute;cision du 
pr&eacute;sident Chirac de reprendre les &eacute;ssais nucl&eacute;aires en 
Polyn&eacute;sie Fran&ccedil;aise.
 
<P>Le proc&egrave;s est attent&eacute; par Maitre Jean-Jacques de
Felice, pour Greenpeace France, et demande au Conseil d'Etat de juger
si la d&eacute;cision du pr&eacute;sident Chirac de reprendre les essais 
nucl&eacute;aires est bien conforme &agrave; la loi fran&ccedil;aise.  

<P>Les arguments de Greenpeace sont que le Pr&eacute;sident Chirac  a 
ignor&eacute; plusieurs principes cl&eacute;s de la  loi du 2 f&eacute;vrier 1995
concernant le R&eacute;enforcement de la Protection de l'Environement*. 
En particulier, le Principe de la Pr&eacute;caution*, le Principe de
l'Action Pr&eacute;ventive*, et l'obligation de consulter le public et
les organisations &eacute;cologiques avant de prendre une d&eacute;cision
qui pourrait affecter s&eacute;rieusement l'environement.
 
 <P>"De r&eacute;cents sondages en France ont montr&eacute;s que le publique 
fran&ccedil;ais ne comprends pas que la d&eacute;cision  de reprendre les essais 
nucl&eacute;aires ait &eacute;t&eacute; prise si rapidement et sans consultation
de la part du Pr&eacute;sident Chirac," a dit le pr&eacute;sident de Greenpeace-France 
R&eacute;mi Parmentier.  "Notre recours au Conseil d'Etat est notre derni&egrave;re 
chance d'ouvrir un d&eacute;bat publique avant qu'il ne soit trop tard."
 
<P>Greenpeace et Maitre Jean-Jacques de Felice vont pr&eacute;senter
plus d'information sur leur action l&eacute;gale devant le Conseil d'Etat lors d'une conf&eacute;rence 
de presse au Club de la Presse, 11 avenue d'Iena. Ils vont demander au Pr&eacute;sident
Chirac de suspendre les essais  nucl&eacute;aires jusqu'&agrave; ce que le Conseil
d'Etat ait pris sa d&eacute;cision.
<P>                                ####
 
<P><H4>QUOI:  UN RECOURS AU CONSEIL D'ETAT PAR GREENPEACE CONTRE JACQUES CHIRAC.
<P>QUAND:  JEUDI, 27 JUILLET, 10.00 AM.
<P>OU: A PARIS, AU CLUB DE LA PRESSE, 11 AVENUE D'IENA, METRO IENA.</H4>

<P>Note de l'Editeur:
<P>1.  La loi concernant le r&eacute;enforcement de la Protection de
l'environement at &eacute;t&eacute; vot&eacute; par l'Assembl&eacute;e Nationale 
en F&eacute;vrier 1995.  
Cette loi indique que le gouvernement doit consulter le publique et les
ONG &eacute;cologiques avant de prendre une d&eacute;cision qui pourrait
avoir de graves cons&eacute;quences sur l'environement.
Le Gouvernement doit aussi appliqu&eacute; un nombre de principes, comme
le Principe de Pr&eacute;caution et le Principe d'Action Pr&eacute;ventive.
 
<P>2.  Le Principe de  Pr&eacute;caution d&eacute;clare qu'en absence 
de certitude, prendre en compte le savoir scientifique et technique ne 
doit pas retarder l'adoption de mesures efficaces pour pr&eacute;venir tout risque 
s&eacute;rieux et irreversible de dommages &agrave; l'environement, au prix convenant.
 
<P>3.  Le Principe d'Action Pr&eacute;ventive indique que -avec priorit&eacute;  
&agrave; la source - les dommages &agrave; l'environement doivent &ecirc;tre 
&eacute;vit&eacute;s par les meilleurs moyens techniques disponibles.
 
<P>4. Le dossier de Greenpeace d&eacute;montre qu'aucunes des 
missions scientifiques  envoy&eacute;es &agrave; Moruroa avec la permission du
Gouvernement Fran&ccedil;ais n'a pu prouv&eacute; que les essais nucl&eacute;aires 
sous-terrains &eacute;taient sans risques.
Par-contre, elles ont toutes souligner un certain nombre d'incertitudes
scientifiques, notamment en relation avec les effets &agrave; long terme.

                         NUCLEAR TESTS:
    GREENPEACE TO TAKE CHIRAC TO FRANCE'S SUPREME COURT
</H4></head><body> 
<P>PARIS, 26 July, 1995 -- Greenpeace has filed suit in Paris this
week with France's Supreme Court (Conseil d'Etat) against French
President Chirac's decision to resume nuclear testing in French
Polynesia. 
 
<P>The legal action was taken by attorney Maitre Jean-Jacques de
Felice, on behalf of Greenpeace France, calling for the Supreme
Court to consider whether President Chirac's decision to resume
nuclear testing is actually legal under French law.  

<P>Greenpeace's case states that President Chirac has ignored
several key principles contained in the Law of 2nd February 1995
Regarding the Reinforcement of Environmental Protection*.  In
particular the Precautionary  Principle*, the Principle of
Preventive Action*, and the obligation to consult with the public
and environmental organizations before adopting decisions that
can seriously affect the environment.
 
<P>"Recent public opinion polls in France have shown that the French
public does not understand why the decision to resume nuclear
testing was taken so quickly and with no consultation by
President  Chirac," said Greenpeace-France's President  Remi
Parmentier.  "Our recourse at the Conseil d'Etat is the last

<P>Editor's note:
<P>1.  The Law Regarding the Reinforcement  of  Environmental 
Protection was passed by the French National Assembly in February
1995.  This law requires the French government to consult with
the public and environmental NGOs before making decision that may
seriously affect the environment. It also requires the French
Government to apply a number of principles, including the
Precautionary Principle, and the Principle of Preventive Action.
 
<P>2.  The Precautionary Principal states that the absence of
certainty, taking into account current scientific and technical
knowledge, must not delay the adoption of effective measures to
prevent the risk of serious and irreversible damage to the
environment at an acceptable cost.
 
<P>3.  The Principle of Preventive Action states that - with
priority at th source - damage to the environment must be avoided
by the use of the best available techniques.
 
<P>4. The Greenpeace legal case demonstrates that non of the 
scientific missions sent at Moruroa with the permission of the 
French Government were able to prove that the underground nuclear
tests were safe. Instead, the all pointed out to a number of 
scientific uncertainties, especially in connection with long term
effects.

<HEAD><H4>                                             PRESS ADVISORY

<P>          TAKE YOUR FRENCH TESTING PROTESTS ON HOLIDAY: 
               GREENPEACE ASKS EUROPEAN TOURISTS</H4>
 
<P>Brussels, 28 July 1995 -- Greenpeace activists in Europe will ask
tourists travelling to France to take the anti-nuclear testing
message with them this weekend, stepping up pressure on France's
President Chirac to reverse his decision to resume nuclear
testing in the South Pacific.  
 
<P>Activists will be at French borders in Belgium, Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg, Spain and Switzerland, distributing leaflets, car
stickers and postcards to people crossing the borders.   

<P>Greenpeace activists will also be positioned at ferry terminals
and airports throughout the UK.  The tourists travelling to
France will be asked to send postcards to President Chirac, and
to display stickers showing their opposition to nuclear testing.

<P>"We are asking Europeans to make their opposition to nuclear
testing clear by taking the message directly to President
Chirac," said Karen Richardson of Greenpeace. "How can the French
President continue to ignore international condemnation of his
decision when the people of Europe are bringing the message home
to him?"
 
<P>Government officials from the member countries of the European
Union (EU) have already expressed their opposition to President
Chirac's decision.   Of the 15 EU member countries, all except
Portugal, Germany and the UK, have made statements of
disapproval. 
 
<P>Added to overwhelming EU opposition, statements of regret and
condemnation have been made by government officials from all over
the world.  The latest government statements have included the
Russian State Duma unanimously vote to oppose renewed French
nuclear testing.  

<P>Last week, the Japanese Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama,
accused the French government of betrayal and said Japan would
sponsor a United Nations resolution condemning the French tests.

     RAINBOW WARRIOR ARRIVES IN FIJI TO APPEAL FOR INCREASED
      PRESSURE ON PRESIDENT CHIRAC AS TESTING APPROACHES</H4></head><body>

<P>Suva, Fiji, July 28th 1995:- The Rainbow Warrior will arrive in
the Fijian capital of Suva at 8am tomorrow (Saturday July 29) to
appeal to the South Pacific Forum and governments of the Pacific
region to make last-ditch efforts to stop a resumption of nuclear
testing at Moruroa atoll in September.

<P>The Rainbow Warrior will also undergo some repairs and general
maintenance, and be re-supplied to enable it to return to the
Moruroa test site in August to join a large peace flotilla of
yachts carrying protestors from around the world.

<P>Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills said the ship would be outfitted for
several months at sea.  "We are preparing to stay as long as it
takes, and to do whatever it takes, to peacefully protest at
Moruroa against President Chirac's decision to begin testing
again," she said. "More tests undermine progress toward nuclear
disarmament, threaten the environment and betray France's pledges
to pursue a comprehensive test ban treaty as quickly as
possible."

<P>Re-provisioning the ship, which will be docked at South King
Wharf, will include loading new inflatables to replace those
seized by the French military when Greenpeace activists entered
the lagoon at Moruroa on July 9th.

<P>Mills said the Rainbow Warrior and her crew were looking forward
to visiting Fiji, where the public had clearly expressed very
strong opposition to nuclear testing and support for the Rainbow
Warrior's crew, particularly for the ship's Fijian doctor, Mili
Tarai.

<P>"We look now to the Fijian government and all the other countries
of the South Pacific to show continued leadership in the
international campaign to stop France's nuclear testing at
Moruroa," Mills said.  She said Greenpeace would be meeting with
representatives of the South Pacific Forum Secretariat and with
officials from a number of governments with representation in
Fiji.

<P>The Rainbow Warrior will arrive at 0800 hours Saturday morning,
and after completing customs and immigration formalities, will
be open to the public until 12 noon.  The ship will again be open
to the public on:

<UL>--Saturday August 5th:    10am - 12pm
                          3pm - 5pm
--Sunday August 6th:      3pm - 5pm
--Saturday August 12th:   10am - 12pm
                          3pm - 5pm</UL>

<P>The ship will also be open for visits by schools, by arrangement
with the ship's captain, during weekdays from July 31-August 4th.
The Rainbow Warrior is currently scheduled to depart from Fiji
to return to Moruroa on August 13th or 14th.

<P><H4>GREENPEACE SAYS CONFERENCE ON DISARMAMENT 
                   LAST CHANCE FOR NUCLEAR TEST BAN</H4>
   
<P>GENEVA, Monday, 31 July, 1995 (GP) -- Greenpeace urged France,
the United States, Britain, China and Russia to make strenuous
efforts to use a last-ditch opportunity to agree a comprehensive
nuclear test ban treaty (CTBT) at the final session this year of
the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva this week.
 
<P>"The disarmament talks, which open today through September 22nd,
will show whether diplomats will continue to dither while further
nuclear tests are exploded, or whether they will make serious
attempts to reach a nuclear test ban," said Greenpeace
International's Simon Carroll from Geneva.
 
<P>Greenpeace said non-nuclear nations have an urgent responsibility
to pressure the nuclear weapon states to meet their disarmament
obligations. 
 
<P>"If the Nation Parties to the UN are really committed to ensuring
a test ban treaty is agreed this year, the 50th anniversary of
the first "test" dropped on Hiroshima, they must act now to
convince the nuclear weapon states that their delaying tactics
are completely unacceptable," said Carroll.
 
<P>Carroll added that the nuclear weapon states had blocked
agreement on the text of a CTBT since talks began in January last
year.
 
<P>"If 1995 ends with no agreement on a CTBT, or worse still, allows
for tests of some kind to continue, this will be a disaster for
nuclear non-proliferation, and the Conference on Disarmament will
be seen as a failure."
 
<P>Any real progress depends on the five nuclear weapon states
blocking progress and committing themselves to meeting their
pledges under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Greenpeace said. 
  
<P>"A serious commitment to non-proliferation would require France
to reverse its plans to resume nuclear testing at Moruroa in
September; China to join the international moratorium, and the
United States to show real leadership by making a successful CTBT
its highest foreign policy priority," he said.  "If the United
States would show as much energy in achieving a test ban treaty
as it did in promoting indefinite extension of the NPT earlier
this year, we would see concrete progress toward the goal of
eliminating all nuclear arsenals and a safer world for everyone,"
added Carroll.

<P>The Rainbow Warrior arrived in the Fijian capital of Suva over
the weekend to a warm welcome from the Fijian people.  Ten local
groups, who have formed an anti-nuclear testing coalition,
welcomed the Rainbow Warrior with banners on the Wharf while
students from the University of South Pacific danced and drummed
in the arrival.

<P><H4> SCIENTISTS CALL FOR STUDY OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS 
          OF FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING BEFORE RESUMPTION</H4>



 
                                       <P> FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
    
 
<P>LONDON, 1 August 1995 -- Over 70 scientists expert in ther fields
worldwide  have signed a Greenpeace appeal calling for an
immediate and comprehensive environmental assessment of the
Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls before France's proposed resumption
of nuclear testing there in September.
 
<P>The appeal seeks to establish the truth of French President
Jacques Chirac's claim that nuclear tests at the atoll would have
"no ecological consequences".  President Chirac has also said
that scientists would be invited to observe the tests to prove
their safety, and that further studies would be permitted after
the testing programme ends.
 
<P>"Observation of the test explosions alone would be useless as an
overall assessment of the environmental consequences of nuclear
tests at Moruroa," said Dr. Paul Johnston of the Greenpeace
Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter.  "It must  be
recognised by the French Government that  the  scientific
integrity  of any programme based solely upon observation  at the
time of testing is highly suspect. What is required is a fully
comprehensive study of the atoll.  Anything less than this would
fail to fufil the minimum requirements of a credible and robust
scientific assessment of the effects of nuclear testing at
Moruroa."

<P>The appeal states that the French Government has never permitted
a full and independent evaluation of the area to assess the true
environmental and health impacts of its testing programme.  To
date, more than 120 underground tests have been detonated at
Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls.

<P>"The sites have effectively become an unregulated dump for high
level radioactive wastes from the explosions," Dr Johnston said. 
"The appeal calls for a comparison of the potential for
radionuclide release from the testing sites with standards 
routinely enforced for civil nuclear sites."

<P>Several "exploratory" scientific missions to the atolls have
concluded that there is a need for greater openness and
monitoring of the test sites.  The data produced by at least two
of the missions questions the safety of the short and long term
containment of radioactivity within the atoll.
 
<P>"Data derived from these very limited studies have shown serious
grounds for concern, both about the integrity of the atoll
structure and the containment of the radioactive products of
nuclear testing," said Dr. Johnston. "Inconclusive results from
these studies have been used by the French authorities to justify
the resumption of nuclear testing and to assert that the tests
are safe.  In fact, there is a great need to fill the information
vacuum that exists about the impacts of nuclear testing at the
atolls with scientific data of the highest quality."

<P>The appeal says a comprehensive, independent study must take
place before any resumption of testing.
 
<P>Scientists from around the world were continuing to sign onto the
appeal, Dr Johnston said.  "They are asking the French
authorities to permit access to both Moruroa and Fangataufa,
provide the most recent data available on the structural
integrity of the atolls along with a radioactive inventory in
order to assess the true environmental risk these test pose."

<P>A comprehensive study would be a multi-disciplinary task,
including testing the atoll for external and internal cracks and
fissures, an exhaustive study of the hydrology of the atoll, a
comprehensive biological sampling programme, and an
epidemiological study assessing health impacts, Dr Johnston said.

<HR>
                  <H4>  <U> APPEAL FROM SCIENTISTS</U></H4>
 
<H4>RATIONALE FOR A PROGRAMME OF STUDY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF 
FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING AT MORUROA AND FANGATAUFA</H4>
 
<P>The president of France, M. Jacques Chirac has recently 
announced that  France intends to resume the testing of nuclear 
weapons  at Moruroa  and Fangataufa Atolls in the South Pacific.
At  the  same time  he stated that the testing programme carried
out  by  France had  no  ecological consequences and that 
independent  scientists would be invited to observe the tests to
prove their safety.
 
<P>Nonetheless,  observation of the tests alone is simply not
adequate as an overall assessment of the possible consequences
of  resuming the testing regime. Very few data exist concerning
the impact upon the  atolls  and their environs of  previous 
testing  programmes carried out at the sites. The data that do
exist indicate  grounds for  serious  concerns,  both about the 
integrity  of  the  atoll structure  and the containment of the
radioactive products of  the weapons testing. 
 
<P>To  date there have been more than 120 underground tests in 
these locations. The degree to which the fission products from
these tests will be  contained within the structure of the atoll
in  the long term is highly uncertain. Effectively, the two sites
comprise an unregulated dump for radioactive wastes from these 
explosions. This  has never been subjected to a full, independent
evaluation.  Several scientific missions to the atolls, all of
which have been described as "exploratory" by the scientists
concerned, have taken place. A common theme to the conclusions
reached in these  studies is  a call for greater openness and
constant vigilance at the test sites.  Moreover,  the  data
produced by at  least  two  of  these missions  raise  serious
questions about the short and  long term containment of
radioactivity within the atoll. 
 
<P>The  scientists taking part in these missions were  well 
respected and  of  international stature. They were led by 
Haroun  Tazieff, Prof. H. Atkinson  and  Cmdr  Jacques  Cousteau
respectively.  Nonetheless,  time constraints and logistic 
restrictions  severely limited  the scope of these studies and
the  information  obtained was, thus, in each case only of a
preliminary nature. Very  little substantial information,
therefore, has made its way to the public or  scientific
communities as a result of these studies.  Further, despite 
their limited and hence inconclusive nature,  the French 
Government  has  used these studies to  justify continuing  their
testing  programme  and  to assert that the  tests  are  safe 
and contained.
 
<P>Considering  this,  there is clearly a need  for  a 
comprehensive exhaustive  and independent scientific study prior
to any further tests. It is important  to recognise  that  such
a study does not require the  disclosure  of militarily  
sensitive   information   concerning the weapons themselves. 
Hence  there is no conflict between the  needs  of a robust 
scientific  programme of work and the  perceived  need  to
preserve militarily sensitive information. Obviously, however,
the authorities will need to grant access to both sites but it
must be emphasised  that  the nature of the required  programme 
does  not conflict with the interests of national security. 
 
<P>An environmental assessment of the atolls should apply, as a
basic minimum,  the  same  criteria  as applied  to  civilian 
sites in relation to the short and long term possibilities of
environmental damage, radioactive escapes and needs for
radiological protection.  In  addition, this assessment should
fully acknowledge that there are  inherent  uncertainties in any
predictive exercise  and that gaps  exist in the data.
Accordingly, a precautionary approach  to future  environmental 
protection  of the  atolls  and  the  wider environment  is
required where full weight is given to  scientific uncertainty 
and  ignorance of the long term consequences  of  the tests. 
 
<P>It  must  be  recognised by the French Government  that  the 
time required for a genuine, comprehensive environmental
assessment  is considerably greater than would be required for
simple observation of  the  tests  at  the  time  that  they  are
carried  out.  The comprehensive nature of the work required
implies not only a long lead time for preparation and logistics
but also sufficient time to execute the actual fieldwork.
 
<P>It must also be recognised that a genuine environmental
assessment can  only take place if there is no restriction on
access  to  the study  areas. This must be facilitated by the 
French  Government. Additionally, the Authorities must be
prepared to provide the most detailed and  recent  data 
available  on  the   structure and geomorphology  of the atolls
together with the best data  available concerning  the 
radioactive inventory present.  Such  information would  pose 
no threat to the national security of France  but is
indispensable to the conduct of the study.
 
<P>Finally,  a multidisciplinary approach will be required.  This 
is likely to be a cost intensive process, a judgment supported
by the large sums of money required to conduct surveys of nuclear
weapons production  sites  in the United States. The  resourcing 
for the programme  will  need to be supported with  substantial 
financing and logistic support from the French Government.
 
<P>The  following  programme of work suggested in  this  document 
is designed to take into account various of the concerns attached
to past  and planned future weapons testing. It is designed to 
be a repeatable  exercise so that the effect of future testing 
can be gauged  against present environmental conditions. Central 
to  the concerns are the possibility of leakage of radionuclides
from  the test  sites.  Hence  the programme should address  in 
detail  the possibility that leakage has already occurred and the
possibility that  it might do so in the future bearing in mind 
the  extremely long  half-life  of many of the radioactive 
isotopes  involved.  It must  be recognised by the French
Government that  the  scientific integrity  of any programme
based solely upon observation  at the time of testing is highly
suspect.
 
<P>The    programme   should  include  inter  alia  the    following
elements; and a decision on whether to recommence testing or  not
should  be  based  on  consideration  of  the  results  of   this
programme,   notwithstanding   other   political   aspects   (ie.
nuclear proliferation and such): 
 
<P>1)  A full survey of the topography of the atoll using  side 
scan sonar  and a remotely operated vehicle equipped with 
cameras  and testing instruments. This will establish the nature
and occurrence of  any externally visible fissures. These may be 
present in  the basaltic  parent  material  laid  down  by 
aerial  and  submarine volcanic  activity  in  which  tests  are 
conducted,  or  in  the overlying transition zone, dolomite and
limestone strata. In  turn this   will  allow  an  evaluation, 
supplemented   by   empirical measurement  of  actual
concentrations of  radionuclides,  of  the potential   for 
release  of  nuclides  from  the  internal reef structure.
 
<P>2) A shallow seismic testing programme to establish the degree 
to which  the  internal  integrity of the atoll  structure  has 
been compromised  by previous testing. Such a programme  would 
provide some information on the degree of internal fissuring of
the parent and  overlying materials and also contribute
substantially to an evaluation of the potential for radioactive
leakage to occur  from the  atoll  structure.  Together  with 
data  produced  from the visual/sonar  inspection  an evaluation
is then  possible  of  the potential for serious structural
changes in the atoll produced  by future weapons testing.
 
<P>3)   A   comprehensive  sampling  campaign  to   investigate  
the concentrations  of  radionuclides in fish,  planktonic 
organisms, sediments  and coralline structures. Where feasible,
samples  will also be taken from various locations outside the
atoll to  provide data  on existing background levels. This
exercise will  help  to establish  whether  radioactive materials
have been  released.  It will  also  give some indications of the
quantities  of  radiation released.   By  using  coralline 
materials  and   analyzing the radionuclides  present in the
skeletal matrix, it may be  possible to  establish the timing and
approximate magnitude of releases  of radionuclides in the past.
 
<P>4)  An exhaustive determination of the hydrology of the atoll 
and reef  structure. This should determine the general water 
movement through  the  various  strata of the  atoll.  Knowledge 
of  water movements  through the system, the interaction between 
fresh  and salt water in the reef system, the presence and size
of freshwater lens  systems will allow a more precise estimate
of the  speed  at which radionuclides may be carried to the
outside environment as a result  of failure of these substances
to be contained within  the reef  structure. In particular the
hydrological  relationships  of fissures and faults identified
by 1 & 2 above and the remnant test chambers and the boreholes
leading to them is a high priority.
 
<P>5)   Following   these  evaluations,  an   epidemiological  
study integrating  retrospective  and  prospective  elements 
should  be initiated  to assess the local and regional health
impacts of the testing regime, past and present.  
 
<P>6) A comparison of the potential for radionuclide release from
the testing sites should be made with standards routinely
enforced for initiated civil nuclear installations.
  
<P>Should a decision to  resume  testing be taken after this
programme is  carried out and its results fully considered,  it 
should be agreed that this programme should be repeated
immediately after the test series has taken place.

                   <H4>FROM HIROSHIMA TO MORUROA: 
          GREENPEACE CALLS FOR AN END THE NUCLEAR AGE </H4></head>
<body>
<P>London, 6 August 1995 -- Fifty years after the first nuclear bomb
devastated the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 (1),
a flotilla of vessels will leave New Zealand today to take part
in a Greenpeace peace flotilla protesting France's plans to
resume nuclear testing at Moruroa atoll. 
  
<P>The protest flotilla will spearhead dozens of vigils,
demonstrations, exhibitions and other activities around the globe
to mark the 50th anniversary of the dawn of the nuclear age, and
to protest nuclear testing. Greenpeace will be taking part in
vigils, protests and commemorative ceremonies in 20 countries
around the world.(2)
   
<P>"The bombing of Hiroshima signalled the beginning of the nuclear
age and with it the capacity to destroy life on the planet," said
Greenpeace's Anthony Froggatt.  "Although no bomb has been used
in wartime since 1945, more than 2,000 of them have been exploded
in tests in the atmosphere and underground leaving a legacy of
human suffering, genetic damage, birth defects and environmental
pollution.  France's decision to resume testing at Moruroa
ensures that the nuclear legacy continues to be a threat to
generations to come."(3) 
  
<P>Fifty years later, there are more than 17,000 bombs in the
bloated arsenals of the nuclear powers with an explosive power
of 6,3487 megatons -- the equivalent of 423,000 Hiroshima bombs. 

<P>Greenpeace is calling on international governments to mark the
50th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima by ensuring
agreement on a comprehensive test ban treaty banning all
explosive nuclear tests permanently by the end of 1995, and to
make concrete progress on other nuclear disarmament measures. 
  
<P>"From Hiroshima to Moruroa, the world has quite simply had
enough.  It is time the nuclear weapon states lived up to their 
obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty to actively pursue
nuclear disarmament and end nuclear testing forever," Froggatt
said.    

<P>Greenpeace's vessels Rainbow Warrior and MV Greenpeace are
currently on their way or preparing to join the international
peace flotilla gathering near Moruroa in late August.

Blair Palese, Greenpeace Communications +44171 833 0600

Auckland: Michael Szabo or Glyn Walters at Greenpeace New Zealand

<P>NOTE TO EDITORS: 
  
<P>1. At 8:15 am on August 6th 1945 a uranium bomb, codename 
"Little Boy" was dropped on Hiroshima, killing 45,000 people 
instantly. Many of them were vaporised, leaving only their 
shadows behind.  All recorded pregnancies within a two-mile 
radius of the centre of the blast resulted in miscarriage or 
stillbirth. Some 4.1 square miles of the city were completely 
destroyed. Delayed radiation effects including increased cancer 
rates put the final estimated death toll of the Hiroshima bomb 
at around 200,000 people. 
   
<P>Three days later, on August 9th, a plutonium bomb codename "Fat
Man" was exploded over Nagasaki. There were 22,000 immediate
casualties, with an estimated final death toll of around 100,000 
people. 
  
<P>Historical evidence shows that the overwhelming military 
advice given to the United States President Truman was that the 
use of atomic bombs was not necessary to end the war - the 
Japanese had already made two attempts to surrender.  
  
<P>2.  Greenpeace is taking part in Hiroshima Day protests or
commemorations in 20 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Canada/Quebec, Chile, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland,
Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States. 
  
<P>3.  As of mid-1995, the U.S., Russia, the UK, France, and China,
have conducted 2,035 nuclear tests.  France is poised to resume
nuclear testing in September and China countries to do so. The
U.S., Russia and France all work on ways to simulate testing in
order to better maintain their arsenals without testing.

<P><H4><head>GREENPEACE HAILS NEW ZEALAND DECISION TO TAKE FRANCE TO THE
WORLD COURT OVER NUCLEAR TESTING</H4>

</head></body>

<P>AUCKLAND 8 August -- Greenpeace today welcomed the decision by
the New Zealand government to ask the International Court of
Justice to stop the proposed French nuclear testing at Moruroa
atoll. The government will ask the court to revisit the case New
Zealand started in 1973 against French atmospheric testing.

<P>"This is an historic decision", said Greenpeace International
lawyer, Duncan Currie.  "New Zealand has taken the lead to hold
France accountable under international law. We are now calling
on other nations to join New Zealand in the case. This is a real
chance to stop nuclear testing forever."

<P>"This is a strong and principled decision by the New Zealand government. It
reflects the depth of feeling and consensus throughout New Zealand amongst the
public and the political parties.  This is a tribute to all New Zealanders,
activists,
protestors and governments around the world who have worked to stop nuclear
testing globallly", said Stephanie Mills from Fiji.

<P>"There is now an excellent chance to stop nuclear testing. Diplomatic, legal and
protest initiatives have come together. It is time for President Chirac to
accept that
the world will not accept renewed nuclear testing."

<P>Greenpeace called upon France to refrain from nuclear testing pending the
decision
by the Court. "It would be an outrage and a travesty if France were to detonate
a
nuclear device while the issue is before the Court," said Mr Currie.

<H4>GREENPEACE CALLS ON NATIONS TO MARK 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF NAGASAKI
BOMBING BY ENDING NUCLEAR TESTING AND PLUTONIUM PRODUCTION   </H4></head><body>

<P>Fiji August 9, 1995--In memory of the 50th anniversary of the
United States bombing of the Japanese city of Nagasaki,
Greenpeace is calling on the countries of the United Nations to
condemn and prohibit all further nuclear tests and the production
of plutonium -- the deadly element which fuelled the Nagasaki
bomb.  

<P>A 6.2 kilogram plutonium bomb destroyed the city of Nagasaki 50
years ago on August 9 1945, killing 70,000 people. 

<P>"Fifty years after Nagasaki was destroyed by a plutonium bomb,
it is time to halt nuclear testing and stop the spread of
plutonium," said Stephanie Mills from the Greenpeace vessel
Rainbow Warrior in Fiji.  "'No more Nagasaki's' means taking the
required steps to stop testing and constructing nuclear weapons".
 
<P>Since 1945 tremendous quantities of weapons-usable plutonium have
been produced by the nuclear industries -- both military and
civilian (nuclear power).  Over 250 tonnes of plutonium is
currently in weapons arsenals, while some 160 tonnes have been
separated for unjustified commercial purposes.  Fifty years after
the first plutonium bomb, we've now got enough to produce 20,000
such bombs.  Indeed, by 2000,  37,585 Nagasaki bombs worth of
plutonium will be in the commercial pipeline unless plutonium
separation (reprocessing) is banned. 

<P>In May of this year, the five officially recognised nuclear
weapons states -- France, China, the UK, the US and Russia  --
pledged to "exercise the utmost restraint" in the field of
nuclear testing at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
Review and Extension Conference.    
 
<P>A promise to negotiate a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) by
1996 was extracted by the non-nuclear weapons states from the
nuclear weapons states at the NPT Conference.  However, China's
continuing programme of nuclear testing and France's announcement
that it will begin a series of tests in September of this year
have broken this promise.  This has led some 150 of the 184
member states of the United Nations General Assembly to condemn
any further nuclear testing [1].   

<P>"The best memorial for the people of Nagasaki would be a renewed
commitment by all countries to halt all nuclear tests and agree
a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty this year,"  said Mills. "Nuclear
weapons don't increase global stability; they lead to global
insecurity.  These weapons must be outlawed and eliminated from
the arsenals of all countries".    
 
<P>The five officially recognised nuclear weapons nations, Russia,
the US, China, France and Britain today have 17,474 nuclear
weapons.  
 
<P>Vigils, peace camps and demonstrations will take place around the
world to mark the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki and
to protest France's decision to resume nuclear testing.

<P>*  The group of 21 is extremely disappointed and fully shares the
concern expressed by the international community at the decisions
recently taken by nuclear weapon state to suspend its moratorium
and resume nuclear weapon testing soon, as well as at the nuclear
test recently conducted by another nuclear weapon state.... this
is a serious step back to the ongoing negotiations for a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and undermines its
successful conclusion. [Presented by India on behalf of G21,

light of consistent efforts by the international community to
further promote measures for nuclear disarmament and non-

<br><H4>UPDATE FROM THE SOUTH PACIFIC</H4></head>
<body>
<P>
 
Two months to the day after President Chirac's decision to resume
French testing, Greenpeace's vessel Rainbow Warrior departed
Suva, Fiji yesterday enroute to joint an international peace
flotilla gathering near Moruroa.  About 200 people gathered on
the dock to say farewell -- with strains of "Now is the Hour" and
traditional Fijian songs of farewell in our ears, we pulled out
on time at 12 noon.
 
<P>Our departure also coincided with protests at the Pacific Games,
which have just begun in Tahiti.  Anti-nuclear activists are
protesting at the Games, and at least four South Pacific
countries are boycotting them.  Meanwhile, 9000 people
demonstrated in Western Samoa at the weekend - a huge turnout for
a nation of around 160,000 people.

<P>President Clinton's announcement on Friday that the U.S. will not
carry out any news nuclear tests is good news.   He has said that
the US will support a comprehensive, zero-yield test ban treaty. 
He has decided to over-rule the military, who wanted low-yield
and hydro-nuclear tests of up to a few hundred tonnes. It's a
pity President Chirac is not paying so much attention to public
sentiment about testing -- although France announced similar
intentions on Thursday, their eight eminent nuclear tests speak
more loudly about lack of commitment to disarmament than any fine
words at the Conference on Disarmament going on now in Geneva.
 
<P>We're motoring into the wind with cloudy skies and a slight
swell.  We expect to arrive in Papeete on August 23rd.

<P>More news as our journey continues.

<br><H4>GREENPEACE CALLS FOR EUROPEAN PROTEST FLOTILLA TO PARIS</H4></head>
<body>


 
<P>Wiesbaden/Frankfurt--18 August 1995--Greenpeace today launched
an appeal for a "European Peace Fleet" to join its ships BELUGA
and SIRIUS to sail to Paris to protest French President Jacques
Chirac's insistence on nuclear testing at Moruroa.
 
<P>At a press conference on the Beluga in German town Wiesbaden
today,  Greenpeace's Susanne Commerell said the fleet would
deliver a strong anti-nuclear message to Chirac, in the form of
hundreds of thousands of signatures on petitions gathered from
around Europe. 
 
<P>"There are so many boat owners around Europe who want to protest
the threat to the marine environment posed by French nuclear
testing.   There is already a peace flotilla in the South Pacific
-- but not in Chirac's back yard.  We are calling on boat owners
to bring their vessels to the Seine on 1 September to make sure
Chirac gets the message -- the world does not want nuclear
testing,"  said Commerell.
 
<P>On its way to Paris, the Beluga will travel through Germany,
Netherlands, Belgium and France to gather support for the
protest.  The Sirius will go to the south coast of England to
garner similar support. 
 
<P>Greenpeace had been contacted by many boat owners who wanted to
join the Moruroa flotilla in the South Pacific, but could not
afford to go. Three Greenpeace boats, the Rainbow Warrior, the
MV Greenpeace and the Manutea will be part of that flotilla.
However, there were now no berths left on most of the boats going
to Moruroa. "Now the people of Europe have the chance to take
part in the protest," said Commerell. 
 
<P>Also at the press conference today, the Mayors of Wiesbaden (1) -
Achim Exner and its "twin town" in France, Fondettes (2) - Pierre
Vacher signed the Greenpeace petition and made statements in
support of Greenpeace's protests. "Greenpeace is also encouraging
all other towns around Europe who are twinned with a French town
to join with their twin to make a unified call against nuclear
testing. More than 60% of French people disagree with their
President's policies -- this is a chance for them to take
action," said Commerell.

<H4>ANC STATEMENT ON NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC BY THE FRENCH
GOVERNMENT</H4></head><boby

<P>The ANC strongly condemns the resumption of nuclear testing in
the Pacific Ocean by the French Government. This action comes at a
time when there is emerging international consensus on the need to
stop such testing and to move towards the elimination of nuclear
arms and technology.

<P>Our new democratic government has taken an important lead in the
recent debates about the non-proliferation treaty and has been
applauded for the example it has set by unilaterally taking a
decision to dismantle South Africa's nuclear capacity.

<P>The development of nuclear bombs and the continuation of nuclear
testing constitutes one of the most serious threats to humanity and
a healthy environment. The ANC calls upon the French Government to
immediately halt this nuclear testing. The ANC expresses its support
and solidarity with all those organisations who have come out in
protest against such testing.

<H4>GREENPEACE APPLAUDS NEW ZEALAND COURT CASE AGAINST FRANCE </H4></head>
 
 
<body> 



 
<P>The Hague--21 August 1995--Greenpeace today welcomed the fact
that New Zealand has now formally filed an application to the
World Court in The Hague to try to stop the series of nuclear
tests by France at Moruroa.
 
<P>The application was filed formally this morning. New Zealand is
asking for an interim order against France to stop testing
pending a full hearing later in the year.
 
<P>"Greenpeace welcomes New Zealand Government's application today,"
said Simon Carroll of Greenpeace International.  The application
re-opens a 1973 case by New Zealand against France to stop
nuclear testing.  This case, which was largely based on pollution
from nuclear testing, was suspended in 1974 when France decided
to take its tests underground. 
 
<P>At that time, the court said that while it did not need to rule
on the case, since France waslegally bound by its announcements 
that it would stop atmospheric nuclear testing,  New Zealand  and
Australia, which had filed a similar case, could re-open the 
case at any time in the future.  Since the early 1970's, more 
information has emerged of the threat to the marine environment 
from underground testing which made it essential for New Zealand 
to reopen its case.
 
<P>"We now call on Governments around the world to formally support
New Zealand's case in the World Court," said Simon Carroll. "It
is in the fundamental interest of all countries that the
international court rules against radioactive pollution of the
marine environment.  All countries should do what they can to
help this outcome."

<H4> PROTEST AT FRENCH TESTING HEATS UP AS RAINBOW WARRIOR
               ARRIVES IN TAHITI </H4></head>
 
 
<body> 



    
 
<P>Papeete, Tahiti, 23 August 1995 -- The Rainbow Warrior arrives
in Papeete today, en route to protest a resumption of nuclear
testing by France at Moruroa atoll next month.
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior will join an international peace flotilla of
around 30 vessels, currently sailing from New Zealand, Australia,
Chile, the United States and Germany.
 
<P>"We return to Moruroa not alone, but on the winds of a large
fleet of boats coming together with a single aim: to stop French
testing at Moruroa," Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills said from
aboard the Rainbow Warrior. "President Chirac still has time to
listen to the international community and change his mind, and
to show that real leadership in the 1990s means a commitment to
nuclear disarmament, not to nuclear testing and nuclear
proliferation."
 
<P>She said a European flotilla sailing for Paris on September first
in solidarity with the Moruroa fleet would take the same message
to President Chirac.
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior sailed from Fiji with a crew of 19 two weeks
ago, after undertaking repairs and re-provisioning following the
boarding of the ship on July 10 by French commandos as it entered
the 12-mile exclusion zone around Moruroa.
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior will berth in Papeete on Wednesday August 23
at approximately 10am at Motu Uta.  A press conference on board
the ship will begin at 11.30am.
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior sails for Moruroa on Thursday August 24, and
is expected to arrive off the Moruroa exclusion zone on August
27.  It will join two other Greenpeace vessels, the sailing yacht
Vega and the MV Greenpeace, as well as a Danish vessel, the
Bifrost and other vessels arriving over the next few weeks to
form the international peace.

<H4> GREENPEACE VESSELS CONVERGE FOR PROTEST AT MORUROA</H4></head>
 
 
<body> 



    
 
<P>
 
Moruroa, South Pacific, August 27, 1995 -- (GP) The Rainbow
Warrior rendezvoused today with the Greenpeace yacht Vega and
other vessels outside the 12-mile exclusion zone at Moruroa atoll
today, as part of the nucleus of an international peace flotilla
now gathering at France's nuclear test site .
 
<P>The Rainbow Warrior met with the Vega 24 miles outside the
exclusion zone at 9 a.m. local time (21 deg. 46 min. S, 139 deg.
30 min. W).  The Danish vessel Bifrost and the New Zealand naval
vessel Tui were already positioned outside the exclusion zone.
The MV Greenpeace will join the flotilla early on the 28th local
time and Greenpeace USA's charter vessel Manuatea is expected in
early September.
 
<P>The four Greenpeace vessels will be part of an international
peace flotilla of between 30 - 50 vessels which will be arriving
over the next few weeks to protest France's plans to resume
nuclear testing at the atolls as early as next week. 
 
<P>President Chirac announced on June 13 that France would break a
three year moratorium on nuclear testing to conduct eight tests
between September 1995 and May next year.
 
<P>More than 150 states and millions of people around the world have
condemned France's plans to test in the South Pacific,
Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills said from on board the SV Rainbow
Warrior. 
 
<P>"The flotilla brings the strength of that protest to Moruroa. 
We are here to give a direct message to President Chirac that
testing bombs to develop more and more deadly nuclear weapons is
a dangerous act of nuclear proliferation and an outrage against
the environment and people of the South Pacific," she said. 
 
<P>Greenpeace campaigner Xavier Pastor, on board the MV Greenpeace,
said Greenpeace would discuss with other vessels of the flotilla
a range of peaceful symbolic and direct actions over the next few
weeks aimed at stopping the testing programme and pressuring
France and the other nuclear weapon states to urgently agree a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

<H4>JACQUES CHIRAC IGNORES  3 MILLION SIGNATURES AGAINST FRENCH 
TESTING: INJUNCTION AGAINST GREENPEACE PROTEST SHIP</H4></head>
 
 
<body> 

<P>Paris--29 August 1995-- The French Govt has just issued an 
injunction (1) to stop the Greenpeace boat Beluga from leading a 
European protest flotilla up the Seine in Paris on Friday. 

<P>This afternoon, it was confirmed that the French Government put 
pressure on the Touring Club of France, to refuse the Beluga 
right of berth under the Pont D'Iena.  The Touring Club had 
previously given permission but today were forced to change. 

<P>The French authorities are even threatening to place their own 
boats along the quays of the Seine to stop any attempt at 
berthing for any of the Boats against the Bomb." 

<P>The French Government has also banned a human chain of 
protestors and VIPs from throughout Europe, organised to take 
the more three million signatures against French testing, 
collected by
Greenpeace worldwide, to the Elysee Palace from the Beluga at 
the Pont D'Iena.   The authorities have cited "disturbance of 
the public order" as the reason for this ban. 

<P>"By stopping the arrival of the European flotilla Against 
Testing in Paris and the stopping of the petitions, the 
representative of the French people, President Chirac, ridicules 
the right to freedom of expression of the millions of citizens 
who want to make a peaceful protest against the resumption of 
nuclear testing" declared Penelope Komites, Executive Director 
of Greenpeace France. 

<P>"France's head of State has demonstrated to us yet again how 
distant he seems to be to the democratic values and freedom of 
expression. Recent opinion polls show that the majority of 
French people have declared themselves to be against the 
resumption of French nuclear testing," said Komites.  

<P>"Greenpeace has no intention however of giving in to
intimidations and blackmail,"  she added. 

<P>"Does President Chirac wish to impose a 12-mile exclusion zone 
around Paris as well as Moruroa?"



<P>(1) the order is similar in legal terms to an injunction.

<H4>FRENCH POLICE BAN ENTIRE GREENPEACE FLOTILLA FROM PARIS</h4></head><body>
 
<P>Paris--30 August 1995--Greenpeace today accused the Parisian
police of "excessive use of power" in its dealings with the peace
protest flotilla expected to arrive in the Seine river Friday.
 
<P>The police have today issued a ban, backed by the French courts,
to stop the Greenpeace vessel BELUGA and the entire peace
flotilla from taking part in a peace protest on the Seine.  The
order bans the boats from all of Paris. 
 
<P>The Beluga, carrying some of the more than three million
petitions collected from around the world against French testing,
have planned to sail up the Seine with the other boats on Friday
morning in a peaceful, and non-violent, protest against nuclear
testing.
 
<P>"This is Jacques Chirac's second '12-mile' exclusion zone in
answer to protests against his disastrous decision to resume
nuclear testing - first Moruroa Atoll, now Paris, around the
Elysee Palace," said Penelope Komites of Greenpeace France.  "He
should tell the people of Paris that he has set up this new
exclusion zone." 
 
<P>The Beluga was to lead the flotilla.  It left Cologne two weeks
ago and has since been to the Netherlands, Belgium and Rouen
before arriving in Paris. 
 
<P>The petitions were to be delivered to the quayside at Pont
D'Iena, where a human chain of activists and VIPs from around
Europe, would carry them to the Elysee Palace, taking the message
to President Chirac.  This has now been banned by the police
under the decree that the human chain would cause a public
disturbance. 
 
<P>"Using the courts to try to suppress peaceful protests against
French testing will not stop people who are outraged at Chirac's
nuclear shame.  Chirac and his nuclear advisors must wake up to
the fact that the world doesn't want French tests," said Komites.
 
<P>Greenpeace is now considering its options on the flotilla. 
 
<p>Police stopped a total of 49 boats coming to join the Paris flotilla.
<li>5 million signatures on the petition....
<li>from more than 150 countries.....
<li>49 boats in Paris...
<li>30 boats in Mururoa...

<H4>GREENPEACE RECONNAISANCE FLIGHT SPOTS TEST RIG IN MORUROA</h4></head><body>
 
<p>Off Moruroa atoll, 30 August 1995:-  A Greenpeace helicopter crew
today spotted a test rig in the Moruroa lagoon during a
reconnaisance flight outside the 12 mile exclusion zone around
Moruroa and Fangataufa.

<img align=top src="rw163t.gif" alt="GP activists debate tactics.">68KB GIF</a>
or <a href="rw163.jpg">24KB JPG.</a> Greenpeace/Morgan   
<p>French authorities have said a test is imminent. Greenpeace crew
member Madeleine Habib said that from the helicopter a test rig
was clearly identifiable in the Moruroa lagoon, although the
distance made identification of other objects difficult.  The
Greenpeace helicopter was closely followed by two military
helicopters during its flight.
 
<p>Meanwhile, a Cook Island traditional voyaging canoe (vaka), Te Au
o Tonga, arrived at the exclusion zone today and performed a
traditional haka ceremony aboard to express the crew's opposition
to nuclear testing.  Other arrivals at Moruroa included the New
Zealand trimarine Triptych and a Chilean yacht, Bebinka.

or <a href="rw161.jpg">24kB JPG.</a> Greenpeace/Morgan  
<p>The Cook Islands vaka is due to return to Rarotonga tonight.
It and its escort boat, the Cook Islands Government patrol boat
Te Kukupa were earlier warned by a French warship to stay out of
the exclusion zone.  Earlier, the Triptych was delivered a letter
by French officers in a zodiac, to which they responded with a
letter of protest against nuclear testing to President Chirac.
 
<p>This followed the delivery last week to the New Zealand naval
vessel Tui of a similar letter by the French authorities. 
Members of Parliament on board the Tui later delivered their own
letter of protest to the French authorities.  Currently around 30
other vessels are en route to Moruroa.
 
<p>"In the same way the peace flotilla is expanding, the strength of
protest against President Chirac's decision to resume nuclear
testing will only grow," Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills said from
on board the SV Rainbow Warrior.  "We are resolute in our
determination to continue the peaceful protest against nuclear
testing and to do our utmost to stop the tests from proceeding."

<head><h4>US CONGRESSMAN AND TAHITIAN LEADERS JOIN THE RAINBOW
WARRIOR IN PROTEST AT MORUROA</h4></head><body>
 
<p>Off Moruroa atoll, August 31:- A ranking United States Democrat
Congressman, Eni Faleomavaega and two leading Tahitian activists,
Oscar Temaru and Vito Maamaatua, today joined Greenpeace's
protest against French nuclear testing at Moruroa.
<P><a href="rw162.gif">
<img align=top src="rw162t.gif" alt="GP activists debate tactics.">85KB GIF</a>
or <a href="rw162.jpg">28KB JPG.</a> Greenpeace/Morgan   
<p>Congressman Faleomavaega, Oscar Temaru, (the leader of the major
opposition party in Tahiti, Tavini Huiraatira) and Mr Maamaatua, 
(the president of the youth section of Tavini Huiraatira), joined
the Rainbow Warrior this morning. They had sailed from Tureia, 
an atoll 60 miles north of Moruroa, after flying there from 
Tahiti.
 
<p>Congressman Faleomavaega, who represents American Samoa and is a 
member of the Congress's Foreign Affairs and International 
Relations Committee, said he had come on behalf of the people of 
both American and Western Samoa. Mr Faleomavaegaa is a ranking 
Democrat on Native American and Territories affairs.
 
<p>"The world has changed.  French nuclear testing is not just about
France, it endangers the lives of millions of people in the 
Pacific region.  France has no right to sit 15,000 miles away and
explode nuclear bombs -- actually weapons of genocide -- in the 
midst of the Pacific," Congressman Faleomavaega said.
 
<p>Mr Faleomavaega said he had visited Moruroa in 1992 and disputed 
French claims about the safety of testing.
 
<p>"I was taken to areas which were absolutely contaminated, where 
nothing could be done about it.  I wish the French government and
officials would quit lying to the interational community about 
this idea of 'ecologically safe' nuclear tests.  It's pure 
baloney.  If Chirac is to become a leader of Europe, this is 
certainly not the way to prove his leadership qualities."
 
<p>Oscar Temaru said he had come to Moruroa to deliver a last 
message to President Chirace from all the children of Tureia, the
atoll closest to Moruroa.  Yesterday, all 76 inhabitants of the 
island signed a petition opposing French testing.  He and Mr 
Maamaatua said the vast majority of Tahitian people opposed any 
resumption of nuclear testing at the atoll.  An anti-nuclear 
demonstration on Saturday is being preceeded by a march around 
Tahiti today.

<head><h4>POLICE BLOCK GREENPEACE DELIVERY OF PETITIONS TO CHIRAC</h4></head><body><p>Paris-1 September 1995 A human chain of about 200 people from
throughout Europe attempted this morning to deliver just under
five million signatures against French nuclear testing to
Presidenc Jacques Chirac at the Elysee Palace in Paris, but were
stopped by police.
<P><a href="2.gif">
<img align=top src="2t.gif" alt="GP activists debate tactics.">83KB GIF</a>
or <a href="2.jpg">28KB JPG.</a>   
<p>The chain, which, at 11.15 am, began passing some of the petitions along the Alexandre III Bridge over the River Seine in
central Paris, got as far as the Champs Elysees but was blocked
by police, and over 100 arrests made. Some of the petitions were
seized. 
<P><a href="3.gif">
<img align=top src="3t.gif" alt="GP activists debate tactics.">75KB GIF</a>
or <a href="3.jpg">28KB JPG.</a> Greenpeace/Morgan   <p>Two boats, which were supposed to carry VIPs to the protests,
were also blocked by police but the VIPs joined the protest on
the bridge where a group of a further 500 protestors are now
holding a demonstration.   Members of the French public have
joined this demonstration. <p>"Stopping the delivery of these petitions in Paris today will not
silence the massive international protest against French nuclear
testing," said Penelope Komites, Executive Director of Greenpeace
France, also arrested this morning.  "Today Chirac has attempted
to suffocate a protest in Paris, but he cannot silence the world.
Who is he trying to fool?" <p>Among the VIPs at the protest include members of Parliament from
Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, Ireland,
Switzerland and Belgium. <p>The delivery of the petitions has been plagued with difficulty
from the French authorities this week, as they banned a peace
flotilla from coming up the Seine, blocked Greenpeace vessel
BELUGA from coming through locks on its way to Paris, and
outlawed the actual delivery of the petitions, saying it would
constitute a "public disturbance."  <p>"The biggest public disturbance Paris and the world faces today
is Chirac's nuclear testing programme in the South Pacific," said
Komites. <p>Two of the banned protest vessels banned have sailed from the UK. 
In another desperate attempt to gag protests, French police
yesterday were sailing up and down the River Seine, warning boat
owners against joining the Greenpeace protest. The Beluga is
still out of Paris, blocked at one of the locks on the Seine. <p>On board the Rainbow Warrior just outside the Moruroa 12mile
exclusion zone, campaigner Stephanie Mills said "protest cannot
be silenced  neither in the South Pacific nor on the rivers of
Paris. Chirac is making France an international pariah." 
<p>The petitions have come from throughout the world, from at least 35 different countries, along with a further 50,000 gathered
electronically from the Internet and 300,000 from France. Among
the celebrities are politicians, scientists, writers, actors,
musicians, Nobel Peace Prizewinners including:<p><li> 160 Japanese members of Parliament<li>  Former Formula One driver Nikki Lauda <li> Ministers of state from a number of countries<li> Thomas Muster, winner of the 1995 French Open (tennis)<li>  Pop stars Robert Palmer, The Wailers, Nina Hagen, Sinead
O'Connor, U2, Tori Amos, French based US jazz singer Dee Dee
Bridgewater, Miryam Mikeba, Annie Lennox, REM.<li> At least two Nobel peace prize winners<li>  Italian film director Gabriele Salvatores<li> The wife of a French Ambassador to Central America. 
<p>60 USA Congress members signed a letter to Chirac urging him to
sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty before the tests.  A list
of how many petitions from each country and further details of 
famous signatories is available from your local Greenpeace 
office.                             <p>For information:  Greenpeace France 33 1 47 70 46 89 or Cindy

<br><head><h4>GREENPEACE SENDS 10 SMALL BOATS INTO 12-MILE EXCLUSION ZONE
AS FRENCH PREPARE TO CARRY OUT FIRST NUCLEAR TEST MORUROA</h4></head><body>
 
<P>5:12 a.m., Moruroa, South Pacific, 1 September, 1995 -- (GP)
Greenpeace has sent 10 inflatable boats and a helicopter into the 12-
mile exclusion zone around the Moruroa test site in order to prevent
imminent French nuclear testing.  

<P>The dozens of activists will attempt to enter the Moruroa atoll lagoon
and occupy the equipment used for nuclear testing.  At the time of
release, the MV Greenpeace and Rainbow Warrior remained outside the
12-mile exclusion zone. 

<P>Greenpeace ships were warned by French authorities not to enter the
exclusion zone.  
 
<P>"The last and only resort we have is to peacefully bear witness at the
test site, and to do whatever it takes within our means to try and
prevent the first of a series of French nuclear tests," Greenpeace's
Stephanie Mills said from on board the Rainbow Warrior. "We can do no
more and no less when President Chirac has remained deaf to the
world's plea not to test at Moruroa."
 
<P>Mills said nearly 5 million signatures had been collected to present
to President Chirac today, in spite of a ban by the French authorities
on a public demonstration in Paris.  Around 160 governments have
formally condemned French testing, and a peace flotilla of more than
30 vessels is gathering at the test site.
 
<P>"Whether in Moruroa, Tahiti or in Paris, the international community's
opposition to nuclear testing and its call for an urgent comprehensive
test ban treaty cannot be silenced by frigates, helicopters, commandos
or bans," she said. "France can defend its resumption of nuclear
testing only by brute force.  It has lost all moral and political
credibility by breaking the moratorium on nuclear testing; by going
ahead with tests now France will become a pariah of the international

<H4>       GREENPEACE DIVERS UNDER TEST MONITORING PLATFORM 
                  TO STOP FRENCH NUCLEAR TEST</h4></head><body>

<P>MORUROA, 5.20pm BST, 1 September, 1995--As commandos storm the
Rainbow Warrior, its captain Jon Castle is in the ship's crows
nest and two Greenpeace divers are under the test monitoring
platform in Moruroa lagoon.

<P>The Greenpeace helicopter pilot hovering above the scene has
confirmed the divers' presence.  Both divers were dropped into
the lagoon by at least two inflatables which had raced into the
Moruroa Lagoon as commandos boarded the Rainbow Warrior.

<P>Greenpeace campaigner Xavier Pastor, aboard the MV Greenpeace
which is monitoring the events outside the 12-mile limit, has
told the French navy frigate VENDEMAIRE that the divers are
beneath the platform.

<P>"If France detonates its bomb now it endangers global efforts to
ban nuclear weapons tests and risks the lives of our peaceful
protestors," said Pastor.  "We appeal to President Chirac to
listen to commonsense and the overwhelming opposition by people
worldwide, over 150 governments and a majority of French people
and end this nuclear nightmare now."

<P>The Rainbow Warrior has stopped within the 12-mile exclusion
zone.  Nineteen commandos have boarded the vessel and have used
welding gear to cut their way into the bridge.

 TWENTY-TWO GREENPEACE ACTIVISTS RELEASED BY FRENCH IN TAHITI</h4></head><body>

<P>Moruroa, South Pacific, 2 September, 1995 -- (GP) Twenty-two
Greenpeace activists who attempted to occupy France's nuclear
test site at Moruroa have now been released by French authorities
in Tahiti.

<P>Along with the 22 Greenpeace activists ranking Democrat
Congressman, Eni Faleomavaega and two leading Tahitian activists,
Oscar Temaru and Vito Maamaatua were also released along with
journalists aboard both the MV Greenpeace and the Rainbow
Warrior.

<P>The Greenpeace activists who have been released reported that
they were held hand-cuffed for 6-hours in a single room while
under French arrest before being flown out of Moruroa.

<P>Those released were activists who had been aboard small
inflatables launched from the two larger ships, the MV Greenpeace
and the Rainbow Warrior, along with two divers who positioned
themselves under a French drilling platform.  The names and
nationalities of those released is still unknown but will be
available soon.

<P>Photographer Steve Morgan, now free in Tahiti, reported that the
radio room of the Rainbow Warrior had been dismantled by French
commandos and that the engines on board disabled.  

<P>Both the MV Greenpeace and the Rainbow Warrior along with their
crews are now being towed to the nearby atoll of Hao, ironically,
the site where French secret service agents were imprisoned after
the bombing of Greenpeace's original Rainbow Warrior in 1985.
Both ships are expected to arrive at Hao in approximately two
days but French authorities have not said how long they will be
held there or if their remaining crew will be deported.

<P>A protest march and forum attended by Japan's Finance Minister
and Members of Parliament from Australia, Austria, Belgium,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New
Zealand, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the United States is taking
place at 9 a.m. in Tahiti.  Protesters have been blocking roads
into Papaeete since yesterday.

<P>French authorities have delayed the carrying out of their first
nuclear test.

<br><br><h4>FREE THE RAINBOW WARRIOR CALL BY GREENPEACE</h4></head><body>

<P>TAHITI - September 2, 1995-- Greenpeace called today for
international support to free the Rainbow Warrior, the MV
Greenpeace and their crews.  The two ships and 55 crew members
were seized by the French while attempting to prevent a
resumption of nuclear testing at Moruroa yesterday.



<P>The SV Rainbow Warrior was attempting to get into the lagoon at
Moruroa when it was boarded by commandos inside the exclusion
zone.  Nine Greenpeace inflatables were launched outside the
zone.  Three inflatables made it into the lagoon and dropped off
two divers at the drilling platform.  The French claim they have
arrested all nine inflatables, their crews and the divers

<P>The MV Greenpeace was boarded a few hours later while outside the
exclusion zone.  "French justifications for boarding the MV
Greenpeace in international waters on the basis that the
helicopter pilot breached regulations by failing to clear customs
only reveals its real intentions," said Greenpeace campaigner in
Tahiti Thomas Schultz.  "This is a blatant attempt to remove
Greenpeace from the scene."

<P>The French commandos then proceeded to smash the communications
equipment on board the Rainbow Warrior.

<P>"The Rainbow Warrior is a symbol of hope against the nuclear arms
race," said Schultz.  Ten years ago the French sank the original
Rainbow Warrior to prevent Greenpeace from protesting against
nuclear testing, killing crew member Fernando Pereira.  "Today
the French are again attempting to silence the protest by taking
the boat and its crew and casting them as the lawbreakers."

<P>"France is acting as a law unto itself and expediently forgets
its own obligations in the international community," said
Schultz.  "France, together with the other four nuclear weapons
states have committed themselves to the elimination of all
nuclear weapons.  Nuclear testing is the most visible
manifestation of a lack of that commitment."

<P>"The Warrior is a more potent symbol today because of the many
millions of people around the world who are no longer willing to
accept the environmental and security threats that nuclear
weapons pose," said Schultz.

<P>Greenpeace said is it preparing to take legal action to challenge
the seizure of its boats and crews, confiscation and damage of
equipment.  "France cannot be allowed to get away with this
cynical attempt to silence protest."

<P>US Congressman E Faleomavaga, Oscar Temaru (Tahitian
independentist) and Vito Mamaatua were among those on board the
Greenpeace ships.

<P>For more information, contact:
Thomas Schultz, Greenpeace International, Tahiti: +689 770 613;
Greenpeace Communications: +44 171 833 0600


<P>Greenpeace Executive Director Steve D'Esposito has issued a plea
for all protests taking place in the event of French testing to
be peaceful.  For a copy of the statement, please contact the
numbers above.


<H4>HOW YOU CAN HELP FREE THE RAINBOW WARRIOR!
          </H4>

<li>Call your national Greenpeace office for information on what
nuclear testing protests are going on in your country.  Ask how
you can help!

<li> Write or fax the French Embassy in your country demanding the
release of the Rainbow Warrior, MV Greenpeace and their crews.

<li> Sign the Greenpeace petition against French nuclear testing and
ask your family and friends to as well!

<li> Write to your local newspaper's letters to the editor section
to make your voice heard -- AGAINST French nuclear testing and
FOR the release of both Greenpeace ships.


<P>Make your protest loud and clear.  
But remember: non-violent, peaceful protest is the key!</body></html>

<br><br><h4>GREENPEACE CALLS FOR PEACEFUL PROTESTS IN RESPONSE TO FRENCH TEST</h4></head>
<body>
<P>On the eve of an explosion by France of the first in a new series
of nuclear weapons, Greenpeace International's Executive Director
Steve D'Esposito today appealed to the many millions of members
of the public around the world to express their opposition
peacefully over the coming period.
 
<P>"Nearly five million people have signed a Greenpeace petition
calling on France to stop the proposed tests. The vast majority
of the world's governments have also expressed their opposition.
France's decision to proceed with testing is a slap in the face
of French national and international opinion opposed to these
tests.
 
<P>In this context, many millions of people will doubtless feel
deeply angered and frustrated by President Chirac's decision to
proceed with the tests.
 
<P>"As an organisation committed to peace, and peaceful change,
Greenpeace calls on its supporters and all those who believe that
the world does not need or want nuclear weapons to continue to
make their opposition known, but peacefully. 
 
<P>"Acts of violence against French citizens and property are not
an appropriate or acceptable response to the French Government.
It must be remembered that the majority of French people are
against the testing, and need continued international support to
have their wishes respected by President Chirac. Vandalism or
violence will only strengthen the supporters of French testing. 

<P>"The public have made clear they believe it is wrong for France
to build and test new bombs. They see the gross hypocrisy of
French support for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but only next
year, after modernising and adding to their own arsenal. The
French position on testing is akin to an alcoholic promising to
stop drinking, as soon as they have filled their cellar.
 
<P>"Greenpeace urges all those concerned about French nuclear
testing to voice their opposition, but to do so peacefully so
that our voices can be clearly heard.  Violent protest will not
achieve the goal we seek -- to end nuclear weapons testing
forever."</body></html>

<br><br><h4>15 CREW AND 2 SHIPS STILL DETAINED BY FRENCH AUTHORITIES -
GREENPEACE CALL FOR THEIR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h4></head><body>

<P>Papeete, Tahiti, 3 September 1995--As the French military today
flew 18 more Greenpeace activists, one cameraman and a Radio New
Zealand journalist to Papeete from Moruroa Atoll today,
Greenpeace called for the release of its two vessels the Rainbow
Warrior and the MV Greenpeace, and an immediate halt to French
nuclear testing.  

<P>As the Greenpeace vessel, Manutea, arrived in Moruroa from the
US, to join the growing international peace flotilla, it is
understood that the French authorities will tow both ships to Hao
Atoll, 600 miles North of Moruroa, with two skeleton crews and
that the ships will be kept under guard.  Greenpeace has not been
told of the French authorities' intentions once they reach there.

<P>All 20 people flown to Tahiti today had come from the two vessels
after the boats had been arrested for peacefully protesting
against France's imminent plans to carry out nuclear tests at
Moruroa atoll. 

<P>Xavier Pastor, campaigner from the MV Greenpeace, reported that
after the vessels were towed into Moruroa lagoon by French
warships, excessive violence was used against the crew who had
protested at being taken off the boats. 

<P>"We were sitting on the floor with linked arms when the French
commandos ordered the skipper to choose a skeleton crew. On our
refusal, the commandos punched, kicked and forcefully separated
us," said Pastor. 

<P>A skeleton crew of eight on the MV Greenpeace [1] and seven on
the Rainbow Warrior [2] are still being detained by the French
authorities, whilst the remainder were flown to Papeete.  It is
not known when the two boats will be released.

<P>"France's heavy handed tactics to prevent peaceful protest and
free speech will fail.  This issue is not between France and
Greenpeace but between those who want to see real progress on
nuclear disarmament and those that do not" said Thomas Schultz,
Greenpeace campaigner in Tahiti.

<P>The SV Rainbow Warrior was attempting to reach the Moruroa lagoon
when it was boarded by French commandos inside the exclusion
zone, smashing communications equipment on board and preventing
further transmissions.  The MV Greenpeace was boarded a few hours
later while outside the exclusion zone in International waters. 
The aim of the action was to prevent the reported test which was
due to take place on 1 September.  Greenpeace crew who were
released earlier, were handcuffed throughout the flight to
Papeete.

<P>"The French government's deliberate destruction of our
communications aboard the Rainbow Warrior and MV Greenpeace, the
detention of Greenpeace activists and ships will not silence
Greenpeace. There is growing outrage from the International
community over France's imminent plans to carry out nuclear tests
in Moruroa Atoll," said Schultz, in Tahiti. "We will continue our
peaceful protest if President Chirac decides to violate the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by going ahead with the nuclear
tests."

<P>Earlier today, Greenpeace International Executive Director
reiterated the call for Greenpeace supporters to use non-
violence * when protesting against French nuclear testing

<br>His Excellency the Ambassador
<br>Embassy of the French Republic
<br>London


<br><br>Dear Sir,

<P>I wish to protest against the reported forcible detention by tour
armed services of the Greenpeace ships in French Polynesia.

<P>The Captain of the Rainbow Warrior, Mr Jon Castle, is known to
me personally and I can assure you that he is an honourable,
peaceful person who acts according to the dictates of his
conscience.

<P>In conversations with many French citizens whom I meet in the
course of my business as a wildlife guide here in the Shetland
Islands, I have found them without exception opposed to and
ashamed of your government's action in resuming nuclear testing. 
Many of them regard this activity as a crime against the people
of the Pacific and the world, as do I.

<P>I hope that France will immediately release the peaceful
Greenpeace protestors and terminate the proposed programme of
nuclear explosions.

<P>This, and full payment for the damage caused to the equipment on
board the two Greenpeace vessels, would do much to restore the
reputation of your country with its many friends in Scotland,
amongst whom I have been proud to include myself.

<br>Yours sincerely

<br><br><B>Johnathan Willis</B>

<hr>


<P><B>The next one is from the MV Kaunitoni which is on its way to
Moruroa to be part of the International peace flotilla.</B>

<br><H4>The Kaunitoni Declaration - 3 September 1995
South Pacific Ocean - 20 degrees 24'S. 154 degrees 23'W
</H4><a href="flotmap.html">To see position on Map</a>
<P>We the individuals, representatives of environmental and anti-
nuclear groups, parliamentarian and members of the press coming
from Tahiti, Fiji, USA, Australia, New Zealand, Cook Islands, UK,
Germany, Belgium, France, Spain, Austria and Japan on board the
MV Kaunitoni, an independently funded, non-commercial initiative
from Fiji, are proud to be part of the International Peace
Flotilla.  Regardless of the fact that due to an engine failure,
we have been drifting two days sailing from the test site, we
are, however, carrying our mission to stop nuclear testing.  We
are in constant contact and cooperation with the international
effort.

<P>We are united in our conviction that the planned nuclear testing
on Moruroa is a crime against the planet - specifically the
peoples of South Pacific and the environment.  It is also clearly
a breach of the existing European law i.e the European Convention
on Human Rights, the EURATOM treaty and against agreed foreign
policies.

<P>We urge the French Government to acknowledge the global
opposition to these tests and to accept this as an international
issue.  We demand that they stop all nuclear testing.  We insist
that respective governments take all positive action against this
aggression and immediately initiate an International Commission
of Inquiry with unrestricted access to all aspects of the test
site.  Furthermore, we strongly criticise the Chinese Government
which has recently conducted nuclear tests in China.

<P>As there is now a real chance of achieving the aim of global
nuclear disarmament, we call upon all people to use this critical
moment to take any positive action you can.

<P>We are united in our convictions.  Nuclear tests must be banned
forever.  Global nuclear disarmament is a prerequisite for world
peace.

<P>54 people from many different countries and walks of life have
made this declaration.  The list includes four European Members
of Parliament, the Vice President of the German Social Democratic
Party, the Vice President of the Belgian Christian Democratic
Party, a Deputy of the German Green Party, a Senator from the
Fiji Parliament and the Ex Prime Minister of the Cook Islands.

"ARE THE FRENCH HEADED FOR A MELTDOWN?  A MOTLEY
FLOTILLA AND CONSUMER BOYCOTTS COULD GIVE PARIS FITS
OVER NUCLEAR TESTING"</h4><br>

By: Mark Hertsgaard</head><body>

<P>Ever since the imperious reign of Charles de Gaulle,
French governments have enjoyed a reputation for not
giving a damn what the rest of the world thinks.  The
latest example is President Jacques Chirac's insistence
on conducting underground nuclear tests in the South
Pacific.  On Friday, French commandos forcibly removed
two Greenpeace protest vessels from the Mururoa test
site, apparently clearing the way for the first of
eight tests that Chirac has pledged to conduct between
now and next May.

<P>But the battle over French nuclear weapons testing
isjust beginning.  If Chirac thinks he can win this
fight by simply bullying and ignoring his critics -- a
scenario in which France clears out the protesters and
detonates its warheads, absorbing a few days of bad
publicity -- he may be miscalculating badly.  Chirac's
immediate obstacle is a citizens flotilla of some 30
boats that will stage the aquatic version of a sit-in
at the Mururoa atoll.  

<P>The flotilla might be dismissed as mere annoyance were
it not for the spectacular victory Greenpeace
spearheaded earlier this year over Royal Dutch Shell,
the world's largest oil company.  The Greenpeace-Shell
battle attracted little media coverage in the United
States, but in Europe it was headline news for weeks. 
Shell was intent on burying an obsolete oil-storage rig
at the bottom of the North Sea. Greenpeace and other
environmentalists complained that the rig contained
toxic sludge that would pollute the marine underworld. 
In the end, the petroleum giant was forced to abandon
its plan by a furious wave of international protest and
consumer boycotts, catalyzed by Greenpeace activists
who twice managed to board and occupy the massive Brent
Spar rig.  The model of resistance used in that battle
-- civil disobedience by Greenpeace activists aimed at
awakening popular opinion, which in turn gives rise to
mass consumer boycotts and official opposition from
governments -- is now at work in the South Pacific.  

<P>The Brent Spar affair hit the news on May 1, when
Greenepace succeeded in landing a group of activists,
accompanied by journalists, on the rig.  The David and
Goliath stand-off generated lots of dramatic media
coverage, arousing public opinion and, in Germany,
sparking the first boycotts of Shell gasoline stations.

<P>Unmoved by the growing public opposition, Shell began
on June 12 to tow the Brent Spar toward its watery
grave off the western coast of Scotland. By this time,
motorists in Denmark and Holland were also shunning
Shell.

<P>Soon public officials of all stripes were rushing to
claim spots at the front of hte gathering parade of
outrage.  An unmistakable sign that the tide had turned
came on June 16, when German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
never much of an environmentalist but facing a Green
Party that now holds swing votes in parliament, urged
British Prime Minister John Major to block Shell's
burial plan.  

<P>But the boycotts hurt Shell most.  In Germany alone,
service station income fell 30 percent.  Losses
estimated in the millions, along with the blackening of
the company's name, provoked dissension within the
company.  Managers of Shell's European divisions
demanded that their U.K. counterparts cancel the
sinking plan. This Shell U.K. finally did on June 20. 
From now on.  The Economist warned, "Companies that
choose to defy their consumers' political demands are
placing their businesses in jeopardy."

<P>And not just companies.  Now France appears determined
to make the same errors of hubris that landed Shell in
the "untenable position" lamented in its final
statement of surrender.   Of course, the French
government cannot be hit in the pocketbook the same way
that a corporation can but politicians have their own
kind of balance sheet to worry about.  How high a
political price is Chirac willing to pay to live out
his Gaulist fantasy?

<P>He has already lost electoral support at home: polls
show that more than 60% of the French oppose a return
to testing.  And he has been condemned in unusually
blunt terms by other heads of government, especially in
the Pacific region.  The tartest comment came from
Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, who asked
Chirac over lunch why, if the nuclear tests were so
safe, France did not conduct them in Marseille?  France
also faces judgement in the World Court, where New
Zealand is arguing that the test violate international
law.  

<P>True, Chirac can shrug off  verbal criticism, but his
nuclear policy is also costing the French economy real
money.  Within days of Chirac's announcement in May
that France would resume testing, angry consumers and
businessmen from Hong Kong to Sydney to Tokyo began
spontaneously boycotting French goods.  The boycotts
increased after France attacked Greenpeace's Rainbow
Warrior II ship on July 9, nearly 10 years to the day
after France's fatal bombing of the original Rainbow
Warrior.

<P>Australia barred a French military supplier from
bidding on a $740 million contract for jet fighters, a
move that so angered Paris that it recalled its
ambassador from Canberra.  French wine sales are down
one-third in Australia and New Zealand.  If such
boycotts deepen and spread to Japan, Europe and the
United States, the economic injury to France could be
substantial, and maybe even intolerable.  Thus Chirac
has painted himself into the same corner that Royal
Dutch Shell did, for nothing is more likely to provoke
wider boycotts that to actually detonate a nuclear
device.  

<P>"There's no way we can physically stop them," concedes
Ulrich Jurgens, executive director [sic] of Greenpeace
International.  But physically stopping the French
isn't really the point.  The role of Greenpeace is to
inspire others to join the fight.  The Brent Spar
affair may have inaugurated a new era in environmental
politics, an era in which direct action is practiced,
not only by countercultural monkey-wrenchers but also
by bourgeois consumers, all united in a militant
multinational mass movement.

<P>At a time when millions feel alienated from formal
political structures and victimized by forces seemingly
too remote to challenge, this direct action model
offers an effective way to put personal beliefs into
political practice. Just because people look passive
doesn't mean they are apathetic -- a lesson Jacques
Chirac may soon learn the hard way.

Press and the Reagan Presidency" and "A Day in the
Life: The Music and Artistry of the Beatles."  He is
writing a book about the global ecological future.

<br><br><h4>RNZ National Radio "Morning Report", 4 September.</h4></head><body>

<P><B>Q:</B> Why was the MVGP seized?

<P><B>A:</B> Yves Bourbillon, French PR at Moruroa:
........ this was done also because the helicopter made a couple
of low `break ins' and the helicopter came from the MVGP and
everything, helicopters, zodiacs, everything are considered as
a whole in that case.



<P><B>Q/MH:</B> Given what the helicopter had done over the last week
wasn't what happened over the weekend not inevitable?

Don Rood (Radio New Zealand journalists on board the MV
Greenpeace who remained on the ship till all but the skeleton
crew were left).

 
<P><B>DR:</B> It was not perhaps inevitable, but that the French boarded
outside (the zone) in international waters is another question
entirely.  The MVGP was three miles outside the 12 mile exclusion
zone and steaming away from it when it was boarded.

<P><B>MH:</B>  From the time when it was apparent that they were trying to
take the ship to the time it was over, how long did all of that
take.

<P><B>DR:</B>  About twenty minutes I think, because the MVGP had all the
doors locked - they smashed down a lot of the doors to get inside
the ship to key areas like the radio room.  They had all the
doors sealed shut and a steel door put in place and that took
about a quarter of an hour for them to bash their way through in
there.

<P><B>MH:</B> It was the airborne side of things that was successful over
the weekend and we saw the pictures of the zodiacs coming
alongside the ship - it flipped - how close to a tragedy was
that?

<P><B>DR:</B> I was standing right above the zodiac when it happened.  The
GP heaved up in the air - it was very rough waters.   The zodiac
got sucked underneath.  The GP came down on top of it.  It
flipped.  There were about six or seven commandos inside it.  I
only saw four heads come up afterwards and then the boat drifted
astern.  All French efforts then went on rescuing the people from
the zodiac.  I was told later when I questioned one of the French
officers, he said that all the French people had been rescued and
were safe.

<P><B>MH:</B> Once the French arrived, what sort of resistance was put up
by GP?

<P><B>DR:</B>  The GP members put up quite a bit of resistance, mostly
passive.  They blocked the entrance to the bridge.  As the French
made to fire tear gas they ripped the masks off their (the
commandos) faces and threw them overboard.  I think that was what
eventually thwarted any major use of tear gas - the fact that all
their gas masks had gone by that stage.  Anything that the French
put down on deck, even momentarily, packs, anything, were just
thrown overboard.  There was quite a bit of stuff jettisoned that
way.  There were some violent scuffles and I followed one French
officer around as he moved around the front of the bridge with
a baton as he tried to smash his way through the window there. 
That proved unsuccessful, because it was toughened glass.

or <a href="rw180.jpg">22KB JPG.</a> French commandos board Mv Greenpeace Greenpeace/Beltra
<P><B>MH:</B>  You were observing while all this was going on?
<p><a href="rw181.gif"><img align=top src="rw181t.gif" border=0 alt="French commandos board Mv Greenpeace">75KB GIF</a>
or <a href="rw181.jpg">22KB JPG.</a> French commandos board Mv Greenpeace Greenpeace/Beltra
<P><B>MH:</B>  You were observing while all this was going on?

<P><B>DR:</B>  I was observing - I was just following around.  They left
me alone. They did not touch me until right at the end when
orders were given to put everyone below decks. I moved to the
back of the boat so I could see what was happening.  I watched
the GP crew hustled below decks.  They then turned to the media. 
There was a Spanish photographer, a British film cameraman and
myself and we were grabbed and hustled - I broke away again and
got back to watch as they pushed the others downstairs.  They
then came for me.  Forced me through the broken door and used
 
their batons to persuade me to go downstairs.  

<P><B>MH: </B> So initially when the French came on board you were able to
identify yourself as a journalist?  Or they knew this already?

<P><B>DR:</B>  Well I was standing there with my tape recorder over my
shoulder and I had the mike in my hand with RNZ plastered all
over it.  So it was clear who I was a journalist.

<P><B>MH:</B>  There have been plenty of reports over the weekend of rough
treatment bordering on violence.  What can you tell us of this?

<P><B>DR:</B>  I don't think it bordered on violence - I think it was
violence.  I saw, especially yesterday, when the French
legionnaires were called in to split the crew up into a skeleton
crew to take the GP to Hau and the rest who were going to be
deported.  GP members resisted this.  They staged a sit in.  The
legionnaires were called in.  They poured down the stairs and
they grabbed anyone they could find.  I saw one man being kicked
and carried away with a legionnaire kicking him in the head.  I
saw others being punched.  There was a former French soldier
there, who was singled out for special attention.  He was leapt
on by two or three of the French commandos and legionnaires and
he was punched around the head.  He actually broke away and
karate kicked one of them in the back.  That, of course, enraged
them and was very roughly handled as he was pulled up the stairs. 
I saw people being dragged up the stairs - their heads banging
on the stair as they went up.  Later on when I was hustled out,
they had to pass the message up that this was a journalist coming
through - so I'm not quite sure what that meant.

<br><br><h4>GREENPEACE INFLATABLES NOW IN MORUROA LAGOON IN NUCLEAR TEST PROTEST</h4>

<br>Moruroa--4 September 1995--Two inflatables carrying Greenpeace activists have
just entered Moruroa lagoon to protest the imminent resumption of French nuclear
testing. 

<br><br>The two boats were launched from a vessel in the peace flotilla and entered
Moruroa lagoon at 5.21 am local time.  They were in radio contact with the
flotilla, and heading for the house of the French Naval commander in charge at
Moruroa - Admiral Philippe Euverte, where they hope to deliver their protest
against the imminent test. 

<br><br>It is not clear where and when that test will be carried out -Moruroa Atoll or
nearby Fangataufa.  

<br><br>"This protest is a last-hour attempt to stave off the test, due to be detonated
at any minute. It comes from Greenpeace, on behalf of the more than 5 million
people who signed our petition opposing testing," said Thomas Schultz,
Greenpeace International nuclear campaigner in Papeete, Tahiti. 

<br><br>"The French military have seized two of our vessels, smashed their
communications, used unreasonable force against our people, but we refuse to be
silenced," said Schultz.

<br><br>The entry by the inflatable crews into the Moruroa test site is part of what is
expected to be an on-going protest by the international peace flotilla.  About
25 boats are at or drawing near to the 12-mile exclusion zone. Another vessel
left Tahiti today carrying politicians from Japan, Australia, Sweden, Italy and
Luxembourg.

<br><br>In Paris, environmentalist Jacques Cousteau resigned this evening
from his position as Chairman of the "Council for Future
Generations," set up by Jacques Chirac to advise the President
on issues affecting the environment. Cousteau said his
resignation was because Chirac has gone ahead with his test
programme, which was a threat to the nuclear Non Proliferation
Treaty and didn't consult the council before he did so. Cousteau
was quoted in Le Monde today he would like the President to
change his mind at the last minute, saying "it's not by exploding
bombs underground that one protects a country." </body></html>

<h4>FRENCH PRESIDENT CHIRAC'S TELEVISED SPEECH WILL INCREASE 
            OPPOSITION TO NUCLEAR TESTS: GREENPEACE</h4>

<P>PARIS, 5 September 1995 -- The refusal of France's President
Chirac, on France 2 (1300h programme), to announce the date of
the first of a series of nuclear tests is an insult to the French
people and to international public opinion who are overwhelmingly
against the resumption of testing.

<P>"Following Commander Cousteau's appeal yesterday for France not
to resume testing, Greenpeace has a glimmer of hope," said Remi
Parmentier, President of Greenpeace France. "Chirac claims he has
listened to the opinions of experts in France but with Jacques
Cousteau, who lead a mission of experts to Moruroa in 1987,
stepping down from a Presidential commission over the testing
issue, it is clear that he does not have the support of his own
experts."

<P>President Chirac continues to turn a deaf ear to world opposition
to testing and seems unconcerned with that as well as that of the
63 percent of his own French people who are also opposed.  He has
also ignored the violence used by French commandos against
Greenpeace activists onboard the two Greenpeace boats, from whom
we still have no news."

<P>"Far from curbing public opinion, the French government's action
will exacerbate the opposition to the nuclear tests planned by
President Chirac," Parmentier said.

<H2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

<p>CHIRAC'S NUCLEAR TEST AN INSULT TO THE WORLD: GREENPEACE</H2>
<p>Papeete, Tahiti, 5 September 1995--(GP) The over 20 kiloton
underground nuclear test detonated by the French Government at
Moruroa Atoll at 11:39 am local time today is an outrageous act
which shows contempt for global political and public will,
Greenpeace said today.

<p>"This nuclear explosion is a slap in the face by Jacques Chirac
to more than 150 governments and millions of people seeking a
nuclear-free future worldwide," said Greenpeace's Thomas Schultz
from Tahiti.  "In post-cold war times, Chirac has succeeded only
in prolonging the nuclear threat that hangs over us all," Schultz
said.

<p>Five hours ago, a second Greenpeace activist in 24 hours was
arrested on Moruroa Atoll in a attempt to stave off the test. 
An estimated 20 peace flotilla vessels are currently near the
test area around Moruroa Atoll.  The Greenpeace vessels Manutea
and Vega are still in the area as part of the flotilla.

<p>Greenpeace is now calling for a worldwide increase in NON-VIOLENT
protests against the French Government's continued nuclear
nightmare.  Dozens of protests are expected to take place in the
next few days at French Embassies and Consulates around the
world.

<p>In Paris, Greenpeace France director Penelope Komites said: "This
test was the first of a planned eight.  Worldwide protest has
been unable to stop this one but Chirac is sadly mistaken if he
thinks the protests will die down."

<p>If the French Government now declares its opposition to the
spread of nuclear weapons, it must be seen as a cynical attempt
to hide the development and production of weapons of mass
destruction, Greenpeace said.

<p>Greenpeace has called for the release of its vessels MV
Greenpeace and Rainbow Warrior being held by French military
since September first.

EURATOM TREATY: 
EUROPEAN COMMISSIONERS DEMAND STOP TO FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTS</title></head><body>
<h4>EURATOM TREATY: 
EUROPEAN COMMISSIONERS DEMAND STOP TO FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTS</h4>
<P>BRUSSELS, Wednesday 6 September, 1995 --Welcoming today's
European Union Commission call for a stay on French nuclear
testing, Greenpeace today urged all European Governments to use
the breathing space it should provide to reach an urgent
agreement with France to halt any further tests.

<P>Less than 12 hours after France detonated its first nuclear test
at Moruroa Atoll, the European Commission has asked France to
provide more information on the impact of testing and it wants
this before any further test.  Using Article 34 of the EURATOM
Treaty, the Commission has requested that France supply detailed
information on planned health and safety measures before giving
its consent to France.  

<P>Speaking from a Greenpeace vigil outside the Commission's
headquarters in Brussels, Louise Gale of Greenpeace's European
Unit said: "Greenpeace welcomes the Commission's recognition of 
its responsibility to protect the environment from the effects
of French nuclear tests.

<P>"France must act responsibly and abide by the Commission's
request to suspend its testing programme," said Gale.

<P>"This decision gives the vital opportunity for other European
Governments to meet with France and find a way to help
France terminate its testing programme," Gale said.

<P>"Everyone knows these tests are technically unnecessary, " Gale
said.  "The world can't wait for lengthy negotiations --
governments should now secure an urgent political accord with the
French to halt the tests before the ongoing negotiations of a
treaty to ban all nuclear tests are finalised."

<P>Greenpeace activists maintained a vigil outside the European
Commission headquarters before the decision.

<P>Protests are continuing around the globe following the first
French test detonated at 11.39am (local time, Moruroa).  This
morning, Greenpeace protests are being staged in Australia,
Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece,
Italy, Ireland, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
Philippines, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, Ukraine and USA.

<P>* Notes to Editors 
  
<P>1. The EURATOM Treaty (the Treaty establishing European Atomic
Energy Community) is one of the founding Treaties of the 
European Community and was signed in 1957. 
  
<P>2. Article 34 EURATOM obliges France to give the European 
Commission information on the additional health and safety 
measures in place for "particularly dangerous experiments", and
obliges the Commission to give its opinion on these measures
before such experiments are carried out, and its prior approval
where the effects of such experiments are  likely to affect the
territories of other Member States, e.g.  Pitcairn Island, under
UK jurisdiction.  
  
<P>3. Article 35 EURATOM gives the European Commission the right to
inspect nuclear facilities to verify the operation and efficiency
of their monitoring of radioactivity levels on the air, water and
soil, and to ensure compliance with basic health and safety
standards to protect the health of workers and general public. 
 
<P>4. Article 148 EURATOM means that if the Commission fails to take
a decision on Article 34 EURATOM, a Member State or the European 
Parliament could take the Commission to the European Court of 
Justice.

  <H4>GREENPEACE CALLS AGAIN FOR NON-VIOLENCE IN PROTESTS AGAINST
                    FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING
</H4>
<P>PAPEETE, Tahiti, 7 September, 1995 -- (GP)  In the wake of riots
in Tahiti today, Greenpeace again reiterated its call for only
non-violent protest in response to the resumption of French
testing in the South Pacific.

<P>Following the first in a proposed series of testing on Tuesday
spontaneous peaceful protests occurred around the world which
Greenpeace welcomed and took part in.

<P>"Clearly, if President Chirac continues to test nuclear weapons,
opposition will grow, however, we implore all those who are
genuinely striving for a nuclear free world to undertake only
non-violent protests," said Thomas Shultz, Greenpeace in Tahiti. 

<P>Throughout the world,  the public and political opposition to the
testing programme continues to grow,  with nearly 5 million
citizens signing an international appeal sent to France's
President and over 150 countries expressing their opposition.

<H4>CHIRAC MUST ABIDE BY EU DECISION AND STOP NUCLEAR TESTS:
GREENPEACE</H4>
<P>BRUSSELS, 8 September, 1995--European Union Environment
Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard is due to send a letter to the
French Government today demanding France stop its nuclear tests
until it can prove the tests are safe.

<P>Under the EURATOM Treaty, the Commission can demand certain
health and safety information before nuclear tests are conducted. 
It has now demanded that France hand over detailed proof that
additional health and safety measures have been taken before the
French tests continue.

<P>"President Chirac must now prove that he's a 'good European' and
abide by the Commission's request to suspend its testing
programme," said Louise Gale of Greenpeace's European Unit.

<P>The Commission's decision gives a vital opportunity for other
European Governments to meet with France and find a way to help
France terminate its testing programme, Greenpeace said.

<P>Speaking from Greenpeace International in Amsterdam, Stephanie
Mills, the Rainbow Warrior campaigner just expelled from French
Polynesia and Paris, said:  "Now the Commission has acted, the
world can't wait for lengthy negotiations.  European Governments
should now secure an urgent political accord with France to halt
the tests before ongoing negotiations of a treaty to ban all
nuclear tests are finalised."

<P>"France sees fit to ignore the Treaty now the world knows how
dangerous nuclear tests are," said Mills.  "So far, they've
ignored the legal obligations under the Treaty just as they have 
world public opinion and over 150 governments opposed to their
nuclear tests in the South Pacific."

<H4>NUCLEAR TEST EYE WITNESSES FLOWN OFF MORUROA; to be deported</H4>

<P>London--9 September 1995--Two British Greenpeace activists who
were on Moruroa Atoll when the first French nuclear test was
detonated this week will be deported to Europe this weekend.

or <a href="rw191.jpg">27KB JPG.</a>Alan Baker in Kayak.
<P>The two, Alan Baker, 31, of Lewes and Matthew Whitting, 36, of
Hereford were part of a Greenpeace team on a boat which was at
sea for 10 days around Moruroa.  Just hours before the test,
Baker and Whitting went by kayak, under cover of darkness, to the
atoll,  disguised as French legionnaires. They arrived on the
atoll at 11 pm on 3 September; one was discovered at 12.30 am on
the morning of the test on 5 September, and the other at 7.20 am.
They had been on the atoll for more than 24 hours undetected. 

<P>While Greenpeace cannot claim that the two delayed the test, it
is known that the 11.35 am 20 kiloton detonation was the first
ever French test of 193 which was set off later than 8 am.  

<P>The two have been held, without contact with their families or
Greenpeace, until late yesterday Tahiti time when they were flown
to Papeete under heavy guard.  They were allowed a brief moment
with Greenpeace lawyers, in the presence of riot police with
guns, and are still in custody, but appear to be ok.  Greenpeace
expects them to be deported to Paris then into the UK over the
weekend.  

<P>Nine other Greenpeace activists were yesterday flown from Hao
Atoll where the vessels Rainbow Warrior and MV Greenpeace were
towed after being arrested by the French Military on 1 September
and held without legal basis since then.  However, the Rainbow
Warrior captain, British citizen Jon Castle, is still being held
alone on the French military base.  It remains unclear as to what
French plans are for him.

<P>"Two Greenpeace people witnessed the horror of an underground
nuclear test on Moruroa Atoll.  They were then held under guard
for five days and absolutely no protest was heard from the
British Government," said William Peden of Greenpeace UK. 

<P>"Similarly, Jon Castle has been held hostage for more than one
week and the Greenpeace boats have been seized -- also with no
legal basis. It's disgusting that John Major stands alone in
supporting Jacques Chirac's resumption of French nuclear testing. 
It's about time he condemned these tests and committed himself
to a nuclear free future, not an Anglo-French nuclear arms race,"
he said. "He should be ashamed of himself."

<P>Contact William Peden pager number 01399 1133 quote number 787
032 or Cindy Baxter Greenpeace Communications  0171 833 0600. On
return to the UK Whitting and Baker will give a press conference. 
Greenpeace UK will confirm the time after we speak to them.  We
expect this to be Monday.

<H4>INTERNATIONAL PARLIAMENTARIANS PROTEST NUCLEAR TESTING AT MORUROA 
</H4>
<P>OFF MORUROA ATOLL, South Pacific, 9th September, 1995 -- (GP)
Eight parliamentarians from Japan, Sweden, Luxembourg, Italy and
Australia today on board the vessel La Ribaud sailed into
France's 12-mile exclusion zone around the test site at Moruroa
atoll to deliver a joint statement declaring that France is in
breach of commitments made under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, and is not in compliance with the Euratom treaty.   

<P>Two activists from Austria representing Global 2000, an Austrian
environmental organisation accompanied the parliamentarians. They
were joined by journalists from Italy, Spain, Great Britain,
Germany and the United States. All were arrested by French
military officials after crossing into the exclusion zone set up
by the French around the nuclear testing site at Moruroa and
Fangataufa atolls at 1329 local time.
 
<P>The Peace Flotilla of some 15 vessels outside the exclusion zone
protesting the recent French test accompanied the
parliamentarians to the line. Greenpeace activists crewing the
boat were also arrested.
 
<P>"We are united in our demand for an immediate end to nuclear
testing at Moruroa. We come in peace and our method of protest
is one of complete non-violence," states the declaration of the
international parliamentarians at Moruroa. "We firmly condemn the
arrogance and colonial attitude of the French government and its
indifference and disregard for all the nations of the South
Pacific."
 
<P>The Declaration calls on France to release all scientific data
on the effects of its nuclear weapons testing and to allow
independent scientific monitoring. It also stated that Chirac is
acting in "complete contradiction to the whole tradition of
France as the cradle of democracy and human rights."
 
<P>The parliamentarians who were arrested today at Moruroa were:
Australia -- Tom Wheelwright, Ian Cohen 
Japan -- Kou Tanaka, Noboro Usami 
Sweden -- Eva Goes
Italy -- Lino De Benetti, Sauro Turroni 
Luxembourg -- Jup Weber
Austria's Global 2000 in Austria--Ilonka Horvath, Kastenhofer  

<P>The journalists who were on the boat were Paul Brown (The
Guardian, UK), Sara Gandolfi (Corriere Sera, Italy), Enric
Gonzales (El Pais, Spain), Ralf Kaiser (ZDF Television, Germany)
Carlo Pizzati (La Republica, Italy), Gerd Schuster (Stern
Magazine, Germany) and John Skow (Time Magazine, USA).
 
<P>The Peace Flotilla joining Greenpeace in protesting near Moruroa
is made up of ships and crew from Chile, New Zealand, Australia,
Germany, Japan, the United States, Denmark, Sweden, Italy,
Belgium and Polynesia. The Flotilla plans to continue a creative
protest in the Pacific as they maintain a non-violent vigil at
the French nuclear test site.
 
<P>The Parliamentarians' declaration concludes with "We ask the
President of the French Democracy, M. Jacques Chirac, in the name
of millions of people in the democracies we represent, to act now
like a world statesman and heed our call."

CHIRAC MUST ABIDE BY EU RULES AND STOP NUCLEAR TESTS:-11 September</title></head><body>
<H4>CHIRAC MUST ABIDE BY EU RULES AND STOP NUCLEAR TESTS:GREENPEACE</H4>
 
<P>BRUSSELS, 11 September, 1995--European Environment Commissioner
Ritt Bjerregaard today urged France stop its nuclear tests
until it can prove the tests are safe.
 
<P>In a report released today, the European Commission lays out in
considerable detail why they have requested that the French
government not undertake any more nuclear tests before further
evaluation by the Commission.
 
<P>The report notes the lack of evidence to support French claims
that its nuclear tests are safe and cites France's refusal to
grant full access to the test site as one main reason for today's
announcement. 
 
<li> Commission scientists assert that possible long term leakage
of radio-active elements is the most significant environmental
risk.<br>  
 
<li> The Commission states that a reliable risk assessment would
require access to detailed data about movements in the rocks and
geological structure which they have not been privy to.<br>  
 
<li>While the French consider a major and sudden rupturing of the
atoll structure unlikely, the Commission cannot confirm this
claim without access to the data currently withheld by French
authorities."<br>
 
<li> The French data does not provide sufficient information to
clearly establish that there is no increase in radioactivity
levels over time.<br>
 
<li> The document, "les atolls de Mururoa et Fangataufa", published
by CEA/DAM-DIRCEN, concludes that the stability of the volcanic
base would not be endangered by further tests but in fact
produces no evidence to support this claim.<br>
 
<li> No detailed results are given by French authorities about
spatial distribution of radio-active elements in drilling
performed after tests.  The report states that such details would
be of high importance to prove the absence of perturbation of
radionuclide migration.<br>
 
<P>Under the EURATOM treaty, France must obtain the Commission's
permission before it conducts additional nuclear tests.  Before
that permission is given, they must hand over detailed proof that
additional health and safety measures have been taken.<br> 
 
<P>The Commission's statement today acknowledges that the EURATOM
Treaty applies to nuclear military activities in French
Polynesia.<br>
 
<P>"France cannot ignore its obligations under the EURATOM Treaty
-- the world knows how dangerous nuclear tests are," said Louise
Gale of Greenpeace.  "It is not for France to say whether or not
it will accept the Commission's decision to ask France to stop
testing until it has taken a position under Article 34 EURATOM.
As guardian of the Treaties, it is the Commission which must
ensure that Community rules are applied and respected by all
Member States, including France."<br>
 
<P>The Commission's decision provides an excellent opportunity for
other European governments to meet with France and find a way
to help France terminate its testing programme, Greenpeace
said.<br>
 
<P>"Greenpeace is encouraged by the European Commission announcement
today and call on France to live it up to it's responsibilities
as a member of the European Community and provide in-depth
information on the true environmental impacts of nuclear testing
in the South Pacific," said Greenpeace International Director
Thilo Bode in Brussels today. <br>

<P>NOTES TO EDITORS:
 
<li> The European Commission report was written by the
Directorate-General of Environment, Nuclear Safety and Civil
Protection (Radiation Protection).  It
follows a August 24 scientific and technical meeting between
French authorities and the Commission -- concerning radiation
protection aspects of nuclear tests in French Polynesia.

GREENPEACE ACTIVISTS ATTEMPT TO OCCUPY DRILLING RIG AT FRENCH
TEST SITE IN FANGATAUFA ATOLL:-19 September</title></head><body><p> SEPTEMBER 19, 1995  

<H4>GREENPEACE ACTIVISTS ATTEMPT TO OCCUPY DRILLING RIG AT FRENCH
TEST SITE IN FANGATAUFA ATOLL, MOST PROBABLE SITE FOR SECOND TEST 
 </H4>
<p>ABOARD SV MANUTEA, Off 12-mile Exclusion Zone, Sept. 19 -- In a
daring new wave of protests against French nuclear testing,
Greenpeace activists, in a coordinated maneuver from the 20-boat
Peace Flotilla, have entered the French exclusion zone around
Fangataufa atoll, the most likely test site for France's second
and more powerful nuclear blast. 
 
<p>The two activists, Belgian Roger Gregoor and New Zealander
Rachael Sanson, planned to drive their inflatable to a testing
drill rig located in Fangataufa lagoon and occupy it as long as
possible. Fangataufa has traditionally been used for extremely
high-yield nuclear testing, and the upcoming test expected to be
detonated there could be up to 150 kilotons.  
 
<p>France's larger nuclear tests were moved from Moruroa to
Fangataufa in 1988.  At the time the French military conceded
that this was because of the extent of damage already caused at
Moruroa, effectively admitting that Moruroa could no longer
sustain larger tests in the 100 kiloton range.  Since 1966,
France has tested five atmospheric and 8 underground tests at
Fangataufa, the last test in 1991 being 130 kilotons.

<p>As European Union members plan for an environmental review to
examine the impact of French testing, the Greenpeace activists
challenged the EU to come to Fangataufa, the most contaminated
of the French testing sites. Said Gregoor, "Let them come and
study the damage done to this former Pacific paradise.  However,
we advise them to use extreme caution.  We are going to the
drilling rig, not the atoll--even the French won't let their
workers stay for long periods here because of the contamination."
 
<p>Despite constant harassment from French warships, jets and
helicopters, the determined members of the Peace Flotilla have
carried out continuous incursions into Moruroa and now,
Fangataufa, with borrowed boats, battered outboards and wooden
canoes.  Today the ship Machias is leaving from Tahiti with a
cargo full of fresh supplies for the Peace Flotilla.
 
<p>As France has never allowed an independent long-term scientific
study of Fangataufa, the EU environmental commission may be the
first allowed, although only for a two or three week "study."  

<p>"Inviting scientists in for a week or two to 'conduct research'
is not only ridiculous, it is pathetic," said Audrey Cardwell,
nuclear campaigner aboard the Greenpeace Manutea.  "France has
damaged the people and environment of the South Pacific for
decades with its blind determination to test nuclear weapons
here.  If France won't listen to the people of the Pacific who
rightly own this land, then maybe pressure from its neighbors in
Europe will make a difference."

FANGATAUFA - FRANCE'S SECRET TEST ZONE 19 September</title></head><body><H4>FANGATAUFA - FRANCE'S SECRET TEST ZONE </H4>

<p>INTRODUCTION

<p>Unlike Moruroa, little public attention has focused on France's
second test site at Fangataufa. But while it may remain hidden
from the public eye, Fangataufa is likely to play an important
role in France's resumed testing programme.  Reports from Paris
have suggested that the French military are planning to resume
French testing in the South Pacific with a blast at Fangataufa,
possibly in October, and that it may be the site of most of the
eight blasts planned over the next year.  

<p>Fangataufa is an oblong-shaped coral atoll with a basalt base,
41 km south east of Moruroa.  It was first used as a site for
atmospheric tests, and was then chosen in 1973 as the site for
underground testing after experimental drilling at another atoll,
Eiao, showed the basalt there was too fragile for tests.  

<p>Fangataufa is a low-lying coral atoll, with its coral ring rarely
exceeding 200 metres in width.  In many places the sea washes
over the low reef into the lagoon, which is 40-42 metres deep. 
As  Fangataufa was a closed atoll, the French Army had to blast
a 400 metre gap in the coral ring as a pass for their ships,
between 1964 and 1966.  The officially sponsored Tazieff
scientific mission of 1981 stated that: "A careful inventory
should be made of the effects caused by the opening up of the
atoll of Fangataufa with a pass before any reactivation of this
test site."  If such a study has been made, it has never been
made publicly available.  

<p>Fangataufa has a wharf and airstrip built by the military, but
there are no permanent personnel based on the atoll.  The atoll
is dominated by a large concrete blockhouse where the nuclear
devices are detonated from, located on the north-east rim, and
several antennae.  The testing zones on the atoll are known
as "Empereur", "Echo", "Terme Sud" and "Fregate".
 
<p>ATMOSPHERIC TESTS AT FANGATAUFA
 
Fangataufa is a small atoll, 5 km by 8 km and was the location
for five atmospheric tests between 1966 and 1974, including the
largest device ever tested by France, a 2.6 megatonne blast in
1968.
 
<p>The first atmospheric test at Fangataufa and France's first
airdrop of  a nuclear weapon was the Tamoure test of 19 July,
1966.  The 60 kt pure plutonium fission bomb was dropped from a
Mirage IVA aircraft over the open ocean adjacent to Fangataufa. 
In 1968, France exploded its first thermonuclear bomb from a
balloon
 
at Fangataufa, the largest ever blast.  Code-named "Canopus", the
bomb weighed an estimated three tonnes.  After this blast,
Fangataufa was said to be so heavily contaminated that it was
declared off-limits for humans for the next six years.  

<p>According to testimonies from workers at the test sites published
by Greenpeace, all vegetation on Fangataufa was destroyed by the
atmospheric tests and planting since then has been largely
unsuccessful.  Workers say that in the early 1980's personnel
were still only allowed to work in rotating shifts at Fangataufa
because it was so contaminated.  Workers also describe ciguatera,
fish-poisoning which occurs when massive coral death takes place,
occurring at Fangataufa.  The living quarters for workers
building the blockhouse were located at Fregate and workers say
the land was so heavily contaminated that travel to the area
where the blockhouse was being built was by boat.  Other reports
say that transport also took place in special buses with no
windows and a special air-conditioning system which was air-
tight, because of the serious levels of contamination.  One
worker said:  "In 1968 I worked on Fangataufa preparing for the
first French hydrogen bomb.  When we first arrived Fangataufa was
a lovely place, quiet and undisturbed, with a lot of vegetation. 
After the explosion nothing was left.  No houses, no man-made
installations, no trees, nothing.  The whole place had to be
evacuated because of the radioactive contamination." 
("Testimonies", Greenpeace 1990)

<p><H5>UNDERGROUND TESTS
 </H5>
<p>After concerted international pressure, a judgement against
France in the World Court, and protests by Greenpeace and other
organisations, France finally announced in 1974 that it would
begin testing underground in 1974, nine years after the 1963
Partial Test Ban Treaty banned tests in the atmosphere.  
On 8 June 1974 President Valery Giscard d'Estang announced that
the 1975 programme would be underground:  the first two
exploratory underground tests explosions took place at Fangataufa
in June and November.  The first took place on the southern rim
of the atoll, with a yield of 20kt.  The second was on the
northern rim, a blast of 15kt.
 
<p>However, from 1976 to 1987 all underground tests took place at
Moruroa, purportedly to avoid the cost of maintaining two test
sites.  All tests at Fangataufa since 1988 have taken place under
the lagoon at depths of 500-700 metres.  

<p>In March 1988, Vice Admiral Pierre Thireaut, Commander in Chief
of the French in the Pacific, revealed that in order to prevent
serious fractures in the rock at Moruroa that might lead to
radioactive leakage, the most powerful blasts in the testing
programme would from then on be conducted at Fangataufa. The
first test at Fangataufa since 1975 thus took place on 30
November 1988, a blast of 100kt.

<p>According to workers at the site, underground tests at Fangataufa
have caused the atoll to sink in places and shallow craters have
formed in the area of the explosions.  There are many prohibited
areas on the atoll because of earlier radioactive contamination. 
After the first underground tests  in 1975, an eye witness
described a kind of tidal wave washing over Fangataufa and a few
days later thousands of stinking dead fish washed up on the
shore.    

<p>There were six underground tests at Fangataufa between November
1988 and May 1991, all in the 70kt - 130 kt range:
 
<pre>1988      November 30    Fangataufa 100kt
1989      June 10        Fangataufa 70kt
          November 27    Fangataufa 90kt
1990      June 26        Fangataufa 100kt
          November 14    Fangataufa 120kt
 
1991      May 29         Fangataufa 130kt

(July 1995)</pre></body></html>

YOUNG NEW ZEALANDERS ENTER FRENCH EXCLUSION ZONE ON SURF SKI</title></head><body>

<H4>YOUNG NEW ZEALANDERS ENTER FRENCH EXCLUSION ZONE ON SURF SKI</H4>
 
<P>MORUROA, September 21 -- In a continuing wave of direct actions
against French nuclear testing, today two young New Zealand
activists from the 20-boat Peace Flotilla paddled into the
12-mile exclusion zone surrounding Moruroa atoll on a surf ski
named the Aotearoa Arc.
 
<P>The two activists, Daniel Godoy, 22, of Wellington, and Daniel
Salmon, 25, of Auckland entered the nuclear test exclusion zone
early this morning as an act of opposition by New Zealand youth
to French nuclear testing in the South Pacific.
 
<P>"The Pacific Island and Rim countries are united in their
repugnance at the nuclear detonation at Moruroa on September 5. 
Any future tests should be canceled immediately because these
atolls are riddled with cracks," said Daniel Salmon. "We hope our
protest will provide impetus for continued worldwide youth
opposition to the French nuclear testing program."
 
<P>The Peace Flotilla has been the subject of continuous harassment
by French warships, fighter-planes and helicopters.  "All less
direct attempts by the Peace Flotilla to discuss French actions
and intimidation with the French Navy have been ignored," added
Salmon. "So we are entering the Zone wanting answers."
 
<P>Earlier in the day, two Greenpeace activists were released from
French custody after entering the exclusion zone around the
neighboring atoll of Fangataufa.  The activists reported that
preparations were being made for another more powerful test at
Fangataufa, furthering speculation that the site will be used for
the second blast, possibly one reaching the 150 kiloton
threshold. 
 
<P>A delegation of scientists from the European Commission,
currently in Tahiti, have been refused to carry out any
independent sampling of the two test sites.  
"The delegation from the EC must be allowed to conduct a
thoroughly independent investigation of nuclear testing on
Moruroa and Fangataufa," said Salmon.  "The EC has a duty to
ensure their member state France shows international
responsibility by ending its escalation of the nuclear arms
race."
  
<P>Daniel Godoy, who sold his car to secure a passage with the Peace
Flotilla, left with encouraging words: "We are entering French
territory with the support and good wishes of all the New
Zealanders who sacrificed so much to make the 6000 mile
round-trip voyage to protest at Moruroa."

SEPTEMBER 26, 1995

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
 
<P>BRITISH GOVERNMENT "ACTING ILLEGALLY" BY IGNORING FRENCH
NUCLEAR TESTS AND ENDANGERING BRITONS IN TEST ZONE
 <p>
The British Government may be acting unlawfully by not protecting
UK citizens in the Pitcairn Islands affected by French Nuclear
Testing. Greenpeace UK  has received a legal opinion from
Geoffrey Robertson QC that the indifference of the Government
towards the welfare of British nationals in the test area is
unlawful if it is the result of a secret agreement to share data
obtained from the French nuclear test programme.
 <p>
Lawyers instructed by Greenpeace have explained that under
European law Britain is entitled to intervene to stop the tests
until they comply with safety standards laid down by the Euratom
Treaty. This is because the UK Government is legally responsible
for the welfare of Pitcairn Islanders - who live less than 500
miles from Moruroa Atoll - and for other Britons who have
lawfully visited the test area in order to protest.
 <p>
According to the lawyers, the Government's refusal to consider
invoking the safety procedure under the Euratom Treaty is a
breach of its duty to safeguard the lives of British subjects and
may be open to challenge in the High Court. It is also unlawful
if it is done in bad faith: for the ulterior motive of wanting
to share data resulting from tests that have not complied with
Euratom Treaty safeguards.
 <p>
The legal opinion was delivered for Greenpeace by Geoffrey
Robertson QC who led the defence at the Matrix Churchill trial
and who has made a number of successful challenges to the British
Government in European Courts, and by Kate Markus, Chair of the
Public Law Project.
 <p>
"This legal opinion makes it a matter of urgency for the
Government to come clean about its policy over French nuclear
tests", said Greenpeace Campaigner William Peden. "It is either
collaborating with the French for its own shady reasons, or it
is showing callous indifference for the health and safety of the
British dependents on the Pitcairn Islands who have the
misfortune to live next door to Chirac's nuclear madness".
 <p>
Greenpeace has today written to the British Government asking
what steps they intend to take to protect Pitcairn Islanders and
reveal the true extent of Anglo-French nuclear collaboration.
 <p>
For further information please contact Greenpeace UK Press Office
on 0171 359 4837 or 0171 354 5100.<p>
 <p>
Copy of legal advice prepared by Geoffrey Robertson and Kate
Markus can be provided on request.

SEPTEMBER 26, 1995
<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      
 
 
<P>TWENTY-ONE POLYNESIANS ABOARD GREENPEACE SHIP VEGA ENTER
FRENCH
NUCLEAR TEST EXCLUSION ZONE WITH SIMPLE REQUEST:
"STOP TESTING ON OUR ANCESTRAL LAND."
 
 <p>
MORUROA, September 26 -- After nearly 30 years, the people of
Tureia have, at least for a night, been reunited with their
homeland of Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls. They have come with a
simple request for their new inhabitants:  "We are here to ask
you, President Chirac and Admiral, to terminate all nuclear
testing.  We want our lands back."
 <p>
Today, twenty-one Polynesians sailed into the 12-mile exclusion
zone aboard the Greenpeace Vega crewed by Greenpeace veterans
David McTaggart and Chris Robinson.  Offering the French Admiral
time to consider their request before entering, the people of
Tureia stated that they came in peace to deliver their message
and would stay on the atoll for a night, and then depart.
 <p>
"For over 30 years the French government has seriously harmed our
children, islands and oceans," read the Polynesian statement. "We
respectfully request that you immediately stop further testing of
nuclear weapons on our property and return Moruroa and Fangataufa
to us.  We will then call on the United Nations to clean up and
try to prevent any further pollution of our ocean and land from
these two atolls."
 <p>
The Polynesians requested an answer within 15 days, and if none
was received, "we will take further action to settle this
matter."<p>
 <p>
The breaching of the French exclusion zone is the latest direct
action taken by the 20-boat international peace flotilla
surrounding the French nuclear test sites. Members of the
flotilla vow to continue disrupting the French military's
attempts to detonate at least 6 more nuclear weapons on the
fragile coral atolls.  The second test is expected within the
week at Fangataufa atoll, and is speculated to reach the 150
kiloton threshold.

PARIS, September 28 1995 -- 
<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      
 
 
<P>GREENPEACE REAFFIRMS ITS POSITION ON FRENCH GOODS BOYCOTT  
 
 <p>




<P>The Chairman of Greenpeace-France,
Remi Parmentier, and the Executive Director of Greenpeace
International, Thilo Bode, have reaffirmed their opposition to
the boycott of French goods in connection zith the resumption of
French nuclear testing in the South Pacific decided by President
Chirac. This resumption has taken place against the will of the
majority of French citizens and international public opinion, as
well as against the nuclear weapons states' own commitment made
within the framework of the Nuclear
Proliferation Treaty.
 
<P>Since the announcement of the resumption of nuclear testing in
the month of June, Greenpeace has always refused to call for a
boycott of French goods. We reiterate clearly for the future our
decision not to use this protest method against nuclear testing.
 
<P>Greenpeace thanks the French companies which have joined and
continue to join Greenpeace's campaign and have expressed their
opposition to the resumption of nuclear testing. We are of course
committed to giving their names to the public only with their
prior and formal consent.
 
<P>We hope that this French nuclear test series, the last one, will
mark the kiss of death of an image of France which is doing a lot
of damage to French exporters. The numerous
messages received by Greenpeace from French exporters opposed to
nuclear testing is indicative of the emergence of the
profile of "exporters of a new kind".

PARIS, September 29 1995 -- 
<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      
 
 
<P>
POLITICAL SUCCESS FOR GREENPEACE AT FRENCH SUPREME COURT

<P>Paris--29 September 1995--Greenpeace today said the French
Supreme Court's recognition of the long term environmental
threats of underground nuclear testing was a "true political
success," despite the fact that the court rejected Greenpeace's
case.

<P>Greenpeace took French President Jacques Chirac to the Supreme
Court (Conseil d'Etat) to challenge his right to make a decision
to resume testing.  Despite ruling at today's public hearing that
the court was not competent to hear the case, the French
Government's Commissioner recognised that long term environmental
and health risks linked to underground nuclear testing did in
fact exist. 

<P>"We are right -- President Chirac can no longer pretend that
underground nuclear testing is safe," said Greenpeace France's
Chairman, Mr Remi Parmentier.  "Chirac did not take the
precautionary principle into account when he decided to resume
testing."

<P>The precautionary principle means that activities that may
seriously affect the environment cannot be justified by the
absence of scientific certainty. This principle was incorporated
into French law in February 1995, as well as within the
Maastricht Treaty.  The international community, including
France, also undertook to apply this principle during the Rio
Earth Summit in June 1992.  

<P>"We all have a duty to provide future generations with an
environment at least as sane and safe as the one we inherited,"
said Parmentier.  "In accordance with this principle, President
Chirac should put an end to his nuclear test programme." 

<P>Greenpeace noted that the Government's Commissioner, while
considering that the Supreme Court was not competent to rule on
the case, recognised that if it had been, Chirac's decision would
have been cancelled, given that Greenpeace was right to point out
that the French Prime Minister's formal approval had not been
issued. 


<P>"This demonstrates that we are correct in stating that the
President acted alone in making his decision," said Penelope
Komites, Executive Director of Greenpeace France.

<P>Tahiti  1st October 1995

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      
 
 

<P>GREENPEACE BOAT BOARDED BY FRENCH IN INTERNATONAL WATERS

<P>Greenpeace today condemned as an act of
piracy the French boarding of the environmental organisation's
vessel MANUTEA in international waters off Moruroa Atoll -- in
the face of an imminent nuclear test.

<P>At 0510 hrs local time Sunday, French commandos boarded the US-
flagged MANUTEA, three miles outside the 12-mile military
exclusion zone in international waters in the South Pacific,
cutting off communications. 

<P>Greenpeace campaigner on board the vessel, Audrey Cardwell,
managed to call the Greenpeace office in Tahiti and spoke for 20
seconds before the line was broken.  She said there were three
French inflatable boats alongside and commandos were boarding. 

<P>A journalist aboard the New Zealand government ship the TUI, also
in the vicinity, told Greenpeace that the French military had
found a canoe on Moruroa atoll at 0200 hrs and were citing that
as the reason to board the Manutea.  However, there is absolutely
no indication that this canoe came from the Manutea. It is not
known how many protestors were aboard. 

<P>The journalist said that the Manutea was three miles outside the
exclusion zone when boarded and was now on its way, under close
escort from French military vessels, into Moruroa. 

<P>"The next nuclear test is imminent and the French are desparate
to stop protestors going into the atolls.  They have used the
canoe as an excuse to seize the Manutea -- but this will not stop
the protests," said Lynette Thorstensen of Greenpeace in Tahiti.

<P>"This is yet another flagrant breach of international law. The
French have just committed what amounts to an act of piracy
against a United States vessel in international waters," she
said.

<P>The Manutea, a 35m schnooner with eight crew on board, three from
Greenpeace, has been in the peace flotilla outside the exclusion
zone for the past four weeks, protesting French president Jacques
Chirac's resumption of nuclear testing in the South Pacific. 
There are about six boats in the flotilla.

<P>In the past two weeks, protestors from the peace flotilla have
managed to get into the Fangataufa atoll lagoon and all have
reported seeing preparations on a drill rig at the atoll.  All
indications are that another nuclear test will be exploded in the
next few days, possibly from Fangataufa, where the largest tests
are detonated. 

<P>Four protestors were deported this weekend from Tahiti after a
high-speed inflatable chase around the Fangataufa lagoon.  Two
of them managed to get onto the drilling rig. 

<P>In the USA, Greenpeace has been in contact with the US State
Department asking them to protest the seizure and asking them to
clarify the illegal boarding. 


<P>"President Clinton must call on Jacques Chirac to stop his
testing programme immediately and to terminate all US cooperation
with France on nuclear weapons development," said Tom Clements
of Greenpeace USA.

<P> 2nd OCTOBER 1995

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      
 
 

<P>GREENPEACE INVADES FRENCH AMBASSADOR'S LONDON RESIDENCE  IN
PROTEST AGAINST  SECOND NUCLEAR TEST
 
<P>The second French nuclear test today at Fangataufa has been
condemned  by Greenpeace as a criminal act of environmental
destruction.   

<P>Greenpeace UK today launched a protest at the French Ambassador's
residence in Kensington. Activists invaded the Ambassador's
garden and climbed on to the  roof of his house in order to mark
their outrage  at France's actions.   

<P>Greenpeace Local Groups are also holding vigils in Southampton,
Cardiff, Norwich, Nottingham,  Birmingham, Manchester and
Edinburgh. 
 
<P>The Greenpeace vessel `Manutea' was seized by French commandos
several hours before the nuclear test, even though the ship was
in international waters three miles outside the Moruroa exclusion
zone.  Greenpeace believes that the seizure was an unlawful act
of piracy designed to silence peaceful protest.
 
<P>President Chirac's decision to detonate a second bomb comes after 
an unprecedented wave of international revulsion  at the  tests. 
 On  Friday  the  European  Union  Environment Commissioner 
again  reminded France to  refrain  from  any further  nuclear
tests until the Commission were  satisfied that  the  tests 
would cause no unnecessary  environmental damage.
 
<P>The  110 kilotonne explosion - almost 8 times more powerful than 
the  Hiroshima bomb - comes 4 weeks after a  test  on Moruroa
Atoll. The latest bomb will cause further damage to an  already
ravaged Pacific area, and may in future lead to further  releases 
of  radioactive contamination  into  the Pacific  environment. 

<P>The test is believed to be the  final certification for an
entirely new generation  of  submarine launched nuclear warheads,
potentially signalling the start of a new  nuclear arms race.  
This  latest  French  test undermines  further  efforts  to
secure  a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that would ban  all
nuclear tests for all time. It also breaks a moratorium  on
testing  in  place since 1992 and currently adhered  to  by
Britain, Russia and the USA.
 
<P>A  recent  MORI  poll  conducted on behalf   of  Greenpeace
indicated that 81% of the European Community polled  oppose the 
French  nuclear testing programme. 158 of the  world's nations 
have  so  far condemned the  tests,  but   the  UK government 
has  refused  to  criticise  President  Chirac, possibly  because
of the close collaboration between  their nuclear programmes . 

<P>"By  testing  again  Jacques Chirac has shown  an  arrogant
contempt for the Pacific  environment and the wishes of the
millions  of  people  across  the  world  opposed  to   his
actions", said Greenpeace Campaigner William Peden. "Chirac must 
realise  that his behaviour is intolerable  and  that this 
nuclear madness must stop. The seizure of the Manutea is  an 
outrageous act of piracy and we are at  the  French Ambassador's
house to tell him that enough is enough".

<P>BRUSSELS - 2nd OCTOBER 1995

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      
 


<P>GREENPEACE CALLS ON EUROPEAN STATES TO PUT FRANCE IN DOCK
                       OVER NUCLEAR TEST

<P>Greenpeace condemned this morning's
large nuclear test at Fangataufa Atoll and the seizure of the
Greenpeace vessel Manutea in international waters as cowardly
acts that defy the international community and attempt to prevent
further protest off Moruroa.

<P>Greenpeace  urged European countries to take France to court over
its 110 kiloton nuclear test (more than 10 times the size of
Hiroshima), exploded at 1.13 pm local time. 

<P>The test it went ahead in defiance of the European Commission's
call for France to provide full information under its EURATOM
Treaty obligations on the environmental dangers of the tests
before any further tests proceeded.  Greenpeace urged the
European Union to restore legal order in the Community and take
France to the European Court of Justice.
 
<P>"With this test, France breaches European law, and  goes against
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by building new bombs which
give France a massive escalation in its nuclear capability,"
Greenpeace's Penelope Komites said in Paris. 

<P>"President Chirac has not only insulted world opinion and again
broken an international moratorium against nuclear testing; he
is sabotaging global moves towards a nuclear free world."  

<P>A European Commission scientific team conducting a limited
mission under Euratom Treaty powers last week was denied access
to Fangataufa.  EU Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard has
said that the information so far received from France is
inadequate and insufficient.
 
<P>The test, was reportedly the 23rd and final 'certification' test
for a new warhead for the new French Triomphant class submarines.

<P>Greenpeace also called for the immediate release of all of its
boats, one of which, the US-flagged Manutea, was seized only
hours ago to facilitate the test, showing a cynical contempt for
international law. 

<P>Komites, along with Greenpeace in Tahiti and around the world,
called for renewed international protest against the test
programme, but reiterated Greenpeace's call for all protest to
be peaceful and non-violent. 
  
<BR><HR><BR>                         
<P>Note to Editors:


<P>This is the 14th underground test at Fangataufa and the 194th
French test.  Larger tests have taken place at Fangataufa since
1988 because of concerns about the ability of Moruroa atoll to
withstand large explosions.  No scientific mission has ever been
permitted to visit Fangataufa, and no information about the
atoll, which was seriously contaminated by atmospheric testing,

<P>BRUSSELS - 3rd OCTOBER 1995

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      
 


<P>  EU COMMISSION MUST ACT NOW ON FRENCH TESTS
                 OR FACE EUROPEAN COURT ACTION


      
<P>Greenpeace begins 24-hour Brussels vigil, asks Europeans to fax
in protests 

<P>BRUSSELS, 3 October:- Greenpeace today called on the European
Commission to quash reports of a 'secret deal' on nuclear tests
between France and the Commission's President Jacques Santer by
deciding to start immediate proceedings against France at its
Wednesday meeting in Brussels.
 
<P>Defying a Commission request to suspend further tests until a
Commission assessment of the health and safety measures of the
testing programme had been completed, France went ahead with a
second, 110 kiloton nuclear test at its South Pacific test site
on Monday.  

<P>Performing 'particularly dangerous experiments', such as the
testing of nuclear weapons, without obtaining the Commission's
prior opinion on additional health and safety measures, breaches
Article 34 of the EURATOM Treaty.
 
<P>"France has refused to comply with the Commission's request to
suspend its testing programme, making a mockery of its claims to
be a responsible member of the European Union," said Louise Gale
of Greenpeace's European Unit. "France's actions leave the
Commission no choice but to decide tomorrow to open the way for
legal proceedings against France at the European Court."
 
<P>The Commission has taken the first steps toward this with
Commissioner Bjerregaard's request that France give its views on
the application of Article 34 of EURATOM to the French tests. The
next step is for the Commission to finally decide at Wednesday's
meeting to apply Article 34 of EURATOM and to send France a
'reasoned opinion' outlining the breach of France's Treaty
obligations with a deadline for a response. 

<P>If France fails to comply with this, the Commission can take the
matter before the European Court of Justice.
 
<P>Greenpeace also called upon the European Parliament and European
Union states to take the Commission before the European Court of
Justice if the Commission fails to act on Wednesday.
 
<P>"It shouldn't come to that if the Commission fulfils its legal
role as 'guardian of the treaties', but the hesitancy of the
Commission so far and the reports of a secret deal with France
leaves no room for complacency," Gale said. "If the Commission
does nothing, the European Parliament or EU member states will
be forced to uphold the law to ensure that no further tests take
place."
 
<P>Greenpeace announced a 24-hour vigil outside the Commission
headquarters in Brussels in the lead-up to the decision. 
A mobile office will receive protest letters for delivery to the
Commission. "The majority of Europeans are opposed to these
tests.If people send us a fax, we'll make sure the Commission
receives their protest directly," Gale said.
 
<P>For further information contact:

Carroll, Greenpeace European Unit, +32.2.280.14.00; or (mobile)

      may be sent are ++32 2 280 1874 or ++32 2 230 8413
 
<P>NOTES 
* Article 141 of the EURATOM Treaty requires the European
Commission to issue a 'reasoned opinion' if it considers that a
Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under the
EURATOM Treaty. If the Member State does not comply with this
opinion within the time period laid down by the Commission, the
Commission may bring the matter before the European Court of
Justice.
 
<P>* Under Article 142 of the EURATOM Treaty, any Member State can
bring an infringement action against France before the European
Court of Justice. Under Article 148 of the EURATOM Treaty, Member
States and the European Parliament can take action against the
Commission for a failure to act.

<P><H4>SCIENTIFIC REPORT CONFIRMS FRENCH BREACH OF EURATOM TREATY:  
</H4>
<p>European Commission left with no choice but to start legal
proceedings against France: Greenpeace
 
<p>Brussels--9 October 1995--The report of the European Union's
scientific expedition to French Polynesia, leaked today by
Greenpeace,  confirms that France is acting in breach of the
health and safety provisions of the EURATOM Treaty. 

<p>The report states clearly that the French authorities denied
access to all the environmental monitoring facilities at Moruroa;
access to Fangataufa was denied altogether (indeed, the French
authorities would not even confirm that there were facilities at
Fangataufa).   

<p>"This report shows that the French Government has clearly
breached the Euratom Treaty, leaving the European Commission no
choice but to formally decide to initiate legal proceedings
against France at its Wednesday meeting in Strasbourg," said
Louise Gale of Greenpeace's European Unit in Brussels. 

<p>"The French are making it impossible for the Commission to fulfil
its responsibilities under the EURATOM Treaty," she said. 

<p>"The only option open to the Commission is for it to decide to
open infringement proceedings against France, including a
requirement for France to halt further tests. Failure by the
Commission to act against France's breaches of the Treaty will
leave it exposed to legal action from member states and the
European Parliament." 
 
<p>The experts were sent to the territory for two weeks in order to
check on whether radioactivity monitoring by France complies with
European law. Article 35 of the EURATOM Treaty requires Member
States to establish facilities to monitor environmental
radioactivity and to allow the European Commission to have access
to these facilities and verify their operation. 

<p>The team's report, obtained by Greenpeace and released today [1]
notes that verification of those facilities which were visited
at Moruroa was not allowed and access to the environmental
monitoring facilities at Fangataufa was totally denied. Access
was also denied to military facilities at Faa'a. Because of this
the team concluded that "...it is impossible to give an
unreserved view on the efficiency and adequacy of the overall
surveillance system in place."
 
<p>On Wednesday, the Commission will consider a report from
Commissioner Bjerregaard on the French testing issue and possible
infringement proceedings at its meeting in Strasbourg. 


<p>In addition to being denied the necessary access to verify
environmental monitoring issues, the Commission team were refused
information on the possible dangerous character of the nuclear
tests and possible additional safety measures taken which the
Commission has requested in relation to Article 34.[2] The team
reports that French authorities denied the Commission team
essential information on geological and hydrological aspects,
long-term prospects, exposures from atmospheric testing, follow-
up of possible health effects, restoration prospects for the
atolls.

<p>EUROPEAN COMMISSION
Directorate-General XI

<p>Luxembourg, 3.10.95


<p><H4>SUMMARY REPORT OF VERIFICATION VISIT TO FRENCH POLYNESIA UNDER
THE TERMS OF ARTICLE 35 OF THE EURATOM TREATY
</H4>
<p><B>18-29 September 1995</B>


<p><font size=+3>1.  Introduction</font>

<p>The verification visit was made as a result of concerns about the
resumption of French nuclear testing in French Polynesia.  It
took place at very short notice, from 18-29 September, in
immediate response to the letters of Mr de Charette to
President Santer and Mr Barnier to Commissioner Bjerregaard dated
13 September 1995, confirming that the French
authorities were ready to welcome the experts of the
Commission for a verification visit to French Polynesia.  Under
the terms of Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty the
purpose was to verify the operation and efficiency of the  
environmental monitoring facilities installed by the competent
authorities.

<p>The nuclear test sites are located at approximately 129
degrees W,  22 degrees S in the Pacific, thus lying towards the
eastern extremity of French Polynesia, of which the
capital, Papeete, is situated on the island of Tahiti, some 1200
km WNW; Pitcairn Island, the nearest territory of another Member
State (UK) lies some 800 km ESE.

<p>The programme of the visit is given in Annex 1 and the
composition of the verification team and of the French
representation during the course of the visit is given in Annex
2.

<p><font size=+3>2.  Nature and Scope of the Environmental Monitoring
Provisions
</font>

<p>Environmental surveillance in French Polynesia is carried out by
three separate organisations:

<li>the Office de Protection contre les Rayonnements Ionisants (OPRI)
has an institutional role in protecting workers and the
population against ionizing radiation;

<li>the tasks of the Institut de Protection et de Surete Nucleaire
(IPSN) are in the field of research and in providing models and
data in support of radiation protection policies; and

<li>the Direction des Centres d'Experimentations Nucleaires
(DIRCEN) conducts the military operations and collects
environmental radioactivity data both on the test sites and in
the environment at large.

<p>These organizations run laboratories and fixed monitoring
equipment and collect a range of samples of marine and
terrestrial foodstuffs, seawater and plankton.

<p>OPRI operates:

<li>a continuous external (gamma) radiation dose rate monitoring
station at Papeete as part of the Teleray network;

<li> a daily air-sampling station at Mahina; and

<li> fixed-location 6-monthly integrating gamma dosemeters at
Mahina, Faaa and Vaina.

<p>All of the above locations are on Tahiti where in addition milk
and seawater samples are collected regularly on behalf of OPRI
by the Laboratoire d'Etude et de Surveillance (LESE) located at
Mahina.  (Other environmental samples from
locations in French Polynesia are collected for the purposes of
specific monitoring campaigns.)  Additionally mobile daily
aerosol monitoring equipment and a 6-monthly integrating gamma
dosemeter are operated on the atoll of Rangiro which is some 300
km NNE of Tahiti and about equidistant from Tahiti and Mururoa.
 
<p>IPSN operates the LESE laboratory at Mahina.  In addition to
operating a high-volume air sampler at Mahina (one sample over
a 10-day period but overnight operation only) LESE carries out
a regular sampling programme in the framework of the
Institute's worldwide network of foodstuffs sampling. 
Further, a roughly equivalent number of biological samples along
with samples of sea-water are provided to IPSN by DIRCEN
independent of the latter's monitoring programme (see below). 
Given the large distances and low population densities
involved, a few locations are taken to be representative of the
total area, typically (for 1993-94):

<li> Tahiti for the Society Islands;

<li>Tureia (at 120 km the closest inhabited atoll to Mururoa) in
the Tuamoto Islands;

<li> Mangareva in the Gambier Islands;

<li> Tubuai on the Austral Ridge and

<li> Nuku Hiva and Hiva Oa in the Marquesas.

<p>DIRCEN operates high volume air sampling, rain-water
collection and gamma dose-rate monitoring stations at Faaa and
at Mururoa.  Biological samples in various archipelagos,
pelagic fish, and seawater from within the 12 mile limit of
territorial waters and seawater and sediments from the Mururoa
lagoon are taken and analysed in the Mururoa laboratory.  No
positive information was received on any monitoring programme for
Fangataufa and no comprehensive overview of the DIRCEN sampling
programme was provided.

<p><font size=+3>3.  Installations Visited</font>


<p>The Commission's verification team visited most of the
installations installed by OPRI and IPSN.  Access to the
facilities of DIRCEN at Mururoa and Fangataufa was not, or only
partially, granted.

<p>For OPRI, all of the above-mentioned stations except Faaa, were
visited.  The equipment is similar to that installed in OPRI
facilities in France.  RESERVATIONS were entered with respect to
the fact that not all rainwater is sampled at
Mahina and as regards facilities at Rangiroa and at Vaina in that
they had only been installed immediately prior to the
verification visit.  An ANOMALY was uncovered regarding the water
sample for the first 3-month period in 1995 which had not been
sent to OPRI and could not be traced.

<p>APPRECIATION, the environmental surveillance is satisfactory from
the health point of view.

<p>For IPSN, the verification of the local sampling agent's
activities at Rangiroa showed these to be satisfactory.  A
RESERVATION was entered as regards the high volume air
samplers at Mahina which were used for overnight operation only;
continuous operation would be preferred.  The LESE
 
laboratory at Mahina was found to be appropriate to the
detection limits required for the estimation of population
exposure.  The archiving system is adequate but could be made
more accessible.  Sampling collection procedures are
satisfactory.

<p>APPRECIATION, satisfactory for the purpose of estimation of
population exposure.

<p>For DIRCEN, high volume air sampling for atmospheric aerosols,
rainwater collection equipment and gamma doserate measurement
equipment are installed at Mururoa as is an apparently well-
equipped laboratory but verification was not permitted.  Full
access was given to the vessel MARARA owned by DIRCEN but with
a civilian crew; it is used for sampling and conditioning, where
appropriate, sea-water at various depths, plankton, pelagic and
lagoon fish and crustacea and for collecting
terrestrial samples.  The vessel is currently in dock at
Tahiti for programmed maintenance and engine replacement but this
did not affect the scheduled cruise programme for 1995.  The
sampling equipment was shown and described but more
detailed technical questions could not be answered.

<p><B>APPRECIATION, not possible due to limited access.</B>

<p>OVERALL APPRECIATION

<p>The results of verification at OPRI and IPSN facilities are
satisfactory.  Access was given to only part of the DIRCEN
facilities and where access was provided verification was denied. 
It is the Commission's view that DIRCEN facilities are an
integral part of the environmental monitoring in French
Polynesia, in particular, since they permit a more accurate
evaluation of the source term of environmental contamination.

<p><font size=+3>4.  Access limited or refused</font>


<p>Access was limited or refused in respect of:

<li>the OPRI and DIRCEN stations at Faaa, which were stated to be
on a sensitive military establishment;

<li> the DIRCEN terrestrial and marine environmental monitoring
provisions at Mururoa; access was denied for verification
purposes since, according to the French authorities, they were
not within the scope of the visit;

<li> as regards Fangataufa, access was totally denied for reasons
of defence security.  The French authorities were not prepared
to confirm or deny the presence of installations relevant to the
monitoring programme.

<p>Additionally, no fresh information on these installations was
offered in the course of discussion.

<p><font size=+3>5.  Other issues addressed at Mururoa</font>


<p>Apart from environmental monitoring issues in the framework of 

the verification visit, the Commission team also asked a
number of questions in particular with regard to the possible
dangerous character of the nuclear tests and possible
additional safety measures taken.  Such questions pertained to
geological and hydrological aspects, long-term prospects,
exposures from atmospheric testing, follow-up of possible health
effects, restoration prospects, etc.

<p>Information requested by the team on these matters was
generally denied and information provided did not go beyond that
previously available from the documentation received.

<p><font size=+3>6.  Conclusions</font>


<p>Verification activities outwith military establishments were
generally satisfactory and gave rise to no major observations
with regard to the reliable operation and the efficiency of the
facilities and the adequacy of the monitoring programmes.

<p>However, verification of those facilities which were visited at
Mururoa was not allowed and access to the environmental
monitoring facilities at Fangataufa was totally denied. 
Access was also denied to the facilities at Faa.  Because of this
it is impossible to give an unreserved view on the
efficiency and adequacy of the overall surveillance system in
place.

<p>Information requested, at Mururoa, by the team on a range of
matters was generally denied and did not go beyond that
previously available from the documentation received.

<H4>EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  LAPDOG OF THE FRENCH?</H4><p>
 <p>
Strasbourg--11 October 1995-- Greenpeace today called the European Commission the lapdog of the French Government after its failure to enforce one of Europe's founding treaties and to halt France's nuclear testing programme in the South Pacific.<p>
 <p>
The Commission's credibility is now at stake since it has further delayed its final decision on the French violations of the EURATOM treaty, said Greenpeace's Louise Gale.  In a letter to the French Government, the Commission has again asked for more information before its special meeting on 23 October (Monday) to decide whether to take France to the European Court of Justice.   <p>
After the decision was announced in Strasbourg this evening, Greenpeace let off a loud siren at the European Parliament buildings, in protest at the delay. <p>
 <p>
Greenpeace called on the European Parliament and the member states to take the Commission to court for failure to act.  The EU member states should take France to Court for breaching the Treaty. <p>
 <p>
The role and the very existence of the European Commission must now be seriously questioned in the light of its failure to censure France's nuclear testing programme, despite blatant breaches of European law by France. <p>
 <p>
"The Commission's own analysis clearly identifies major<p>
violations of the treaty.  The Commission's failure to take Chirac to task is a purely political decision," said Louise Gale.  "The European Commission is supposed to be the 'Guardian of the Treaties', but all we have got now is a lapdog of the French Government."<p>
 <p>
Gale added that it was time France stopped keeping the environmental impacts of its testing programme a secret. France should provide information to the Commission instead of denying its scientists access to its test sites at Fangataufa and Moruroa as it did this month.  "If testing is so safe, why is France trying to hide the scientific findings on environmental impacts?" she said. <p>

<H4>FRENCH COMMANDOS CHARGE YACHTS IN PEACEFUL SAIL-
BY IN PAPEETE HARBOUR</H4>

AUCKLAND, 12 October 1995 -- Greenpeace today condemned a heavy-handed response by French commandos in zodiacs and a military tug who arrested Peace Flotilla yachts as they sailed around Papeete harbour carrying anti-nuclear banners.<p>

The four skippers were issued with an infraction notice, escorted by riot police from the dockside to the harbour master's office and threatened with up to ten days jail for "unauthorised movement" in the harbour.  French authorities have banned the yachts from leaving Papeete until the case goes to court, possibly next week.<p>

or <a href="rw197.jpg">22KB JPG.</a> Greenpeace<p> 

The four yachts - Joie, Sudden Laughter, Te Kaitoa and Carumba - have been stationed at Moruroa until returning to Papeete over the past fortnight. They began their protest at 8am local time, joined by local Tahitian activists and a group of Aboriginal and Torres Strait islanders. They flew banners saying "Stop Bombing Moruroa" and "Vive le Pacifique".<p>

"Charging the yachts for sailing around Papeete harbour shows the ridiculous lengths France will go to stop people exercising their democratic right to peacefully protest," Greenpeace spokesperson Janet Dalziell said. "This was a complete over-reaction to what is the maritime equivalent of a parking ticket."<p>

<img align=top src="rw199t.gif" alt="photo1.">62KB GIF</a>
or <a href="rw199.jpg">20KB JPG.</a> Greenpeace<p> 

The skipper of Sudden Laughter, Nigel Joy, said the flotilla boats were determined to carry their protest to the heart of Papeete, and had sailed in formation around the harbour and past a French warship, La Nivose. La Nivose was stationed at Moruroa and was one of the ships harassing the peace fleet.  She carried out the boarding of the Greenpeace vessel Manutea on October 3 and the Anna.<p>

Dennis Johnson, skipper of Joie, said the four yachts were representing millions of people around the world opposed to nuclear testing. He said 32 vessels from 12 countries had been stationed at Moruroa over the last month.<p>

"While we cannot stay out at Moruroa forever, we are determined to continue our protest here in Papeete to show our solidarity with the people of French Polynesia, who live with the reality of nuclear testing every day," he said. <p>

Nigel Joy said the yachts, some of which had been at sea for seven weeks, would head home before the start of the hurricane season, but were determined to continue their campaign against nuclear testing when they returned to New Zealand.  The delay in the peace yachts' departure from Tahiti will involve considerable extra expense and hardship, as they were due to leave for Rarotonga this week, he said.<p>

Peace Flotilla Protests in Papeete<p>

Papeete:  The Moruroa Peace Flotilla took their anti-nuclear protest to
the heart of Papeete this morning, sailing in formation around the
harbour and past a French warship, La Nivose, berthed at the military
docks.<p>

Flying banners that said  Stop Bombing Moruroa ,  Le Jour de Honte est
Arrivi  (The Day of Shame has Arrived) and  Vive le Pacifique , the four
yachts: Joie, Sudden Laughter, Te Kaitoa and Carumba, began their
protest at 8am local time.  A fifth flotilla yacht, Guinevere, is also
in Papeete but was unable to participate because she is undergoing
repairs.  Also on board the protesting yachts were local Tahitian people
and a group of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.

Two inflatable boats carrying about six military personnel each, a
police launch and a harbour patrol vessel followed the protest closely.
The harbour patrol approached each yacht as they were finishing the
protest to issue them with a  ticket  for movements in the harbour
without permission (this carries a small fine).<p>

      We are determined to continue our protests against the crime
of nuclear testing in the Pacific, and while we cannot physically stay
out at Moruroa for ever, we are here to show solidarity with anti-
nuclear efforts in Papeete,  said the
skipper of Sudden Laughter, Nigel Joy.   We will also    [text missing]

<P><br><br><br><br><br><H4>FRANCE BOARDS GREENPEACE PROTEST VESSEL IN ITALIAN TERRITORIAL
WATERS</H4>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE



<p>BRINDISI, ITALY 25 October, 1995 -- (GP) Commandos from a French
destroyer armed with axes boarded the Greenpeace vessel Altair
today in the Italian port of Brindisi and tear gassed her crew
during a protest against the French military.

<p>The Altair and four inflatable vessels entered the port of
Brindisi to try to peacefully prevent the French destroyer
Dupleix, armed with at least four Exocet Missiles, from entering
the port.  Greenpeace activists painted the side of the French
ship with "STOP NUCLEAR TESTS!" while other activists chained
themselves to the mooring ropes of the Dupleix.

<p>Commandos aboard the Dupleix turned fire hoses on the Greenpeace
inflatable boats and attempted to flood the Altair's engine room
before boarding the Greenpeace vessel.  Commandos lodged tear gas
into the bridge forcing the captain and crew to flee before
starting the ship, throwing it into reverse and abandoning it,
allowing the Altair to go full speed into the dock several times.
 
<p>French commandos allowed the Altair to run out of control,
risking collision with other Italian police and Coast Guard
vessels.  One Greenpeace crew member was injured.

<p>The Altair sustained a hole above its water line during the
series of collisions.  The damage is now being assessed.

<p>"This is a grave breach of international law and is an attack not
only on Greenpeace and Greenpeace crew members but on the Italian
and Dutch states as well," said Greenpeace's Giuseppe Onutrio. 
"Clearly France is prepared to stop at nothing to test its
nuclear bombs. 

<p>"France came to a friendly harbour in 1985, sank the Rainbow
Warrior and killed Fernando Pereira. They stormed onboard the
Rainbow Warrior in July, smashing windows and teargassing the
crew. They came into international waters and seized the M/V
Greenpeace and Manutea. They have beaten up and illegally
detained crew members and seized our ships. But now France has
come to Italy, a friendly port and attacked a Greenpeace ship in
harbour, again smashing windows and teargassing the crew
members."

<p>The Greenpeace campaign to end all nuclear testing worldwide will
continue full-force and will not be stifled by the French

   FLIES IN THE FACE OF CONTINUED INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION   </H4> 

                  
                            
       <p> Greenpeace Vessel Caramba Remains Off Test Site
 
<p>PAPEETE, 28 OCTOBER, 1995 -- (GP) Greenpeace condemned France's
third nuclear test, an estimated 60 kiloton explosion off Moruroa
Atoll at noon local time, saying that the latest test ignores
massive and ever-growing international opposition. 
 
<p>Greenpeace's vessel Caramba and one other peace flotilla vessel
remain just outside the test area bearing witness to the ongoing
French testing program.
 
<p>"Despite hundreds of nations coming together to celebrate 50
years of the United Nations, the absence of political will to
collectively take action to stop one rogue nation from further
nuclear tests has never been more obvious," said Greenpeace's
John Mate on board the Caramba.  "France should urgently heed the
wishes of a majority of nations and stop all nuclear tests
immediately."
 
<p>French President Chirac will visit the United Kingdom on Sunday
to discuss ongoing nuclear cooperation between the two countries
as well as the United States.  John Major will also travel to New
Zealand in mid-November to meet with Commonwealth states where
he is expected to face a storm of criticism for his complicity
in the French testing program.
 
<p>This month, the 113 countries that make up the non-aligned
movement recently called for an immediate cessation of all
nuclear testing and for a moratorium to be put in place until a
Comprehensive Test Ban (CTBT) can be agreed.  The European
Parliament this week passed a resolution condemning any further
nuclear testing by either France or China stating the risk future
tests could pose to the Non-Proliferation Treaty as well as the
global environment. 
 
<p>"Although there are now only two vessels left at the site of this
environmental crime, Greenpeace is here representing the millions
of individuals and the 159 countries opposed to France's nuclear
testing," Mate said.  "We call on those peoples and nations not
to give up hope -- collective will, political and diplomatic
pressure can bring an end to this nuclear threat."

<P><br><br><br><br><br><H4>SPECIAL MAIL DELIVERED AT CHIRAC'S OFFICE: 7 MILLION SIGNATURES
AGAINST NUCLEAR TESTS </H4> 

                  





 
<p>Paris, 28 October 1995--In the wake of the third French nuclear
test in the South Pacific, Greenpeace activists today finally
managed to deliver its 7 million signatures against nuclear
testing to Jacques Chirac this morning. 

<p>The activists arrived at the Louvre Post Office this morning,
with the petitions, put up for special delivery to President
Chirac's office.  

<p>The signatures were packed in about a million envelopes, weighing
about 2.5 tonnes. The operation was free of charge for Greenpeace
because it is a French constitutional right to send mail to the
president for free.  As the police looked on, the 1000 packages
were handed over to the post office.  There were no arrests
because the Greenpeace protest relied on the French constitution.

<p>Greenpeace France has received the signatures from all over the
world. From Japan to Colombia, citizens of 30 countries have made
their opposition to nuclear tests clear. "Is President Chirac
going to be deaf to millions of protests again", askes Penelope
Komites, director of Greenpeace France. "He has just let off
another environmental nightmare in the South Pacific -- again to
international protest.  These 7 million people have a right to
be heard." 

<p>Greenpeace awaits the confirmation that the petitions have
reached Chirac -- under the same constitutional obligation, the
French Postal Service is obliged to certify to the sender that
their letter has been received by the President. 

<p>This was the third attempt by Greenpeace to deliver the 7 million
petitions to the Elysee Palace.  The first, with a "European
Peace Flotilla", was outlawed by police.  The police stopped 29
boats in the Seine who were intending to deliver the petitions. 
The second attempt was on the same day when police ruled that a
human chain to carry the petitions to the Elysee Palace was a
"public disturbance".

STOP UNTIL YOU STOP TESTING!   </H4> 





 
<p>Chequers, UK--29 October 1995--Several hundred Greenpeace
protestors descended upon Chequers today, overrunning the grounds
and using whistles and foghorns to disrupt the arrival of French
President Jacques Chirac.
<p><a href="rw205.gif"><image align=left src="rw205t.gif">93kb Gif</a> and <a href="rw205.jpg">38 kb Jpeg</a>.  
<p>Waves of protestors waving 9ft French flags painted with "NON"
and "DeTESTable" swarmed over fields to approach the driveway to
Chequers. Dozens of police, some of them on horseback, were
clearly outnumbered and unable to prevent the noisy 'invasion'.
At least six demonstrators got into the grounds, along with a
number of sheep which also added to the chaos. There were 13
arrests altogether. 
<p><a href="rw206.gif"><image align=left src="rw206t.gif"> 76 kb Gif</a> and <a href="rw206.jpg">30 kb Jpeg</a>. 
<p>Chirac was in Britain today to discuss Anglo-French nuclear
collaboration with Prime Minister John Major. Chirac was forced
to travel by helicopter to see John Major, instead of by car as
previously planned. He was delayed by 20 minutes.  
<p><a href="rw207.gif"><image align=left src="rw207t.gif">92 kb Gif</a> and <a href="rw207.jpg">32 kb Jpeg</a>.  
<p>The meeting takes place just two days after the third in the
current series of nuclear tests - a 60 kiloton bomb, four times
the size of Hiroshima - was detonated at Moruroa Atoll.
<p><a href="rw208.gif"><image align=left src="rw208t.gif">120 kb Gif</a> and <a href="rw208.jpg">46 kb Jpeg</a>.  
<p>"John Major's welcoming to Britain of Jacques Chirac just days
after the third nuclear test is a slap in the face to the 85% of
British people who want French nuclear testing to stop,"
Greenpeace campaigner Janet Convery said.
 
<p>"John Major has isolated himself as a world leader openly
supporting President Chirac's nuclear testing programme. These
two nuclear collaborators stand accused of openly defying world
opinion," she said.
 
<p>Since announcing a series of eight nuclear tests in June this
year, Jacques Chirac has been the target of world-wide protest
and condemnation from almost 160 countries.

<p>John Major can now expect to share Chirac's position as a world
pariah.

<p>John Major is expected to be lambasted by angry Commonwealth
countries for his support of President Chirac when he attends the
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in New Zealand next
month.
 
<p>Seven Greenpeace people were arrested at Chequers;  and six other
protestors from either CND or the Green Party, who also protested
Chirac's talks with Major.  The sheep were free to go, although
banned from the grounds in future.

<P><br><br><br><br><br><H4>ROOFTOPS RING TO SOUND OF ANTI-NUCLEAR PROTEST </H4> 

                 



<p>WELLINGTON, 30 October 1995 -- Greenpeace today took opposition
to French testing to the rooftops. Seven protesters climbed onto
the roof of the French Ambassador's residence in Wellington,
calling for an end to French testing and unfurling French flags
painted with NON, radiation symbols and deTESTable.

<p>Responding to the recent third French test the team of climbers
set off a warning siren and blew whistles as the Ambassador
prepared to leave for Parliament Buildings where he is to receive
another diplomatic dressing down from the New Zealand government.

<p>"We want to make sure France not only gets the anti-nuclear
message from the Beehive today, but also from the rooftops of
Wellington," said Greenpeace's Stephanie Mills from outside the
Ambassador's residence. "As long as France explodes nuclear bombs
at Moruroa, protests will follow around the world."

<p>Greenpeace said Prime Minister Bolger should seize the
opportunity presented by the CHOGM meeting in Auckland next week
to lead the Commonwealth in the strongest possible condemnation
of French testing and France and Britain's abysmal failure to
disarm. Britain still remains the main barrier to a strong CHOGM
communique which condemns French testing and France's failure to
disarm.

<p>"If France is serious about nuclear disarmament then it should
stop testing now and sign the Treaty of Rarotonga immediately,
not wait until after the current series of tests ends next year,"
said Mills. "This third test also risks giving the go ahead to
another Chinese nuclear test, and causing yet more damage to the
Pacific environment."

<p>UPDATE: Ambassador Le Blanc was forced to leave his residence
about an hour early because of the very noisy protest. The
climbers managed to occupy the roof for more than an hour until
they were (peacefully) removed by the police. They have been
arrested for breach of the peace and served with trespass notices
but they are unlikely to be charged.</body></html>

<H4>GREENPEACE WELCOMES SIGNING OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NUCLEAR
WEAPONS FREE ZONE TREATY - CALLS ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS
STATES TO RATIFY PROTOCOLS IMMEDIATELY</H4>
 

<P>Greenpeace today welcomed the signing of the Southeast
Asian Nuclear Free Zone (SEANWFZ) Treaty as further
evidence that nuclear weapons are unacceptable to the
majority of the world's nations.
 
<P>Greenpeace congratulated the leaders of the Association
of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Malaysia, Indonesia,
Philippines, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand who
signed the Treaty, along with Burma, Cambodia and Laos.
all ten countries have now pledged not to manufacture,
possess, test or use nuclear weapons.
 
<P>The environment group said the decision by the Southeast
Asian nations was a major step forward, and called on the
five Nuclear Weapons States to demonstrate their
commitment to disarmament by signing the appropriate
protocols of the Treaty. With Latin America and the
Carribean, the South Pacific, and Antarctica all covered
by Nuclear Weapons Free Zones, the new SEANWFZ and the
anticipated African NWFZ shows the growing opposition to
nuclear weapons worldwide.
 
<P>"The Nuclear Weapons States, and countries in which their
weapons are based, are becoming isolated outposts in a
world that wants genuine and rapid nuclear disarmament,"
said Greenpeace nuclear campaigner Ben Pearson.
 
<P>"Clearly, an increasing number of the world's nations see
nuclear weapons not as something that will defend them,
but as something they need to be defended against.
 
<P>"They are tired of the `balance of terror' and the false
doctrine of deterrence, and instead want meaningful
progress towards a nuclear weapons free world".
 
<P>Greenpeace called on the five Nuclear Weapons States -
the UK, France, China, Russia and the US - to respect the
wishes of the people of South East Asia and immediate
ratify the protocols of the SEANWFZ Treaty. A refusal by
the Nuclear Weapons States to ratify the Treaty would
undermine it, and cast doubt on the commitment of the
Weapons States to disarmament.
 
<P>"Under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the NWS are
obliged to work towards nuclear disarmament. Yet in the
25 years since the Treaty came into force they have made
little." said Pearson "Continued nuclear testing by China
and France, and the announcement by the United States
that it will conduct tests for nuclear weapons in 1996,
move us further away from that goal. A failure by the
Nuclear Weapons States to ratify this NWFZ Treaty will
once again underline the unwillingness of the Weapons
States to support real moves towards disarmament".

<H4> GREENPEACE CALLS FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE, IMMEDIATE BAN ON TESTS
AS FRENCH GOVERNMENT CONFIRMS CONTAMINATION FROM WEAPONS TESTS                                       
</H4>


<P>PARIS, January 23, 1996
<P>The French government confirmed 
today that it knew about, but did not release, information 
concerning radioctive contamination from its nuclear testing 
program in the South Pacific in 1995.  Greenpeace has called on 
the French government to fully disclose the contamination data, 
immdiately stop any further nuclear tests and to forge ahead 
with current talks in Geneva to ban all nuclear weapons tests.
 
<P>According to Alain Barthoux, the director of the French nuclear 
agency CEA, French officials monitored the presence of 
radioactive iodine 131 after one of the nuclear weapons tests in 
1995.  The radioactive contamination found around Moruroa atoll 
is clear evidence that radioactivity from France's controversial 
nuclear tests has escaped into the environment.  
 
<P>The stunning revelation was made in the course of "closed door"
talks in Washington last November regarding the Comprehensive 
Test Ban treaty currently being negotiated in Geneva.  The 
informaton was apparently leaked to the press by officials in 
the meeting.  In turn, the CEA's director was forced to confirm 
the now "public" statement.
 
<P>"The French government has lied to the public and concerned 
governments around the planet," said Greenpeace's Damon Moglen. 
 "Rather than spending time and energy in trying to erase the 
facts, President Chirac should now commit to a nuclear testing 
moratorium while the Comprehensive Test Ban is being 
negotiated."
 
<P>Although France has promised to honor an international test ban 
it stills plans on continuing to conduct at least one more 
nuclear test in the next few days or weeks.

<H4>GREENPEACE RESPONDS TO FRENCH OFFER TO RETURN PROTEST SHIPS                            
</H4>
       
       
       
       <P>PARIS,  2  March 1996
<P>Greenpeace today  announced  the
       receipt  of  a  letter  from French Admiral  Philippe  Euverte
       detailing  arrangements proposed by France for the release  of
       Greenpeace's  2  ships,  3 yachts and  a  helicopter  arrested
       during  protests  at France's nuclear testing  programme  last
       year.  Greenpeace  has  asked a  French  court  to  appoint  a
       surveyor  to  assess the seaworthiness and  condition  of  its
       ships.
       
  <P>     French   commandos  seized  the  Rainbow  Warrior  in   French
       Polynesian   territorial  waters and  the  M/V  Greenpeace  in
       international waters on September 1, smashing  navigation  and
       communications equipment and holding crews for six days.
       
<P>       The  French public prosecutor said in a statement on  March  1
       that there were no grounds for France to continue holding  the
       ships.
       
  <P>     "Greenpeace welcomes this indication that France will at  last
       return our boats but we will believe it when we see it,"  said
       Greenpeace's legal advisor Duncan Currie. "Greenpeace's  ships
       should never have been seized in the first place and they have
       now  been held for six months despite no charges being brought
       against any Greenpeace activist in all that time."
       
 <P>      Greenpeace  has protested the ship seizures as  illegal  under
       international  law and Greenpeace's lawyers  argued  before  a
       Papeete court in November that France had no right to keep the
       vessels under French law.
       
   <P>    "We  are  anxious  for the urgent return of  our  vessels  and
       equipment  so  we  can continue our environmental  campaigning
       around the world," Currie said. "However the French Government
       cannot  undo  the  damage it has done to the Pacific,  to  the
       rights  of  the islanders, or the pursuit of peace, simply  by
       releasing Greenpeace's boats."
       
   <P>    Greenpeace  is concerned about the condition and seaworthiness
       of  its  vessels  and their ability to travel long  distances.
       The  organization said its first concern is for the safety  of
       its crews and the damage to the boats.
       
  <P>     France's  announcement came just three days after a  judge  in
       the  Los  Angeles  Federal District  Court  refused  a  French
       request to dismiss a claim by Greenpeace for return of the  US
       flagged  Manutea  and kidnapping, assault and battery  against
       Greenpeace  personnel.  Greenpeace will pursue  its  case  for
       compensation  for  the illegal seizure and  detention  of  its
       vessels in French and U.S. courts until an agreement has  been
       reached on outstanding issues.
       
    <P>   According  to  a  letter  Greenpeace  received  from   Admiral
       Euverte,  who was in charge of the French military  operations
       last year, Greenpeace's vessels -- the SV Rainbow Warrior,  MV
       Greenpeace, yachts La Ribaude, Vega and Manutea, along with  a
       helicopter  and  dozens of inflatables  --  will  be  released
       between March 11 and March 18.  Local observers on Hao,  where
       the  ships  are being held by the French, say the  ships  have
       been   painted  recently,  presumably  to  cover  any   damage
       sustained during the boarding and detention.
       
  <P>     Greenpeace said the MV Greenpeace and SV Rainbow Warrior would
       be  readied for urgently required campaigning work as soon  as
       possible.
       
  <P>     Greenpeace  continues to campaign for an end  to  all  nuclear
       testing  and  is  currently working to ensure a  Comprehensive
       Test  Ban Treaty (CTBT) is signed in 1996 now being negotiated
       in Geneva.

<br>
<br><H4> GREENPEACE CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL PROTEST 
              AS CHINESE SET OFF NEW NUCLEAR TEST</H4></head>
<body>
<P>



<P>HONG KONG, 17 August 1995 - (GP) Greenpeace called for global
protest against China today as news broke that the Chinese have
set off another nuclear test just two days after Greenpeace
activists were detained for holding up an anti-nuclear testing
banner in Tiananmen Square, Beijing. 
 
<P>A report out of China's Xinhau news agency said that a 20-
kilotonne explosion was detonated at China's Lop Nor test site
today, the second test since the signing of the Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) in May.   

<P>"Greenpeace is calling for international condemnation and protest
against China's nuclear testing program," said Damon Moglen from
Hong Kong.  "Our protest two days ago in Beijing was an effort
to forestall what we view as an international crisis over nuclear
testing. Today that crisis is closer to being upon us."
 
<P>Greenpeace said it believes China's test today, along with recent
non-nuclear weapons tests over the past few weeks, gives
provocation to other countries in the region to pursue both
nuclear and military capability and that this test could
seriously threaten, if not destroy, any hope of a Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) currently under negotiation.
 
<P>"What China has provoked today with this nuclear weapons test is
not only regional instability but international insecurity,"
Moglen said.  "Recent statements by China that it supports a CTBT
pale in light of its action today.  China has, in fact, added
fuel to the fire of France's decision to resume testing and put
pressure on all nuclear weapons states to test or fall behind
these two countries in their game of nuclear one-upmanship."  

<P>China and other nuclear nations pledged to the international
community at recent NPT talks to 'exercise utmost restraint' on
nuclear testing and to pursue a CTBT as speedily as possible.  

<P>"The international community and a vocal public must send a
strong message to both China and France that they are violating
their Treaty commitments and that they will be held accountable
for putting their own selfish and short-sighted purposes before
the achieving of a global ban on testing," said Moglen.
 
<P>China has conducted 23 tests in the atmosphere and now at least
20 underground, with three other seismic events suspected of
being nuclear tests.  The latest test brings the official number
to 43 tests. China has said it plans three or four more tests
this year.
                            -more- 
<P>China's current testing programme is thought to involve nuclear
warheads for two new missile systems, one for deployment in the
late 1990s, the other around 2010.  France has also admitted that
it's testing program to begin in September in the South Pacific
would allow it to test a new weapons system.
 
<P>Greenpeace protester Anne Dingwall, who was recently detained by
Chinese authorities for holding up an anti-nuclear testing banner
in Tiananment Square with four others, and Greenpeace anti-
nuclear campaigner Damon Moglen held a press conference in Hong
Kong today.  All of the Greenpeace protesters have been deported
from China and, but for Dingwall and Moglen, are returning to
their countries. 
 
<P>Greenpeace is campaigning against nuclear testing by France and
China, the two remaining nuclear weapon states still testing, and
is urging the international community to speedily adopt a CTBT
this year which would ban all tests in all environments for all
time.

<head><H4>GREENPEACE PROTEST CHINESE NUCLEAR TEST IN FRONT OF ISTANBUL
MISSION</H4></head><body>
 
<P>Istanbul, Turkey, August 19, 1995 - Some 30 Greenpeace and
Turkish Anti-Nuclear Plattform activists today protested
China's latest nuclear test in front of the country's
diplomatic mission in Istanbul. They held a banner in
English and Turkish calling for an end to all nuclear tests. Some
activists chained themselves to the building while
others sprayed nuclear signs on the street.
 
<P>Among the activists are members of the Greenpeace ship
"Altair", which arrived in Turkey last Wednesday to rally support
against Chinese and French nuclear testing. The ship  
is on an anti-nuclear tour in the Mediterranean Sea.
 
 
<P>China set off another nuclear test at the Lop Nor test site last
Wednesday, two days after Greenpeace activists were
detained for holding up an anti-nuclear testing banner in
Tiananmen Square, Beijing. It was China's second nuclear
test since the signing of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) last
May.
 
<P>"Greenpeace calls for international condemnation and protest
against China's nuclear testing program. Nuclear testing
threatens to halt the growing momentum towards a global test
ban," said Berto Hullu of the Greenpeace Mediterranean
Office in Istanbul. "What China is provoking with its
nuclear weapons test is not only regional instability but
international insecurity. China has added fuel to the fire of
France's decision to resume testing."
 
<P>France, China and other nuclear nations pledged to the
international community at NPT talks last May to "exercise utmost
restraint" on nuclear testing and to pursue a global test ban as
speedily as possible. Shortly afterwards, France said it will
resume nuclear testing in the Southern Pacific next September.
 
<P>China has conducted 23 atmospheric tests and at least 19
underground, with three other seismic events suspected of being
nuclear tests. The latest brings the figure 20
underground which makes a total of 43 nuclear tests. China has
said it plans three or four more test this year.
 
<P>China has used its nuclear tests since 1964 to develop the
world's fourth largest nuclear weapons arsenal. It includes
approximately 450 nuclear weapons, and an estimated 150
tactical (artillery shells and atomic demolition munitions).
Together they have a cumulative yield of 250 megatons or
around 16,000 Hiroshima bombs. China's current testing
programme involves warheads for two new missile systems.
 
<P>The Chinese test site at Lop Nor site, approximately 265
kilometres south-east of Urumqi in the Xinjian region (due west
of Beijing, due north of Kathmandu), is home of the
Uighur people. China has never allowed any form of
independent or outside assessment of the environmental or health
impacts of its nuclear testing programme. The Uighur are of
Turkish origin.
 
<P>The total amount of plutonium-239 released at Lop Nor is
estimated at 3,300 curies, about 48 kilograms in weight. One
millionth of a gram of plutonium-239, if inhaled, can cause
cancer. A further two million curies of caesium-137 and 1.3
million curies of strontium-90 have also been released into the
atmosphere.
 

<P>The Greenpeace ship "Altair" began its tour against nuclear
testing in Barcelona, Spain, on August 4, 1995. The tour
will
continue until mid-November, visiting Israel, Cyprus,
Lebanon, Greece, Italy, Tunisia, France and Malta.

          <p><H4> Calls On All Nuclear Nations to Halt Testing</H4>

<P>BEIJING, 15 August 1995 -- (GP) In the organization's first protest
in mainland China, Greenpeace activists, at approximately 8:35 local
time today, displayed a banner in Tiananmen Square calling on the
Chinese government not to carry out imminent nuclear weapons tests.

 or <a href="aug15c.jpg">46KB JPG.</a> Greenpeace activists in Tiananmen SquareGreenpeace.


<P>After displaying the 5-meter banner reading "STOP ALL NUCLEAR TESTING"
in both English and Chinese briefly, six Greenpeace activists were
surrounded in Tiananmen Square by some 30 military and civilian police
and taken into custody.  No contact has yet been made with the
activists since their arrest.

<P>"Greenpeace believes China's role in this issue is critical and we
have gathered activists from all of the other nuclear weapons states
along with our international director to send a strong message to the
Chinese government and people that further nuclear testing here and
anywhere else in the world is unacceptable," said Thilo Bode, incoming
Executive Director for Greenpeace International before the protest. 

<P>"By conducting nuclear tests now, both China and France threaten to
hijack the growing momentum toward a global ban on nuclear testing."
 
<P>Taking part in the protest were Greenpeace Executive Director Thilo
Bode as well as directors from Greenpeace offices in the other four
nuclear weapons states (Britain, France, Russia and the US). 

<P>In an interview with Asahi Shimbun on Sunday, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said his country would agree to stop nuclear testing when a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), currently being negotiated at
the United Nations in Geneva, came into force.  But Greenpeace said
China must do more to halt testing now, not later, if a CTBT is to be
successfully negotiated.

<P>Media reports have said that China is currently making final
preparations at its Lop Nor test site to conduct a nuclear weapons
test before the end of August.  The Lop Nor test site is some 265
kilometres south-east of Urumqi in the Xinjian region. The area has
been heavily contaminated by radioactivity released by the tests.
 
<P>Since its first test in 1964, China is believed to have detonated
some 42 nuclear blasts. It is estimated that China has constructed
some 450 nuclear weapons deployed as land and submarine-based missile,
aircraft-carried gravity bombs, artillery shells and even nuclear
demolition munitions. 

<P>In all, the power of the accumulated Chinese nuclear arsenal is
some 16,000 times greater than that of the bomb the US dropped
on Hiroshima, Japan in 1945.   
 
<P>"Continued nuclear tests and weapons development will not make China
or any other nation safer or more secure," said Greenpeace's Damon
Moglen in Beijing.  "It will, instead, create greater regional
instability and will justify the efforts of other nations to develop
nuclear weapons. Testing now by China, or France, threatens to arrest
or even destroy this historical opportunity for a global test ban. The
clock must not be turned back now."

<P><br><br><br><br>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<H4><p align=cnter> SIX GREENPEACE PROTESTORS TO BE DEPORTED FROM CHINA TOMORROW
</H4></head>
<P>BEIJING, 15 August, 1995 -- (GP) The six Greenpeace activists
detained by Chinese police for 14 hours today after holding up
a protest banner in Tiananmen Square are being held under guard
at a hotel near Beijing airport and are expected to be deported
tomorrow.

<P>Greenpeace's Harald Zindler, in a phone call from the Beijing
Grace Hotel, told Damon Moglen, still in Beijing, that the six
are safe, in good spirits and expect to be flown to Hong Kong on
a morning flight.

<P>"We are relieved to hear that our activists are safe after having
no contact with them since their nuclear testing protest in
Tiananmen Square early morning in Beijing," Greenpeace's Moglen
said.  "We are, however, committed to continuing to send a clear
message to China, whether from outside the country or within,
that nuclear testing is unacceptable by China, France or any
other nation."

<P>Details of the deportation of the Greenpeace activists remains
sketchy but Zindler reported that most would be flown to Hong
Kong on an early flight out.  It is unclear as to who will be
deported when and to where but we hope to learn more in the
morning Beijing time.  

<P>The Greenpeace deportees may be available to Hong Kong press when
they arrive once more details are known.  Please keep in contact
with Greenpeace Communications for information.

<H4>CHINA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND TESTING PROGRAMME </H4></head>
 
<P>China has used its 42 nuclear tests since 1964 to develop the world's fourth
largest nuclear weapons arsenal, (the UK has less). It includes approximately
450 nuclear weapons of at least five different types, divided between 300
strategic weapons (on land based missiles, bombers, and submarine launched
missiles), and perhaps 150 tactical (artillery shells and atomic demolition
munitions). Together they have a cumulative yield of 250 megatons or around
16,000 Hiroshima bombs. 
 
<P>China's last test was on 15th May 1995 at the Lop Nor nuclear test site. The
detonation came three days after the end of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) Review & Extension Conference, where it alone amongst nations
supported the right under article V to conduct peaceful nuclear explosions.
China claims it does not have the computer technology to undertake lab tests
and that it needs to test 'in the field'. It should be noted that China (along
with France) is not a signtory to the Partial Test Ban Treaty. 
 
<P><H4>CHINA'S TESTING PROGRAMME</H4>
 
<P>Testing takes place at the Lop Nor site, approximately 265 kilometres south-
east of Urumqi in the Xinjian region (due west of Beijing, due north of
Kathmandu). The Xinjian region is home to the Uighur people, and China has
never allowed any form of independent or outside assessment of the
environmental or health impacts of its nuclear testing programme. Since
testing began in 1964, China has conducted one test on average every 284 days. 
 
<P>China's current testing programme is thought to involve warheads for two new
missile systems, one for deployment in the late 1990s, and one around 2010.
The latter may carry several
warheads. China is also developing a new sea-launched ballistic missile (JL-2)
for deployment on its second generation strategic nuclear-powered submarine.
In May of this year China also tested a new ballistic missile with a range of
2,000 kilometres.  
<P>The chief design laboratory for Chinese nuclear weapons is the Ninth Academy
at Mianyang (Sichuan) or the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP).
Plutonium production for weapons purposes, which has taken place at two
reactors, in Jiuquan (Gansu) and Guangyuan (Sichuan), reportedly ceased in
1991. However a new plutonium facility is scheduled to open in the mid-1990s.
  
<P><H4>FUTURE TESTS AND WEAPONS</H4>
 
<P>China has said it plans four or five more nuclear tests during 1995. These
tests are central to the qualitative development of new systems, rather than
the quantitative deployment of a larger number of systems. Chinese nuclear
strategy is currently based upon the ability to retaliate if attacked with
nuclear weapons. Land-based systems remain central, improvements in accuracy,
range, guidance and control. Taiwan and Japan increasingly dominate strategic
thinking. 
 
<P><H4>RADIOACTIVITY AND LOP NOR
 </H4>
<P>A book released by International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War
(1) has given the following amounts of
radioactivity as having been released from Lop Nor.
 
<P>The total amount of plutonium-239 released as result is estimated at 3,300 
curies, approximately 48 kilograms in weight (see 2 for estimates). One
millionth of a gram of plutonium-239, if inhaled can cause cancer. The amount
of plutonium-239 still contained within the Lop Nor site is estimated by IPPNW
(1) as 1,800 curies (25 kilograms). 
 
<P>A further 2 million curies of caesium-137 and 1.3 million curies of
strontium-90 have also been released into the atmosphere. The radioactive
half-life of these materials are 30 and 29 years respectively. Caesium-137
concentrates in muscle tissue, but normally passes out of the body in 2 years.
Strontium-90, however, attaches to the bones and thus stays in the 
body giving radiation doses over a longer period of time.  
The above figures are exclusive of the shorter lived fission products, such
as iodine-131, which has a radioactive half-life of 8 days, which would have
also been released.
 
 
<P>              <H4> CHINESE NUCLEAR TESTS: 1964-1995</H4>
 
 
<P>The Chinese nuclear test site is at Lop Nor in the western province of Xin
Jiang.  Since conducting the first test there on October 16th, 1964, China has
exploded (42??) nuclear bombs: 23 in the atmosphere (ceased in 1980); 19
underground (since 1969) plus 3 unverified seismic events suspected to have
been nuclear explosions.  China's last atmospheric tst was on 16th October
1980.

<p>
   Rainbow Warrior left Prince's Wharf in Auckland bound for 
Matauri Bay to pay respects to and receive the blessing of the 
local Maori people who act as custodians to the site where the 
first Rainbow Warrior lies.  It's a fitting destination before 
the new Rainbow Warrior sets off for Moruroa, the Pacific atoll 
where France is about to resume the testing of nuclear weapons.  
<p>
<p>
<B>13 June 0800</B> 
<p>
<p>
   We arrived at Matauri Bay and were welcomed aboard the Maori 
elders and community leaders.  The welcome and blessing of our 
ship and voyage was very moving.  To take part in the Maori 
custom and culture was an honour for all of us.  We left Matauri 
be at midday and prior to commencing our long sea passage paid 
our own personal respects to the sunken Rainbow Warrior by 
sailing over where she lies.  We go to Moruroa to bear witness on 
behalf of the international community and protest at the 
continuing arrogance and stupidity of man.  The decision by 
France was expected, but we are angered nonetheless.  What right 
do they have in the face of international opposition to 
proliferate and test weapons of mass destruction many thousands 
of miles from France?  Would the French people allow atomic 
testing on the French mainland?
<p>
   We have nine different nationalities on board: British, 
French, Fijian, American, Dutch, Italian, New Zealander, 
Australian, and Solomon Islander.  Work on board is varied.  All 
Greenpeace ships have a highly qualified core of people on the 
bridge, in the radio room, and the engine room.  Some new crew 
crew are inexperienced in life on board ships but receive on 
board training.  The one common goal of all of us is to fight for 
a better, cleaner environment.  
<p>
<p>
<B>15 June 1200</B>
<p>
   With a near gale force westerly wind, the Rainbow Warrior 
under reefed jib, fore, main, and mizzen was making seven and a 
half knots on her easterly course.  A P-3 Orion aircraft of the 
Royal New Zealand Air Force paid us a friendly visit and wished 
us good sailing.  During the day the crew were engaged in 
cleaning ship, keeping watches, and other shipboard activities.   
The campaigners have been non-stop on the ship's telephone 
talking to the international media explaining the reasons why 
Rainbow Warrior is on her way to Moruroa.  Night is now upon us.  
The sky a blaze of stars.  The Rainbow Warrior moves further 
east.
<p>
<p>
<B>16 June 1000</B>
<p>
   We have all recovered from a severe stormy night.  With 
westerly winds gusting gale force and sea swell four meters deep 
it was very uncomfortable for all of us.  The ship took quite a 
battering  being thrown around like a cork and all those on board 
felt like peas in a jar.  At 0500 this morning it was decided to 
start the main engines and run to the northeast to clear the 
worst effects of the storms which approach from the west.  With 
the combined main engine and sail we are achieving a speed of 
nearly ten knots towards our destination. 
<p>
<p>
<B>16 June 1400</B>
<p>
   The Rainbow Warrior is now making a good ten knots under one 
engine and full sail.  Wind is still steady westerly, force seven 
with heavy swell.  She is more comfortable now than twelve hours 
ago and all on board are recovering from the earlier battering by 
the elements.  I can now sit comfortably in my cabin and continue 
the log of life on board.  People will ask what our reaction was 
when we heard the announcement by President Chirac on the morning 
of 14 June.  We were not surprised but felt anger, which 
increased our determination to bear witness at Moruroa Atoll.  
<p>
   The equipment we have on board Rainbow Warrior is designed for 
the various campaigns Greenpeace addresses.  The inflatable boats 
and crews are the symbol of the organization known by the 
international community.  We have various sized boats and 
outboard engines for different roles.  Our communications center 
has all the latest equipment for instant communication to 
anywhere in the world within seconds.  Thom our Radio Operator is 
a computer/electronics whizz kid.  For Greenpeace, communications 
is an important aspect of the organization's strength.  On this 
voyage and at Moruroa, thousands of miles away for the most part 
from inhabited land masses, these communication tools are more 
important than ever.  
<p>
   A little about myself.  Born in 1942, in Cardiff, South Wales, 
my family and I moved to live in the east end of London in 1947.  
From an early age, I and my brother were taught the values of 
living in a community where respect and caring for all was of 
prime importance.  These values came from our parents who 
believed fervently in 'living socialism' as well as 'political 
socialism'.  
<p>
   At the age of seventeen, I went to sea as an officer cadet in 
the Merchant Navy and obtained my master's foreign going 
certificate at the age of twenty-eight.  I spent five years 
working in Kenya and Tanzania as a harbour master and pilot.  I 
returned to the U.K. in 1976.  In 1983 I was sent to Vanuatu by 
the British government as Director of Ports and Marine.  I was 
responsible to the government of Vanuatu for all marine matters 
within the republic.  
<p>
  It was in June, 1985 that I became directly involved with the 
original Rainbow Warrior during her stay in Port Vila.  Later, I 
heard that she had been bombed in Auckland Harbour.  It was then 
I made a conscious decision to give my time and experience to the 
organization.  I joined Greenpeace in 1988 and have been involved 
in various campaigns in the Mediterranean, United States, 
Northwest Europe, and now the Pacific.  As well, I have been 
actively involved in the U.K over the past twenty-five years with 
CND - the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament - so this voyage in 
very important to me personally. 
<p>
   I live in the U.K. at Frinton on Sea, Essex with my wife 
Janet, three sons and one daughter.

<H4>Captain's log
<P>Sunday 25th June </H4> 
</head>            

<body>




 

 
<P>   Our four day stay in Rarotonga has been a great experience. 

The warmth and friendship shown in so many ways by the local 
community was wonderful.  Every day people would arrive at the 
ship with gifts of fresh fruits and vegetables - we have enough 
bananas on board to keep us going for weeks.  On one day alone
we 
were visited by 250 school children who brought their letters and

good wishes - the younger generation, our future, is what we are 
fighting for.  
 
  <P> For the crew this was not just a break on a beautiful island 
but a time for more serious boat training.  Every day our boats 
went out to sea for about three hours.  The crews would return, 
sore bums, arms, knees, backs.  Training in small inflatables 
takes its toll!!
 
 <P>  I decided to take Saturday off, and forget the ship for a 
while.  Myself and the photographer Steve Morgan hired a push 
bike and we peddled around the island - a distance of about 24 
miles.  Being a rather warm day we decided to make 'refreshment 
stops' at various tourist hotels en route!!  Our last stop off 
was at the Royal Rarotonga Yacht Club - last bastion of the 
'Empire'.  We received a very warm welcome, even to the point 
they gave us the use of a small sailing dinghy.  I suppose they 
thought the captain of the sailing vessel Rainbow Warrior should
be proficient in small boat sailing!!  We did not capsize, but 
ran the centre over a rock - no damage to the boat.  After 
refreshments we bade farewell to the yachting fraternity and 
cycled back to Rarotonga harbour feeling tired but happy.
 
<P>  We sailed midday Sunday bound for Papeete, the capital of 
Tahiti.  I wonder whether our welcome there would be as warm as 
Rarotonga?
<br>
<P><B>Monday 26th June</B>
<br> 
<P>With the wind almost dead ahead we could not use our sails, but 
motored.  In the afternoon we had another session of boat work. 

<P>More launching, more bruised bodies. The air temperature is 
rising with midday reaching 33 degrees Celsius, sea temperature 
30 degrees.
<br> 
<P><B>Tuesday 27th June</B>
<br> 
<P>Weather fine and clear, but very hot.  Again more boat training. 

At night the temperature drops to about 26 degrees Celsius.  We 
averaged six knots today - nothing to get excited about.  
<br> 
<P><B>Wednesday 28th June</B>
<br>
<P>Noon position 18 degrees 22 minutes south, 152 degrees 14 minutes

West.  Speed 5 knots.  Nothing to report except sighting of a 
minke whale close to ship.
<br> 
<P><B>Thursday 29th June</B>
<br>
<P>Arrived off Papeete Port 1030 hours.  The Port Authorities, 
through pressure at higher levels, are trying to make access to 
the ship very difficult.  As I write, a large demonstration of 
more than 15,000 -- about 20 percent of the adult population of 
the island -- are marching in protest at a resumption of French 
testing.  The French authorities want the Rainbow Warrior out of 
the way on grounds that we may incite problems -- the irony is 
that the problem is their decision on testing!  We will stay 
outside Papeete until we are hear from local activists that we 
are to get a better berth.  
 
<P>   Warm Regards  - David Enever

<p>    At 1500 hours the S/V Rainbow Warrior met up with S/V Vega and

commenced re-supplying her with fresh water and provisions.  We 
were closely watched by three French warships.  All our boats 
were in the water buzzing around being very busy hoping to 
confuse the navy.  By sunset this operation had been completed 
and we took back on four boats whilst the fifth disappeared into 
the darkness fully provisioned to set out on her lone expedition.

on board.  The Rainbow Warrior then moved south keeping three
miles 
outside the exclusion zone so that the French Navy would not, we 
hoped, be able to board us.  We now had a naval escort of 5 
vessels boxing us in  - very cozy!!
<br> 
<p> <B>9 July</B>
<br> 
 <p>   At 0100 hours all crew were called giving them time to take 
breakfast and make final checks on their boats.  All boats were 
fully equipped with provisions and safety equipment i.e. flares, 
compass, GPS position receivers, EPIRB radio location beacons,
and 
automatic RADAR transponders etc.  My priority, as always, is 
the safety of my boat crews.  
 
<p>    Before the crews were given the call to stand by their boats 
launching, Monsignor Jacques Gaillot a kindly, quiet man, who is 
also a Roman Catholic Bishop from France known for his good 
works on behalf of the homeless, immigrants and unemployed, said 
prayers for the safety of us all.  Many then joined in reciting 
the Lord's Prayer.  Even those of us who do not prescribe to a 
faith were deeply moved.  I looked round at my crew and saw some 
tears.  God created this planet and does not want it destroyed
by 
the stupidity of man  - I always refer to him as the Executive 
Director in the Sky.
 
 <p>   At 0200 hrs, under cover of darkness, we launched Group Two 
comprised of 2 boats with two persons per boat.  A hazy moon gave

enough light to launch without putting on deck lights and 
attracting the Navy's attention.
 
 <p>   The first launch was beautiful, the training of the past month

was bearing fruit. Within 10 minutes the two boats slipped
quietly into 
the Pacific and were away to their kick off point.  I then turned

north and made for my second launch position 10 miles north of 
Group Two.  At 0350 Group One comprised of two more boats were 
launched and made off into the darkness.  The Navy had a 
suspicion that boats had been launched and used a helicopter to 
hunt for them.  They also launched their own search craft.  
 
<p>    After launching Group One I steamed a further 10 miles north 
to be at my start point for 0500 hrs.  We now had three groups 
over an arc of 20 miles which succeeded in dividing the Naval 
vessels.  We were all going to cross the exclusion zone at 0500 
hrs or thereabouts.  Sunrise was 0600 hours: plenty of light to 
enter into Moruroa Lagoon.  At 0500 hrs precisely, Rainbow 
Warrior kicked in her second engine and away we went at 11 knots 
towards the exclusion zone line.  We all were acting 
independently of each other, three groups dashing for the lagoon 
from different directions at full speed.  I was called by French 
Naval vessels stating I was entering the exclusion zone and 
should turn back.  I replied that I would maintain my course and 
speed.
 
<p>    At 0615 we saw inflatables being launched by a French naval 
vessel.  A French frigate steamed past at speed but did not 
impede me  As we got closer to the channel we could see clearly 
the fairway buoys and a tug blocking the pass.  At 0600 Marine 
Commandos had boarded us, dressed all in black with face masks. 

<p> The wheelhouse had bars on all the windows and both doors were 
locked securely.  
 
   The officer in charge of the eight commandos ordered me to 
open the door, I refused and next thing I remember, a sledge 
hammer was breaking the wheelhouse windows and two tear gas 
canisters were popping and fizzing like fire works!  We were 
rammed  starboard side by the naval tug A234 whose role was 
to stop us entering the channel.  The tear gas took quick effect 
and I and the cameraman Gene evacuated the bridge.  Andy, the 
mate, opened the forward door and we evacuated the accommodation 
of all personnel.  
 
 <p>   The commandos then entered and made for the radio room.  They 
told me to open the radio room door, I refused.  They then set 
about it with axes.  Thom the radio officer, Stephanie Mills and 
Jean-Luc were still getting film out and doing live interviews
as 
the commandos battered the door.  They forced a hole large enough

and squirted tear gas inside.  The effect on face and eyes is 
devastating.  
 
   Stephanie and Thom escaped out of the porthole onto the bridge

deck.  Jean-Luc kept his head out of the porthole, breathing 
fresh air.  Eventually the door was forced open and Jean-Luc 
taken - but the film had been sent out to the world.  
 
 <p>   We were herded on deck under the watchful eye of a commando. 

We were initially refused access to toilets, food, refreshment. 

I argued with the nasty little zealous officer, pointing out the 
question of human rights , the UN Charter and E.C law and that
I 
would inform the world if he did not conceded these basic rights 
-- he did.
 
 <p>   We were then towed to a mooring buoy in the lagoon.  In charge
of 
the operation, a harbour master resplendent in white shirt, long 
white trousers and binoculars around his neck -- what a sight! 

We immediately nicknamed him the "Admiral".  
 
<p>    At 1400 hours the squad of heavies -- a gang of French foreign

legionnaires -- removed my crew forcibly to a boat where they 
were taken ashore for questioning.  I was held on board to meet 
the commander of the French Navy at Moruroa who was interested
to 
know the whereabouts of our fifth inflatable.  I honestly 
answered I did not know where they were.  
 
<p>   I was then taken ashore to the Gendamerie and held for eight 
hours while the rest of my crew were interrogated at two 
different locations on the atoll.  They were marched back to the 
quay and told they would be taken back to the Rainbow Warrior. 

<p> They then staged a sit down protest refusing to move until I 
could join them -- I felt very proud of them!  I was then 
released, and joined their sit in, saying we would not move until

all four of our inflatables and their safety gear were returned 
to the ship.   
 
 <p>   By this time about 60 legionnaires and commando style troops 
surrounded us, and it was beginning to look "heavy". I asked the 
press to stay with us because if they had left I believe we would

have been beaten.  Thankfully, Janet Gibson and Rob, the 
cameraman of Channel 9 in Sydney, Roger Maynard of the London 
Times and Juliette Larousse Hollier of AFP stayed watching -- I 
thank them all for that.
 
<p>    The "Admiral" gave the command and the troops moved in on us, 
forcibly moving us to a waiting launch.  We were taken back to 
the Rainbow Warrior where the "Admiral" and his merry men were 
<br>
<p><B> 10 July </B>
<br> 
<p>    We arrived outside the 12 mile limit at 0230 hours and our 
uninvited guests -- who had been controlling the bridge and 
engine room and had posted guards on the deck -- left.  We 
drifted over night so everybody - except the campaigners who were

left answering never-ending phone calls - could get well earned 
rest.
 
<p>    In the afternoon we met "Vega" and the Danish Viking ship, 
"Bifrost". A barbecue on the deck to honour Steve Sawyer's 
birthday was a fitting way to end the last 48 hours!
<br> 
<p><B> 11 July</B>
<br> 
We stocked both the Vega and Bifrost with more fuel and food, 
and at 1830 hours bid them farewell. We are making passage to 
Papeete to continue the campaign against nuclear testing.  We 
will arrive on Bastille Day - the 14th of July -- ironic  that 
this is a celebration of liberty, fraternity and equality.
<br>
<p><B> 13 July</B>
<br> 
We are now 15 hours from Papeete and wonder what our reception 
will be.  We have and will continue to have the support of the 
majority of people in the South Pacific and the world.  Our 
thanks go to the people of Australia for their support and 
encouragement.  I send my love to Nick and Tina Lorenson and 
family and two special people in Leura: Take care Judith and 
Alexander.

<H4>Captain's log
<P>14th July</H4></head><body>
 
<P>   Bastille Day  - Liberty, Equalite, Fraternity, for some but
not for the indigenous people of the South Pacific.  They do not
have the choice on the question of independence, and whether
weapons of mass destruction should be tested at Moruroa Atoll.
 
<P>   Rainbow Warrior entered Papeete at 0930 hrs.  The welcome was
tremendous, with Tahitian war canoes, bedecked with flowers and
palm fronds escorting us to our berth.  The sound of drums and
cheering people moved us all.  They were there to welcome Oscar
Temaru, the mayor of Faa'a, Tahiti's most populous city, and
leader of of the independence movement Tavini Huira-atira, as 
well as the Rainbow Warrior.  Oscar had been to Moruroa with us.  
A quiet spoken, intelligent man whom we all respected greatly.  
An inspiration to also, to hear of his ambitions and dreams for 
Tahiti and its people.
 
<P>   As in all ports, Immigration came on board to check crew 
members against Passports.  There was much amusement when six 
crew members could not be traced - they were of course on "Vega" 
and the fifth inflatable.  Even the principal immigration officer 
turned to me and winked secretively as if to say- "What are you 
buggers up to!"  We had struck up a friendly rapport with Customs 
and Immigration in Papeete which is always good for all of us.  
After the ship had been cleared, we were all taken ashore to 
partake in a traditional Tahitian feast on the quayside in front 
of a French warship.  Speeches of welcome to us all were heard 
and I replied on behalf of the R.W.  All the time crews on the 
French warship were busily snapping away with their cameras.  We 
then laid wreaths at a memorial to those who had died since the 
beginning of nuclear tests at Moruroa Atoll in 1967.
 
<P>   In the evening we were the guests of Oscar Temaru at a house 
on the beach near Faa'a.  It was a beautiful night, clear sky and 
a moon, almost full.  Three beautiful Tahitian girls accompanied 
by a guitar snag traditional songs for us - I cannot describe the 
feeling the we experienced - we were in paradise.  The kindness 
and warmth of the Tahitian people will remain with me always.  
 
<P>   I was concerned with the security aspect for the R.W. while we 
were at Papeete.  I approached Oscar on the subject and he 
immediately had some of followers staying on and patrolling the 
quay for the duration of our stay - it made me feel much easier.  
We were reunited with our media friends who had traveled on the 
R.W. to Moruroa.  They supported us by staying around when we 
were forced back to R.W. at Moruroa Atoll.  Channel 9's Rob and 
Janet, Roger from the Times of London, Juliet from AFP Paris - It 
was good to see them all again.  We had a good evening out 
together needless to say!!
 
<P><H4>Monday 17th July</H4>
 
<P>   Another full day of press and television interviews.  The 
media attention was firmly set on the whereabouts of the 
mysterious 5th inflatable with David McTaggart, Henk Hazzen, and 
Chris Robinson.  In all honesty we did not know where she was - 
I'm not sure the media believed us.
 
<P>   We sailed that evening at 1745 hrs.  Sadness in many ways to 
say goodbye to our friends who had been with us to "the place of 
the dark secret", Moruroa Atoll.  Many well wishers were there to 
bid us farewell as we slowly moved from the quay.  We dropped the 
pilot at 1815 hrs and set course for Rarotonga, a distance of 620 
nautical miles.
 
<P>   The wind was very light on passage so we could not set our 
sails but motored on our two engines.  Everybody was exausted and 
took the opportunity to catch up on sleep!!
 
<P><H4>Thursday 20th July</H4>
 
   We entered the small harbour at Rarotonga and were greeted by 
the Deputy Prime Minister and school children.  It was good to be 
back again.  That evening I was present at a function hosted by 
the Prime Minister who made the announcement the a "Vaka" 
traditional canoe would sail to Moruroa as part of the Peace 
Flotilla. 
<P> <H4>Saturday 22nd July</H4>
 
<P>   Preparing again for sea.  Sailing time set for 1200 hrs.  
During the morning well wishers came to visit us and wish us Bon 
Voyage.  We bade farewell to our video man Gene and stills 
cameraman Steve where were leaving the ship - we had been 
together for two and a half months.
 
<P>   A major crisis almost canceled our sailing.  I had ordered 50 
vegetarian and 50 meat pies.  They were due at 1200 hrs but at 2 
minutes to sailing - no bloody pies.  I requested main engines 
and commenced letting go when - our pies arrived!!  The day was 
saved and we sailed from Raortonga.
 
<P><H4>Wednesday 26th July</H4>
 
<P>   We now have some wind and are under full sail.  We will be 
arriving Suva, Fiji Saturday 29th July at 0800 hrs for repairs, 
provisions, and new crew.  Then Rainbow Warrior will return to 
Moruroa Atoll.  We will not give up the fight to see the end of 
this insanity perpetuated by the French Military establishment on 
the peoples of the South Pacific.  
 
 <P>   Warm regards  -  David Enever</body></html>

Voices from some of the Rainbow Warrior crew:</H4></head>

<P>Peter Laue, American, 70 years of age:

<P>I retired in late 1988, having been an engineer aboard deep
sea tow boats for nearly twenty years. Feeling it was time to do
something good for the environment, and missing the sea, I
applied to Greenpeace for an engineering job.  I felt strongly
that I would like to leave a greener and cleaner world for my
children and grand children.  Greenpeace seemed to fit what I
thought I should do, and what I was trained to do. They have not
disappointed me.
 
<P>I was finally hired as chief engineer aboard the MV Greenpeace,
and soon found myself leaving Amsterdam for Norway and Russia in
1991.  we were protesting the then-Soviet Union's nuclear bomb
tests in Novya Zemlya, an island above the Arctic circle, north
of Archangel, conducted by the Soviet Union.  At the test site,
we were arrested at gunpoint and held aboard for a week by the
KGB.  Once released, we sailed for Norway, Iceland, Ireland and
England, hunting for a ship loaded of nuclear waste going from
Europe to England.  They out-foxed us that trip.
 
<P>Other voyages I've made have been opposing toxic dumping and
saving endangered sea turtles in the Mediterranean, protecting
the Antarctic, and the anti-whaling campaign.  Waste trade
(shipping of waste from developed to developing countries)
campaigns in South East Asia, driftnet fishing campaigns in the
Bay of Biscay and Mediterranean have also been a highlight in my
work.  Many, if not most, of these campaigns have to do with
educating the visitors aboard ship about the particular campaign:
the reasons why we are protesting, the issues involved, and
working with other environmental groups.
 
<P>This last campaign, as you know, was a witness to the world about
nuclear testing.  
 
<P>Have there been any exciting moments?  Yes, many, some of which
would happen when we least expected trouble. But our very
presence seemed to upset some people who seem to have enough of
a guilty conscience to over-react in a tense situation.
 
<P>For me, atomic testing in the Pacific or any other place in the
world is a crime against all living things on the planet -- it
is time to stop -- and the people of the world have to know about
it.  

<P>Americans should be concerned about testing as much as the
rest of the world.  Who do we want to kill with these nuclear
bombs?  How many children with leukaemia or birth defects from
radiation do we need to see before we question our reliance on
nuclear weapons and power?  How much more of our resources do we
wish to dump down a hole of destruction?  Winston Churchill said
it best: "The second bomb only bounces the rubble."  If the
French test, there are people in the US -- who do not realise or
know the consequences of their actions -- who will want to resume
testing in the US.  Then we would see the same craziness of the
nuclear arms race starting all over again.  Albert Einstein's
words put it best when he said that the splitting of the atom
changed everything, save our mode of thinking, and thus we drift
towards unparalleled catastrophe.
 
<P>When the French commandos boarded the Rainbow Warrior, I was on
the bridge with the captain, so if any systems broke down or he
needed assistance I would be right there.  I was tear gassed
along with everyone else.  After being herded on deck, it was
discovered that the radio room which was barricaded was also tear
gassed, and that two campaigners and the radio operator were in
there.  We were afraid they might be hurt or overcome by gas. 
Two of them scrambled out the porthole, thankfully, while one
hung out the porthole for air. 

<P>I had to reenter the ship to get tools and show the commandos how
to open the door: this time I really got a dose of tear gas. 
The French commandos, or Foreign Legion, or Navy or Police (they
were all there) didn't seem to know what to do with us, and there
were many conflicting scenarios of what was going to happen to
us. Finally the Rainbow Warrior was towed into Moruroa lagoon and
tied up to a mooring buoy.  Then we were taken ashore and
separated into groups so no one knew where or what was going on
with anyone else.
 
<P>Lastly, we were interrogated.  We all gave our names as Fernando
Pereira, the Greenpeace photographer killed when the French blew
up the first Rainbow Warrior ten years ago - and then more
waiting.  Finally, everyone was assembled at the dock to be taken
back to our ship. We refused to go until our inflatables (which
they had been seized) were returned for safety reasons.  They
refused -- after much more talk, more officers and then finally
a bus load of Foreign Legionnaires arrived.  They finally gave
us one inflatable back and the Legionnaires said they would use
force if necessary to put us back on the Rainbow Warrior.  They
carried, pushed and shoved us aboard a launch and took us back
to our ship.  They then towed us out of the lagoon to the 12 mile
limit and let us go.
 
<P> The same people who make and test these bombs and spread nuclear
pollution through the world without good reason are the same
people who will use these bombs of mass destruction... People
should think of the money and resources used to make and test
these bombs: which could be used for peace and the enhancement
of people's lives world wide instead.</body></html>

<head><H1><H4><B>The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in Jeopardy?</B></H4></H1>
 
</head>

<body>


            
<P><H4><B>INTRODUCTION</B></H4>
 
<P>A Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) has been the goal of the
international community since atmospheric tests were banned in
1963. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, signed in 1970,
called for a CTBT, and agreement of such a measure has been seen
as an important litmus test of the Nuclear Weapon States (NWS)
commitment to nuclear disarmament ever since.
 
<P>Talks on a CTBT finally began in earnest in January 1994 at the
Geneva Conference on Disarmament (CD), after the United States,
Britain, France, Russia -- all at the time with testing moratoria
in place -- and China, agreed to establish a formal negotiating
committee.  Only 36 states are currently members of the CD,
(including all five official NWS) and 23  other states are
allowed to participate in the discussions as observers.
 
<P>It was hoped that the treaty would be concluded by April 1995,
when a decision on the extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT) was made. Unfortunately, because of a lack of political
will on the part of the NWS, various obstacles blocked progress.
These included China's advocacy of exceptions for so-called
"peaceful nuclear explosions" (PNEs), Britain and France's desire
to exempt tests "in exceptional circumstances", the United
States' support until January 1995 of a ten-year "opt out"
clause, and pressure from the military in the NWS for an
exemption for low-yield and hydronuclear experiments (HNEs).  
 
<P>Such loopholes would make a test ban treaty largely meaningless
in affecting greater steps for nuclear disarmament, because
through more sophisticated technology, the NWS would be able to
continue to test and develop new generations of nuclear bombs.
A genuinely comprehensive test ban treaty must ban all tests, for
all time, in all environments, including the informational
environment (i.e. computer simulation).
 
<P>Many non-nuclear countries opposed indefinite extension of the
NPT in May, fearing that it would give carte blanche to the NWS
to continue testing and block further disarmament measures.
However, the NWS pledged to the international community that they
were committed to the NPT's end goal of the abolition of nuclear
weapons, and promised to pursue a CTBT with vigour and to
"exercise utmost restraint" over nuclear testing until such time
as the CTBT entered into force.
 
<P>Unfortunately, this pledge was broken almost immediately. On May
15, three days after the NPT ended, China set off its 42nd
nuclear test. On June 13, France announced that it would resume
nuclear testing in the South Pacific. While both France and
China have said they would agree to a CTBT in 1996, their actions
raise serious questions about their commitment to either a CTBT
or nuclear non-proliferation. This was underscored in July 1995
when the French Ambassador to New Zealand, M. Jacques Le Blanc
said that France "reserved its right" to continue testing if the
international community failed to conclude the CTBT in 1996.
 
<P>France's proposed series of eight 10 - 100 kiloton nuclear tests
from September 1995 to May 1996 may also be used to disguise the
simultaneous detonation of low yield tests. France's eight tests
are therefore likely to provide data not only for new nuclear
weapon systems such as warheads for the new M45 and M5
submarine-launched ballistic missiles and a new air-launched
cruise missile (ASLP), but also for future low yield, high
powered laser experiments and computer simulation tests.
Hydronuclear tests, favoured by the US testing establishment,
have been described as "experiments" rather than tests by the
United States. The Pentagon and US nuclear weapons scientists are
currently lobbying to have such tests exempted from a CTBT.
 
<P>Any and all of these tests are contrary to France's NPT
obligations to halt and reverse the arms race and achieve nuclear
disarmament.
 
<P><H4><B>LOW YIELD TESTS</B></H4>
 <P>At the CTBT talks in Geneva, Britain and France have reportedly
sought exemptions for tests up to the equivalent of 500 tons of
TNT, a position supported by the Pentagon.  This explosive level
is 200 times more powerful than the Oklahoma bomb. Critics say
these tests would provide information to develop so-called micro-
or mini-nukes (nuclear weapons with a yield of less than one
kiloton) for tactical use in "conventional" wars.  According to
Ray Kidder, a US nuclear physicist who does not believe such
tests should be permitted, the proposed 500 tons TNT threshold
also happens to be the strength of the miniature nuclear
weapons US nuclear weapons laboratories were investigating just
before the US testing moratorium was declared in 1992. The United
States has not yet resolved its official position on low-yield
tests.
 
<P><H4><B>HYDRO-NUCLEAR EXPERIMENTS</B></H4> (HNEs)
 
<P>An HNE is the detonation of a nuclear weapon in which the chain
reaction is prevented from progressing effectively, and thus the
yield is very low (much less than the full weapon yield). The
yield can be as low as 0.1 kg.
 
<P>These tests have been used as "safety and reliability" checks in
the past to make sure that the weapon does not detonate if the
conventional detonators around the warhead are set off
accidentally.
 
<P>HNEs can also be used to study the first moments of criticality
(ignition) in a nuclear explosion.  A series of HNEs would be
difficult to distinguish seismologically, from a series of low
yield weapon tests, so these tests pose a grave problem for the
verification credibility of a CTBT.
 
<P><H4><B>COMPUTER SIMULATION TESTING</B>
 </H4>
<P>Sophisticated computer simulations, including the use of
high-powered laser facilities and hydrodynamic testing (which
involve no nuclear explosion), are proposed to refine existing
design warheads, and may provide information for new weapons
designs.  However, the military in the NWS argue that actual
tests are also needed to ensure new warheads are effective. 
Regardless, billion-dollar proposals such as France's proposed
Bordeaux laser facility and the US National Ignition Facility
clearly breach those countries' NPT obligations because they
would facilitate the development of new nuclear weapons.
 
<P><H4><B>FRANCE'S JUSTIFICATION FOR TESTING</B></H4>
 
<P>President Chirac told the French Senate on July 12 that two tests
were to try out a new nuclear warhead, two were for safety and
reliability tests, and the other four were to acquire the
technology for computer simulation tests. The first test is
thought to be to certify the TN-75 warhead for the new M45
submarine-launched missile, even though this warhead has already
undergone 22 development tests in the South Pacific prior
to the April 1992 moratorium. These tests must surely have
established the performance of the warhead, and it is hardly
necessary for a final test.
 
<P>Nuclear tests often have multiple purposes, with only the primary
purpose being given by the authorities. For example, it is
possible that new warhead tests are labelled "safety" tests if
the new warhead is safer than the old one. Thus the other tests
may well be for development of new generation warheads for the
M5 submarine launched ballistic missile and the air-launched
cruise missile (ASLP). 
 
<P>This would ensure France had a new generation of nuclear weapons
until well into the 21st century.  None of these developments are
necessary or justified, particularly given the end of the Cold
War. Instead, they threaten European and global security by
adding to already bloated nuclear arsenals, undermining the
international norm of non-proliferation, and putting the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in jeopardy.
 
 
<P><H4><B>CURRENT STATE OF PLAY WITH CTBT NEGOTIATIONS: DEADLOCK
 </H4></B>
<P>Until recently, many non-nuclear countries tacitly agreed to an
exemption from the CTBT of very low yield tests (such as the US
official position of tests with yields of up to 4 pounds), hoping
that this would encourage the NWS to agree the CTBT as speedily
as possible.  However, with the NWS now advocating tests of up
to 500 tons, many countries believe that a CTBT would effectively
be meaningless and that the modernisation of nuclear weapons by
the NWS would continue. These countries want a CTBT to mean zero
tests, and argue that no CTBT is better than one which fails
to halt nuclear proliferation.
 
<P>In early July, both India -- on behalf of the Group of 21 (G21)
of Non-Aligned countries -- and Indonesia put forward new draft
texts for a CTBT aimed at explicitly prohibiting low yield tests.

<P>Indonesia's text would ban all nuclear testing whether explosive
or not; India's text seeks only to ensure that low yield tests,
including hydronuclear experiments, are covered by the CTBT. In
contrast, an Australian CTBT draft which does not specifically
prohibit low yield tests is being supported by some non-nuclear
Western countries. If the nuclear disarmament goal of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty is to be honoured, it is time -- fifty
years after the first bomb devastated Hiroshima -- to bring to
an end all activities which lead to the development of new
nuclear weapons, and a halt to improvements of existing systems. 
As an absolute minimum, a CTBT must be truly comprehensive and
must ban all explosions of whatever yield in all environments for
all time.  Until it is agreed, all NWS should abide by a
moratorium and indicate what further steps they will take toward
the goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons.

<body>
<h2>Statements of Governments opposed to Nuclear Testing </h2>
<p>
Statements by Governments at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
talks in April on nuclear testing, prior to France's decision to
resume testing at Moruroa atoll. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty was extended indefinitely in May, in spite of many countries'
concern that this would give the nuclear weapon states (France, U.S., 
U.K., China and Russia) carte blanche to continue their nuclear 
weapons programmes. In spite of "solemn pledges" by the nuclear 
weaponsn states to exercise "utmost restraint" on testing at the NPT,
China tested its 42nd nuclear bomb three days after the conference ended,
and France's decision to resume testing on June 13th has been widely 
viewed as undermining the commitments made at the Non-Proliferation
Treaty Conference.

<A NAME="Argentina"><B>Argentina:</B></A>
 "Special efforts should be made to finalise the
comprehensive test ban treaty in 1995" ( Mr Di Tella,
Representative of Argentina, 24 April 1995) (NPT/CONF.1995/SR.11)

<p> 
<A NAME="Australia"><B>Australia</B></A>
  stated its expectations: "Negotiations on a CTBT are
far advanced and are most likely to be concluded this year... We
wish to see a permanent and truly comprehensive end to the
testing of nuclear weapons through the conclusion this year of
the CTBT negotiations in Geneva..."  (Hon Gareth Evans,  Minister
for Foreign Affairs, 18 April, 1995)

<p> 
<A NAME="Austria"><B>Austria:</B></A>
 "We expect rapid and substantial progress in the
negotiations on a CTBT, and its early conclusion if possible in
1995 or 1996....We appeal to all nuclear powers to declare or
maintain voluntary moratoria on nuclear weapons tests until the
conclusion of a CTBT." (Ambassador Robert Marschik, Permanent
Representative of Austria to the United Nations, 19 April 1995)

<p> 
<A NAME="Belgium"><B>Belgium</B></A>
emphasised the importance of the moratorium in
achieving a CTBT quickly: "Les moratoires sur les essais...
temoignent en effet d'un nouvel etat d'esprit qui rend possible
la conclusion d'un traite d'interdiction complet des essais
nucleaires... Mon pays ne menagera aucun effort pour parvenir a
la signature rapide d'un accord en ce sens."   (Andre Mernier,
Ministre Plenipotentiaire, Mission Permanente de la Belgique
aupres des Nations Unies, 20 avril, 1995)

<p> 
<A NAME="Canada"><B>Canada:</B></A>
"[Canada] hoped that the nuclear-weapon states would
refrain from testing during the [CTBT] negotiations. ( M.
Ouellet, Minister of Foreign Affairs, 26 April 1995,  NPT.CONF.
1995/SR.3)

<p> 
<A NAME="Denmark"><B>Denmark</B></A> stated:
"The commitment shown by the United States with
regard to banning nuclear weapons tests and the leading role
taken by the U.S. in the negotiations of a comprehensive nuclear
test ban treaty is laudable... We have finally reached the stage
of serious negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test ban
treaty backed up by four moratoria on nuclear weapons testing. 
These negotiations must now be concluded."

<p> 
<A NAME="Fiji"><B>Fiji</B></A> stated:
 "An important, essential and long over-due first
step... would be a voluntary and permanent cessation of all
nuclear tests, no matter how small the device.  In this regard,
we take note of the progress being made in achieving a
comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT).  At the same time, we feel
very perturbed at the news reports that the current three-year
moratorium on testing is likely to be discontinued by some
States." (Ambassador Manasa Seniloli, Permament Representative
of Fiji to the United Nations, 25 April 1995)

<p> 
<A NAME="Finland"><B>Finland</B></A>
 said: "Progress is being made in the negotiations at
Geneva.  We would like to see the treaty ready by the end of this
year." (H.E. Ms Tarja Halonen, Minister for Foreign Affiars, 19
April 1995)

<p> 
<A NAME="Germany"><B>Germany:</B></A>
 "We urgently need a Comprehenisve Test Ban Treaty. 
Should the 1995 deadline not be feasible, in spite of encouraging
progress, we must together press for it to be signed and sealed
in 1996." (Dr Klaus Kinkel, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs,
18 April 1995)

<p> 
<A NAME="Ghana"><B>Ghana:</B></A> 
"His delegation believed that, with a sincere commitment
by all the parties to the disarmament objectives of the Non-
Proliferation Treaty, the negotiations on a comprehenisve test-
ban treaty could be concluded more quickly and it hoped that such
a treaty could be condlued in the next few months with the
cooperation of all parties concerned."  (Mr Abdulai, April 24,
1995 NPT/CONF.1995/SR.10) 

<p> 
<A NAME="Ireland"><B>Ireland</B></A> stated:
"We welcome the quickening of the pace of
negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.  We want
to see this work concluded in the near future... Public opinion
in our countries will not understand or accept any impediment to
the rapid conclusion of CTBT negotiations.  Pending the
conclusion of the CTBT, the moratoria on nuclear testing
introduced by the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom and
France will continue in force." (Tanaiste and Foreign Minister
Dick Spring, 18 April 1995)

<p> 
<A NAME="Italy"><B>Italy</B></A> stated:
 "[The CTBT negotiations] have made important
progress recently... which we hope will be concluded shortly. 
In the meantime, we continue to welcome the moratorium on nuclear
testing already decided on and implemented by most nuclear-
weapons States."

<p> 
<A NAME="Japan"><B>Japan:</B></A> 
"The continued suspension of nuclear tests by the United
States, Russia, the United Kingdom and France is testimony of
their commitment to the comprehensive ban on nuclear testing."
(Mr Yohei Kono, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign
Affairs, April 18, 1995)

<p> 
<A NAME="Malaysia"><B>Malaysia:</B></A>
 "Pending the conclusion of [a CTBT] the nuclear-
weapon States which had instituted a moratorium on testing should
maintain it and resist the temptation of resuming testing. 
Malaysia urged the nuclear-weapon State which did not as yet
observe the moratorium to join in the voluntary restraint so as
to create an atmosphere conducive to successful negotiations of
that instrument." (Mr Agam,  26 April 1995, NPT/CONF.1995/SR.5)

<p> 
<A NAME="New Zealand"><B>New Zealand:</B></A>
  "every effort must be made to conclude the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty this year....In discussing this key
issue, I feel bound to express my concern that there is one
nuclear-weapon state which continues to test, and another which
is contemplating the resumption of testing....I call on both
[China and France] not to do anything which would jeopardise the
early conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty." (Hon. Doug
Graham, Minister of Disarmament and Arms Control, 20 April 1995)
Speaking on behalf of the European Union at the opening of the
NPT Conference , then Foreign Minister Alain Juppe called for a
comprehensive test ban treaty to be concluded 'without delay'. 
However, during the NPT Review and Extension Conference France
opposed calls for a timetable for nuclear disarmament, including
conclusion of a CTBT this year.

<p> 
<A NAME="Nigeria"><B>Nigeria</B></A> 
voiced concern: "Even the relative progress so far
recorded in the Conference on Disarmament on a Comprehensive
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is tentative and not irreversible." (H.E.
Chief Tom Ikimi, Minister of Foreign Affairs, 18 April 1995)

<p> 
<A NAME="Russia"><B>Russia:</B></A>
 "The Russian Federation was in favour of singing it [the
CTBT] in 1995.  It was continuing to adhere to its moratorium on
nuclear tests, which had been repeatedly extended. (Minister of
Foreign Affairs Kozyrev, 24 April 1995, NPT/CONF.1995/SR.11))

<p> 
<A NAME="Slovakia"><B>Slovakia:</B></A>
 "His delegation supported the early drafting,
conclusion and entry into froce of a treaty ending all nuclear
explosions once and for all, without any exception and considered
observance of the nuclear test-ban moratorium to be an important
element in the preparation of that text." (Mr Shenk, 26 April,
1995, NPT/CONF.1995/SR.5)

<p> 
<A NAME="Solomon Islands"><B>Solomon Islands:</B></A>
 "Eighty percent of our population use seawater
to flavour their food...  Our major industry and food source is
fishing....If our seas are poisoned, gone is our most bountiful
source of food and the salt which we use to flavour our food. 
Therefore we must be concerned about French testing in Moruroa
and the very possibility of nuclear wars or explosions anywhere
in the world.  There is nothing short of the total and final
elimination of all nuclear weapons for all time which will
satisfy us that this nightmare will not one day happen.... the
failure of the nuclear weapons states to agree even on a draft
of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by the opening of this
conference is deeply disturbing.  It has given rise to concern
that -- after this conference adjourns -- they may turn their
backs on their obligation to ban all nuclear explosions for all
times.  Instead they might agree to what will really be a low-
yield threshold treaty, allowing sizeable explosions, which would
permit further development of nuclear weapons and would spur
rather than inhibit proliferation.  Nuclear weapons were tested
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Why are more tests needed? ... The
parties should commit to prompt completion of a multilateral and
truly comprehensive test ban treaty that bans all explosions for
all time, without the loopholes sought by some nuclear weapon
states." (Ambassador Rex Horoi, Permament Representative to the
United Nations, 24 April 1995)

<p>
<A NAME="Sweden"><B>Sweden</B></A>
stated: "We urge all States... to ensure the early
conclusion of a treaty.  There are no longer any technical
obstacles to verify a test ban treaty.  What is needed now is
political will.  It is of vital importance to reach agreement on
a treaty text before the end of this year.  We appreciate the
nuclear test moratorium presently upheld by all but one of the
nuclear-weapon States.  We expect this moratorium to continue
until it can be replaced by an international treaty banning
nuclear tests for ever." (Mr Jan Eliasson, Permanent Under-
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, April 20, 1995)

<p> 
<A NAME="Switzerland"><B>Switzerland:</B></A> 
"Switzerland was disheartened by the lack of
progress achieved to date [at the CTBT talks] and considered that
the idea of providing exceptions to the general prohibition was
incompatible with the spirit of Article VI.  Whatever the motives
and arrangements for such exceptions, it would leave lingering
doubts over the will to ensure that nuclear tests would never
again take place. (Mr Mayor, 20 April, 1995 NPT/CONF.1995/SR.7)

<p> 
<A NAME="Uganda"><B>Uganda:</B></A>
 "Recalling that the extension of the [Non-Proliferation]
Treaty had been explicitly linked to progress towards the
conclusion of a comprehenisve test-ban treaty, he called for the
urgent conclusion of that treaty as a short-term goal." (Mr
Kamunawire, April 25, 1995 NPT/CONF./.1995/SR.13)

<p> 
<A NAME="UNSEC"><B>U.N. Secretary General </B></A>
Boutros Boutros-Ghali  (Inaugral speech
at the NPT Review and Extension Conference, 17 April 1995):
"Progress is being made at the Conference on Disarmament toward
a Comprehensve Test Ban Treaty.  I urge the negotiating parties
to take into account the desire of the international community
for an early conclusion of the Treaty....  The most safe, sure
and swift way to deal with the threat of nuclear arms is to do
away with them in every regard.  This should be our vision of the
future.  No more testing.  No more production.  No more sales or
transfers.  Reduction and destruction of all nuclear weapons and
the means to make them should be humanity's great common cause."

<P><a name="Argentina">Argentina</A>
<P>*  Vicente Berasategui, Director of the European Area of the
Argentinean Foreign Ministry, had an interview with the
French Ambassador in Argentina, Renaud Vignal (June 22).
Berasategui expressed to him the "big concern" of the
government about the future FNTs.
 
<P><a name="Australia">Australia</A>
<P>* Branded the resumption of testing at the French Polynesian
atoll of Mururoa as "unnecessary, a provocative, dangerous....
indefensible decision". Foreign Minister,  Gareth Evans [AFP,
10/07/95].
<P>*  Gareth Evans, the Foreign Minister, on a visit to Jordan,
condemned France's decision to resume tests and urged the
international community to pressure Paris to change its mind.
"I think if the international pressure is maintained, not just
from our part of the world, but from all around the world, then
there would be something that they would just have to seriously
consider," Mr Evans said. "The  Cold War is over. It is time to
be looking forward constructively."  UK,  Daily Telegraph,  15th
July 1995.
 
<P><a name="Austria">Austria</A>
<P>* On July 11th the Austrian Government officially protested
against the tests and announced that they would repeat the
protest in "the relevant international political fora".
 
<P><a name="Belgium">Belgium</A>
<P>* "Belgium is deeply disappointed with the French decision,
because this decision is opposite to the spirit of the NPT. 
French decision may compromise the solidarity shown during the
signing of the treaty",  Press release from the Belgium Ministry
for Foreign Affairs,  14th June 1995.
 
<P><a name="Brazil">Brazil</A>
<P>*  To be confirmed,  however,  French ambassador has been
summoned to the Brazilian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to receive
a note from the Government which regrets the resumption of
testing.
 
<P><a name="Canada">Canada</A>
<P>*  Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet said in June that the
resumption of nuclear testing is " absolutely against the
interest of world security" and could encourage the proliferation
of nuclear arms. [Business Information Wire,  10th July 1995].
 
<P><a name="Chile">Chile</A> 
<P>*  Chile sent only second-tier officials to the festivities
[Bastille day] to show its displeasure over plans to resume
tests, foreign minister Jose Miguel Insulza said.
<P>     Instead of going himself, the minister sent his number two
and chief of protocol to the embassy.
<P>     Insulza said he had also asked the French government for
information on the possible impact of its nuclear testing on
Chilean-held Easter Island, which lies in the South Pacific.
<P>     Chile, with a long South Pacific coast, earlier called on
France to reconsider its plans to begin nuclear testing in
September in the Mururoa atoll in French Polynesia. [Reuter, July
14th].
 
<P><a name="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</A>
<P>*  Former Czechoslovak foreign minister Jiri Dienstbier, one of
the country's most popular political figures, and two retired
army generals signed a petition calling upon the French
government not to resume testing in the Pacific at a
demonstration outside the French Embassy. "I doubt I'll be
invited back to the French Embassy again but I have to make a
stand," said retired General Antonin Spacek [Reuter 14th July
1995].
 
<P>A name="Denmark">Denmark</a>
<P>* The Foreign Ministry Announces:  In Response to the French
President's Decision to end the temporary moratorium, the Foreign
Minister States: It is with surprise and sincere regret that I
learn that the President of France, Jacques Chirac, today has
decided to carry out 8 nuclear tests. [Danish Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Press Release, June 13, 1995].
 
<P><a name="Fiji">Fiji</A>
<P>*  Fijian Foreign Minister Filipe Bole said he will stay away
from festivities planned by French ambassador Jacques Costilhes
in Suva. [ AFP. July 13 1995]
 
<P><a name="Finland">Finland</A>
<P>*  "Finland regrets the decision of France to continue nuclear
testing between September 1995 and May 1996'said minister
Halonen" [The Finnish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ms. Tarja
Halonen,  13th June 1995, Helsingin Sanomat].
 
<P><a name="France">France</A>
<P>* "I repeat the time had come to put an end to the nuclear
armaments race," the ex-president said in the interview with the
weekly news magazine L'Express released last Tuesday.  [Reuter, 
July 4th 1995].
<P>*  A poll by the German Forsa institute published in weekly
newspaper Die Woche found that 95 percent of Germans  oppose the
French tests.      It said 60 percent of French people were
opposed to the tests and only 24 percent in favour. Half of
French people were prepared for France's nuclear power to be
placed under European control. [reuter 19th July 1995]
 
<P><a name="Germany">Germany</A>
<P>*  "Such tests are not in line with the German government's
political ideas",   Helmut Schaefer,  minister of state for the
German foreign office,  [AFP,  10/07/95].
<P>*  The general secretary of the Free Democrats, members of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, told the French ambassador
in a letter that "France's isolated decision to resume nuclear
tests undermines worldwide efforts to disarm nuclear weapons."
[Reuter 14th July 1995].
<P>*  500 German and other scientists published an appeal to Chirac
to stop the tests. They said they were "horrified and dejected"
by the plans, which "mirror the behaviour of the Cold War
period."
<P>   Signers of the letter included Carl Friedrich von Weizsaecker,
who worked on the fledgling Nazi atomic bomb project and has
become a leading critic of nuclear weapons. The letter echoed a
1957 vow by German scientists never to work on an atomic bomb.
[AP 15th July 1995].
<P>*  Germany,  previously silent on the issue due to its close
neighbourly ties with France, also chose this occasion to express

<p>
<p> 
 
<B>1972:</B> David McTaggart and crew sail to Moruroa from New Zealand
on his yacht Vega/Greenpeace III in protest at continued
atmospheric testing a decade after the PTBT was signed. They are
rammed by French warships, seized and impounded to Moruroa.
<p> 
<B>1973:</B> A peace fleet sails from New Zealand to Moruroa including
Fri, Spirit of Peace, and Vega. Fri is boarded and impounded at
Moruroa.
<p>
<B>1974:</B> France announces it will move its nuclear tests underground
<p> 
<B>1981:</B> Vega sails to Moruroa and protests underground tests. The
crew includes future French Environment Minister Brice Lalonde
and skipper David McTaggart.
<p> 
<B>1982:</B> Vega returns to protest at Moruroa.
<p> 
<B>1985:</B> The Rainbow Warrior is bombed by French secret agents in
New Zealand as she prepares to set sail for Moruroa to protest,
killing photographer Fernando Pereira. In response a large peace
flotilla sails from New Zealand to join Vega and MV Greenpeace
to continue the protest at Moruroa.
<p> 
<B>1989:</B> Greenpeace lobbies the European Parliament for a
resolution calling for an independent health and scientific study
of French testing in the South Pacific.  The resolution is
defeated narrowly after heavy pressure from the French
government.  However, the European Commission agrees to 'maintain
an interest' in the issue.
<p>
<B>1990:</B> Greenpeace publishes a new scientific report postulating
that the radioactive material cesium 134, found at Moruroa by
French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, showed leakage from
underground tests maay already be occuring.
<p>
<B>1990:</B> The MV Greenpeace enters the Soviet test site of Novaya
Zemlya in protest at Soviet plans to test at the Arctic island
site.  Four Greenpeace crew members are arrested on the test site
after taking samples revelaing high levels of radiation.
<p>
<B>1990:</B>  Four British women enter the US Nevada test site as part
of a Greenpeace action, and postpone the British test scheduled
there for several hours.
<p>
<B>1990-1991:</B> The new Rainbow Warrior sails on its first 
expedition to Moruroa with a scientific team on board to test for
radioactive leakage. The scientific team is arrested and deported
as it attempts to take samples at the 12 mile military exclusion
zone.
<p>
<B>1991:</B> Greenpeace organises thousands of international anti-
nuclear testing activists at a gathering on the Nevada test site 
on the eve of the Partial Test Ban Amendment Treaty Conference.
<p>
<B>1991:</B> France signs the NPT
<p>
<B>1991:</B> President Gorbachev announces a moratorium on nuclear
testing by the Soviet Union.
<p> 
<B>1992:</B> The new Rainbow Warrior returns to Moruroa with an expanded
scientific team and attempts to set up a "Pacific Peace Base" to
monitor the tests and prevent the 1992 test series. After a 90
minute high speed chase the ship and 5 inflatables are seized by
commandos within half a mile of Moruroa lagoon. The scientific
team are deported and the ship impounded at Moruroa for two days
before being released. The ship is also barred from entering
Tahiti.
<p> 
<B>1992:</B> Ten days after the Rainbow Warrior leaves Moruroa,
President Mitterand announces that France will join the Russian
nuclear testing moratorium.
<p>
<B>1992:</B> Greenpeace USA joins other groups in lobbying for a
moratorium on US nuclear tests.  In September 1992, the US
moratorium is instituted.
<p> 
<B>1995:</B> The NPT is extended indefinitely. Three days after the NPT
conference ends, China tests its 42nd nuclear bomb. The world
watches new French president Chirac to see if France will break
the moratorium and resume testing or not...

<title>Effects of Nuclear Testing at Moruroa and Fangataufa</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>

<H2>THE EFFECTS OF NUCLEAR TESTING AT MORUROA AND FANGATAUFA</H2>
<p>
The 180 or so atmospheric and underground tests at Moruroa and
Fangatauf atolls have dispersed in the environment or created
crude waste dumps underground of hundreds of kilograms of
plutonium and other highly radioactive fission products.  To say
that French nuclear tests pose no problem to the environment is
from an ecological point of view to affirm two things:
<p>
<ul>
<li> that there has never been environmental contamination at
Moruroa and Fangataufa
<li> that the radioactive material present at these atolls is
confined in such a way that no release into the environment will
occur over the thousands of years to come.
</ul>
<p>
These two claims are obviously false:
<p>
atmospheric tests released into the air and ocean most of the
radioactivity they produced.  This radioactive contamination was
measurable throughout the southern hemisphere.  It contributed,
along with American, Russian, British and Chinese tests to an
increase in cancers and radiation-induced birth and genetic
defects.  The victims of this "third world war" are more numerous
than those of Chernobyl, which is considered the largest
industrial catastrophe in history.
<p>
Moreover, French tests, whether in the atmosphere or underground,
have left enormous quantities of wastes at the test site:
contaminated earth, waste from decontamination of equipment,
contaminated clothes etc.  There is no official acknowlegement of
the storage, transfer or eventual clean-up of these thousands of
tonnes of waste.
<p>
<H3>Other examples of environmental consequences include:</H3>
<p>
On July 25 1979, an explosion created serious fractures in the
side of the atoll ( which were partially filmed by the Cousteau
Mission) and a subsequent tidal wave engulfed installations.
<p>
In spring 1981, cyclones removed radioactive waste covering a
zone of 30,000 square metres in the northern part of Moruroa
atoll.
<p>
In 1992, the French Government, wanting to contradict a study
undertaken by Greenpeace (the Buske Report) requested the
International Atomic Energy Agency undertake a study of plankton
sampled 12 miles from Moruroa atoll. The study revealed
contamination by plutonium which could only have come from a
radioactive source, whether it resulted from fissuring of the
atoll, dumping of waste in the zone.  No official explanation was
given.
<p>
Restrictions prevent long stays on Fangataufa atoll where larger
tests have been conducted since 1988 because of earlier
contamination from atmospheric tests.  Cousteau's report in 1987
concluded: " The premature and accelerated ageing of the
[Moruroa] atoll explains certainly in great part the imminent
transfer of high yield tests to Fangataufa."
<p>
More generally, the disastrous consequences for the environment
of nuclear weapons production has been largely recognised by the
United States and Russia.  An official estimate by the United
States puts the costs of stabilising the environmental problems
at nuclear weapons production sites at $240 billion over the next
30 years.
<p>
Claims that radiation from underground tests will be confined
within the atoll in the long term are simply not credible.
<p>
In 1987 ... volcanic rock at Moruroa and the depth necessary to
do the tests in a wayto enable us to calculate the exact
mechanical impact of nuclear tests were not supplied by the
French authorities.
<p>
The process of vitrification of wastes in the atoll's basalt
structure is far from being as simply as CEA experts claim.
Vitrification is difficult to master even in an industrial
environment, and completely unpredictable under testing
conditions.  Chimneys and fractures allowing water to permeate
into the atoll have been created. The evidence suggests that
shocks caused by successive explosions have created an additional
problem in confining the radioactive materials.
<p>
A simple comparison with the research required for the storage of
high level radioactive waste in France illustrates the
discrepancy in approach to safety between the two.  What would be
the reaction if nuclear waste was stored under the sea in a
region regularly impacted by very large explosions?
<p>
The French authorities have frequently pointed out the low
population density around the atolls of Moruroa and Fangataufa. 
It must be remembereed that several European countries, situated
two or three hundred miles from Chernobyl were seriously affected
by that disaster.  Ocean current can be extremely effective
carriers of radioactive contamination, and the accumulation of
radiation in the food chain would do irreparable damage to the
maritime resources of the coastal states of the Pacific.
<p>
With this evidence, the French Minister for the Environmnent,
Corinne Lepage and President Chirac cannot deny the effects of
nuclear tests on the environment of French Polynesia and
international waters.  Neither can the claims that tests are safe
coming from the military and nuclear industry be credible, given
the vested interests of these experts. Only a fully independent
and comprehensive study over several years which has full access
to all data currently "military secret", and which has
unrestricted opportunities to sample and monitor the atmospheric,
oceanic and terrestrial environments of Moruroa and Fangataufa
can hope to establish the real environmental consequences of
nuclear testing at the atolls.

<title>US Congress letter to Clinton</title>
</head>

<body>
<h3>A letter from US Congress Representatives to President Clinton,
expressing their concern about a resumption of French Nuclear
Testing. </h3>

<pre>

                  Congress of the United States
                    House of Representatives
                      Washington, DC 20515
 
                         June 13, 1995 
 
 
The Honorable William J. Clinton
President of the United States
The White House
Washington, D.C. 20500
 
Dear President Clinton,
 
     We are writing to raise our deep concern about the possible
resumption of nuclear testing by the Government of France in the
South Pacific and the possible impact on American citizens and
nationals who live in the Pacific.  In meeting with French
President Jacques Chirac on June 14 at the White House, we urge
you to seek assurances from him that France will continue its
current testing moratorium and support continued negotiations for
a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). 
 
     With over 100 nuclear bombs having been detonated in the
South Pacific, the people of the Pacific have gained a firsthand
appreciation of the hazards of nuclear weapons.  The renewal of
tests at the Moruroa test site will place the Pacific environment
at further risk of radioactive contamination.  We join leaders of
American Samoa, Guam and other Pacific communities in voicing our
strong opposition to the environmental threat that additional
testing poses.
 
     With the renewal of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT) last month, France and other nuclear weapons states gave a
solemn pledge to continue to exercise "utmost restraint" with
regard to nuclear testing.  A resumption of testing would
undermine the NPT and raise serious questions about France's
commitment to non-proliferation and disarmament.
     Your meeting with President Chirac is of particular
importance in light of the on-going CTBT discussions by the
United Nations Conference on Disarmament in Geneva and the G-7
meeting later this week in Halifax.
 
     As the world looks on, we ask that you reaffirm your
leadership on this issue and convince President Chirac that any
resumption of testing will be a step backward for non-
proliferation and have serious negative impacts on the
international non-proliferation regime.
 
Sincerely,

June 21, 1995</head>
<body> 
<p>The President
<br>The White House
<br>Washington, DC 20500<br>
 
<p>Dear Mr. President:
 
<P>     Your policy of forswearing nuclear weapons tests has brought
important results.  We urge you, in the strongest terms, not to
agree to demands from some within your Administration to conduct
additional tests or to change the U.S. negotiating strategy from
our current insistence on a truly comprehensive treaty to ban all
tests.
<P>         Not only have you provided strong political leadership to
counter proliferation around the globe, but you have also set a
powerful moral example to the other nuclear weapons states by
continuing the U.S. moratorium on all nuclear tests and by
pursuing a permanent ban on all tests, regardless of size. 
Through your concerted efforts, the U.S. secured extension of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and we are now closer to
completing a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty than we have been in
30 years.
<P>         You have the distinction of being the first U.S. President
since the dawn of the atomic age not to conduct a nuclear weapons
test.  You should continue that policy, especially since your own
scientific experts have concluded that additional nuclear tests
are not necessary to maintain the safety and reliability of the
U.S. arsenal.  Any weakening of the U.S. CTB negotiation position
to permit low-yield nuclear weapons tests would directly undercut
the NPT's disarmament provisions, jeopardize the trust the U.S.
has just engendered among non-aligned nations at the NPT
conference, and provide a loophole for countries wishing to
acquire nuclear weapons in the future.
<P>         Halting all nuclear testing now and for the future is in our
national interest.  We can still maintain a sufficient and strong
nuclear deterrent without nuclear tests, and retain the moral
authority needed to deter nuclear proliferation around the globe.
<P>         Again, we appeal to you to remain firm in your current
nuclear testing policy and press other nations to support it.
<P>         Thank you for your leadership on this important security
issue.
 
<P>    Sincerely,
<pre>

 <head>          <H4>The Environmental Impacts of Nuclear Testing 
                          at Moruroa Atoll </head>
</H4>
<P>INTRODUCTION
<body>
<P>The more than 180 atmospheric and underwater tests at Moruroa and
Fangataufa atolls have dispersed in the environment or created
crude nuclear waste dumps underground of hundreds of kilograms
of plutonium and other highly radioactive fission products. To
say that French nuclear tests pose no problem for the environment
is to argue that:<br>

<UL>* there has never been environmental contamination at Moruroa and
Fangataufa

* the radioactive material present at these atolls is confined
in such a way that no release into the environment will occur
over the thousands of years to come.</UL>
<P>These two claims are obviously false:
<UL>* atmospheric tests released into the air and ocean most of the
radioactivity they produced. This radioactive contamination was
measurable throughout the southern hemisphere. It contributed,
along with American, Russian, British and Chinese tests to an
increase in cancers and radiation-induced birth and genetic
defects. It is estimated that an extra 2 million fatal cancers
will result globally from atmospheric testing. The victims of
this "third world war" are more numerous than those of Chernobyl,
which is considered the largest industrial catastrophe in
history.</UL>
 
<P>* Moreover, French tests, whether in the atmosphere or
underwater, have left enormous quantities of wastes at the test
site:
<P> - contaminated earth, waste from decontamination of equipment,
contaminated clothes etc. There is no official acknowledgement
of the storage, transfer or eventual clean-up of these thousands
of tonnes of waste.

<P> - The interior of the atoll is effectively a vast, unregulated
high-level radioactive waste dump.
 
<P>CLAIMS THAT RADIOACTIVITY FROM UNDERGROUND TESTS ARE PERMANENTLY
CONFINED WITHIN THE ATOLLS IN THE LONG TERM ARE SIMPLY NOT
CREDIBLE.

<P>The Commisariat a l'Energie Atomique claims that through a
process of vitrification resulting from the heat of the test
explosion, radioactive material from the tests is completely
confined in the atoll's basalt structure.  However, vitrification
is difficult to master even in an industrial environment, and
completely unpredictable under testing conditions.  Chimneys and
fractures allowing water to permeate into the atoll have been
created. The evidence suggests that shocks caused by successive
explosions have created an additional problem in confining the
radioactive materials.
 
<P>A simple comparison with the research required for the storage
of high level radioactive waste in France illustrates the
discrepancy in approach to safety between the two.  What would
be the reaction if nuclear waste was stored under the sea in a
region regularly impacted by very large explosions?

<P>In terms of Moruroa's suitability as a long-term radioactive
storage site, the scientific missions that have been allowed very
limited access to Moruroa for exploratory investigations have
been united in their criticism, saying water-permeable coral
atolls are unsuitable sites for nuclear testing.

<P>* Commander Jacques-Yves Cousteau's 1987 mission noted: "Some
researchers believe that it is natural barriers that play the
most important role in the storage of nuclear waste. 
Consequently the storage site must meet very strict criteria.
One of the most important of these is the absence of water, and
especially of circulating water.  Whatever the circumstance, the
volanic stratum of an atoll, totally saturated with water, is the
worst choice!  Another important criterion is the absence of
factures.  But, in addition to the natural fractures affecting
the volcanic layer [at Moruroa], the explosions cause the
formation of a veritable network of fissures around the storate
site (the test chamber).  Their adsorption coeffiecient is much
less than that of vermiculites (micas) or of illites (clay). 
Moruroa is consequently a very poor site for storing nuclear
waste." (p.32, Cousteau Report)

<P>* Cousteau concluded nuclear testing had caused accelerated and
premature aging of the atoll.  "The tests conducted under the
lagoon still produce fissures and subsidences that affect the
external slope of the atoll.  The risk of collapse in the
southern zone is not excluded: in faact, very wide (one to two
metres) longitudinal faults penetrate the upper part of the outer
flank over some tens of metres...

<P>It is clear that the permeability of the volcanic layer is
locally increased by fractures caused by underground tests...The
premature and accelerated aging of the atoll certainly explains,
in large part, the imminent transfer of the large yield nuclear
tests to the atoll of Fangataufa..". (p. 36, Cousteau Report)

<P>* The Atkinson report noted: "Underground testing may be acting
to alter the ambient conditions, particularly along the north
east and south west margins, both areas of particularly severe
testing as indicated by fissuring, subsidence and submarine
sliding of the limestones.  Hydrological consequences of these
effects are increases in the vertical transfer rate of water and
the direct lateral exchange rate between ocean and atoll
interior...The French claim that any leakage from the volanics
into the limestone will be stopped by the impermeable transition
zone is not borne out by the data inspected... the claim that the
transition zone acts as a barrier to long-term leakage can, on
the basis of geologic evidence, be discounted.  The volcanics in
their virgin state offer a poort to moderate geo-chemical barrier
and a moderate to good hydrological barrier.  The testing
programme is reducing the effectiveness of both." (p.9, Atkinson
Report) 

<P>*  The Atkinson report concluded that the structural integrity
of Moruroa had been impaired by fissuring, subsidence and
submarine slides; that there was doubt about the ability of the
transition zone around each test blast to act as a barrier to
radioactivity migrating out of the atoll; and that the volcanic
core in which tests take place had been severely altered by the
tests.  "At the underground test sites, water is avilable for
leaching the radioactive material (which can be equated to
high-level waste).  Mechanisms exist for the transport of this
contaminated water to the biosphere at least in the long term."
(p. 11, Atkinson Report). The report defined the long term as
greater than 500 years; the half-life of plutonium is
24,000 years.
 
<P>THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES CLAIM THAT NO LEAKAGE FROM UNDERGROUND
TESTS HAS OCCURRED.

<P>In fact, the scientific missions which have been permitted access
to Moruroa, although only allowed to take a handful of sample,
have all detected the presence of artificial radioactivity either
in or around the test site.  This include radioactive iodine,
cesium 134, and plutonium in the lagoon and outside the 12 mile
exclusion zone.

<P>The Atkinson mission in 1984 noted: "About 20 Gbq
(Gigabequerels) of plutonium is transported annually to ocean
waters from the lagoon at Moruroa.  It was not possible to
determine the original source of sources of this plutonium....
the one positive result is consistent with there being a local
source of particulate plutonium before the storms of 1981.  The
lagoon is a possible source." (p. 143, Atkinson Report)

<P>* The French authorities themselves told the Atkinson team that
the sediments of the lagoon contained 10-20 kg of plutonium
(ingestion of one microgram can cause fatal cancer; 20 kilograms
of plutonium is sufficient to manufacture several nuclear
bombs).

<P>* The Cousteau mission found iodine 131 in 1987, which has a half
life of only eight days, and so must have resulted from a recent
test.  The report noted: "After having mentioned the
possibilities of a leak by a fissure which had propagated
from the cavity right to the surface, traversing the basalt then
the coral, of by the emplacement well which was more or less
impervious, authorities of the CEA provided us with an
explanation for the presence of this iodine. On 20 May, 1987,
during post-test monitoring drilling, caried out after a test,
an accidental leak occurred... we were assured of the quite
exceptional character of this type of accident. Despite the
plausible nature of the explanation... we have not been able to
verify its veracity directly."  (p. 21-22, Cousteau Report) 

<P>* The Cousteau mission also found Cesium-134 -- an artificial
radionuclde not present in atmospheric fallout -- and suggested
it might "be necessary to attribute the origin of the Cs-134 to
the underground tests".  The French authorities provided no
explanation of the presence of Cs-134 in the Cousteau samples,
but three years later suggested is was a typographical error in
the Cousteau report.  (p. 23, Cousteau Report)

<P>*  US scientist Norm Buske detected cesium 134 in plankton
samples taken outside the 12 mile zone during a Greenpeace
mission in 1990.

<P>* In 1992, the French Government, wanting to contradict Buske's
finding, requested the International Atomic Energy Agency
undertake a study of plankton sampled 12 miles from Moruroa
atoll. The study revealed contamination by plutonium which could
only have come from leakage due to fissuring of the atoll
or dumping of radioactive waste in the zone. No official
explanation was for the presence of plutonium at this sampling
station.
 
<P>Other examples of environmental consequences of the testing
programme include:
 
<P>* On July 25 1979, an explosion created serious fractures in the
side of the atoll (which were partially filmed by the Cousteau
Mission) and a subsequent tidal wave engulfed installations.
 
<P>* In spring 1981, cyclones removed radioactive waste covering a
zone of 30,000 square metres in the northern part of Moruroa
atoll.
<P>* Restrictions prevent long stays on Fangataufa atoll where
larger tests have been conducted since 1988 because of earlier
contamination from atmospheric tests. 

<P>The French authorities have frequently pointed out the low
population density around the atolls of Moruroa and Fangataufa.
It must be remembered that several European countries, situated
two or three hundred miles from Chernobyl were seriously affected
by that disaster, and radionuclides from the accident were
transported atmospherically around the globe. Ocean current are
extremely effecient carriers of radioactive contamination, and
the accumulation of radiation in the food chain would do
irreparable damage to the maritime resources of the
coastal states of the Pacific.
 
<P>With this evidence, the French Minister for the Environment,
Corinne Lepage and President Chirac cannot deny the effects of
nuclear tests on the environment of French Polynesia and
international waters. Neither can the claims that tests are safe
coming from the military and nuclear industry be credible, given
the vested interests of these experts. Only a fully independent
and comprehensive study over several years which has full access
to all data currently "military secret", and which has
unrestricted opportunities to sample and monitor the atmospheric,
oceanic and terrestrial environments of Moruroa and Fangataufa
can hope to establish the real environmental consequences of
nuclear testing at the atolls.

<head><H4>NUCLEAR TESTING  
FIFTY YEARS IS ENOUGH</H4></head><body>
 
<P>Since the first nuclear test at Alamagordo, New Mexico in July 1945, the five nuclear
weapons states, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France and China have
conducted 2,035 nuclear tests.   Every test, costing up to US$70 million each, has helped
to add new generations of weapons to arsenals of the nuclear states.   Even with the end
of the cold war, nuclear testing continues, a reminder that the nuclear arms race is not
over.    
<P>STOP ALL NUCLEAR TESTING NOW
 
<P>In November 1990, Russia declared a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing.  In April
1992, France also announced a moratorium on nuclear testing.  In the latter half of 1992,
the United States joined the moratorium, which also forced the United Kingdom to join (it
uses the US test site at Nevada).  Since 1992 China has been the only country conducting
nuclear tests.   
<P>However, in June 1995 the newly elected French President, Jacques Chirac, announced
that France would break the moratorium and begin a series of eight nuclear tests at
Moruroa atoll in the South Pacific starting in September.   Preparations for those tests are
now underway.   France is conducting these tests in order to develop new nuclear
weapons and retain a nuclear capability well into the next century. 
 
 
<HR>
<P>As with many facts about nuclear weapons, the details about nuclear testing have been
kept very secret by all five nuclear powers.   The following figures are based on known
public information.

<li>TOTAL       2,035 

</ul>   </pre>


<P><H4>ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH EFFECTS OF NUCLEAR TESTING</H4>  
<P>One of the most tragic examples of the dangers from nuclear testing is the legacy from
the "Bravo" Test on Bikini atoll in 1954.  The US military failed to warn and evacuate
people on nearby Pacific islands who were directly downwind of the radioactive fallout. 
Children played in the 'atomic snow' from the radioactive cloud which passed above
them, completely unaware of the dangers.  Since then the islanders have been relocated a
number of times because their homes are still contaminated.  They cannot eat local
produce.  People are still suffering from cancers and ill health from the radiation.  There
have been high rates of stillbirths, and what the islanders call 'jellyfish babies' which die
soon after birth because of the dreadful deformities resulting from exposure to radiation.  
No independent scientific team has been permitted to undertake a thorough investigation
of Moruroa, and no independent health assessment of the people of French Polynesia has
been permitted. However, brief investigations have revealed deep cracks and fissures and
evidence of subsidence on the atoll.  Moruroa is like a large water-permeable and
unregulated radioactive waste dump, and many scientists believe radioactivity is already
leaking into the lagoon and surrounding ocean.  As the atoll ages and suffers more blasts
from nuclear tests, it becomes even more vulnerable to leakage.  If Moruroa were to
fracture or break up, long-lasting, high-level radioactivity from over 120 nuclear tests
could leak or spill into the Pacific ocean causing incalculable and irreparable harm to the
marine environment and local health. 
 
<P>Extract from "Testimonies : Witnesses of French nuclear testing in the South Pacific"
 
<P>Toimata has four surviving children.  While her husband was working at Moruroa, she
had six other babies who died.  
"Our first and eldest child was born in 1975.  She always seems to be sick with a chronic
cough and stomach pains but she goes to school and is doing alright there.   My second
baby was born prematurely at seven and a half months and died the day he was born. 
My third baby was born at home at full term but died two weeks later.  She had a skin
problem.  Her skin would come off immediately if it was touched.   The doctors said that
the baby was fine but obviously she was not.  No one knows the cause of her condition.   
Eugene, my fourth baby, was born at full term but died when he was two months old. 
He had diarrhoea and we took him to Mamao, the hospital in Tahiti.  The diarrhoea
continued for some time.  When it stopped, it was replaced by another condition.  The
baby became rigid, like wood.  Every part of his body was racked by continuous
muscular contractions and he had a high temperature.  It was impossible to open his fists. 
The doctors would not talk about his condition.  He was a Mamao for two weeks and
then he died.  The doctors did not tell us anything and refused to fill out his death
certificate."  
 
<P>A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY 
 
<P>Negotiations for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to end all nuclear testing for
all time have been taking place for the past two years at the United Nations Conference
on Disarmament (UNCD) in Geneva. 
 
<P>Such a ban should include small explosions and other technologically advanced testing
programmes, and would:  
<P>1.  Pave the way for nuclear disarmament
Perfecting new weapons undermines Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations to
disarm (see below). Also a negotiated and verifiable CTBT would create a more stable
context for disarmament talks.
 
<P>2.  Reduce the risks to health and the environment Further accidents or leakage of
radioactive materials from testing would be stopped. 
 
<P>3.  Help stop nuclear proliferation
A CTBT would make it more difficult for non-nuclear states to develop a nuclear arsenal.

 
<P><H4>The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)</H4>
 
<P>The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) came into force in 1970. 
Under the terms of the Treaty, the nuclear weapons states agreed to eliminate their
nuclear weapons.  In return, the non-nuclear weapons states agreed not to manufacture or
acquire nuclear weapons.   At the time, stopping all nuclear testing through a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was seen as a key step to stopping and reversing the
arms race.    
<P>The final decision of the NPT Review and Extension Conference in New York in May
1995, stated that the nuclear weapons states should exercise the "utmost restraint" on
nuclear testing until a Comprehensive Test Ban was completed no later than 1996.  Both
France and China have clearly broken their pledge to exercise 'utmost restraint' : China
conducted a test just three days after the close of the NPT Conference, and France is now
planning a series of tests as intensive as any it conducted at the height of the cold war.  In
doing so they could jeopardise the whole future of the test ban talks.  
 
<P>Discussions have also been delayed by political disagreements and attempts to get round
the Treaty by developing other ways of producing new nuclear warheads using computer
simulations, much smaller nuclear explosions or tests referred to as hydronuclear
experiments.
 
<P>In addition to the five nuclear weapons states, there are also the nuclear arsenals of Israel,
India and Pakistan.  Israel is thought to have about 200 nuclear weapons, while the status
of the nuclear arsenals of India and Pakistan is unknown.   
As long as the five nuclear weapons states continue to develop more and newer nuclear
weapons, several other countries will squander their resources in attempts to join the
nuclear club.  
Nuclear testing is part of nuclear weapons production and proliferation.  Fifty years after
the dawn of the nuclear age, it is time to stop.

    AT MORUROA ATOLL, SOUTH PACIFIC.</h4>

<h4>SUMMARY</h4> 
<p>The  test  site used by the French at Moruroa Atoll in  the 
South Pacific consists of an extinct volcano overlaid by
limestones and dolomites  laid  down by corals. In addition  to 
atmospheric and safety tests which left the lagoon contaminated
with up to 20kg of plutonium,  123 underground tests have been
carried out  resulting in a substantial inventory of
radioactivity remaining underground.
 
<p>There  have long been concerns about the structural  integrity 
of the reef system, yet virtually no data have been released into
the public  domain.  Nor  have scientific  expeditions  been 
afforded enough time comprehensively to evaluate the problem.
 
<p>Modelling exercises have shown that there is potential for  radio
nuclides  to enter the wider environment through the 
hydrological processes taking place in the Atoll structure.  
 
<p>This  circulation and escape is likely to be facilitated   by 
the fissuring and fracturing caused by the tests themselves.
Consider able damage has been done to the structure of the atoll,
including the  displacement  of portions of the protective  upper 
limestone apron and subsidence of the upper layers.
 
<p>Escapes of short-lived radionuclides have been detected after 
two tests  monitored by expeditions of independent scientists in 
1983 and 1987  respectively. These were attributed to  an 
exceptional accident during valve decoupling whilst obtaining
samples from the blast cavern. This is, however, also evidence
of direct connection between the cavern and the upper, porous
layers of the geological structure. In addition, elevated levels
of plutonium isotopes have been found in oceanic waters in the
vicinity of the test site.
 
<p>Although limited, this evidence outlines the  necessity  for  a 
comprehensive  evaluation of the Atoll and its environs  prior 
to the resumption of any testing programme.
 
<p><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>Between  1966 and 1991, 175 nuclear test explosions  were 
carried out at Moruroa and Fangataufa Atolls  as part of the
French nuclear weapons testing programme. Both of these atolls
are part of the Tuamotu Archipelago located in French Polynesia.
Of the 175 tests, 44 were atmospheric and took place on the two
atolls between  1966 and 1974. After this tests were conducted
underground at the rate of  between four and eleven tests per
year. Of these 8  were conducted at Fangataufa and the remaining
123 at Moruroa. The  yields of  these  explosions have never been
officially released  by  the French Authorities, but are
estimated on the basis of New  Zealand and Swedish seismic
studies to be around 2500 kilotons TNT equivalent.  There is some
discrepancy in the numbers of tests  reported by different
authorities since some may not have been reported  by the French.
 
<p>The  tests are conducted by boring a shaft into the  basalt 
rocks which  form  the  base of the atoll structure,  and 
lowering the device  together with testing equipment into the 
borehole.  After backfilling with drilling debris, the device is
detonated.  Subsequently,  a second shaft is opened into the
cavity formed by the explosion to supplement measurements made
in the first few  milliseconds of the explosion.
 
<p>The  shafts drilled range in depths from 500-1200 metres into 
the basalt core. Initially, shafts were drilled into the outer
rim of the  lagoon,  but since 1981 higher yield tests  were 
shifted to shafts  drilled  under  the central lagoon. In  1986 
all  testing activity was shifted to the central zone. 
 
<p>The flow of information concerning the outcomes of these tests 
in all respects has been tightly controlled by the French 
establishment.  There  have  been very few  opportunities  for 
independent scientists  to scrutinise operations or to conduct
surveys of the area  in  question. Although  four surveys have 
been  allowed by scientific  researchers independent of the
French military, these have  been highly restricted. Periods of
three to five  days  have been allowed and activities restricted
to certain sample types and tightly specified areas of the
lagoon.  
  
<p>There is no doubt that any evaluation of the impacts of the under
ground tests is confounded by the residues of radioactive
materials  remaining from the atmospheric testing. Certain of the 
above ground  tests  were  "safety tests". As a result  of  these 
tests together with accidents and the storage of radioactively 
contaminated  artifacts in a 30,000 square metre area on the
North Coast of the Atoll, around 20 kg of plutonium-239 are now
thought to be present  in the sediments of the lagoon itself.
This is  estimated to  result in the transfer of around 20
Gigabecquerels of Pu-239 into oceanic waters annually [1].
 
<p>Inevitably, concerns have been raised about the possibility of
the radionuclides  produced  in  the underground  tests  reaching 
the environment. The effects of the testing programme on the
structure of  the reef system are an area of particular concern.
These  concerns have been heightened by the reporting of the
results of the Atkinson  and Cousteau Foundation visits in 1983
and 1987  respectively. The possibility that further tests may
be conducted by the French  authorities commencing in September
1995 is  taking  place against a background of an informational 
vacuum. These  notes, therefore,  outline the concerns in
relation to the  environmental safety  of the proposed tests, in
turn a function both of lack  of information  available  for
independent scrutiny and the limited data  available  on the
structure and integrity of the reef. The limited  source 
references from which such information can  be drawn are given.
Discussion is limited to Moruroa Atoll, since the best quality
information is limited to this site.

<p>It  must be emphasised that the French authorities will have 
conducted  a large number of measurements on the tests and  upon 
the lagoon itself. To date very few of these data have been
published. According to reference [5], the Service Mixte de
Securite Radiologique in France established a monitoring network
consisting of  50 sampling  stations which were sampled at the
surface and near  the bottom  of  the lagoon from 1979 until
1986. These data  have  not been presented for independent
scrutiny. In June 1990, 18  samples of  1000l of seawater were
collected from sites within the  lagoon by  the SMSR following
the Cousteau expedition. Some samples  have been  subject to
intercalibration exercises under the auspices  of the  IAEA  [6
& 7]. It is not known what other  environmental  matrices  have 
been  monitored, nor what the results  of  any  such monitoring 
revealed. Currently, 10 monitoring stations appear  to be in use,
covering the whole lagoon [5]. 
 
<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
 
<p>The Moruroa test site has not been subject to any thorough
assessment by independent scientists for environmental impacts
resulting from testing. The limited surveys conducted in 1983 and
1987  took place  over a period of three to five days with
limited access  to the site. Monitoring data collected by the
French Authorities  has not  been  formally published or made 
available  for  independent scrutiny.  No official figure has
been published for the yield  of the devices tested and these
have been estimated from New  Zealand and Swedish seismic data.
There is, therefore, a need:
 
<p>1)  to  release data on the type and yield of the  devices 
tested together  with the inventory of radionuclides likely to
have  been formed;


<p>2)  to carry out an independent evaluation of monitoring data 
and examination of the protocols used;
 
<p>3) to carry out an independent evaluation of the current
condition of the test site.
 
 
<p>POINT
 
<li>There has been no robust  environmental assessment carried out 
at the Moruroa test site. Few of the data presumably gathered by 
the French Authorities have been made available for independent 
scrutiny.
  
<p><h4>DESCRIPTION OF SITE</h4>
 
<p>There is some information available about the structure of
Moruroa Atoll which has been published in the open scientific 
literature. Some of this is presented in Refs [2 & 3].
Essentially, the island is of volcanic origin, modified by the
activities of reef building organisms. It is 25 Kilometres long
across the east-west axis  and 9  kilometres  at  the widest
point on the  north-south  axis.  An opening through the reef,
about 5 kilometres wide, gives access to the lagoon on the
north-west coast of the atoll. The crown of  the reef is around
65km in extent.
 
<p>Boreholes  drilled into the atoll have shown a  layered 
structure typical of other atolls. The Moruroa structure is
relatively  well investigated in relation to other reefs and the
results from  five drillings  have been reproduced in reference
[3].  The  depths  of the  various  layers  making  up the 
structure  are  not  uniform throughout  and consist of:
 
<l>1)  A top layer of limestone extending to a depth of between 
130-200m in depth.</l> 
<l>2) A layer of dolomite extending to between 260 and 420m in
depth.</l>
 
<l>3)  A  transition zone of montmorillonitic  and  kaolinitic 
clays overlain by calcareous rocks extending to between 350 and
450m  in depth.</l>
 
<L>4) Underlying the transition layer is a layer derived from 
aerial volcanic activity extending to about 550m</l>
 
<l>5) A basalt layer produced by submarine volcanic activity 
extending to the depth of the boreholes drilled.</l>
 
<p>In  essence  this structure has developed since the  cessation 
of volcanic activity 8-9 million years ago. The reef building
activity  has  taken place as the island structure  has 
gradually  sunk below sea level. Hence the geology also varies
depending upon  the relative times that the base materials became
submerged.
 
<p>Hence, the structure is heterogenous and the layers that comprise
it  are  also  heterogenous. The picture is  also  complicated 
by periods when sea-levels fell and the limestone strata were 
eroded to  produce large dissolution cavities and faults. Given
the  complex  nature  of the geological structures it is not 
possible  to derive a general model of the internal geology nor
of the hydrology.  Water  movements  and circulation within  the 
structure  are inevitable. The porosity coefficient ranges
between 10-30% in  the various levels of the coral platform.
 
<p>The  zone of aerial volcanism also contains material with  a 
high porosity  ranging from 6-30%. This is due to the
heterogeneity  of its  composite materials. Finally, the zone of
materials  produced by  submarine volcanic activity are fissured
and  splintered  with complex  dykes cut vertically into the
structure. The porosity  of this is estimated as having a
coefficient of 6%.
 
<p>Significantly,  Reference  [8]  notes that the  variation  in 
the thickness  and the composition of the transition zone casts 
doubt upon  its ability to act either as a barrier to the 
migration  of radionuclides  formed  in  the weapons tests, or 
to  cushion  and channel the seismic energy due to the nuclear
explosion.
 
<p>Studies  of  water movements through the structure of  the 
lagoon have  shown rapid lateral exchanges between the sea water
and  the water held in the interstices of the rock. Vertical
migration  has been set at 90m per year in the first 450m of this
structure based upon  empirical data [see: 3]. A useful overview
of the  hydrology of the Atoll was produced in 1986 by New
Zealand workers [4]. This led  them  to conclude that in its
natural state the Atoll  is  as "leaky as a sieve". Moreover,
they also point out that the thermal energy  from nuclear
detonations will also force circulation  patterns tending to
accelerate the movement of radionuclides upwards. On  the 
further assumption that the  nuclear tests  had  produced
considerable  fracturing  of the atoll structure,  the 
conclusion reached was that radionuclides generated by the tests
could  begin to leak into the lagoon within 10-100 years. The
porous nature  of the  dolomite layer would encourage the flow
of  seawater  through the  structure into the lagoon. This,
itself is flushed  by  water movements,  and an estimated flux
of 100 million cubic  metres  of water  through the opening in
the reef crown takes place daily. 
 
<p>Atoll  water  relationships are known to be  hugely  complex 
from studies on other atolls [2]. Water circulation through the
highly porous  structure has been highlighted by work on other
reef  systems  [12]  while  information on the high  porosity 
of  Moruroa, indicating  many  fractures  within the basement 
is  provided  in Reference [13].
 
 
<p><h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
 
 
<p>The  structure of the atoll is geologically complex consisting 
of various strata all of which are porous to some degree. Even
if  it is  assumed that no fracturing has taken place as a result
of  the testing,  the natural porosity of the rock is conducive 
to  water movement and hence to the mobilisation of radionuclides
which  can be introduced into it. There is a need, therefore, to
establish:
 
<p>1) A comprehensive evaluation of the hydrology of the reef
system.
 
<p>2)  Empirical determination of radionuclide movements through 
the porous strata.
 
<p>Movement of water through the structure of the Atoll will also 
be affected  by  any  fracturing of the structure due  to  the 
tests themselves  which could markedly affect the movement of 
materials through the structure by considerably increasing the
porosity.  In reference  [3] it is noted that the cavity,
fractures  and  interstices  should  fill with interstitial water
after a few  days,  a point  also made in References [4 & 9],
since they are  below  and are themselves in a water saturated
zone.
 
 
<p>POINT
 
<li>The  Atoll  is  composed of several varied  layers  of 
geological material.  None  of these layers are themselves 
homogeneous.  The limestone  layers  have a high porosity and
both the  porosity  of these layers and the underlying volcanic
strata will be  increased by fissuring. The transition layer does
not appear to be a barrier to the migration of radionuclides from
the test chambers.
  
 
<p><h4>EVIDENCE OF FRACTURING AND DAMAGE TO THE ATOLL.</h4>
  
<p>The detonation of a nuclear device in the basaltic rocks 
produces temperatures  of  100,000  degrees Celsius and  gas 
pressures  of around  1Mbar.  This  causes rocks in the 
immediate  vicinity  to vaporise,  and  those further away to
melt. The end result  is  to produce  a  cavity whose size is
dependent upon the yield  of  the device. Rocks around the cavity
will be fractured by the blast and the  roof of the cavity
collapses to create a "chimney"  [9].  The subsidence  chimney 
is heaped with very coarse elements  [Ref  3] with large spaces
between them. As an example, based upon US data, with  a 50kt
yield, a cavity of 37 metres radius, with  a  chimney height of
148m will be formed. The fracture zone radius is  likely to be
266m  in radius (Ref 3].
 

<p>Damage  to  the limestone layer is particularly  well 
documented, that to the volcanic layers less so. Fracturing and
damage to  the structure  of the Atoll was first  reported by the 
1983  Atkinson expedition  [8].  They noted that the structure
of  the  limestone forming  the  upper  part of the atoll was 
altered  by  fissuring subsidence  and underwater slides.
Moreover, they stated that  the volcanic rocks in which the
blasts have taken place must have been severely modified  in the
zones surrounding the cavities formed.
 
<p>The full impacts appear to be severe. Reference [8] reports
subsidences of over a metre in areas of the Atoll affected by 
testing. 
As pointed out in Reference [1], fissures are propagated by 
testing, a result of cumulative compacting of the limestone. This
will serve to increase the lateral and vertical water transport
in  the carbonate  areas of the Atoll. The scope and scale of the 
problem are  not known. No data have been placed in the public
domain  for independent scrutiny concerning the depth and
relative positioning of the test shafts. It is, therefore not
known, to what extent the various fracture zones may have
interacted with each other, and to what  extent the integrity of
the reef as a whole is  compromised. The lack of data, and the
impossibility of evaluating the integrity  of the volcanic rocks
was the subject of numerous  remarks  in Reference [8]. The
methods of siting the shots as given in  Reference [3]. The
siting is calculated such that the thickness of  the sound 
volcanic  rock is equal to twice the radius of  the  cavity
produced. This needs clarification. 

<p>Reference  [3]  notes  that observations were made  on  SCUBA 
and submarine  dives to 50 and 230m respectively. These took
place  on the external slope of the Atoll in Zone "Zoe" in the
South of  the Atoll.   This area had been the location of a large
slide  of  the external submerged part of the Atoll following the
detonation of a 120kt  device  which became stuck in the shaft
in  the  limestone.  The slide mobilised around a million cubic
metres of rock,  creating  a  tsunami like tidal wave. Internally
in the  Atoll,   Taken together, Reference [4] considers that
these events must have been accompanied  by  deep fracturing.
Reference [1]  suggests  that  a cavern  140m in diameter was
formed. On the basis of the  formulae presented  in reference [3]
this implies a fracture zone almost  a kilometre  in  radius.
This would extend to the periphery  of  the reef and to the
surface.  Observations during the diving programme found that
both new and old fissures were apparent, and that there was 
evidence that at the time of observation, recent  rock  falls and
cracks of recent origin were present, showing that tests under
the lagoon, rather than at the periphery of the reef were 
capable of  causing  disintegration of the limestone crown  and 
had  been doing  so. Report [8] noted that slippage of the 
outermost  limestone  apron layer would effectively strip the
Atoll of its  water protective skin.
 
<p>Both Reports [3 & 8] draw attention to the possible poor
condition of  the volcanic rocks surrounding the chambers but
note  that  it was not possible to observe this directly. Both
note that fracture zone overlap may have occurred. This creates
the possibility  that the  test  chambers could be directly
exposed to moving  water  as well as weakening the atoll
structure.
 
<p>The  potential role of the secondary sampling bore made after 
the explosion is considered below.
 
 
<p><h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
 
 
<p>The  nuclear tests can be expected to have caused widespread 
fissuring and fracturing of the base rock and the limestone 
overlay. Both  the  Atkinson  and the Cousteau  report  document 
extensive damage  to  the  Atoll structure, although both  note 
that  while damage  to  the volcanic rocks may be serious it can
only  be  inferred.  In  places, the outer limestone layers have 
slipped  and will  have increased the permeability of the atoll
and exposed  it to  erosive action by the sea. In other areas,
the  limestone  has subsided  by  over a metre. Fissuring will 
increase  the  overall permeability of the reef and also
facilitate the escape of  radio nuclides from the cavities
produced by the tests.
 
 
<p>POINT
 
<li>Evidence  exists of extensive cracking and fissuring of  the 
reef which  will  increase the likelihood of radionuclides  from 
tests entering the wider environment.
 
 
<p><h4>EVIDENCE OF RADIOACTIVE ESCAPES</h4>
 
 
<p>The  detonation  of a nuclear device results in  the  emission 
of radionuclides  with a variety of properties. Some such as 
tritium and  isotopes of iodine are relatively volatile, Others, 
such  as caesium isotopes are soluble. Other isotopes will be 
incorporated into  the  vitrified rock formed on cooling after 
the  explosion.  Although  this is a glassy substance, it will
be cracked and  subject  to leaching at an unknown rate.
Reference 3 states that  the average  activity of the reformed
rocks is around 1.3  microcuries per  gram. The precise
radioactive inventory will depend upon  the yield  and the type
of the device. As an approximation,  Reference [3]  suggests that
the activities of Strontium-90 and of  Caesium-137  produced  in
the detonations are 260,000 and  650,000  Curies respectively.
 
<p>There are several anomalous findings of radioactivity in the
Atoll environment. Some of these have been subsequently confirmed
by the French  Authorities although the release of I-131 and 
Cs-136  was admitted only after what was described as a very
unusual  incident involving the decoupling of valves at the head
of the test shaft.
 
<p>Despite the limited time and logistic resources available to 
both the  Atkinson  and Cousteau expeditions, both  found 
evidence  of radioactive  leakage.  The Atkinson group were
authorised  by  the French  Authorities  to conduct a single 
experiment.  They  found levels of tritium at 500Bq/cubic metre
in the interstitial air  of the  surface terrain soil as against
an expected concentration  of 0.2 Bq/cubic metre. Two
explanations were furnished in the  report [8];  either venting
of gaseous tritium from underground  cavities or a faster
groundwater flow rate than admitted. It was noted that "volatile
and gaseous fission products migrate from the  explosion cavity 
at the moment of the test". The quantities were such  that this
was not thought to be due to incomplete sealing of the shaft. 
Tritium  is a highly mobile radioactive element. Subsequent 
tests by the French Authorities according to the Cousteau team
were  not able  to confirm the result [3]. Tritium and Krypton
isotopes  are now apparently monitored routinely, subsequent to
the 1982 expedition by Haroun Tazieff [3]. 
 
 
<p>Two  anomalous results were recorded by the Cousteau team  in 
the aftermath  of the test that they witnessed. The very  short 
half-life isotope Iodine-131 (8 days) was detected in all the 
sediment samples  shortly  after a test. In addition the same 
isotope  was found  in  a sample of zooplankton from the lagoon. 
Although  not explicitly  mentioned  in Report [3], Report [1] 
notes  that  the highest concentration was found in the sample
of sediment farthest from the site. Ultimately, the French
explained the phenomenon  as the  release  of water from a
secondary borehole to  the  chamber, drilled for testing
purposes. This is clear evidence of venting of radioactive 
material. The release was admitted as 1.3x10 5   Bq  of Cs-137
and 2.0x10 11  Bq I-131[5]
 
 
<p>The  same  explanation is offered for traces of  Cs-136  
(release 1.4x10 6   Bq) detected by the French Authorities in a
follow up  to the  Cousteau work. Unusually, this was published
in  an  academic journal,  one of the few examples of work from
the  programme  appearing  thus  [5].  The second shaft is an 
unknown  entity.  For example, while the primary shaft is lined
in some cases [3], it is not known whether this is observed for
the secondary shaft  opened to collect samples of lava from the
test cavern. It does, however, de  facto,  act  as a second,
unsealed conduit  from  the  cavern, through  the fracture zone
and into the limestone layers.  It  has also  been admitted by
the Authorities that  radioactive  elements may  be released from
them. The French Authorities did not  report this incident until
the evidence forced them to do so. 
 
<p>The Cousteau study also reported elevated levels of Cs-134 in
some of  their  samples. Cs-134 was in use as a tracer and 
Report  [5] advances contamination of the Cousteau samples as the
most  likely explanation  of the presence of this low yield
isotope.  Interestingly,  the Cs-134 was also accompanied by
elevated levels of  Cs-137, which in Report [5] published by the
French Authorities  is a used  to point out the similarity with
the caesium signature  from Chernobyl. Weak activity from Cs-134
was also found in the  plankton  samples.  Intriguingly,
moreover, Cs-134 was also found in  a survey  of plankton,
conducted outside the twelve mile limit  from the SV Rainbow
Warrior [10]. In addition elevated levels of  Anti mony-125  were
detected in one of the samples. This finding is  of interest 
given that Cs-134 should not have been found  given  its short
half-life and its relatively  low yield in weapons detonations.
The Cs-137  released is  stated to not have been sufficient to
raise the Cs-137  levels in the Lagoon above existing levels. 
The French Authorities  have refuted  these  findings as being
due to  contamination,  possibly from  Chernobyl. Buske [11]
suggests that irradiation  of  Portland Cement used in lining the
shaft could be a potential source.
 
<p>Finally, IAEA studies  have detected elevated levels of 
plutonium in  seawater samples taken down current of Moruroa and 
Fangataufa Atolls, outside the twelve mile limit. The most
reasonable  explanation  of  this is remobilisation of highly 
contaminated  lagoon sediments, but leaching from test caverns
cannot be ruled out. 
 
 
<p><h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
 
<p>It  has  been admitted by the French Authorities  that  there 
are circumstances in which volatile radioisotopes may be emitted 
from the  cavern  resulting from the test. Tritium is a  highly 
mobile element  which would be expected to migrate rapidly away
from  the test  cavern through fissures and faults. Hence as 
expected,  the most  mobile  element  is detected first. This 
is  a  significant finding, and one which should have been
followed up. This  appears not to be the case. None of these
studies have published data  for krypton  isotopes. The presence
of I-131 and Cs-136 in the  vented water, together with Cs-137
indicates that a direct pathway exists through  which
radioisotopes can be conducted through  the  entire Atoll
structure, including the porous limestone areas. This  path way
is in the form of the secondary shaft. Anomalous  measurements
of Cs-134 found by Cousteau have been strengthened by a 
seemingly elevated level of Cs-134 in plankton outside the 12
mile limit.
 
 
<p>POINT
 
<li>Radioactivity has been emitted directly from test chambers to 
the surface,  demonstrating  the existence of pathways  through 
which migration may occur.   
 
<p><h4>THE NEED FOR A BASELINE STUDY</h4>
 
 
<p>The major problem concerning the evaluation of the Atoll 
environment is the absence of data. In contrast to the few days
that have been  made available to scientific expeditions in the
past,  there is a need for a comprehensive and integrated
scientific  programme to be carried out. The basic elements are
as follows:
 
 
<p>1)  A full survey of the topography of the atoll using  side 
scan sonar  and a remotely operated vehicle equipped with 
cameras  and testing instruments. This will establish the nature
and occurrence of  any externally visible fissures. These may be 
present in  the basaltic  parent  material  laid  down  by 
aerial  and  submarine volcanic  activity  in  which  tests  are 
conducted,  or  in  the overlying transition zone, dolomite and
limestone strata. In  turn this   will  allow  an  evaluation, 
supplemented   by   empirical measurement  of  actual
concentrations of  radionuclides,  of  the potential   for 
release  of  nuclides  from  the  internal   reef structure.
 
<p>2) A shallow seismic testing programme to establish the degree 
to which  the  internal  integrity of the atoll  structure  has 
been compromised  by previous testing. Such a programme  would 
provide some information on the degree of internal fissuring of
the parent and  overlying materials and also contribute
substantially  to  an evaluation of the potential for radioactive
leakage to occur  from the  atoll  structure.  Together  with 
data  produced  from   the visual/sonar  inspection  an
evaluation is then  possible  of  the potential for serious
structural changes in the atoll produced  by future weapons
testing.
 
<p>3)   A   comprehensive  sampling  campaign  to   investigate  
the concentrations  of  radionuclides in fish,  planktonic 
organisms, sediments  and coralline structures. Where feasible,
samples  will also be taken from various locations outside the
atoll to  provide data  on existing background levels. This
exercise will  help   to establish  whether  radioactive
materials have been  released.  It will  also  give some
indications of the quantities  of  radiation released.   By 
using  coralline  materials  and   analysing   the radionuclides 
present in the skeletal matrix, it may be  possible to  establish
the timing and approximate magnitude of releases  of
radionuclides in the past.
 
<p>4)  An exhaustive determination of the hydrology of the atoll 
and reef  structure. This should determine the general water 
movement through  the  various  strata of the  atoll.  Knowledge 
of  water movements  through the system, the interaction between 
fresh  and salt water in the reef system, the presence and size
of freshwater lens  systems will allow a more precise estimate
of the  speed  at which radionuclides may be carried to the
outside environment as a result  of failure of these substances
to be contained within  the reef  structure. In particular the
hydrological  relationships  of fissures and faults identified
by 1 & 2 above and the remnant test chambers and the boreholes
leading to them is a high priority. 
 
<p>5)   Following   these  evaluations,  an   epidemiological  
study integrating  retrospective  and  prospective  elements 
should  be initiated  to assess the local and regional health
impacts of the testing regime, past and present.  
 
<p>6) A comparison of the potential for radionuclide release from
the testing sites should be made with standards routinely
enforced for civil nuclear installations.
 
<p>This  programme of work is a basic minimum that should be 
carried out  even  if  no further tests were planned.  This 
programme  is currently being developed into a more detailed
protocol by a group of participating scientists. Should a
decision to  resume  testing   be  taken  after this programme
is  carried out  and  its  results  fully   considered,  it 
should be agreed that the  programme   be repeated  immediately
after the test series has taken  place  with appropriate
monitoring at the time of the tests themselves.

<h2>The Mission of the Rainbow Warrior</h2>

<p>
The mission of the Rainbow Warrior en-route to Moruroa atoll is
two-fold: to mobilise the international community to pressure 
President Chirac to reverse his decision to resume nuclear testing
at Moruroa, and to attempt by non-violent direct action to stop the 
tests.
<p>
Greenpeace believes President Chirac's decision threats to shatter 
an historic window of opportunity to achieve this year -- fifty years 
after the bomb was first 'tested' on the people of Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki -- a comprehensive test ban treaty banning all tests in all 
environments  for all time.  There are a few weeks left before French 
tests are due to resume at Moruroa in September: our aim now is to 
galvanise the force of international public pressure against President 
Chirac's decision and ensure we move nearer to our goal of a nuclear 
free future.

<title>About the S/V Rainbow Warrior</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>About the S/V Rainbow Warrior </h2>
<p>

<B>In 1985</B>,  Greenpeace lost its Pacific Ocean campaign vessel,  the 
Rainbow  Warrior, in Auckland, New Zealand.  In October of  1987, 
we  reached a settlement with France, and the search began for  a 
new  vessel.  Because of our very good experiences with  the  sea 
keeping ability of Rainbow Warrior, we tried to get another North 
Sea  Trawler.   Although  North Sea Trawlers are  not  nearly  as 
abundant  as they were when we found the Rainbow  Warrior,  after 
several months of looking we found one.
<p>
The  Grampian  Fame (ex Ross Kashmir), was built in  1957,  as  a 
fully  rivited, steam powered fishing vessel, fourty four  meters 
long.   In  1966,  she was jumboised to her  present  fifty  five 
meters and converted to diesel power.  She was bought from  North 
Star  Fishing Company Ltd., who had been using her as an oil  rig 
stand-by  vessel.  She was equipped to hold 300 survivors in  the 
hold.
<p>
The  task  of the conversion to a Greenpeace vessel has  been  to 
fit her out with all equiptment necessary for long range work  in 
the  Pacific Ocean.  This included changes to the  accomodations, 
engine room, and the addition of a sail rig.  
<p>
When  the  vessel was purchased by Greenpeace,  the  accomodation 
area was still the same arrangement as when she was a double side 
trawler.  The allyway on the port side had been boxed in, but the 
original  bulkheads  remained.  This, plus an  engine room casing 
which  extended to the allyways on both sides, cut the area  into 
too many small and unusable spaces.  So the old house was removed 
down to the main deck level, and a new larger house added.  A new 
wheelhouse  to fit in with the sailing rig was also 
added.  The old fish hold or survivor space is now an educational 
theatre and workshop.

"Elaine Shaw, Director of Greenpeace New Zealand had just returned home from Piha
when the telephone rang.  It was a New Zealand Herald reporter who wanted to talk to
her about the Rainbow Warrior....'at one o'clock in the morning!' she snapped...'Oh, I'm
sorry, didn't you know?  Your ship's been sunk'...Elaine slammed down the phone in
shocked disbelief."
                                      --YOUR CAN'T SINK A RAINBOW           
                              July 10, 1995

<P>It was an event that shook the world. July 10th 1985, the
Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior lay keeled to one side in
Auckland harbour, New Zealand, after two bombs had ripped it
apart around midnight. One crew member, Fernando Pereira, was
dead. As time and an intensive investigation went on, the truth
became inescapable - the French secret service were responsible
and the French government had ordered the bombing.

<P>The Rainbow Warrior had just arrived from the Marshall Islands
when the bombing occurred. In the Marshalls, at the request of
the islanders, the Rainbow Warrior had relocated the 320
residents of Rongelap atoll, whose home had been contaminated by
US nuclear testing in the 1950s. The islanders had been plagued
with cancer, leukaemia, birth defects and miscarriages since
then; the Rainbow Warrior took them to a new life on Mejato
atoll. Moruroa atoll, where French nuclear testing still took
place, was the logical next destination on the Rainbow Warrior's
voyage of peace.

<P>The Rainbow Warrior bombing, ten years ago this July, was an
historic act of violence - a display of state-sponsored terrorism
on the soil of a strongly anti-nuclear country and against an
organisation founded on the principle of non-violence. The
bombing outraged the world. The French defence minister was
forced to resign, the United Nations was called in to mediate a
settlement between France and New Zealand, and Greenpeace
continued the campaign which had provoked such a violent reaction
- to stop French nuclear testing at Moruroa atoll in the South
Pacific.

<P>Ten years later, the Rainbow Warrior lies buried off the coast
of New Zealand, slowly evolving into a living reef while a new
Rainbow Warrior takes up her task. With an uncertain moratorium
on nuclear testing in place, Greenpeace's commitment to
campaigning and peaceful direct action to stop environmental
destruction remains unchanged. The organization continues to work
to end the nuclear threat, to protect the Pacific and other
oceans from over-fishing and toxic pollution, and to halt ozone
depletion and global warming.

<P>'You Can't Sink a Rainbow' was the slogan that drove a small
group of shocked and bereaved activists in Auckland in 1985 to
work together to find other boats and sail again in protest to
Moruroa, in spite of the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior. Signals
from France suggest nuclear testing may resume this year at
Moruroa, in spite of the moratorium. Greenpeace - its ships, its
supporters and the people that together make up the organisation
- remain ready to fight for a nuclear-free future. Never has that
been more important than in 1995, fifty years after the nuclear
age began and the year in which the future of the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty is decided.

<P>Greenpeace is campaigning for real progress on nuclear
disarmament. Alongside this it is campaigning for a new energy
deal to replace the failed and dangerous promise of nuclear power
with solar and other renewable technologies. This would satisfy
the worlds energy needs without the risk of nuclear wars,
contamination or nuclear proliferation.

<P>
Greenpeace established its first European office in London in
1977.It was there, in a borrowed and leaking office in central
London, that a plan was hatched to buy a boat with which to
protect whales in the North Atlantic.

<P>British fishing ports were scoured in search of a suitable
vessel. Finally, an aged and rusting former North Sea trawler in
Aberdeen seemed to meet the requirements. The 'Sir William Hardy'
had been used as a fishery research trawler by the UK Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and though it needed a
complete refit, the sleeping quarters and mess had already been
altered. The 'Sir William Hardy', built in 1955, was the first
diesel electric ship built in the United Kingdom.

<P>Within 8 months, enough money had been raised for a 10 percent
down-payment. The balance was due within 60 days. As time ran
out, hopes of purchasing the ship waned. But then the Netherlands
branch of the World Wildlife Fund agreed to help finance the
campaign to save the whales. Negotiations quickly took place to
complete the purchase and to bring the ship down to London's
docks for an overhaul. Several skilled volunteers offered to help
and in the final stages of purchase the first campaign team began
to form. 

<P>With the help of a growing band of supporters and the World
Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace had acquired its first vessel in
Europe. Some months later, it was renamed 'Rainbow Warrior' after
the Warriors in a North American Cree Indian prophecy:  'When the
world is sick and dying, the people will rise up like Warriors
of the Rainbow....'
Fresh paint, in striking rainbow patterns, was applied to the
super-structure and on the bow a dove of peace carrying an olive
branch symbolised the vessel's mission.

<P>On 29 April 1978, as the Rainbow Warrior steamed proudly from the
London docks, the Greenpeace and United Nations flags flew
together to reflect not only the international composition of the
24-member crew from 10 countries, but global concern for the
plight of the whales.

<P>The entire operation was beset by almost insurmountable problems
again and again: lack of money to buy fuel, legal wrangles,
shortage of equipment and sheer exhaustion. But despite the odds,
the Rainbow Warrior proved to be a truly seaworthy ship.

<P>In the autumn of 1981, the diesel electric propulsion engine
system that had lovingly been rebuilt on many occasions had to
be replaced. Greenpeace volunteers took out 45 tons of equipment
from the engine room and installed the new Detroit engines. In
1985, before leaving the USA on the start of the Pacific
campaign, the Rainbow Warrior again underwent major conversion,
to a sail-assist system. The Marconi ketch rig made the Rainbow
Warrior the largest yacht fitted with this type of sail rig.

lb steel barrels, crashes onto a Greenpeace inflatable, narrowly
missing its crew. Protests against a shipment of Japanese spent
fuel carried by the Pacific Fisher to Barrow in Cumbria.

<P>Seal Campaign
Prevents the massacre of 6000 grey seals by Norwegian hunters in
Scotland's Orkney Islands.

<P>1979 - Whale Campaign
Enters Icelandic waters; five harpoons are fired at close range
over the heads of crew members. The Rainbow Warrior and BBC-TV
crew are intercepted and detained by gun boats. Returns to
Iceland later in the year and, again using inflatable boats,
defeats whaling attempts. The ship and crew are illegally
arrested; the Captain and UK directors are issued with an
injunction and the Rainbow Warrior equipment is confiscated.

<P>1980 - Nuclear Campaign
Sails into the French port of Cherbourg to oppose ships
delivering nuclear waste from Japan for reprocessing. Rammed by
a French naval ship.

<P>Toxic Campaign
Blockades a Bayer ship in the Netherlands disposing of tons of
chemical waste in the North Sea.

<P>Whale Campaign in Spain
Makes a second voyage to Spain to protest against whaling
operations. After successful confrontation in June, the ship is
seized and held in the military harbour of El Ferrol by Spanish
authorities who remove portions of the propulsion system to
prevent escape. In November, after being impounded for five
months, replacement parts are smuggled aboard and the ship
escapes by night, happily arriving in Guernsey in the Channel
Islands.

<P>1981 - Seal Campaign
Crosses the North Atlantic in February after having ice-
strengthening added to the bow to campaign against the slaughter
of harp seal pups on the ice packs off the east coast of Canada.
Members of the crew are arrested for dyeing the pups' coats green
to make them commercially worthless.

<P>1982 - Seal Campaign
Return to Canadian seal hunt, this time in the Gulf of St
Lawrence. Spends more than two weeks battling pack ice to reach
the hunt. Once again, several crew members are arrested for
saving the lives of several hundred seal pups. At the height of
the campaign the EEC announces a ban on the importation of seal
pup skins, which is the death knell of the commercial sealing
industry.

<P>Whale Campaign
Transits the Panama Canal to launch a campaign against dolphin
killing by deep sea tuna fishermen. Then goes on to Peru to
campaign against Peruvian whaling operations. Six months later,
Peru agrees to stop whaling.

<P>1983 - Nuclear Campaign
Campaigns against off-shore oil and gas development off the
California coast, and against the US Navy's plan to dispose of
ageing nuclear submarines by dumping them at sea.

<P>Driftnet Campaign
Voyages to the Bering Sea to confront deep sea salmon driftnet
operations, which kill thousands of sea birds and marine mammals
annually as by-catch.

<P>Whale Campaign
Voyages to Siberia to document illegal Russian whaling operation
at Lorino, where several hundred California grey whales are
killed each year. Seven crew members are arrested by the Soviets,
but the Rainbow Warrior outmanoeuvres a Russian warship and other
pursuit vessels and arrives safely back in Alaska. The crew
members are held for five days, but are finally released after
international outcry against whaling and in support of Greenpeace
efforts.

<P>1984 - Toxic Campaign
Sails through the Panama Canal to the Gulf of Mexico to protest
against ocean incineration of toxic chemicals; several days after
the ship leaves San Francisco, the US Environmental Protection
Agency revokes the permit to burn in the Gulf.

<P>1985 - Nuclear Pacific Peace Voyage
Sets sail to the Pacific after conversion to a sail-assist rig
and a complete refit in Florida. Transits the Panama Canal and
heads for Hawaii, the first stop in the Pacific. 

<P>Sails to the Marshall Islands from Hawaii with tools, books and
medical supplies. The Marshallese are suffering from the effects
of US nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s. The 320 residents
of the contaminated Rongelap Atoll, plagued with cancer,
leukaemia, birth defects and miscarriages, ask Greenpeace to help
relocate them with the Rainbow Warrior to begin a new life on
uncontaminated soil on Mejato Island. 

<P>Kiribati and Vanautu welcome the Rainbow Warrior and Greenpeace
renews its links with islanders visited by the Greenpeace yacht
Vega during previous anti-nuclear campaigns. Greenpeace and the
islanders are united in their efforts to prevent the London
Dumping Convention from lifting its two-year moratorium on
radioactive waste dumping at sea. Arrives in Auckland, New
Zealand, to support that nation's nuclear free policies and is
warmly welcomed by the public.

<P>July 10th - The Rainbow Warrior prepares to lead a peace flotilla
of ships from New Zealand to Moruroa to peacefully protest
against French nuclear testing. Three days after arrival in
Auckland, French agents bomb and sink the Rainbow Warrior in the
harbour, killing Greenpeace photographer Fernando Pereira.

<P>1987 - After 2 years of international arbitration, a panel of 3
arbitrators award a damage claim settlement in favour of
Greenpeace. The French Government is ordered to pay Greenpeace
US $8.159 million. Greenpeace pledges to use part of the award
to support the world-wide fleet of ships and its campaigns for
a nuclear and pollution free Pacific.

<P>Greenpeace reaffirms its decision for a burial at sea as an
honourable end for the ship. On December 12, the Rainbow Warrior
is sunk in the clear deep waters of the Pacific at Matauri Bay
in New Zealand, with full Maori ceremony.

<P>1989 - The new Rainbow Warrior is launched in Hamburg on July
10th and immediately starts a European tour.

<body>







<P>



<P>On the night of July 10 1985 the Rainbow Warrior had been docked
in Auckland harbour for three days while preparations for the
protest voyage to the nuclear test site at Moruroa Atoll were
finalised.

<P>On board the Rainbow Warrior that night were several of the crew
and a number of local Greenpeacers. Martini (Gotje, first mate),
skipper Pete Willcox, engineer Davey Edwards, Bene Hoffman, radio
operator Lloyd Anderson, Rien Achterberg and Fernando Pereira
were all having a drink in the ship's mess. Bunny (McDiarmid) was
visiting relatives and Henk was at a meeting in the ship's
theatre. All the skippers of the peace flotilla were there.
Relief cook and peace squadroner Margaret Mills had baked a
chocolate cake for Steve's (Sawyer) birthday. After the birthday
celebration the assembled skippers met in the ship's theatre to
discuss schedules and routes. Margaret, Pete and Lloyd were
asleep in their cabins by 11:30, all the others either departed
or were up in the mess talking...

<P>At 11:49 an electric blue flash was seen in the water beside the
Warrior, quickly followed by a huge explosion. 'Bloody hell...
It's from the engine room,' shouted Davey Edward after he was
thrown from his chair against the wall. As everyone raced from
the mess, Davey ran to the engine room. He was hardly able to
open the door. It was like a huge steam bath, with water hissing
in through the gaping hole torn in the ship's side.

<P>Captain Pete Willcox, jolted awake, stumbled down to the engine
room. One look was enough. 'Abandon ship, everyone 
get the hell out of here!' he shouted as the ship keeled over
towards the wharf.

<P>Fernando Pereira was worried about his cameras. He called out
that he was going below to get them. He was quickly followed by
Martini, who couldn't find his partner Hanne Sorensen and was
worried she might still be in their cabin. The two men skidded
down the stairs together. Martini checked out the cabin in scant
seconds and made for the deck again, then the wharf. Fernando was
in his cabin when the second blast went off, barely two minutes
after the first.

<P>There was panic on the wharf. No one had seen Fernando come back
up. Martini was still asking, 'Where's Hanne?' Someone said they
thought she's gone for a walk earlier.

<P>Elaine (Shaw, director of Greenpeace New Zealand) had just
returned home from Piha when the telephone rang. It was a New
Zealand Herald reporter who wanted to talk to her about the
Rainbow Warrior. 'At one o'clock in the morning!' she snapped.
'Oh I'm sorry. Didn't you know? Your ship's been sunk.' Elaine
slammed the phone down in shocked disbelief. Then it rang again -
 a local radio station this time. 'No, I don't know anything
about it,' she said firmly, heart pounding, and hung up. She rang
Steve (Sawyer) and the Piha contingent immediately set off for
the city. 

<P>When they arrived the wharf area was already cordoned off and
they were directed to the Wharf Police Station, where the
crew,some wrapped in blankets, sat pale-faced and in shock. It
was 2 am. The only good news was that Hanne had turned up safe
after a walk into the city.

<P>By 4 am divers had recovered Fernando's body. He had drowned,
trapped in his cabin, the straps of his camera bag tangled around
one leg.

<P>As it emerged that the bombing was a deliberate act of sabotage,
there was little doubt in Greenpeace minds who was responsible.
Two days after the bombing the French Embassy in Wellington
issued a statement echoing the flat denials emanating from Paris.
'In no way is France involved,' it declared. 'The French
Government doesn't deal with its opponents in such ways.' But
within a few days police had arrested French secret service
agents Alain Mafart and Dominique Prieur as they tried to return
their van to an Auckland hire company. While they were held in
custody, the charter yacht Ouvea, carrying another team of agents
implicated in the bombing, sailed to Norfolk Island and then
disappeared a few days out to sea heading north for Tahiti. Her
crew was reportedly picked up by the French nuclear submarine
Rubis, which turned up in Tahiti on July 22 - the first time a
French nuclear submarine had been known to enter the South
Pacific.

<P>The international outcry pressured the French Government into
setting up its own inquiry. After less than three weeks the head
of the inquiry, Bernard Tricot, a former Director-General of the
Elysee Palace, announced, 'On the basis of the information
available to me at this time, I do not believe there was any
French responsibility.' The French agents caught in New Zealand
were merely there to spy on Greenpeace, Tricot implied, not to
bomb them.

<P>Hostility towards the French Government grew after President
Mitterrand threatened that any protesters at Moruroa that year
would be arrested, and refused to meet with Greenpeace
International director, David McTaggart. Rather than cool the
growing international controversy, the transparently inadequate
Tricot report served only to fuel the fires of indignation and
further undermine the French Government's credibility, so that
a second inquiry was ordered on 5 September, but it was already
too late.

<P>Following claims in the London Sunday Times that President
Mitterrand had known of the bombing plan, and implicitly,
therefore had authorised it, French Defence Minister Charles
Hernu resigned and Admiral Pierre Lacoste, director of the DGSE,
France's intelligence and covert action bureau, was sacked.
Within days Prime Minister Fabius admitted French  secret service
agents had bombed the Rainbow Warrior under orders. It was, said
New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange, nothing more than 'a
sordid act of international state-backed terrorism'.

<P>Charged with murder and arson, on 4 November Mafart and Prieur,
just two of a much larger team of saboteurs, pleaded guilty in
the High Court at Auckland to lesser charges of manslaughter and
wilful damage and were each sentenced to ten years' jail. Their
guilty plea ensured that the facts of the police investigation
would never be made public. In June 1986, in a political deal
presided over by the United Nations Secretary-General, Javier
Perez de Cuellar, France agreed to pay compensation of NZ$13
million (US$6.5 million) to New Zealand and 'apologise', in
return for which Mafart and Prieur would be detained at the
French military base on Hao atoll for three years.

<P>To cap it all, the two spies were both free by May 1988, after
less than two years had elapsed, Mafart having been smuggled out
<P>

<br>
Fernando Pereira
<P>In the mid-1970s Fernando Pereira left his home in Portugal to
avoid being conscripted into the armed forces, then embroiled in
colonial wars in Africa and Asia. Fernando travelled to the
Netherlands, where he eventually joined Greenpeace to turn his
photographic skills to what he saw as a politically positive use.
After fleeing war to work for peace, Fernando's death was a
tragic and cruel irony.

<H1><P ALIGN=CENTER>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING AND THE NUCLEAR
NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY</H1>



</head>







<body>







<P>


<I>What does the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (npt) have to do
with the tenth anniversary of the Rainbow Warrior bombing? </I>

<P>On July 10 1985 French agents bombed the Rainbow Warrior in
Auckland harbour to prevent its protest voyage to the nuclear
testing site of Moruroa in French Polynesia. The tenth
anniversary of the bombing coincides with an historic conference
on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

<P>During the Cold War, nuclear testing was a symbol of the nuclear
arms race and a technical necessity to develop new nuclear
weapons. An end to nuclear testing has therefore been seen as an
essential lever in stopping the creation of larger nuclear
arsenals and the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries.

<P>Under the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), nuclear weapon
states agreed to end the nuclear arms race and work for nuclear
disarmament 'at an early date', in exchange for non-nuclear
states rejecting nuclear weapons possession. The 1963 Partial
Test Ban Treaty (PTBT) had ended nuclear tests in the atmosphere,
and the non-nuclear states party to the NPT saw a comprehensive
test ban outlawing all tests in all environments as the next step
to halt, or impede, the development of new nuclear weapons. In
the preamble to the NPT, therefore, they called for a
comprehensive test ban as a priority, and ever since have seen
progress toward it as a 'litmus test' for assessing the
commitment of the nuclear weapon states to disarmament.

<P>In April-May 1995, a decision on the future of the NPT will be
made at a meeting at the United Nations in New York. Nuclear
weapon states and their allies want the Treaty extended
indefinitely; the non-nuclear, non-aligned states generally are
calling for much greater progress on nuclear disarmament.

<P><I>A return to French nuclear testing?
</I>
<P>France's commitment to both the NPT and achievement of a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) is questionable. France has
so far refused to sign the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT) -
 banning tests in the atmosphere - and only became party to the
Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991. In spite of President
Mitterrand's commitment to a testing moratorium, observers say
France played an obstructive role in negotiations at the Geneva
Conference on Disarmament in 1994, calling for some tests to be
excluded from the treaty, on the spurious grounds of 'safety'
testing. The French military has strongly lobbied the
conservative government of Prime Minister Balladur to resume
testing, arguing that at least 20 more tests are necessary before
France could use computer simulated tests to develop new nuclear
weapons. Prime Minister Balladur has said that France would
resume testing if it were necessary to maintain France's
deterrent.

<P><I>What do the military want to test at Moruroa?</I>

<P>If testing was resumed at Moruroa, new nuclear warheads for
France's new Triomphant class submarines would be among the
systems tested. Twelve of these warheads will be fitted to each
of the new missiles that will be deployed on the submarines after
the year 2000. The military is also keen to develop and test a
warhead for a new air-to-surface missile.

<P><I>What are the health and environmental costs of French testing?</I>

<P>An independent health study of the people of French Polynesia has
never been undertaken, and the military records of the health of
personnel from the site have not been released. No follow-up
programme has been undertaken to monitor workers' health once
they have left the site.

<P>In 1963, the French Governor of Tahiti, M Grimald claimed 'Not
a single particle of radioactive fallout will ever reach an
inhabited island'. But immediately after the first atmospheric
tests, radiation was detected as far away as Samoa, Fiji and New
Zealand. According to testimony from people affected by the tests
collected and published by Greenpeace, higher rates of cancer,
birth abnormalities and other illnesses have been experienced by
people in French Polynesia since testing began.

<P>The environmental safety of testing nuclear weapons underground
at Moruroa has been the subject of major controversy and concern.
Moruroa and its sister test site at Fangataufa are water
permeable coral atolls on basalt, now containing several
Chernobyls worth of radioactivity. Testing threatens the
geological stability of these fragile and vulnerable environments
and makes leakage of large quantities of radionuclides into the
marine environment an ever present threat.

<P>Since 1975, more than 130 nuclear warheads have been expolded in
deep shafts in the atoll, resulting in huge cavities that fill
with molten rock and radioactive debris. Because of the
fracturing of the rock, some radioactivity leaks into the
surrounding areas through venting or seepage.

<P>While the French authorities have argued that testing is safe,
several scientific missions to the atoll - all of which have had
severely limited access to the site - have raised serious
questions about its ability to contain the radioactivity released
by underground tests. 

<P>In 1981, a mission led by French geologist Haroun Tazieff issued
a warning about the geological stability of the atoll in the
long-term if nuclear weapons testing continued. In 1983, a New
Zealand-Australia-Papua New Guinea mission found elevated levels
of tritium, and severe fissuring of the atoll and subsidence of
more than one metre in parts of the atoll. In 1987, Commandant
Jacques Cousteau found short-lived radionuclides such as caesium
134 and iodine 131 in the Moruroa lagoon, indicating leakage from
test explosions was already occurring. He filmed spectacular
cracks and fissures in the atoll as well as submarine slides and
subsidence, and described the impact of testing on the atoll as
creating 'premature and accelerated ageing... which explains.to
a great extent, the next move of the largest nuclear tests to
Fangataufa atoll.' In 1988, French officials announced that
larger tests would be exploded from then on at Fangataufa. 

<P>In 1990, a Greenpeace team - even though denied access to the
test site and restricted to working outside the 12 mile military
exclusion zone around Moruroa -found artificial radioactivity in
plankton. In 1991, an International Atomic Energy Agency mission
invited by the French military to counter Greenpeace's findings
found elevated levels of plutonium in samples taken 12 miles from
the atoll.

<P>Any further nuclear testing at Moruroa and Fangataufa could
exacerbate environmental damage at the atoll. Greenpeace has
called for a comprehensive and independent monitoring and
sampling programme at the French test sites, along with a fully
independent epidemiological health survey and full disclosure of
all information held by the French authorities about the
environmental and health effects of nuclear testing.

<P><I>France - where to now?</I>

<P>In spite of the leadership shown by President Mitterrand in
announcing the 1992 nuclear testing moratorium, France has failed
to meet its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) and has yet to meet other disarmament commitments.
It has: 
.    not signed the Partial Test Ban Treaty. 
.    failed to meet its obligations under the Euratom Treaty to
provide data on radiation monitoring and contamination at the
test site.
.    not supported a fully comprehensive test ban treaty text at
negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.  .   
made a reservation to the ban on radioactive contamination of the
marine environment contained in the South Pacific Region
Environment Protocol. .    refused to sign the South Pacific
Nuclear Free Zone Treaty.

<P>CHRONOLOGY
1960  France conducts its first nuclear test in the atmosphere
in Algeria.

<P>1960 - 1966  17 tests conducted in Algeria, including 4
atmospheric and 13 underground.

<P>1966 - 1992  175 tests detected at the Pacific test site,
including 44 atmospheric tests (39 at Moruroa, 5 over Fangataufa)
and 131 underground (123 at Moruroa, 8 at Fangataufa). Some low-
yield tests may not have been detected by seismic monitoring
however; unconfirmed military sources have put the total at more
than 200.

<P>1972  Greenpeace sails into the French test site at Moruroa. Its
ship, the yacht Vega, is badly rammed by French warships and
towed to Moruroa.
<P>1973  The Greenpeace ship Fri sails to Moruroa, is boarded and
its crew detained. Later, the yacht Vega returns to the test
site; skipper David McTaggart is severely beaten by French
commandos.

<P>1974  France halts atmospheric testing at Moruroa.

<P>1981  The Vega returns to Moruroa to protest against underground
testing. 

<P>1982  The Vega returns to the test site. The yacht is arrested,
held for a year, and then freighted back to New Zealand by the
French military.

<P>1985  While Greenpeace is preparing to sail the Rainbow Warrior
to Moruroa, the ship is blown up in Auckland harbour, New Zealand
by French secret service agents, killing crew member,
photographer Fernando Pereira. Later that year, Greenpeace
returns to Moruroa with other vessels to maintain its opposition.

<P>1989  Greenpeace launches the new Rainbow Warrior in Hamburg on
July 10, the anniversary of the Rainbow Warrior bombing.

<P>1990  The Rainbow Warrior visits Papeete, Tahiti, to protest
against the effects of nuclear testing. Later that year, the ship
sails to Moruroa. Water samples near the test site show
radioactivity may be leaking from the atoll.

<P>1992  In March, just before elections in France, the Rainbow
Warrior again sails to Moruroa. It is boarded by the French
military and its crew expelled from French Polynesia. On April
8, just 10 days after the Rainbow Warrior is forced to leave
French Polynesia, President Francois Mitterrand announces a 12
month moratorium on French testing, to be extended if other
countries follow suit. 

<P>In August, the US joined the nuclear testing moratorium followed
later by the UK. 

<P>1993  In June, President Mitterrand and President Clinton
announce they will extend the nuclear testing moratorium.  

<P>1994  France joins Conference on Disarmament negotiations on a
yet-to-be concluded comprehensive test ban treaty.

<P>1995  In April - May, the future of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) is to be decided at the United Nations in New York.
July 10 marks the tenth anniversary of the bombing of the Rainbow
Warrior.

<P>


<P><I>Christine Cabon, alias Frederique Bonlieu</I>
Cabon joined the French army in 1977, and was later transferred
to the intelligence gathering and evaluation wing of the
Direction Generale de la Securite Exterieure (DGSE - French
Secret Service). She infiltrated the Greenpeace New Zealand
office in April 1985 to uncover plans for the Greenpeace Moruroa
trip and gathered directions, maps, and information for the Ouvea
crew and the Turenges. She left New Zealand on May 24 1985; at
the time of the bombing she was in Israel. The same day the
Auckland police asked the Israeli authorities to arrest her, she
was warned off by the DGSE and was able to leave Israel before
Israeli authorities arrested her. She has since disappeared.

<P align=left><image align= top src="pkspou.gif">


<I>Ouvea crew - the French support boat</I>
<P>The three Ouvea crew are believed to have smuggled explosives,
an inflatable and an outboard motor into New Zealand. It is
possible but unlikely that one of them actually placed the bombs.

<P align=left><image align= top src="pkspxm.gif">


<I>Dr Xavier Maniguet</I>
<P>Maniguet was a doctor specializing in treating diving accident
victims. He claimed only to have been a passenger on board the
Ouvea. He was living in Dieppe, Normandy (France) in 1985. He
later wrote a book, The Jaws Of Death (Shark As Predator, Man As
Prey), which included reference to his role in the Rainbow
Warrior bombing.


<P align=left><image align= top src="pksprv.gif">

<I>Chief Petty Officer Roland Verge, alias Raymond Velche,
Skipper of the Ouvea,</I>
<P> Velche was a combat frogman who joined the
French army in 1970 and was later seconded to the DGSE. He was
based at the Navy Frogmen Training Centre (CINC) at Aspretto in
Corsica, which was closed in 1986.


<P align=left><image align= top src="pkspmb.gif">


<I>Petty Officer Bartelo, alias Jean-Michel Berthelot</I>
<P>Bartelo was also a combat frogman. His whereabouts since the
bombing are unknown.



<P align=left><image align= top src="pkspga.gif">
<I>Petty Officer Gerald Andries, aliases Eric Audrenc, Eric Andreine</I>
<P>Member of the Ouvea crew, Andries was a combat frogman. He bought
,the inflatable and the outboard motor used in the bombing in
London. Andries joined the French army in 1975 and later became
a DGSE agent based at the Navy Frogmen Training Centre in
Corsica. Six years after the bombing, on November 23 1991,
Andries was arrested in Basel. He crossed into Switzerland on the
Brussels-Milan Eurocity train without a passport: he could show
the customs officers only a driver's licence and an army
document. The police routinely checked the Interpol system and
found there was still an international warrant outstanding for
his arrest. He was detained in prison in Basel while the Swiss
authorities awaited an extradition request from New Zealand. 

<P>On December 17 the New Zealand government informed the Swiss
authorities that they would not be seeking Andries' extradition.
Andries was subsequently released and immediately escorted to the
French border. At the moment of his arrest Andries was still in
the army but not a DGSE agent. 



<P align=left><image align= top src="pkspam.gif">
<I>Major Alain Mafart, alias Alain Turenge</I>
<P>Mafart was a DGSE agent and deputy commander of the Navy Frogmen
Training Centre in Corsica. He supported the sabotage team and
was apprehended by New Zealand police when returning a rental
van. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to 10
years imprisonment on November 22 1985. Following a United
Nations sponsored mediation between New Zealand and France in
July 1986 Mafart was deported to the island of Hao in French
Polynesia to serve 3 years. In return France apologised to New
Zealand and paid New Zealand US$7 million. 

<P>On 14 December 1987 Mafart was returned to Paris, after
complaining of stomach pains. After treatment he was not returned
to the island. In 1988 he enrolled on a two-year course at the
Ecole de Guerre (War College) in Paris.

<P>Mafart was promoted to colonel in December 1993. According to Le
Monde, Mafart was then serving near Paris on a base housing
several command staffs, including that of military intelligence.
His commanding officer during the Rainbow Warrior affair is now
an aide to Defence Minister Francois Leotard. 



<P align=left><image align= top src="pkspdp.gif">

<I>Captain Dominique Prieur, alias Sophie Turenge</I>
<P>Prieur was a DGSE controller in the intelligence-gathering and
evaluation wing, acting as Christine Cabon's controller. She was
a specialist in European peace movements. After her arrest by New
Zealand police, she pleaded guilty with Mafart to reduced charges
of manslaughter and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on
November 22, 1985. Because 
of the UN ruling in the arbitration between New Zealand and
France (July 1986) she was deported to the island Hao (French
Polynesia) to serve 3 years instead. On May 6, 1988 she was
returned to France because she was pregnant (her husband was
allowed to join her on Hao). As with Mafart, she never returned
to Hao. She has since been promoted to the rank of Commandant.

<P>A UN Arbitration panel found that France had breached its
obligation to New Zealand several times by removing the agents
from Hao and failing to return them, but it rejected an appeal
by New Zealand to have Mafart and Prieur returned because the
term they should have spent there had already lapsed.

<P>Recently published book about her role in the boming.

<P><I>Colonel Louis Pierre Dillais, alias Jean Louis Dormand</I>
Dillais was the chief of mission of the DGSE operation to stop
the Rainbow Warrior on July 10, 1985. A senior officer at the
underwater combat centre at Aspretto in Corsica, Dillais
travelled under the code name of Jean Louis Dormand and
reportedly drove the inflatable boat for the two divers who
installed the bombs which sunk the Rainbow Warrior. After the
bombing, he sent the two divers to the South Island of New
Zealand to ski, and went himself as a tourist to Queenstown until
he flew to Australia on July 23.

<P>In 1994, French Defence Minister Francois Leotard appointed
Dillais as chief of the private office of the Minister of
Defence. In this post, he is in charge of military intelligence.
Previously, Dillais worked for the general secretariat of the
'Defense National', attached to Prime Ministerial Services, in
charge of European-Atlantic affairs.

<P>Critics within the DGSE say that Dillais failed to protect his
team because their names were revealed to the New Zealand police
and their careers subsequently ended. They say Dillais' own
career has been protected because his father-in-law is former
foreign affairs minister Jean Francois Poncet.

<P><I>Alain Tonel, Jacques Camurier, Francois Verlet</I>
Known by these names to the New Zealand police, these 3 men were
the so-called 'third team' of divers, either a back-up team of
frogmen or the saboteurs themselves. Verlet left for Tahiti on
July 10 and Tonel and Camurier crossed to the South Island on
July 11 with Dillais (Dormand) before leaving the country.

<P><I>Colonel Jean-Calude Lesquer</I>
Lesquer, a colonel in 1985, was head of the action unit charged
with the Rainbow Warrior bombing. Lesquer lost his post over the
Rainbow Warrior scandal but was promoted to Brigadier-General
because of his performance in the Gulf War. In February 1995 he
was promoted to Major-General, and assigned to COFRAS, a semi-
state body entrusted with following up major contracts between
French arms manufacturers and foreign governments.

<P>One official said he would be posted to Saudi Arabia, one of the
French arms industry's main foreign clients. Lesquer served in
Saudi Arabia in 1991 as chief of staff of the French Daguet
division which fought alongside allied forces in the Gulf War.

<p>The nuclear industry in North America and Western Europe is not yet dead but it is 
desperate.  The decline of orders at home has forced it to look elsewhere for a new 
market -- that market is Central & Eastern Europe (CEE) and Asia.   The nuclear 
industry is poised and ready to strike again. 

<p>In CEE and the former Soviet Union, there are still reactors under construction in 
Czech Republic, Russia, Slovakia, Romania and Ukraine.    With few orders in their 
own countries, many Western firms, notably, Siemens (Germany), Electricite de 
France and Westinghouse (United States) are hoping to form key partnerships with 
Eastern firms for the completion of these reactors.   In addition Siemens is proposing 
to  become involved in the next generation of reactors in Russia, with the 
development of the VVER 640 reactors.     Other Western firms are interested in 
building new their new generation of reactors, with Westinghouse discussing 
construction of the AP 600 in both Hungary and Lithuania.
 
<p>Many nuclear power plants in CEE are in crisis.    Western experts have classified 27 
operating reactors in CEE as 'high risk', that is, reactors that are very likely to have a 
serious accident in the next years.    Greenpeace believes that these reactors should 
be closed immediately.  These reactors could be shutdown by utilising the huge 
potential for energy efficiency and the introduction of renewable energy sources.
 
<p> In Asia - Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan and India have plans to expand their 
nuclear power supplies.  While Indonesia is also soon to embark on a nuclear power 
programme in a region known for its high earthquake frequency.  

<p>By forcing itself on newly industrialising countries the nuclear industries of Western 
Europe and North America hope to survive.  However, if these nations do continue to 
invest in nuclear power, they will find themselves increasingly handicapped in the 
world community, having to deal with environmental and economic problems that are 
intrinsic to nuclear power.
 
<a name="chernobyl">
<p><FONT SIZE=+1 FACE="MS SERIF">A C C I D E N T S &nbsp D O  &nbsp H A P P E N
 </font>
<p>In April 1986, staff undertaking tests on safety systems at <a href="../nukes/chernob/index.html">Chernobyl</a> nuclear power 
station in the former Soviet Union, switched off the emergency cooling system and 
other essential safety systems.  The reactor became unstable and reached 100 
times normal power.  It then took just 4 seconds for the nuclear reactor to explode, 
leading to the world's worst ever civil nuclear accident.
 
<p>The western world has also already had a taste of the potential disasters that could 
be caused by their reactors.    In 1979 the United States' experienced a major 
accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor. Human error amplified a technical 
fault that occurred and caused the reactor to meltdown (meltdown happens when the 
core of a reactor gets so hot that the fuel rods actually melt).  Radioactive gases 
poured into the atmosphere.  It took days for emergency evacuation plans to be put 
into operation. Local people accused the government of a big cover-up. Independent 
experts have shown that cancer deaths and infant mortality in the area are several 
times the national average.
 
<p>The threat posed to the world community by both eastern and western nuclear 
reactors is enormous. These accidents have shown nuclear energy to be one of the 
most highly dangerous and potentially lethal human creations.


 <p><FONT SIZE=+1 FACE="MS SERIF">A  &nbspC O S T L Y  &nbspM I S T A K E</font>
 
<p>Nuclear power is highly uneconomic. Where market forces have been permitted to 
follow their course, nuclear power has proved uncompetitive.  Moreover, the full 
economic costs arising from the decommissioning of old plants, the long-term 
management of radioactive wastes and the inevitable periodic accidents, have yet to 
be incorporated into the total costs of nuclear power.

<p>After a Review on the privatisation of the British nuclear power industry, the 
government deemed that there was no economic justification for public funding of 
any new reactors.  In December 1995,  British Energy announced the cancellation of 
two proposed nuclear power stations.

<H2>Nuclear Safety and the G7<BR>- A Contradiction in Terms?</H2>

The 1986 Chernobyl disaster and the political changes in Eastern
Europe since 1989, allowed Western media and experts an
unprecedented insight into the dangerous state of the region's
nuclear infrastructure.
 <P>
As a result various emergency "assistance" programmes were
established in 1991 starting with the European Union's programme
on the Kozloduy reactors in Bulgaria.
 <P>
The heads of states of both the G7 and the European Union have for
a number of years been  making strong statements of concern over
nuclear risk.[<A HREF="#table1">Table 1</A>]  In April The Nuclear Safety meeting of the
G7 and Russia will discuss various nuclear safety and nuclear
security issues.
 <P>
The 1992 Munich G7 meeting called for a definite programme of
action.  This resulted in an analysis jointly undertaken by the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the
International Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Bank.
 <P>
The study, presented at the G7 meeting in Tokyo in 1993, looked at
the investment options for reducing nuclear risk in countries with
the so called "high risk reactors", the RBMKs (15 operational) and
the VVER 440-230 (11 operational). Consequently, the report looked
at Armenia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine and
developed three main risk scenarios: `Low', `Medium', and `High'.
The scenarios looked at various rates of phase out for the
"dangerous reactors" and various degrees of investment in new and
existing nuclear power plants.   The main findings of the report
were:
 <P>
 It would have been technically feasible to replace all the "High
Risk" nuclear plants with alternative supplies and improve nuclear
safety in each of the countries concerned, by the mid 1990s.
<P> 
 The `Low Risk Nuclear Scenario', which involved the most rapid
phase out of the "high risk" reactors, also had the lowest
investment cost of the three, amounting to a total investment cost
of approximately $18 billion, between 1993-2000 ($2.3 billion per
annum).   In contrast, the `Medium' and `High' scenarios, which
involved the upgrading of existing reactors and the completion of
new facilities, would have cost $24 and $25 billion respectively.
 
<H2>Nuclear Assistance Programmes</H2>
 
Since 1991, a substantial series of, primarily grants, but with
some loans, has been given to reactors in the region.   To date,
work completed, undertaken and proposed has reached over 1 billion
ECU.

<H2>Dangerous reactors still operating</H2>
 
Since 1986 there has been no significant improvement in nuclear
safety in CEE or the former Soviet Union.   This is a  sentiment
reiterated in a 1995 publication by the United States Department
of Energy Office of Energy Intelligence, which states,
 <P>
"Many Soviet designed reactors operating in the successor states
to the Soviet Union pose significant safety risks because of
inherent design deficiencies, deteriorating economies, political
turmoil and weak regulatory oversight.  As a class, these reactors
continue to experience serious incidents, raising the spectre of
another accident akin to Chernobyl"<FONT SIZE=2><B>1</B></FONT>
<P> 
The report concludes that the four worst nuclear power stations in
the region are: Chernobyl (Ukraine), Kozloduy (Bulgaria), Kola
(Russia) and Iganalina (Lithuania). [<A HREF="#table2">Table 2</A>]
<P> 
The only, `high risk' reactors (RBMK-Chernobyl type- or VVER 440-
230 models) that have been shut-down since 1986 are:<BR>
<B>i)</B> Chernobyl unit 2, which suffered a fire in 1991. However,
according to plant officials it will be restarted in 1996.<BR>
<B>ii)</B> Medzamor (Armenia) units 1 and 2. These were shut-down in 1989
due to local opposition.  However,  unit 2 was restarted in
October 1995 and it is reported that unit 1 will be restarted in
1997.
 <P>
It is clear that the current approach for reducing nuclear risk
has failed.  There have been no permanent closures of what Western
agencies describe as the "High Risk Reactors".
 <P>
In most cases we are no closer to the closure of "high risk"
reactors than we were in 1991.   The main reason for this  has
been insufficient investment into alternative energy sources.
 <P>
Throughout CEE and the Former Soviet Union there is a massive
potential for renewable energies and in particular energy
efficiency.
 <P>
Throughout the region there has been a decrease in electricity
production over the past years. The reason for this is twofold.
Firstly, the decline in industrial demand owing to the changing
economic situation and secondly, because of payment problems
concerning fossil fuel importation.     In some cases, this
situation has led to massive decreases in electricity production.
In Between 1990 and 1995, there was a decrease from 224 TWh to 144
Twh in Ukraine. This 80 Twh decrease is greater than that produced
by the whole of the nuclear industry in the country (71 Twh in
1995).   In other words, if fossil fuel supplies were guaranteed
all the nuclear capacity could be replaced with existing, unused
supply.
 <P>
One of the most important issues is energy intensity - or the
amount of energy that countries use for the production of
materials.    Historically, countries in the former Soviet Union
paid very little, if anything, for fuel supplied by Russia.
Consequently, there was little or no incentive for either energy
saving or efficiency.   Today however, Russia charges world market
prices for the fuel.   As a result,  the bills countries have to
pay for fossil fuel (particularly gas) are enormous.   In Ukraine
the annual bill is between $1-2 billion.  However, in comparison
with the European Union, Ukraine  uses more than four times as
much primary energy per unit of Gross National Product.   Clearly,
this is in part due to the significant heavy industry in Ukraine,
but is in the main caused by lack of energy efficiency.
 
<H2>Energy Efficiency Potentials</H2>
 
    A recent presentation by Hagler Bailly Consulting, the
National Energy Efficiency Centre and Ukraine Ministry of Energy
and Power2,  outlined the following potentials for energy
efficiency.
 <P>
   At a cost of $0.03/Kwh about 14 Twh could be saved.  This is
more than the Chernobyl station produced in 1995.
<P> 
   Within a five year period Demand Side Management and Load
Management at seven industrial sites, can save nearly 2GW (two
large scale nuclear power plants) at a cost of $US 905 million.
 <P>
While other sources show:
 <P>
  Experts from the Ukrainian Institute of Energy Saving Problems
have shown that energy saving can reach 65% of total demand.  Of
this; 80% can be achieved in the industrial sector, with 30% of
this at no or low cost measures.
 <P>
  A study undertaken for the European Commissions TACIS programme
showed that at almost zero costs, 5-10% of the total power
consumption can be achieved in 1-2 years.
 
 
<H2>Next Steps </H2>
<UL>
<LI>An international co-ordination unit to assist with the phase out
of nuclear power in the region needs to be established.    This
would ensure that all lending from International Financial
Institutions (World Bank, EBRD, European Investment Bank etc.) and
bi-lateral initiatives, would incorporate loan conditional
agreements to the phasing out of nuclear power.
 <P>
<LI>Priority for loans and grant should be given to demand and
supply side efficiency.
 <P>
<LI>All loans for the completion and upgrading of nuclear power
plants should be abandoned.

<H2>Chernobyl: Ten Years After<BR> Causes, Consequences, Solutions</H2><BR> <I>3rd Version - April 1996.</I>


<H2>Introduction.</H2>
 
The Chernobyl disaster has been described as `the greatest
technological catastrophe in human history'. The accident sent a
shock wave around the world, causing the cancellation of nuclear
power programmes in country after country and was a turning point
for the world nuclear industry.
 <P>
Ten years later, we are beginning to see what the true impact of a
nuclear accident can be.   Millions of people are still affected,
hundreds of thousands of people have still not returned to their
homes and agricultural land is still restricted hundreds of miles
from the scene of the accident.
 
<H2>Causes</H2>
 
<H3>Design Problems</H3>
 
The RBMK's had a number of design flaws, the main four of which
are:-
1) the sensitivity of the neutron field to reactivity
perturbations leading to control difficulties and requiring
complicated control systems.
2) No functioning containment.
3) a positive void co-efficient of reactivity that increases as
power is decreased.
4) a control rod follower design fault that actually increases
reactivity at the bottom of the core upon insertion from a
completely withdrawn position.  In addition, owing to  the control
rods being fitted too closely in the guide channels, their
movement was slowed by the surrounding water, giving an extremely
slow insertion time of 20 seconds.    The control rod follower did
not match the full height of the reactor core, leaving a water gap
at the top and bottom and exacerbating the effect.
 <P>
To date the reactors have not been made sufficiently safe and it
is impossible for them to do so.  The danger was graphically
expressed by Hans Meyer, spokesman for the IAEA who told Reuters,
on the opening day of the IAEA's Conference on RBMK reactors in
Vienna on April 1st-3rd 1996 "The great danger of the RBMK
reactors is that they can catch fire in a way other reactors
cannot."
 <P>
Despite this, the IAEA's Conference concluded with Viktor
Siderenko, deputy minister at the Russian Ministry of Atomic
Energy, calling for increased technical assistance for the
reactors costing between $100-150 million per reactor, compared to
the present level of about $20 million.
 
<H2>Consequences</H2>
 
It has been estimated that, although different radionuclides were
released,  the total radioactivity of the material from Chernobyl
was 200 times that of the combined releases from the atomic bombs
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  However, there is still
ongoing discussion about the quantity of radioactive material
released in 1986.   Many of the official estimates at the time
claimed that 50 million curies (excluding noble gases) were
released.   However, in 1995, the Committee on the Safety of
Nuclear Installations from the Nuclear Energy Agency released the
results of further research on the source term which shows that,
the release was about 140 million cures, three times the original
estimate.
 
<H3>Contamination</H3>
 
In the former Soviet Union at least 9 million people have been
effected by the accident; 2.5 million in Belarus; 3.5 million in
Ukraine; and 3 million in Russia.  In total over 160 000 Km2 are
contaminated in the three republics.
<P> 
As far away as the United Kingdom, restrictions are still placed
on the movement and slaughter of sheep.  In January 1996 these
restrictions were still in place in 219 farms effecting 317,400
sheep and covering more than 1097 km2.
 
<H3>Evacuation</H3>
 
In the three countries most affected (Belarus, Russia and
Ukraine), at least 400 000 people were forced to leave their
homes.    Despite this massive evacuation there are an estimated
270 000 people still living in areas of such contamination that
strict controls are required ie. restrictions on the use of
locally grown food.
 
<H3>Economic</H3>
 
In the UK it is estimated that the total cost of compensation paid
to farmers is  12 million ($18 million). Several other European
countries suffered economic losses. In Germany, the Federal
Government paid out 452 million DM. ($307 million), while in
Austria, the government paid compensation for agricultural losses
totalling 966 million Austrian schillings ($94 million)
<P> 
The Belarus Government estimate the total economic damage caused
between 1986-2015 would be (1992 June prices) $235 billion.   In
Ukraine, in 1995 the Ministry for Chernobyl needed 286.4 thousand
billions of karbovanets ($2.3 billion), but received only one
third of this.   It is therefore possible to estimate that the
total bill for those countries most effected will exceed $300
billion by 2015.
 
<H3>Health</H3>
 
<H4>Thyroid Cancers</H4>
 
It is now widely accepted that the Chernobyl accident has resulted
in a massive increase in thyroid cancers in the three countries
most affected.    Already, 680 cases of thyroid cancer have been
recorded in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. Belarus has shown a 100
fold increase, from 0.3 per million in 1981-85 to 30.6 per million
in 1991-94. Russia indicates a 10 fold increase form 0 cases in
1981-5 to 10 per million in 1991-91 and, Ukraine shows an
approximate 7 fold increase from 0.5 cases per million in 1981-85
to 3.4 per million in 1991-94.
 
 
<H3>Other Health Effects</H3>
 
UNICEF has assessed national statistics (ie. not just in
contaminated areas) for Belarus, between 1990-1994 and has noted
significant increases in many types of health disorders.  For
example  problems of the nervous and sensory organs have increased
by 43%; disorders of the digestive organs by 28%; and disorders of
bone, muscle and the connective tissue system have increased by
62%; and malignant tumours by 38%.
<P> 
The Ministry of Chernobyl in Ukraine, estimates that there is a
doubling of morbidity between those living in contaminated and
clean areas.
 
<H3>Liquidators</H3>
 
Liquidators is the term given to the 800 000 workers who were
involved in putting out the fire and undertaking the immediate
recovery work.  Despite the high doses that many of the
liquidators received, there has been no internationally co-
ordinated study to investigate the health consequences of the
accident.
<P> 
According to the World Health Organisation, medical monitoring of
some of the liquidators is already indicating growing morbidity
and mortality rates amongst this group.
 <P>
According to the Belarus Government, thyroid cancer has increased
4000%, diabetes 700%, diseases of blood organs 840% and some
malignant tubes 160% as well as a general reduction in the
functioning of the immune system.
 <P>
Estimates by a major non-government organisation - the Chernobyl
Union - indicate that in the Russian Federation alone, 10% of the
liquidators are unable to maintain full-time employment, meanwhile
the Russia Ministry for Civil Defence claim that 38% of
liquidators suffer from some disease.
 <P>
At their 1995 annual press conference the Ukrainian Ministry of
Health states: "According to inter-ministerial expert councils the
805 (60%) of ACCP (liquadators) deaths only in 1993 were connected
with Chernobyl NPP accident effects, and 532 (77%) - in 1994
respectively."
 
 
<H2>Sarcophagus</H2>
 
The Chernobyl Unit 4 post accident containment structure, more
commonly known as the "sarcophagus" was completed in November
1986. The sarcophagus was built in extremely hazardous conditions
in order to isolate and contain the remains of the damaged reactor
which contains over 400kg of plutonium and more than 100 tons of
nuclear fuel.
<P> 
Designed to last 30 years, it now suffers from approximately 300
square yards of cracks and holes along with other weaknesses which
have arisen due to both  the speed of construction and the
conditions under which it was built.  The design of the
sarcophagus did not allow  for potential earthquake stresses and
both Ukrainian and Western scientists say it could collapse in a
severe earthquake releasing radioactive dust.  In March 1996, the
Ukrainian Environment Minister stated "There is a real danger that
as a result of thermal chemical migration of nuclear fuel deep in
the debris of the reactor of the fourth power unit, a critical
concentration may arise that will lead to a speedy heating and a
thermal blast", however, not all experts agree with this analysis.
 
<H2>Dangerous reactors still operating</H2>
 
Since 1986 there has not been any significant improvement in
nuclear safety in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) or the former
Soviet Union (FSU).   This is a  sentiment reiterated in a
publication by the Department of Energy Office of Energy
Intelligence, which states.
<P> 
"Many Soviet designed reactors operating in the successor states
to the Soviet Union pose significant safety risks because of
inherent design deficiencies, deteriorating economies, political
turmoil and weak regulatory oversight.  As a class, these reactors
continue to experience serious incidents, raising the spectre of
another accident akin to Chernobyl"
 <P>
The report concludes that the four worst reactors in the region
are Chernobyl (Ukraine), Kozloduy (Bulgaria), Kola (Russia) and
Iganalina (Lithuania).
 <P>
The only, so called, high risk reactors (RBMK-Chernobyl type- or
VVER 440-230 models), that have been shutdown since 1986 are:
<P> 
Chernobyl unit 2, which suffered a fire in 1991, but according to
plant officials will be restarted in 1996.
 <P>
Medzamor (Armenia) units 1 and 2:   These were shutdown in 1989
due to local opposition,  but unit 2 was restarted in October 1995
and it is reported that unit 1 will be restarted in 1997.
<P> 
There  are  a number of bi-lateral aid agreements which bring  the
total   assistance  programme  to  about  1013.88   million   ECU.
However,  the  wisdom of attempting to retrofit the  reactors  has
been questioned.  In September 1992, the then director of Industry
and Energy Department of the World Bank Anthony Churchill stated.
 <P>
"The  questions we have to ask ourselves are; one,  what  are  the
chances  of  these  [nuclear safety] programmes being  implemented
effectively within a reasonable period of time, and, two,  at  the
end of this process how much safety have we really bought?  Are we
simply  playing Russian roulette with a pistol that now has twelve
cylinders instead of six ?  Is this a game we really want to play,
even with twelve cylinders?"
 
<H2>Solutions</H2>
 
In Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union there is
a huge potential for removing the need nuclear power on the short
term.   However, this has not been realised partly because of
continued investment of resources into nuclear power programmes.
Instead, investment should be made into alternatives which are
more beneficial to the countries' environment and economy.   In
particular investment should be focused towards.
 
<H3>Energy Efficiency</H3>
 
This is a very important untapped resource available to all
countries in the region.  Conservative estimates show  that at
present, electricity consumption per unit of economic output is at
least twice as high as that in OECD Europe.  Moreover, since
electricity use in the region has not decreased by as much as
economic output, electricity intensity has actually increased in
recent years.
 <P>
One example that highlights the benefits of energy efficiency
implementation is an analysis which was undertaken by the European
Union energy centre in Kiev.   In Ukraine there are thousand of
boilers used in small scale district heating plants and power
units in small factories.  The EU analysis looked at a system
using eight boilers.  The test showed that the improved efficiency
gained by overhauling the eight boilers led to savings of 412,000
m3/year of natural gas, and 55,000 kWh/year of electricity.  This
is just one example among tens of thousands in the region where
money and energy is being wasted.
 
<H4>i.  Retrofitting Existing Supply Capacity</H4>
 
In Ukraine between 1990 and 1995 electricity production dropped by
80 Twh or approximately 35%.  During this period production in the
nuclear sector remained constant, at about 70Twh.  Therefore, the
decline in production took place almost exclusively in fossil fuel
plants.   Since it can be assumed that the plants in operation in
1990 are still operating today, it would be possible to shut down
100% of the existing nuclear sector overnight if all existing non-
nuclear plants were utilised.
 
<H4>ii.  Construction of New Renewable Energy Sources</H4>
 
This has very obvious environmental and economic advantages over
other new supply options.  However, despite this little work has
been undertaken to evaluate the full range of potentials in the
region, with the exception of wind.
 <P>
* The potential for Wind Power in the region is enormous.  In
Ukraine, there is the potential for over 150 GW in the Sivash and
Black sea areas,  in comparison Chernobyl currently has 2GW of
capacity.
<P> 
* The use of small scale hydro has the potential to produce 4
times more than the present capacity of operating power plants
according to experts from the State Scientific Research, Design
Construction Institute of Unorthodox Power Generation and Electric
Engineering.
 
<H2>Conclusion</H2>

Despite massive international concern over nuclear safety in CEE
and the fSU and hundreds of millions of dollars in grants and
loans to the region, there has been little increase in safety and
none of the "high risk" reactors have been permanently closed.
The only conclusion that can be reached is that the money is going
to the wrong programmes.   Instead of investing in energy
efficiency and alternatives, the majority of vital resources are
being paid to western consultants and contractors to review
nuclear safety.
 <P>
The accident at Chernobyl has had a huge impact on the
environment especially in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.  In
addition, it has had a negative impact on the health of the
hundreds of thousands of people involved in the clean-up and those
who still live in heavily contaminated areas.   Due to the long
half life of many of the radio-nuclides released a huge area will
remain contaminated for generations to come.   International
organisations, such as the IAEA and WHO continue to maintain that
other than Thyroid cancers there are no negative physical health
effects from Chernobyl.  However, with the exception of Thyroid
cancers no large scale international study has been completed
which investigates health effects in high risk groups e.g. the
Liquidators.    Without adequate information it is impossible to
draw firm conclusion.
<P> 
Due to the serious risk of a second accident at Chernobyl it is
essential that the station be closed immediately and because of
the safety problems of the existing Sarcophagus it is necessary
to take immediate action to secure it and begin preparation for
the construction of a second structure.    Both of these require
urgent Western financial support to avoid another environment and
ecological disaster.

<H2>Nuclear Power World Status Report 1996</H2>
 
<H2>10 Years After the Chernobyl Accident:
The continuing decline of the nuclear power industry</H2>
 


As of December 31st 1995, there were some 430 commercial
nuclear power reactors in operation world-wide.   These
plants had a collective nominal capacity of nearly 340
gigawatts (GW),  producing about 17% of global electricity.
 <P>
At the same time, just 36 plants were under construction
(with a nominal capacity of 30 GW), the fewest plants under
construction at any one time for a quarter-century. Most are
scheduled to be completed in the next few years, though
delays in construction continue to plague the industry.
 <P>
In addition many plants have been completed, but remain
idle, or have been abandoned while under construction
('mothballed').  While more than 80 reactors (19,000
megawatts) have been permanently shutdown, many questions
surrounding long-term decommissioning remain unanswered.
 
<H2>North and Latin America</H2>
 
In the United States, it has been 18 years since a nuclear
reactor has been ordered, and 23 years since one was ordered
and not subsequently cancelled.  Indeed, over the past 30
years, a total of 123 nuclear plants were cancelled by
utilities, representing 135,000 megawatts (MW) of generating
capacity--well above the country's total current nuclear
capacity (109 reactors and 99,000 MW).
<P> 
In 1995, no reactors were being built in Canada.  In 1990,
Ontario Hydro had plans to construct ten more reactors by
2014, but these plans have been cancelled.  One reactor was
shut down in 1995.
<P> 
There are only five nuclear reactors operating in Latin
America, two in Argentina, two in Mexico and one in Brazil.
Argentina and Brazil both have one reactor under
construction.   The nuclear reactors in Latin America have
all suffered severe technical problems  and are frequently
shutdown.
<P> 
In 1992, Cuba postponed the completion of two partially
constructed Soviet-designed reactors.
 
<H2>Western Europe</H2>
 
In 1957 the promotion of nuclear energy in Europe was
considered to be so important that a European Atomic Energy
Community (EURATOM), was created. Today, in the European
Union, 7 of the 15 member states do not operate
commercial nuclear power reactors, i.e. Portugal, Ireland,
Luxembourg, Denmark, Italy, Greece and Austria.
If Sweden abides by its decision to phase out nuclear power
by 2010, as decided after a Referendum in 1980, there will
be majority of non-nuclear EU Member states.
<P> 
Sweden's newly elected government has recently called for
the closure of one reactor within the next four years.    In
a 1980 referendum, Swedes voted to phase-out nuclear power,
and parliament set a final date based on 25-year reactor
lifetime.
 <P>
In February 1995, the Swedish government Commission
reviewing the nation's energy policy concluded that although
Sweden's 12 nuclear reactors, generating roughly half of the
electricity, can be technically decommissioned by 2010, the
costs of such decommissioning would be very high.
Decommissioning at a later date would result in a much lower
economic cost.   Despite enormous lobby efforts by the
nuclear industry, the Swedish Energy Commission, after
completing its Review in December 1995, did not abandon the
idea of a nuclear phase-out.
<P>
The Commission has also suggested that a number of stringent
economic measures be legislated.  The decision on whether
the phase-out date will be maintained at 2010, or postponed,
as well as which instruments will be legislated to assume
the phase-out, is expected to be made by the Swedish
government during the upcoming year.
<P>
In the whole of the European Union,  France is the only
country which has reactors under construction.
 <P>
On 13 November 1995, the Franco-German consortium of
Framatome and Siemens presented a state of the art of the
"European Pressurised Water Reactor" (EPR) project. The EPR
is presented by the reactor constructors as the "inherently
safe" nuclear reactor of the next generation. The EPR is
expected by its promoters to have a 10 to 100 times smaller
core meltdown risk than current Pressurised Water Reactors
(PWR).   This attempt to increase reactor safety standards
points to the fact that present levels of safety were wholly
inadequate.
<P> 
The start-up of the first demonstration EPR in France is
planned by the year 2005.  Apart from the French state
utility, Electricite de France (EDF)  no other company has
so far committed to actually order an EPR, not even the
German utilities. Since the official construction cost
estimates of the EPR are at least 15% higher than for
traditional nuclear reactors, the commercial future of the
"next generation" reactor remains highly uncertain.
 <P>
After a Review on the privatisation of the British nuclear
power industry, it was deemed that there was no economic
justification for public funding to build any new reactors.
In December 1995, British Energy announced the cancellation
of the two proposed stations.
 <P>
In Finland, in September 1993, the Parliament voted against
the government proposal for a fifth reactor.   While in
Spain, in April 1991, the government confirmed the 1983
moratorium on nuclear construction. In January  1995, a new
law definitively cancelled the five reactors, which were
`mothballed' since the moratorium.
<P> 
The Dutch government decided after a parliamentary debate in
December 1994 to only approve the operating life of the
Borssele reactor until 2004, and this under strict
conditions, despite strong pressure from the reactors
operator to extend the life until 2007.
 <P>
After the unification of Germany, old reactors in the former
Eastern Germany were closed almost immediately.   Public
protests against radioactive waste transports and
repositories have strengthened the general anti-nuclear
sentiment amongst the German public.   The Energy Consensus
talks between the industry, the Federal Government and the
SPD-Opposition were broken off in the summer of 1995 without
an agreement on new reactor orders.
<P> 
In Belgium, where 7 reactors account for about 55% of the
electricity, a special Senate's Commission concluded in 1991
that no new reactors should be built in an area closer than
30 km from the nearest population centre.    In this small
and densely populated country, such a place simply does not
exist. In December 1995, the Belgian electricity utilities
presented their new 1995-2005 equipment plan.  Although the
plan does not foresee new plant orders in the next ten
years, it has been broadly criticised for its lack of an
effective phase out policy.
 <P>
There are currently five reactors operating in Switzerland.
After a Referendum in 1990, the Swiss adopted a moratorium
on the construction of new reactors at least until the year
2000. In 1992 and 1994 the reactors Muehleberg and Beznau-2
had their licences extended temporarily for just 10 years,
instead of an unlimited period, as demanded by the
utilities.
<P> 
Swiss law urges the existence of a final radioactive waste
repository before any new reactors can be ordered. In 1995
the people of the Canton of Nidwalden rejected such a
radioactive waste repository in a Referendum, which has
jeopardised the future of Swiss nuclear power prospects.
 <P>
The OECD Nuclear Energy Agency stated in its 1993 Activities
Report that due to the low number of new plant orders in
comparison to the closure of reactors, even before the end
of their expected life time, the viability of the nuclear
industry is at stake, as well as the confidence of nuclear
investors.    With contracts scarce in western countries,
the traditional nuclear construction companies are looking
for new markets.  In an attempt to survive they have turned
to Asia and Eastern Europe for business.   However, nuclear
power in those regions also continues to be plagued with
problems.
 
<H2>Central and Eastern Europe</H2>
 
In Russia, despite official plans for the completion and
construction of up to 10 power reactors by 2005, industry
officials are reported to predict that there will only be
funding of two reactors, at Kalinin and Rostov, by 2000.
 <P>
In November, the German company Siemens signed a letter of
intent to supply the instrument and control systems for  the
development of the new generation of reactors in Russia, the
VVER 640.    This reactor will initially be built at the
Sosnovy Bor reactor complex, with proposals for further
reactors at Kola as well as potential sales overseas.
<P> 
In Ukraine, the operation of units 1 and 3 at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant continues to receive international
attention.   In December, a "Memorandum of Understanding"
between the Ukrainian government and the governments of the
G7 and EU countries was signed.   This memorandum seeks the
closure of Chernobyl by the year 2000 and outlines an
international assistance programme, totalling US$2.3
billion.  The largest project within this package is for the
completion of two new reactors and current estimates by the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
estimate that this completion will cost approximately $800
million.
<P> 
In August 1995, the sixth reactor at the Zaporozhe nuclear
power plant was started.   In 1995 this station had the
worst safety record of all Ukrainian plants according UNIAN,
the Ukrainian wire service.
 <P>
In October 1995, the second unit of the Medzamore nuclear
power plant in Armenia was restarted.      The station was
closed in 1988 due to public opposition, and had not
operated at all since that time.   Over the past years
Armenia has suffered massive energy shortages due to lack of
investment and an energy blockade in its 7-year war with
neighbouring Azerbaijan.
 <P>
The restart of the reactor triggered protests from
neighbouring Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, who fear the
plant is an environmental threat. US officials also joined
the protest, stating that the plant is among the world's
most dangerous.
 <P>
In October 1995, Bulgarian authorities restarted reactor
number one at it's Kozloduy nuclear power plant.   It was
restarted despite objections from western governments, the
European Commission and western European safety
organisations.   As a result, one of the main western
contractors at the site, Electricite de France,  threatened
to withdraw it's personnel from the site.
 <P>
Despite the signing of an agreement to fund the completion
of two reactors at the Temelin nuclear power station in
March 1994 in the Czech Republic, little work appears to be
ongoing.  The work to be undertaken by Westinghouse and in
part funded by the United States Government Export-Import
Bank has stalled  in part due to liability concerns and in
part due to legal problems.
<P> 
In December 1994, a public participation process began to
evaluate the technical, economic and public viability of the
completion of the first two units at the Mochovce Nuclear
power plant in Slovakia.   The reactor completion, to be
undertaken using French, German, Russian, Czech and
Slovakian technology, to be funded by the EBRD, the European
Commission and French and Germany government credit
agencies, would have been the first western European
completion of Soviet-designed reactors.
<P>
In March 1995, following the completion of the public
participation project, the Slovakian government requested
that the project be suspended by the Bank.   It later
transpired the Slovakian Government was dissatisfied with
the total price of the project, nearly $1 billion, and the
conditions that the EBRD had placed upon the loan.
<P> 
The utility is still looking for finances to complete the
project and is preparing a package with greater involvement
from Russia's Minatom, Czech banks and companies as well as
Siemens.  However, the future of Mochovce is still far from
secure.
 
<H2>Asia</H2>
 
In East Asia, Japan, South Korea, China, and Taiwan have
plans to expand their nuclear power programmes.  However, in
South Korea it is estimated that completion costs for the
five reactors currently under construction could be almost
double that of some of the country's older reactors.   In
addition, public opposition to nuclear power and
particularly radioactive waste dump sites in South Korea is
continuing to increase.
<P> 
In Taiwan, disputes over how to deal with the radioactive
waste from the country's six nuclear plants continues to
plague the industry.  While plans for two new reactors have
been delayed due to public opposition and escalating costs.
<P> 
At the end of 1995, Japan had 50 operating nuclear reactors
with a further 4 under construction.   The official long-
term energy supply and demand outlook published by the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) in 1992,
was for the construction of 40 more nuclear reactors.
However, it has recently become obvious that this `official
plan' is quite unrealistic.
<P> 
The nine electricity utilities are all staggering under the
weight of debt accumulated from constructing nuclear plants
in the past: this resulted in the utilities unilaterally
withdrawing from the plan to construct the `advanced thermal
reactor' (ATR) in August 1995.
<P> 
In addition, new measures to de-regulate the electricity
market which came into effect on January 1st 1996, made the
outlook for nuclear power in Japan even worse.  The biggest
change was that utilities could no longer charge a standard
8% premium to ensure their `investment return'; in future
the price of electricity sold to the consumer will be
regulated, and generators will only make a profit according
to how low they can push their own costs.  This will
inevitably reveal the cost disadvantages of nuclear power.
<P> 
In December of 1995 Japan also experienced a massive public
loss of confidence when sodium leaked from it's Fast Breeder
Reactor, Monju, and the Japanese nuclear industry attempted
to cover up the full extent of the damage.
<P> 
The close proximity of China's Daya Bay reactors to Hong
Kong has always provoked strong concern from the Hong Kong
residents.  Fears over the plant were heightened when
shortly after construction began, engineers discovered that
more than half of the vertical reinforcing steel in the
foundation had been left out.  Although this was corrected,
confidence in Daya Bay suffered long-term damage.   Plans
for expansion at Daya Bay continue to face delays.
 <P>
Western governments, led by the United States, have promised
North Korea as much as $400 million worth of fuel oil and
two large western-style reactors, in exchange for a pledge
to curtail nuclear weapons development.
<P> 
India is in the process of constructing five new reactors.
In 1993 India's nine operating reactors had a capacity
factor of only 39 percent in 1993, far below the 60-80
percent average of most countries. Meanwhile, a 130-ton
concrete slab of the containment dome collapsed at a reactor
under construction at Kaiga in 1994, increasing
uncertainties about the safety of India's nuclear reactors.
<P> 
Recently Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines have
expressed some interest in nuclear power.   These plans,
however, remain very much in the early planning stages.
While Indonesia continues to move slowly on orders long
anticipated by vendors.
 <P>
In total, Asian countries account for half of all new plants
under construction.    Although nuclear power is the only
energy source actively promoted by a United Nations agency,
it has never fulfilled its promise to bring energy security
to newly industrialising countries.    Contrary to the small
share of nuclear power in the electricity production, it
contributes very significantly to the foreign debt of newly
industrialising nations.
 <P>
In addition, all commercial nuclear reactors produce
sizeable amounts of plutonium, and most nuclear technology
can by put to dual civil-military uses. As nuclear
technology spreads around the globe so does the risk of
nuclear proliferation.
 <P>
Finally, the rising cost of decommissioning retired
facilities continues to cloud the industry's future.  The
Yankee Rowe reactor in western Massachusetts, USA which cost
over US$186 million to build in 1960, was closed in 1991.
To fully dismantle the plant will cost some US$370 million.
If governments and utilities have had a difficult time
justifying the cost of building and operating reactors,
closing them could be an even harder sell.
 
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
 
In the past two decades there has been a steady decline in
the fortunes of the nuclear industry around the world.   The
decline started in the United States in the 1970's  and
resulted in the cancellation of over 120 nuclear power
plants.   Subsequently, we have seen the cancelling of
nuclear power programmes and reactors around the world.
Today, in Western Europe only France has any reactors under
construction, while in Central and Eastern Europe only a
handful of reactors are being built.   Even in Asia, which
is often touted as the next region of the world to build
large numbers of nuclear power plants, reactor programmes
are being slimmed down and cancelled.
 <P>
In the next decade this downward trend is likely to
continue,  and as the true economic and environmental costs
of decommissioning and radioactive waste management come to
light it could even accelerate more rapidly.
 <P>
However, the nuclear industry has not given up.  It intends
to design a new generation of reactors which it states will
be safe and cheap.    This is already being undertaken in
Europe with the development of the European Pressurised
Water Reactor (EPR) and in Russia with the VVER 640.
 <P>
The nuclear industry has had almost 50 years to prove that
nuclear technology is safe, clean and cheap and has failed
to do so.  Far from producing electricity that is  "too
cheap to meter", the environmental and economic costs of
nuclear power are now too huge to measure.   Now is not the
time for further government subsidy to develop a new series
of nuclear reactors.    As we approach the 21st century,
renewable energy sources have clear environmental and
economic advantages over nuclear power.  The time has come
to stop all further developments in the nuclear industry and
to start to implement a new Solar Age.

<P>

This graph illustrates the decline in orders for nuclear
power.  The steady decline, which began in the 1970s in the
United States, has continued throughout the rest of the
world.   This downward trend is likely to continue as the
economic and environmental burdens of nuclear power come to
light.

<H2>Reactor Starts vs Shutdowns</H2>
 

<IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=527 HEIGHT=353 ALT="Graph illustrating decline in the nuclear power industry" SRC="g02.gif">
<P>
The above graphs shows the decline in the nuclear power
industry.   The comparison between new reactors starting up
-- which tailed off in the early 1990s -- and old reactors
being shutdown, shows the true extent of the downward trend.
In fact, there was a major reversal of tradition in the 1989-
1991 period, when more reactors were shutdown than were
brought on-line.  This will be the trend for the future,
particularly in the early part of the next century.
<P> 
It is important to note that up to the present date,
reactors being shutdown have been mainly smaller prototype
and early commercial plants, while the upcoming wave of
shutdowns will be full-size commercial plants. Thus the
overall energy contribution of nuclear power is due for a
major decline as the reactors commissioned in the early
1970s are closed.

<H2>Going Down......</H2>
 
<IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=531 HEIGHT=303 ALT="Graph illustrating IAEA's predictions of nuclear capacity for yr 2000" SRC="g03.gif">
<P>
In contrast to the downward trend of nuclear power (See
Starts vs Shutdowns graph), the official voice of nuclear
promotion - the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -
maintained for many years a rosy outlook for the industry.
This graph shows the IAEA's predictions of nuclear capacity
for the year 2000, according to the year in which they were
made.  For example, in 1976 the IAEA expected that total
nuclear capacity by the year 2000 would be about 2300
Gigawatts.  As time passed the IAEA slowly caught up with
reality, and in 1994 the Agency predicted that capacity six
years later would be just barely above the actual 1994
capacity.

<H2>World Nuclear Capacity and Spent Fuel Arising</H2>
<IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=525 HEIGHT=395 ALT="Graph illustrating increase in spent nuclear fuel" SRC="g04.gif">
<P> 
As more reactors were constructed the huge volume of highly-
radioactive irradiated or `spent' nuclear fuel has massively
increased.  Despite the huge scientific and economic input
of a civil nuclear programme spanning four decades, there is
still no accepted technique for disposing of the waste which
inevitably results from the operation of nuclear reactors.
Reaching a total of over 130,000 tons, the spent fuel from
nuclear plants is simply accumulating in pools of water at
reactor sites. Meanwhile, national governments continue to
delay the final reckoning in the face of major public
opposition. The `dark side' of the nuclear dream appears
today as intractable as ever.
