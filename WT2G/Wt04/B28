To the veterinarian:<P>
The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) within the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) helps to ensure the safety of the food supply and assists
in providing for the health care needs of animals through the approval and
post-approval monitoring of safe and effective animal drugs, medical devices,
and feeds.  Veterinarians also help to ensure food safety and provide for the
health care needs of animals through appropriate and responsible use of
FDA-regulated products.  Because of the similarities of mission between FDA and
veterinarians, this booklet was written to provide a source of information on
CVM activities which may be of interest to veterinarians.  Our success at CVM
depends on the knowledge, abilities and ethics of veterinarians to use
FDA-regulated products responsibly within their practice.  We hope this booklet
will serve as a catalyst for greater communication between CVM and the
veterinary profession.<P>

<B>Introduction</B><P>
 The FDA has the broad mandate to assure safety and effectiveness of
drugs (including animal drugs), devices, and the safety of the food supply.
This responsibility is derived from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(the Act). The Act was amended in 1968 to include sections which specifically
address animal drugs.  It was the intent of these amendments to consolidate and
revise the Act to ensure that animal drugs are safe and effective for their
intended uses and that they do not result in unsafe residues in foods from
treated animals. <P>
 Section 512 of the Act, the basic statutory provision governing new
animal drugs, provides that a new animal drug is unsafe unless there is in
effect an approval of a new animal drug application and unless the intended use
of a drug and its labeling  conform to the approved application.  A new animal
drug which does not conform to the provisions of section 512 is adulterated and
subject to the enforcement provisions of the Act.  Virtually all animal drugs
are "new animal drugs" within the meaning of the term in the Act, and are
subject to section 512.  Although an animal drug may avoid the approval
requirement if it is not a new animal drug or is grandfathered, the burden is
on the marketer to prove that one of these exceptions applies.  To assist in
carrying out its statutory responsibilities, the FDA has promulgated
regulations and developed written regulatory policies.  New regulations are
published in the <A NAME="fnb0">FEDERAL REGISTER</A>  <a
href="#fn0">[1]</a> .   All FDA regulations are codified in
Title 21 of the CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS <a
href="#fn1">[2]</a> .  <A NAME="fnb1">These</a> regulations and policies are
subject to change as new circumstances occur and new information becomes
available.  Because they are always subject to legal challenge, they must be
scientifically and legally defensible. <P>
 Most regulatory issues can be adequately and appropriately resolved
through dialogue in various forms.  The FDA encourages such open, frank
discussions. <p>
 
 
<B>WHO HAS RESPONSIBILITY? </B><P>
 While the Food and Drug Administration is responsible for regulating
animal feeds/foods, devices, and most animal health products, there are some
classes of animal products that fall under the jurisdiction of other Federal
agencies.  A quick guide as to which agency has responsibility for these
products is provided below. <P>

<B> Pet
Foods</B>
 <P>
 Pet foods are subject to the requirements of the Act, and pet food
manufacturers are subject to individual annual product registration in most
states.  State laws may require that pet food labels bear, in addition to the
mandatory information required by Federal law, a label statement of "guaranteed
analysis" for minimum protein and fat content, and maximum fiber and moisture
content, a nutritional adequacy statement, and feeding directions.  Additional
information concerning state registration and labeling requirements may be
obtained from the individual states where the products will be distributed or
from the Official Publication of the Association of American Feed Control
Officials, Inc. c/o Mr. Charles P. Frank, AAFCO Treasurer, Georgia Department
of Agriculture, Plant Food, Feed and Grain Division, Capitol Square, Atlanta,
GA 30334. <P>
 Pet foods are also subject to the labeling requirements of the Fair
Packaging and Labeling Act, which governs certain aspects of consumer product
labeling.  In the future, definitions for nutrient content claims, such as
"lite," may be developed in a manner consistent with those developed for human
foods. <P>
 As with human food, pet foods may not be adulterated or misbranded.  Pet
foods may not contain any poisonous or deleterious substances or residues of
pesticides in excess of established tolerances.  They may not be stored in any
containers which may render the contents injurious to health because of any
poisonous or deleterious substance and may not contain any color additives or
food additives which are unsafe.  To ensure safety, canned pet food must be
manufactured and registered in  accordance with the FDA regulations for low-acid
canned foods.  Pet food labeling may not be false or misleading in any
particular. Damage or inferiority may not be concealed in any manner.  Pet food
may not be sold under the name of any other food and may not have any valuable
constituents omitted or extracted. <P>
  <P>
<B>Veterinary Biologics</B><P>
 The term "veterinary biologics" includes all viruses, serums, toxins,
and analogous products of natural or synthetic origin, such as diagnostics,
antitoxins, vaccines, and the antigenic or immunizing components of
microorganisms intended for use in the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of
disease in animals.  The Veterinary Biologics Staff, Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is responsible for
regulating veterinary biologics for purity, safety, potency and
effectiveness. <P>

<B> Veterinary
Medical Devices</B>
 <P>
 By statutory definition, a medical device is an instrument, apparatus,
implement, machine, contrivance, implant, <i>in vitro</i>  reagent, or other
similar or related article, including any component part, or accessory, which
is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease,  or other conditions, or in
the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other
animals, or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man
or other animals and which does not achieve any of its principal intended
purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals
and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of
its principal intended purposes.<P>
Veterinary medical devices and diagnostic aids are subject to the general
provisions of the Act in regard to misbranding and adulteration.  There are
currently no requirements for FDA pre-market
approval of medical devices intended for animal use.  However, animal medical
device labeling may not be false or misleading under the existing Act.  A
veterinary medical device may be considered misbranded if the manufacturer or
distributor does not have data which establish the safety and effectiveness of
the claims made for the product.  Medical devices are illegal if dangerous to
animal or human health when used in the manner prescribed, recommended, or
suggested in labeling.  The FDA relies on veterinarians and other users to
report unsafe veterinary medical devices.<P>
Articles such as screening test kits for drug residues are regulated as
veterinary medical devices.  One example of screening tests is those used to
screen milk for the presence of drug residues.  As with other veterinary
medical devices. these articles must bear adequate directions for use, labeling
may not be false or misleading, and the manufacturer should have data adequate
to demonstrate that use of the screening kits in accord with label directions
will yield consistent and reliable results. <P>
If adequate directions cannot be written for lay use, the veterinary medical
device is deemed unsafe for use except under the supervision of a licensed
veterinarian. The FDA, therefore, requires that the label bear the statement:
"Caution:  Federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a
licensed veterinarian" (21 CFR 801.109).  Examples of veterinary medical
devices which are required to bear the prescription legend include
transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulators, pulse magnetic field devices, and
lasers.<P>
 
<B> Pesticides</B> <P>
Germicidal preparations for use on inanimate objects, as well as
rodenticides, and most insecticides are subject to the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, administered by the Pesticide Regulation
Division of the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C.
20460.  However, some products used to control external pests are intended to
act systemically and, therefore, are regulated as drugs by the FDA and not as
pesticides by the EPA.  For example, topically applied flea control products
are usually regulated by EPA, whereas orally administered flea control products
generally fall under FDA's jurisdiction.  In those situations where violative
residues of pesticides are detected in animal-derived
human food products, FDA has the responsibility for regulatory
enforcement.<P>
 <B>Animal
Grooming Aids</B>
 <P>
 The animal counterpart of a cosmetic is commonly referred to as a
"grooming aid."  The Act defines a cosmetic as pertaining only to human use
(201(i)).  Therefore, products intended for cleansing or promoting
attractiveness of animals are not subject to FDA control. However, if such
products are represented for any therapeutic purpose or if they contain an
active drug ingredient they are subject to the Act as animal drugs. <P>
 
 
<B>The Drug Approval Process</B><P>
Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the term "drugs" means articles
recognized in the official United States Pharmacopeia, official Homeopathic
Pharmacopeia of the United States, or official National Formulary; articles
intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention
of disease in man or other animals; and articles other than food intended to
affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.  It
also includes articles intended for use as a component of a drug. 
	<P>
Once a product is determined to be a drug for animal use, the next step is to
determine whether or not it is a new animal drug.  The Act defines a new animal
drug (in part) as any drug intended for use for animals other than man, the
composition of which is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by
scientific training and experience, as safe and effective for use under the
conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling.  By virtue of
Supreme Court interpretations of the necessary basis for general  recognition,
there are, for all practical purposes, no animal drugs which are not also new
animal drugs. <P>
Before a new animal drug may receive FDA approval, it must be established by
scientific testing as  effective  and  safe  by the sponsor of the
drug product.  Effective  means that the product will do what it is
claimed it will do consistently and uniformly.   Safe  includes safety to
the animal, safety of food products derived from the animal, safety to persons
administering the drug or otherwise associated with the animal, and safety in
terms of the drug's impact on the environment.  The sponsor of a new animal
drug is responsible for conducting all appropriate testing to establish
effectiveness and safety.<P>
If the product is intended for use in a food-producing
animal, residues in food products must also be established as safe for human
consumption.  The sponsor must also develop analytical methods to detect and
measure drug residues in edible animal products.  It is the responsibility of
the drug sponsor (individual or firm seeking FDA approval of the drug product)
to conduct the necessary tests.<P>
The sponsor may select outside investigators to conduct clinical trials of the
drug as long as they are qualified by scientific training and experience, and
agree to comply with the investigational protocol and all applicable
regulations.  FDA has established regulations for non-clinical
investigations, such as toxicology studies, and regulations and guidelines for
conducting and monitoring clinical trials.<P>
When the sponsors believe that sufficient data have been collected to establish
the safety and effectiveness of their drug product, they may apply for
approval.  A New Animal Drug Application (NADA) is submitted along with
supporting data, including all adverse effects associated with the drug's use.
The NADA must also include information on the drug's chemistry;  composition
and component ingredients;  manufacturing methods, facilities, and controls;
proposed labeling; analytical methods for residue detection and analysis if
applicable;  an environmental impact assessment;  and other information.<P>
The FDA review of the NADA submitted by drug sponsors is very detailed and
comprehensive.  FDA scientists will determine whether the data have been
developed in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice Regulations and the
clinical trial guidelines.  If the studies were conducted properly, the data
are evaluated with respect to drug safety and effectiveness.  The animal safety
data for a drug product must relate to the dosage levels and routes of
administration proposed in the labeling.  The primary objective is to determine
the safety of the product relative to labeled usage.  Examples of some
questions that must be answered concerning the safety of the drug product to
the animal are:<P>
(1)  What is the toxicity in the target animal?<br>
(2)  Is the product a teratogen, carcinogen, or mutagen?<br>
(3)  What is the margin of safety?<br>
(4)  Are observed toxic effects (if any) reversible?<br>
(5)  Does the product affect reproduction?<P>
At the conclusion of the animal safety review, a summary is prepared which
explains why the product is safe or not shown to be safe.  If the product has
been shown to be safe but some restrictions or constraints on use are needed,
all warning and caution statements to be placed on the label must be enumerated
and included in the summary, as well as any expected side effects.<P>
All effectiveness data submitted must relate either directly or indirectly to
the specific label and labeling claims made for the product.  Basically, the
petitioner must demonstrate that the product produces the claimed effect.  As a
minimum, the data must have four basic attributes:<P>
(1)	The data must come from adequate and well-controlled
 studies.<br>
(2)	The data must demonstrate that the dose response relationship has been
established.<br>
(3)	The studies must have been performed in several locations so that any
geographic or environmental effects can be evaluated.<br>
(4)	The major portion of the data must come from studies in which the proposed
label dosages and routes of administration were used.<P>
Since no drug is absolutely safe or totally effective, approval of a drug
product from a target species standpoint must rest on an assessment of the
degree of acceptable risk when weighed against the potential therapeutic or
production improvement benefit.  Such risk/benefit weighing is not done with
respect to human food safety.<P>
With respect to human food safety, the Center for Veterinary Medicine makes a
threshold assessment of the carcinogenic potential of the drug.  In some cases,
sponsors are required to submit results of extensive testing to determine the
cancer-causing potential.  Food animal drugs that are cancer-producing, or
whose metabolites are cancer-producing, may be approved only if no harm comes
to the animal and there is no residue of the substance or its metabolites in
edible tissues reaching the consumer.  Extensive testing may be required to
establish the "no-residue" level based on a risk calculation.  In general,
sponsors of food animal drugs are required to submit toxicity and metabolism
studies, as well as residue depletion studies upon which FDA can base a
withdrawal time for the drug.<P>
Development of adequate methods for detecting drug residues and their
metabolites is frequently a very time-consuming
and expensive item in developing a new animal drug for food-producing
animals.  Analytical methods sensitive to levels that assure food safety may
have to be developed for muscle or other tissues.  The proposed residue
methodology must be validated prior to approval  of the NADA and must show
satisfactory performance in one USDA and two FDA laboratories.  If the method
proves to be practical, of sufficient sensitivity, and is validated in the
three laboratories, FDA will approve the method.<P>
When an NADA is approved, a regulation is published in the FEDERAL REGISTER
announcing its approval and is incorporated into the CODE OF FEDERAL
REGULATIONS.<P>
Under certain conditions, unapproved new animal drugs may be distributed and
used under the terms of investigational new animal drug applications (INADs).
The drugs must be used for research, i.e., for the collection of data intended
to be submitted in support of an NADA approval.  Regulations provide that such
drugs may be distributed for use only by experts, qualified by scientific
training and expertise, to investigate the safety and effectiveness of animal
drugs.<P>
 
<B> Classifying
RX and OTC Animal Drugs</B>
 <P>
FDA has the responsibility for determining the marketing status (prescription
or over-the-
counter)
of animal drug products based on whether or not it is possible to prepare
"adequate directions for use" under which a layperson can use the drugs safely
and effectively.  An animal drug which because of its toxicity or other
potential for harmful effects, or method of its use, or the collateral measures
necessary for its use, is not safe for animal use except under the professional
supervision of a licensed veterinarian is an Rx drug and can be dispensed only
by or upon the lawful written order of a licensed veterinarian.  Products for
which adequate directions for lay use can be written must be labeled for over-the-
counter
(OTC) use under existing law.  If adequate directions cannot be written, the
prescription (Rx) system provides a method of distribution and control which is
intended to assure that the Rx product reaches only the hands of persons
trained to use the product.  This can include, in addition to the veterinarian,
animal owners or managers whom the veterinarian has determined are capable of
using the product safely under the practitioner's supervision.<P>
Safe use includes safety to the animal, safety of food products derived from
the animal, safety to the persons associated with the animal, and safety in
terms of the drug's impact on the environment.<P>
Effective use of a drug product assumes that an accurate diagnosis can be made
with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the drug can be properly
administered, and that the course of the disease can be followed so that the
success or lack of success of the product can be observed.<P>
The same drug substances can be marketed in a number of different dosage forms,
intended for use by different routes of administration, and in different
species of animals.  Thus, these drug products may be appropriately labeled Rx
in some cases and OTC in others.<P>
Rx products must bear the legend:  <P>
 "Caution:  Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a
licensed veterinarian." <P>
 
 
<B>Dispensing Veterinary Prescription Drugs</B><P>
 Since adequate directions for safe and effective lay use cannot be written
for veterinary prescription drug products, such products can only be sold to or
on the prescription or other order of a licensed veterinarian (Section 503
(f)).  Prior to being sold or dispensed, they must remain in the possession of
a person or firm regularly and lawfully engaged in the manufacture,
transportation, storage, or wholesale or retail distribution of veterinary
prescription drug products.  The drug products may be distributed only by
persons or firms authorized by state and local laws. <P>
 Sale (dispensing, shipping, or otherwise making available for use in
animals) to the layperson of a veterinary prescription drug product may be made
only by or on the bona fide prescription or other order of a licensed
veterinarian.  The FDA has interpreted the word "prescription"  to apply only
to the practitioner's direction to a pharmacist.   Because some states
authorize persons other than pharmacists to dispense prescription drug products
on a veterinarian's instructions the term "other order" is used when
instructions are for a legally authorized dispenser who is not a pharmacist.
In both cases the instructions and their intent are the same and the dispenser
may not dispense an Rx drug product without a veterinarian's explicit
authorization. <P>
 Sale of a veterinary prescription legend drug product to a layperson, except
on a prescription or on order of a licensed practitioner, causes the product to
be misbranded since it fails to bear adequate directions for lay use and does
not meet all the requirements of the exemption, and subjects the seller to
civil and/or criminal provisions of the Act. <P>
 A licensed veterinarian may legally use or dispense a veterinary
prescription drug product only within the course of his/her professional
practice where a valid veterinarian-client-
patient
relationship <a href="#fn2">[3]</a>  exists. <A NAME="fnb2"> Veterinarians </a>
employed by drug manufacturers or distributors may not legally dispense
prescription drug products to laypersons unless they meet the above criteria.
Similarly, practicing veterinarians or their employees may not legally sell
veterinary prescription drug products to walk-in
customers unless the same criteria are met. <P>
 Federal regulations require that drug manufacturers provide at least the
following information on the label of the finished package form of veterinary
prescription drug products: <P>
 (1)	the statement, "Caution:  Federal law restricts this drug to use by or
on the order of a licensed veterinarian"; <br>
(2)	recommended or usual dosage;<br>
(3)	the route of administration, if it is not for oral use;<br>
(4)	the quantity or proportion of each active ingredient;<br>
(5)	the names of inactive ingredients if it is for other than oral use;<br>
(6)	an identifying lot or control number;<br>
(7)	manufacturer, packer, or distributor's name and address; and<br>
(8)	net quantity contents.<P>
When issuing a prescription or other order, the veterinarian must inform the
dispenser as to the information to be placed on the labeling of the dispensed
product which must include at a minimum the information listed below:<P>
(1)	name and address of the dispenser;<br>
(2)	serial number and date of the order or its filling;<br>
(3)	name and address of the veterinarian who prescribed or ordered the drug
product;<br>
(4)	directions for use; and<br>
(5)	any necessary cautionary statements including withdrawal times.<P>
Any additional requirements of state or local laws for dispensed veterinary
drug products must also be followed.<P>
To protect themselves and their clients, veterinarians should make efforts to
ensure their instructions are followed, especially when they prescribe or
recommend drugs for food-producing animals that require a withdrawal period.<P>
 
 
<B>Drugs in Animal Feeds (Medicated Feeds)</B><P>
 Anyone who adds drugs to feed is subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act.  Just as each label claim for a new animal drug must be approved,
so too must the drug be specifically approved for administration in animal
feed. Approvals are issued only for the uses, claims and drug levels which have
been shown to be safe and effective by adequate and well-controlled studies.
When the new animal drug application for use of the compound in animal feed is
approved, a regulation is published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.  The feed must be
labeled in accordance with the regulations if sold or delivered to a second
party. <P>
 Veterinarians (whether practicing or employed by a feed manufacturer) may
only direct a drug to be mixed into feed for uses and at potency levels
specifically permitted in 21 CFR Part 558.  The person or firm mixing a
medicated feed must be registered with the FDA as a drug manufacturer and hold
an approved medicated feed application (Form FDA 1900) unless exempted by
regulation from registering and obtaining such approval. <P>
 If a drug has been added to animal feed for uses or at levels not specified
in the regulations, a violation of the Act has occurred.  Any individual
authorizing the violation, as well as the individual illegally mixing the feed
may be subject to regulatory action.  Additionally, the feed itself may be
subject to seizure.      <P>
 
 
<B>Responsibility for Illegal Residues in Meat, Fish, Milk, and
Eggs</B><P>
 FDA is responsible for programs and regulatory actions aimed at preventing
illegal drug residues in human food products derived from treated animals.
(For regulatory purposes, live animals are considered unprocessed food.)
Illegal drug residues in edible products can constitute a hazard to the health
of persons consuming such food.  Failure to observe label withdrawal periods
before slaughter or processing, or failure to withhold milk is the principal
cause of illegal drug residues.  Other causes may include failure to follow
other label directions, poor feed manufacturing practices, and human
negligence.   <P>
 FDA is also charged with ensuring that contaminants of feed origin do not
result in unsafe contamination in human food of animal origin.  Regardless of
the cause, it is FDA's policy to hold responsible any individual in the
production and marketing chain who can be shown to have caused (by an act of
commission or omission) illegal residues or other contaminants in edible animal
products <a href="#fn3">[4]</a> . <A NAME="fnb3"> Livestock</a> dealers may
also be subject to enforcement action if they market animals containing illegal
residues and have failed to take reasonable precautions to prevent the sale of
adulterated food.  If justified by the facts, legal charges will be considered
against these individuals.  If a veterinarian prescribes, dispenses, or treats
an animal(s) with a drug which results in the occurrence of an illegal drug
residue in edible products from the treated animal, the veterinarian may be
held responsible for having caused a violation of law.  
 
  <P>
<B>Compounding of Animal Drugs</B><P>
In general, compounding an animal or human drug--whether from an
approved drug or an unapproved drug--is not permitted by the Act.  This is true
even if the compounder is a veterinarian or a pharmacist.  Two courts of appeal
have held that bulk drugs may not be sold to veterinarians for compounding.
Nevertheless, CVM acknowledges the medical need for compounding may exist
within certain areas of veterinary practice.  The contemporary practice of
veterinary medicine requires products to treat hundreds of conditions and
diseases in dozens of species. However, business and market realities in the
animal health industry can only provide a fraction of products necessary for
these indications.  Consequently, veterinarians continue to require products to
treat diseases or conditions in animals for which no FDA-approved product is
available.  Veterinarians must by necessity on occasion utilize products that
are compounded to meet a specific medical need. Thus, the agency may exercise
its enforcement discretion to permit compounding in certain instances.  Contact
CVM to obtain details of the enforcement discretion policy.<P>
 <B>Extra-label
Use of New Animal Drugs in Food-producing
Animals</B> <P>
"Extra-label
use" refers to the actual or intended use of a new animal drug in a food-producing
animal in a manner that is not in accordance with the approved drug labeling.
If an approved new animal drug is used for an unlabeled purpose, it is deemed
unsafe under Section 512 (a)(1)(B) and is in violation of the law.  Extra-label
use includes, but is not limited to, use in species or for indications (disease
or other conditions) not listed in the labeling, use at dosage levels other
than those stated in the labeling, and failure to observe the stated withdrawal
time. <P>
It has been FDA's position that veterinarians may be subject to regulatory
action for any violative drug residues in human food resulting from their
prescriptions, recommendations, or treatments contrary to label instructions.
Similarly, <u>anyone</u> in the producing or marketing chain who could be shown
to have caused illegal drug residues through extra-label use of drugs in
food-producing animals is subject to regulatory action.  In contrast, under
usual circumstances veterinary practitioners may consider the extra-label use
of drug products in non-food-producing animal practice without ordinarily being
subject to FDA enforcement actions.<a
href="#fn4">[5]</a>  <A NAME="fnb4">In </a>rare circumstances, for example, when
the health of the treated animals is harmed, regulatory attention by FDA would
be considered, or preferably, referred to the State veterinary licensing
authority for investigation.  <P>
The use or intended use of new animal drugs in treating food-producing
animals in any manner other than in accord with the approved labeling causes
the drugs to be adulterated under sections 501(a)(5) and (6), 512 (a)(1)(A) and
(B), and/or 512 (a)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.   The
agency will consider regulatory action when such use or intended use is found,
whether by a veterinarian, producer, or other person.  Regulatory actions will
also be considered against distributors and others who might cause adulteration
of approved new animal drugs.  Nevertheless, extra-label drug use in treating
food-producing animals may be considered by a veterinarian when the health of
animals is immediately threatened and suffering or death would result from
failure to treat affected animals.  Extra-label use of  drugs may be considered
by food animal veterinarians only when:<P>
(1)	A careful medical diagnosis is made by an attending veterinarian within
the context of a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship;<P>
(2)	A determination is made that (a) there is no marketed drug specifically
labeled to treat the condition diagnosed, or (b) drug therapy at the dosage
recommended by the labeling has been found clinically ineffective by the
veterinarian in the animals to be treated;<P>
(3)	Procedures are instituted to assure that identity of the treated
animals is carefully maintained;<P>
(4)	Significantly extended time period is assigned for drug withdrawal
prior to marketing meat, milk, or eggs; steps are taken to assure that the
assigned timeframes are met, and no illegal residues occur; and<P>
(5)	The prescribed or dispensed extra-label drug (prescription legend or
over-the-counter) bears labeling information which is adequate to assure the
safe and proper use of the product.   At a minimum, the following label
information is recommended:<P>
The name and address of the veterinary practitioner<P>
The established name of the drug (active ingredient), or if formulated from
more than one ingredient, the established name of each ingredient.<P>
Any directions for use specified by the practitioner (including
class/species or identification of the animals; and the dosage, frequency,
route of administration, and duration of therapy).<P>
Any cautionary statements specified by the veterinarian.<P>
The veterinarian's specified withdrawal/discard time(s) for meat, milk,
eggs, or any food which might be derived from the treated animals.<P>
Extra-label use of drugs in treating food-producing animals may, under this
policy, be considered only in special circumstances.  The "exempting" criteria
do not include drug use in treating food-producing animals by the layman.  Lay
persons cannot be expected to have sufficient knowledge and understanding
concerning animal diseases, pharmacology, toxicology, drug interactions, and
other scientific parameters to use drugs in any way other than as labeled.
<P>
Certain drugs may not be used in treating food-producing animals even under
the cited criteria.  These drugs are:<P>
In all food-producing animals:<P>
	Chloramphenicol<br>
Clenbuterol<br>
	Diethylstilbestrol<br>
	Dimetridazole	<br>
	Ipronidazole<br>
	Other nitroimidazoles<br>
	Furazolidone (except for approved topical use)<br>
	Nitrofurazone (except for approved topical use)<P>
In lactating dairy cattle:<P>
Sulfonamide drugs (except approved use of sulfadimethoxine,
sulfabromomethazine, and sulfaethoxypyridazine).<br>
	<P>
Extra-label uses of drugs in treating food-producing animals for improving
rate of weight gain, feed efficiency, or other production purposes, or for
routine disease prevention are inappropriate as is the use for therapeutic
purposes other than under the circumstances described above.  A drug (including
a bulk drug) may not be mixed into feed for any use or at a potency level not
specifically permitted by the regulations in 21 CFR Part 558, even if
prescribed by a veterinarian.
 <P>
<B>Veterinary Use of Human-labeled drug products </B><P>
 FDA is aware that human-labeled drug products have been promoted and
distributed by manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies for use in animals
and that such drugs are being prescribed, dispensed, and administered by
veterinarians for animal use. <P>
 Promotion of human-labeled drug products for veterinary use by these
sources has included advertising animal use in veterinary publications;
distribution of labeling and promotional materials, suggesting or recommending
use of these products in animals; or oral statements from sales personnel
describing or recommending use in animals.  Such promotion causes the drugs to
be misbranded under Section 502 (f)(1), or adulterated new animal drugs under
Section 501(a)(5), or both.  Furthermore, such promotion may subvert the new
animal drug approval process by creating a disincentive for drug manufacturers
to seek such approval. <P>
 FDA is very concerned about the use of human-labeled
drugs in food-producing
animals because of the increased potential of illegal drug residues in meat,
milk, and eggs. Human-labeled
drug products have not undergone testing for residue depletion from edible
tissues, thus, appropriate withdrawal times to avoid illegal residues in food
can only be estimated.   <P>
 Nevertheless, there are legitimate and important veterinary needs for
human-labeled
drugs in the treatment of disease or to prevent pain in food-producing
animals in instances where there simply are no animal drug products available
that would avoid animal suffering or death <a
href=" #fn5">[6]</a> . <A NAME="fnb5"> Examples </a> include analgesics and
anesthetics for pain, sedation, and surgery, insulin for ketosis, and antidotes
for poisoning. <P>
 Most veterinary use of human-labeled drug products occurs in non-food
animal practice (companion, sporting, exotic, etc.).  Many diseases of pets and
other non-food
animals cannot be treated in accordance with current standards of veterinary
practice without the use of human-labeled
drugs because approved drug products bearing veterinary labeling often do not
exist.  FDA has generally refrained from taking enforcement actions in this
area because there is no expected adverse impact upon the public health.  In
rare circumstances, when the health of the treated animals is harmed,
regulatory attention by FDA would be considered or, preferably, referred to the
State veterinary licensing authority for investigation. <P>
 Dispensing pharmacists are required to label dispensed drugs in
accordance with the prescribing veterinarian's instructions, including the name
and address of the dispenser, the serial number and date of the order or of its
filing, the name of the licensed veterinarian, directions for use, and any
cautionary statements.   <P>
 Use of human-labeled
drug products in food-production
animals should be limited to those cases where appropriate veterinary-labeled
therapy does not exist.  It is unacceptable to use a human-labeled
product for common disease conditions in food animals because approved
veterinary-labeled
drug products, e.g., antibacterials, anti-inflammatory
agents, etc. are available.  The food animal veterinarian assumes greater
responsibility when he or she uses a human-labeled drug rather than a
veterinary drug.  Use of human-labeled
drugs may be considered by food animal veterinarians only when they have
 <P>
 made a careful and definitive diagnosis and evaluation of the condition
for which the drug is to be used, and are operating within the confines of
 a valid veterinary/client/patient/relationship;<P>
made a deliberate determination that there is no other appropriate
veterinary-labeled
therapy; i.e., there is no marketed veterinary-labeled drug product
specifically labeled for the disease condition to be treated or the veterinary
drug has been found clinically ineffective by the veterinarian in the animals
to be treated; and<P>
taken adequate steps to prevent the occurrence of illegal residues in
edible animal products.  This should include a review of the best available
toxicological and tissue distribution and tissue residue depletion data and
establishment of an extra long drug withdrawal period prior to marketing meat,
milk, or eggs.  The animal owner or manager should be given explicit written
withdrawal instructions.  The practitioner should have a high degree of
confidence that the client will follow the drug withdrawal
instructions.<P>
Regulatory action will be considered when an illegal residue occurs even if
the veterinarian followed the foregoing precautions.  The enforcement
discretion that might be accorded to veterinarians will not be extended to lay
persons, e.g., owners, who administer human-labeled
drugs either to food-producing or non-food animals without the supervision of a
licensed veterinarian operating within the framework of a valid
veterinarian/client/patient relationship.<P>
Veterinarians are expected to follow cautionary handling and disposal
provisions, if any, specified in human drug labeling to protect handlers and
the environment.  The highest priority for regulatory attention is illegal
tissue residues from human-labeled
drugs, and manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies who promote the
substitution of human-labeled
drug products for animal drugs for economic reasons.
<P>
<B>Reporting Adverse Drug Reactions</B><P>
 Users of new animal drug products are encouraged to notify the product's
sponsor of any unexpected or adverse reactions resulting from the use of that
product. The sponsor is responsible for establishing and maintaining records
concerning experiences with the drugs and for submitting reports of those
experiences to FDA. Among the data which must be submitted are reports of
injury, toxicity, sensitivity reaction, unexpected incidence or severity of side-effects
associated with use, or failure of the drug to exhibit expected pharmacological
action.  FDA scientists analyze these data to determine if any modifications
are needed in the drug's labeling, dosage level, etc., to prevent future
adverse reactions.  In extreme instances, the adverse reactions may be so
severe as to require withdrawal of approval of the drug.  However, because of
the extensive premarketing approval process, this rarely occurs. <P>
 FDA also encourages direct reporting of adverse drug reactions by
veterinarians. The reports should be submitted on Form FDA 1932a, Veterinary
Adverse Reaction, Lack of Effectiveness, or Product Defect Report .  This is
a pre-addressed,
postage-paid
form which is filled out and dropped in the mail by the veterinarian. Copies of
the form are usually available from state veterinary medical associations,
clinics of colleges of veterinary medicine, USDA Extension Service
veterinarians, and FDA offices.  FDA may occasionally need more detailed
information about an incident, and the veterinarian may be called by a FDA
staff veterinarian.  In any event all forms are acknowledged by letter and
another form is sent for future use.<P>
Adverse reactions may be reported by telephone during normal working hours
(7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  Eastern Standard/Daylight Time) by calling collect 301-594-1751,
or after hours by dialing direct 301-594-0797.
 In the second case a message is recorded and the call is returned by a
veterinarian the following working day.<P>
 
 
<B>Types of FDA Regulatory Actions</B><P>
The objective of FDA regulatory programs is to assure compliance with the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  Specific enforcement activities include
actions to correct and prevent violations, remove violative products or goods
from the market, and punish offenders.  The type of enforcement varies with the
nature of the violation.  These range from a letter notifying the individual or
firm of a violation and requesting correction, to criminal prosecution of the
individual or firm. Findings of adulteration or misbranding usually lead to an
individual who failed to take steps to assure compliance with the law.  Such
individuals can be charged as violators and if guilty are subject to the
penalties specified by the law.<P>
<i>Warning letters</i> - are sent to the individuals, advising them of specific
noted violations.  These letters request a written response as to the steps
which will be taken to correct the violation.  These letters constitute one
form of warning that can be issued under current Agency policy.  <P>
<i>Criminal prosecution</i>- -may be recommended in appropriate cases for
violation of Section 301 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  Misdemeanor
convictions, which do not require proof of intent to violate the Act, can
result in fines and/or imprisonment up to one year.  Felony convictions, which
apply in the case of a second violation or intent to defraud or mislead, can
result in fines and/or imprisonment up to three years.  Fines (misdemeanor or
felony) can be as high as $500,000 or more. <P>
Under current FDA policy, criminal prosecution is usually but not always
preceded by a Warning Letter or some other form of warning to the firm or
individual(s) involved and opportunity for an informal meeting.<P>
<i>Seizure -</i>
An action brought under admiralty proceedings against an FDA-regulated product
which is in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for being
adulterated and/or misbranded.  The purpose is to remove a specific lot of
goods from the channels of commerce.<P>
<i>Injunction -</i>
A writ granted by a court whereby one is required to do or refrain from doing a
specific act.  FDA may seek injunctions against individuals and/or corporations
to prevent them from violating or causing violations of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act.<P>
The FDA field offices have primary responsibility for conducting inspections or
investigations and collecting samples which may lead to recommending regulatory
action.  The type of action recommended will depend upon the nature of the
violation and the public health concern, Agency policy, previous history of
violations by the firm, and other factors.  FDA headquarters offices generally
review enforcement actions for approval.  Some recommendations for regulatory
action are transmitted to the Justice Department for its review and action.<P>

Misdemeanor fines under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act may reach
$500,000 under some circumstances.<P>
The Criminal Fine Enforcement Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-596) provides for
fines for Federal law violations.  Although the act is an amendment to the
criminal statutes, not the FD&amp;C Act, it applies to all fines levied under
the FD&amp;C Act, other statutes that contain provisions enforced by FDA, and
to all Federal crimes in Federal law.<P>
The following fines are applicable for each offense:<P>
Up to $100,000 for a misdemeanor by a corporation or individual that does not
result in death.<P>
Up to $250,000 for a misdemeanor by an individual that results in death,
or a felony.<P>
Up to $500,000 for a misdemeanor by a corporation that results in death,
or a felony.<P>
The maximum imprisonment for a misdemeanor under the FD&amp;C Act remains a
year for each offense.<P>
 

<B> Interaction
with the Food and Drug Administration</B>

mission under a policy of openness and free communication.  All parties are
best served when there is clear understanding of the FDA's regulations and
policies and how they are administered.  By operating under this policy, FDA
hopes to create confidence in, and support for, programs that are intended to
promote and protect the health and well being of all. <P>
 FDA encourages anyone to contact the Agency for assistance, to supply
information, or to report a problem with a product.  To help direct requests to
the proper location for a rapid response, we offer the following

<B> Glossary </B>
 <p>
<B> Adulteration :</B>  A violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
which includes products that are defective, unsafe, not shown to be safe,
filthy, or produced under insanitary conditions.  It also includes products
which are manufactured under procedures and controls which do not comply with
Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations as well as new animal drug
products which are not the subject of an NADA approval.  Detailed definitions
of adulteration are in the Act itself, and have been developed in regulations
and by the courts.<P>
<B> Adverse Drug Reaction :</B>  An unexpected side effect, injury, toxicity,
sensitivity reaction, or unexpected incidence or severity of side effects
associated with use of a new animal drug product.  The failure of a new animal
drug product to exhibit expected pharmacological action also is an adverse drug
reaction.<P>
 <B>Animal Feed:  </B> An article which is intended for use as a substantial
source of nutrients in the diet of the animal.  It is not limited to a mixture
intended to be the sole ration of the animal.<P>
<B> Biologics :</B>  see  Veterinary Biologics <P>
<B> Device : </B> An instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance,
implant, <i>in vitro</i> reagent, or other similar or related article,
including any component part or accessory, which is intended for use in the
diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation,
treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or intended to
affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and
which does not achieve any of its principal intended purposes through chemical
action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent
upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its principal intended
purposes.<P>
<B> Drug:  </B> An article (1) recognized in the official United States
Pharmacopeia, official Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States, or
official National Formulary, or any supplement to any of them; (2) intended for
use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in
man or other animals;  (3) intended to affect the structure or any function of
the body of man or other animals;  and (4) intended for use as a component of
any articles specified in clause (1), (2), or (3);  but does not include
devices or their components, parts, or accessories.<P>
 <B>Electronic Animal Identification Products: </B>  Implantable transponders
which contain unique information for use in animal identification.  A reader
compatible with the transponder is used to make the final identification.
These transponders are implanted into inedible portions of the animal (e.g.,
ear) and if the implant is rendered for animal feed, the Center is regulating
the transponder as a food additive.<P>
<B> Extra-Label Use : </B> Refers to the actual or intended use of an approved new animal drug
in a manner that is not in accordance with the approved label directions.
<P>
<B> Food Additive: </B>  Any substance the intended use of which result or may

component or otherwise affecting the characteristics of any food including any
source of radiation, unless the substance is considered generally recognized as
safe (GRAS).<P>
<B> Injunction :</B>  A writ granted by a court whereby one is required to do or
refrain from doing a specific act.  FDA may seek injunctions against
individuals and/or corporations to prevent them from violating or causing
violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.<P>
 <B>Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD) :</B>  Statutory authority to exempt
new animal drugs from the requirements of an approved new animal drug
application is found in Section 512 (j)  of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act.  This exemption specifically limits the distribution of
unapproved new animal drugs only for use by experts, qualified by scientific
training and experience, to investigate the safety and effectiveness of animal
drugs.  In order to distribute a new animal drug for clinical investigations,
an exemption from the requirements of an approved new animal drug application
must be claimed.  This is accomplished by the submission of certain information
referred to as an INAD (Investigational New Animal Drug) application.<P>
<B> Labeling :  </B>All labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter (1)
upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers or (2) accompanying such
article.<P>

 A valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship, as defined by the
American Veterinary Medical Association is: <br>

 "An appropriate veterinarian-client-patient relationship will exist when:
(1) the veterinarian has assumed the responsibility for making medical
judgements regarding the health of the animal(s) and the need for medical
treatment, and the client (owner or caretaker) has agreed to follow the
instructions of the veterinarian; and when (2) there is sufficient knowledge of
the animal(s) by the veterinarian to initiate at least a general or preliminary
diagnosis of the medical condition of the animal(s).  This means that the
veterinarian has recently seen and is personally acquainted with the keeping
and care of the animal(s), and/or by medically appropriate and timely visits to
the premises where the animals are kept; and when (3) the practicing
veterinarian is readily available for follow-up in case of adverse reactions or
failure of the regimen of therapy."<A HREF="#fnb2">Back</A><p>

<body>
<H3>About NADE - FDA CVM Pre-Marketing (NADE)</H3>
<P>

The Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation (NADE) is responsible for reviewing
information submitted by drug sponsors who wish to obtain approval to manufacture and
sell animal drugs.  A new animal drug is deemed unsafe unless there is an approved
new animal drug application.  Virtually all animal drugs are "new animal drugs"
within the meaning of the term in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
<P>
NADE determines whether or not an animal drug should be approved for marketing. 
Before a new animal drug may receive FDA approval, it must be clinically tested for
effectiveness and safety.  If a product is intended for use in a food-producing
animal, it must also be tested for safety to human consumers, and the edible animal
products must be free of unsafe drug residues.  The sponsor must also develop
analytical methods to detect and measure drug residues in edible animal products.  It
is the responsibility of the drug sponsor (the individual or firm seeking FDA
approval of the drug product) to conduct the necessary tests.
<P>
NADE performs the following tasks in their review of applications:
<ul>
<li>Evaluates the safety  and effectiveness  of new animal drugs.

<li>Evaluates the safety for human consumption of drug residues in food derived
from treated animals.

<li>Evaluates the effect of animal drugs on the environment.

<li>Determines the adequacy of information submitted for proposed use of
investigational new animal drugs.

<li>Evaluates manufacturing methods and procedures for new animal drug products.

<li>Recommends to the Center Director appropriate action on new animal drug
applications and abbreviated new animal drug applications (for generic drugs).

<li>Coordinates the development and implementation of regulations and policies
pertaining to new drugs intended for animal use 
</ul>
<P>
When a sponsor feels that adequate data have been gathered to support the safety and
effectiveness requirements of a new animal drug, the data are organized and submitted
as a New Animal Drug Application (NADA).  
<P>
An "original" NADA (the initial application for approval of a new animal drug) should
contain all of the following information:
<P>
<ul>
<li>A signed copy of the FD 356V (New Animal Drug Application).

<li>A well-organized summary of the information in the application. 

<li>List of Components of the drug product and the resulting new drug substance
when they are combined.

<li>The amount of each component contained in the product.

<li>Full description of methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing,
processing and packing of the drug product.

<li>Samples of the product, if requested by CVM.

<li>Proposed labels and labeling.

<li>Full reports of investigations in animals and humans to prove the safety and
effectiveness for the proposed use.  If the product is to be used in food animals,
full reports related  to the impact of the drug on the resulting food products are
required.

<li>An accompanying Environmental Assessment as required by 21 CFR 25.31.

<li>A Freedom of Information Summary of the data used in determining if the
product is safe and effective.

<li>A Bioresearch Monitoring Statement as required by 21 CFR 514.1(b)(4)(ii).
</ul>
<P>
Pre-marketing divisions are responsible for reviewing NADAs  -- The Toxicology staff
evaluates the safety to the target animal, the public, and the environment; the
Biometrics staff provides statistical analysis of submitted data; and the Chemistry
staff evaluates the manufacturing processes, quality control, and residue levels in
the edible animal tissues.
<P>
During the review process, a sponsor may make changes or "amendments" to information
contained in an NADA.  These amendments must also be reviewed by the pre-marketing
staff.
<P>
If the pre-marketing divisions decide the information in the NADA shows the drug will
be safe and effective for its intended use, a recommendation is provided to the
Center Director that the NADA should be approved.  If the Director agrees, he/she
approves the application and publishes a notice of approval in the Federal Register.
<P>
Following approval of an NADA, the sponsor may propose changes.  These changes may
range from a simple manufacturing change to a major new claim in a new species, and
are submitted in supplemental NADAs.  While the extent of the review is wholly
dependent upon the extent of the proposed changes, the same general review process is
followed. 
<P>
For additional information on the authorization of Investigational New Animal Drugs
(INAD) and the review of NADAs and ANADAs by CVM's pre-marketing group, refer to the
following:
<P>
<ul>

<li>21 CFR 511 and 514.

<li>CVM Staff Manual Guides 1240.3000, 1240.3010, 1240.3030, and 1240.3100.

<li>The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Section 512.
</ul>
CVM's pre-marketing group is involved in two processes in regulating the interstate
shipment of animal drug products.  The first process, the Investigational New Animal
Drug exemption (INAD),  involves the interstate shipment of experimental drugs used
for testing in animals.  This testing may require drugs be given to animals that will
later be used to produce human food products.  FDA must ensure that the food products
derived from these experimental animals will be safe for human consumption.
<P>
The second process is the NADA review.  It includes the evaluation of data regarding
an animal drug's safety to the target animal and to humans who might consume products
from the treated animal; the review also evaluates effectiveness for the purposes
claimed.  To be legally marketed, a new animal drug product must be approved under an
NADA.
<P>
NADA sponsors usually include university researchers, contract researchers, private
practitioners, drug manufacturers, and/or feed or food manufacturers in their
protocols.  The activities of the investigators are monitored through the bioresearch
monitoring program.  Their data generation processes are validated through on-site
inspections by FDA field personnel.  Reports covering laboratory practices relating
to toxicology and safety research, and the functions of clinical investigators and
sponsors are forwarded to CVM for evaluation. 
<P>
A sponsor must conduct certain tests to show that a drug is safe for the target
animal, has the intended effect, and that edible products derived from treated
animals are safe for human consumption.  If animals receiving an investigational drug
are to be slaughtered for consumption, authorization to do so is needed from the FDA.
 These animals must be slaughtered in a federally inspected facility.  The USDA, in
coordination with the FDA, provides for a USDA inspector to monitor the slaughter of
research animals intended for human consumption.
<P>
Once an INAD exemption has been granted according to the requirement of the FFDCA,
the sponsor must do the following:
</ul>
<li>Assure the proper and safe packaging and labeling of investigational drugs.

<li>Report the names and locations of investigators to whom drugs are shipped.

<li>Maintain records of all drug shipments and of all reports received from
investigators.

<li>Notify FDA immediately if a safety problem is observed.

<li>Notify FDA or USDA prior to slaughter of animals treated with the
investigational drug.
</ul>
<P>
To market a generic animal drug product in the United States, a person or a company
must obtain approval of an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA).  Under
the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, a generic animal
drug product may be approved by providing evidence that it has the same active
ingredients, in the same concentration, as the approved animal drug product, and that
it is bioequivalent to the approved animal drug product.  This information is
submitted to NADE in the form of an ANADA.

<H3>Conventions used in FDA CVM hypertext documents</H3> 
<hr><P>

The current version of the Hyper-Text Markup Language does not support many
symbols, characters and format types that are commonly used in technical
documents such as these.  We are working within these restrictions, and feel it
is important that you read this guide to the conventions we use.


<P><B> Subscripts</B> will be represented as follows: <P> OA(t1/2) or X(T)<P>
where t1/2  and T are meant to be subscripted.  
<P> <B>Superscripts</B>
will be represented as follows: <P> 14^2 <P> where 2 is meant to be
superscripted.  Whatever appears after the ^ symbol 
is the portion to consider superscripted. <P>

<B>Tables:</B>  All tables are presented in monospaced preformatted format.  If tables are 
wider than 80 characters, there will be an <B>Editor's Note</B> describing the number
 of columns.  You may have to scroll from side to side to view all of some tables. Your browser must use a monospaced font
for preformatted text.  If a porportional font is used, the tables will no longer
line up properly.<P><B> Footnotes:</B> Footnotes can be handled in several
ways:<P> Footnotes may be hyperlinked, so you may click on the footnote
reference to read the footnote, and then follow another link back to the
reference point. <P>  Footnotes may be referenced in parenthesis - as in
(footnote 1), or just (1) or as a bolded number. 
Footnotes usually will be at the bottom of the document containing the
reference but may be included where referenced in the text.
<P> 
<B>Special Characters:</B> Here is a listing of special characters
and their names. If the name of the symbol does not match what your browser
shows, please contact the webmaster of this site. <P>

<TITLE>ABOUT THE FDA CVM - CONCLUSION</TITLE>
<H3>ABOUT THE FDA CVM - CONCLUSION</H3>

The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine is responsible for ensuring that animal drugs and
medicated feeds are safe and effective for their intended uses and that food from
treated animals is safe for human consumption.  Before a new animal drug can be marketed
in the U.S.,  it must be approved by the FDA on the basis of quality, safety, and
efficacy.  When the drug is for use in food-producing animals, not only must the safety
to the animal be demonstrated, but also the safety of food products derived from the
treated animals that are intended for human consumption.
<P>
Once approved products are on the market, the Center monitors the use of the products
through surveillance and compliance programs.
<P>
One of CVM's highest priorities is assuring the safety of the food supply through
elimination of violative residues in meat and milk.  And, because of that work and  the
cooperative efforts of all  FDA employees, the United States can boast the safest food
supply in the world.

ANIMAL
FEEDS ACTIVITIES
</b>
<P>
<b>
<a name="RTFToC48">Biotechnology</a></b>
<P>
Division of Animal Feeds (DAF) worked with senior FDA officials and the Center
for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) to develop a policy for
evaluating information collected by plant biotechnology firms that are striving
to comply with the 1992 FDA policy on new plant varieties.  In addition, CFSAN
and/or CVM met with the sponsors of seven transgenic plants and reviewed
reports which included the specifics of the genetic transfer and analytical
data on the expression products, nutrients, and toxicants.  DAF had significant
input on the cotton and soybean decisions since by-products of these plants are
major animal feed ingredients.  It was concluded that the FDA consultation
process was finished for the seven products: herbicide-resistant cotton,
herbicide-resistant soybean, three delayed-ripening tomatoes, pest-resistant
potato, and virus-resistant squash.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC49">Selenium</a></b>
<P>
As required under the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) on September 6, 1993, FDA published a notice in the FEDERAL REGISTER (59
FR 45973) that stayed the 1987 amendments to the selenium food additive
regulation (21 CFR 573.920). In two separate actions in 1994, Congress passed
legislation that prohibits the Agency from enforcing the stay.  In FDA
Appropriations legislation, an amendment was included that suspended that stay
until December 31, 1995.  The second action, included in the Federal Crop
Insurance Reform Act, states that the FDA shall not implement or enforce the
stay unless the Commissioner of the FDA finds that selenium supplementation at
0.3 ppm in complete diets is not essential to maintain animal health, is not
safe to animals consuming the additive or humans consuming edible portions of
selenium-supplemented animals, is not effective to promote normal growth and
reproduction, and that the manufacture and use of supplemental selenium cannot
be reasonably controlled by adherence to current good manufacturing practice
requirements.<P>
As a result of these actions, the 1987 amendments are permanently in effect.
The maximum permitted supplementation levels are listed in Title 21, Part
573.920 of the CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS.  A CVM Update was prepared and
distributed that clarified the current status of the selenium food additive
regulation.<P>
<b>
<a name="RTFToC50">Inventory
of Type A Medicated Articles Facilities
</a></b>
<P>
We surveyed the Type A Medicated Articles sponsors for a listing of the drugs
manufactured and the manufacturing sites.  The information was entered into a
database housed in an X-base environment that can be linked with the Official
Establishment Inventory (OEI).  This linkage makes possible the on-line review
of each establishment's current compliance status.  A mechanism is in place to
add establishments upon notification from the Office of New Animal Drug
Evaluation (ONADE) that a drug or supplement has been approved.  Routine
reports can now be developed and <i>ad-hoc</i> queries can be performed.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC51">Food
Additive Petitions Approved
</a></b>
<P>
On November 8, 1993, a food additive regulation (21 CFR 573.920) was
established for the use of <i>Pichia pastoris </i>dried yeast as a source of
protein in feeds for broiler chickens at levels up to 10 percent of the total
diet.  The food additive must contain not less than 60 percent crude
protein.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC52">Food
Additive Petitions Filed
</a></b>
<P>
A notice of filing was published in the FEDERAL REGISTER on May 10, 1994,
(59FR24166) announcing that Kemin Industries, Inc. is proposing to amend the
food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of propionic acid as an
antimicrobial agent to control salmonella in animal feed and feed ingredients
when used at the rate of 10 kilograms per ton.<P>
A notice of filing was published in the FEDERAL REGISTER on August 11, 1994,
(59FR41326) announcing that Rhone-Poulenc Animal Nutrition is proposing to
amend the food additive regulation 21 CFR 573.870 to provide for the safe use
of poly(2-vinylpyridine-co-styrene) as a coating agent in the preparation of
rumen-stable, abomasum-dispersable nutrient products for dairy cattle and dairy
replacement heifers.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC53">Consulting
Reviews Provided for Food and Color Additives
</a></b>
<P>
On May 23, CFSAN approved a food additive petition (FAP) for the safe use of
aminoglycoside 3' phosphotransferase II {APH (3') II} as a processing aid in
the development of new varieties of tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton.  APH (3')
II is a protein encoded by the kanamycin resistance (<i>kan</i><sup>r</sup>)
gene which can be inserted into the respective plants using rDNA techniques.
CVM reviewed the FAP in respect to the effect of APH (3') II on animals and on
the stability of approved aminoglycosides (neomycin) in the presence of
products from the transgenic plants.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC54">Pet
Food Activities
</a></b>
<P>
CVM worked with the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) in
developing regulations to define the use of descriptive terms such as "lite"
and "low" on pet food labels.  The intent is to pattern the definitions in a
manner similar to those prescribed in the FDA regulations for human foods.  In
this way, the consumer is not confused by vastly different criteria for
establishing use of the terms on product labels.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC55">Olestra</a></b>
<P>
Following a request for assistance on a food additive petition under review by
CFSAN, the Animal Feed Safety Branch of CVM provided the primary review for
three dietary studies of Olestra, a synthetic fat substitute, in pigs.  The
review of a 12-week study is complete and a response to the sponsor's comments
was provided.  The 26-week and 39-week studies are under review.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC56">OUTREACH
ACTIVITIES:
</a></b><P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC57">International
Activities
</a></b>
<P>
The Division of Animal Feeds held several teleconference calls and one meeting
in Rockville, Maryland, with representatives of the Agriculture and Agri-Food
Canada and the Association of American Feed Control Officials.  The main thrust
of these sessions was to continue the harmonization process between Canada and
the United States.  These meetings have also served to maintain open
communication on subjects of common interest such as feed ingredients/food
additives, feed safety issues, biotechnology, and medicated feeds.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC58">Guidelines</a></b>
<P>
The Division of Animal Feeds prepared two draft guidelines to assist sponsors
of food additive petitions in collecting utility data.  A notice of
availability of one guideline entitled <i>"Guideline for the Evaluation of the
Utility of Food Additives in Diets Fed to Aquatic Animals"</i> was published in
the FEDERAL REGISTER on June 20, 1994; and a second notice of availability for
the guideline entitled <i>"Utility Studies for Anti-Salmonella Chemical Food
Additives in Animal Feeds"</i> published in the FEDERAL REGISTER on June 23,
1994.  The salmonella guideline was the subject of a public meeting in August,
1994, at Mississippi State University where the agency received written and
oral comments.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC59">APPLICATION
INTEGRITY POLICY
</a></b>
<P>
The Division of Compliance coordinates CVM's implementation of the Agency's
Application Integrity Policy.  This year we reviewed seven cases in which CVM
staff identified questionable data in animal drug applications.  After thorough
analysis of  records and inspectional findings, the Center determined that five
of the cases should be handled by other administrative procedures that are not
a part of the Agency's Application Integrity Policy.  In one case, our analysis
is on-going to determine if a pattern or practice of submission of untrue
statements of material facts to animal drug applications is detectable.  The
Center has continued to work with American Cyanamid to remedy data collection
and reporting practices as described by the agency's Application Integrity
Policy.  An additional case was brought to our attention by CDRH, we examined
our records to determine if information uncovered by CDRH investigations
influenced data submitted to CVM. We found the identified practice did not
influence the data submitted by the identified firm to CVM applications. <P>
<b>
<a name="RTFToC60">VETERINARY
MEDICINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE
</a></b>
<P>
The Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee (VMAC) reviews and evaluates
available data concerning the safety and effectiveness of marketed and
investigational new animal drugs, feeds, and devices for use in the treatment
and prevention of animal diseases and increased animal production and makes
appropriate recommendations to the Secretary, the Assistant Secretary for
Health, and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.<P>
The Committee twice during FY 94 in Rockville, Maryland.  The dates of these
meetings were November 9-10, 1993, and May 11-12, 1994.<P>
On November 9, 1993, the Committee met in an open session to provide advice on
a proposal to allow for flexible labeling of prescription animal drugs.  This
concept would allow a range of doses and a variety of treatment claims for
prescription drugs to be used by veterinarians.  The Committee felt that the
proposed approach to flexible labeling was based on sound scientific principles
established within the disciplines of pharmacology, microbiology and
pharmacokinetics.  The members supported, where appropriate, inclusion of the
following information in the labeling of drugs approved under flexible labeling
guidelines:<P>
1. Pharmacokinetic data and graphic illustrations of drug concentration-time
profiles.<P>
2. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) data for those pathogens with
efficacy claims approved and listed in the labeling.<P>
3. MIC data for minor pathogens which may contribute to the disease for which
treatment is indicated in the labeling, but for which there are no specific
label claims.<P>
4. Tissue penetration/drug distribution data.<P>
5. Target animal safety information/toxicity information.<P>
6. Dosage range (therapeutic window) information.<P>
7. Incompatibilities with other drugs/drug interactions.<P>
8. Indications for use.<P>
9. Directions for use.<P>
10. Withholding times.<P>
11. Contraindications/cautionary statements/warning statements.<P>
12. References to more detailed information in the scientific literature.<P>
The Committee also felt that the flexible labeling guidelines, as written,
adequately protect the public from unsafe residues because adequate information
on withholding times which correspond to doses in the therapeutic window will
be included in the labeling.  The discussion at the VMAC meeting was the
Agency's first public discussion regarding the proposed Flexible Labeling
Guideline.  The comments provided by the Committee members helped the Agency to
more sharply focus the guideline and to continue to move towards its adoption
and implementation.<P>
During the same session, the Committee also discussed what FDA could do to
insure maximum adoption by food animal producers of the guidance provided in
FDA Compliance Policy Guide 7125.37, <i>Proper Drug Use and Residue Avoidance
by Nonveterinarians</i>.  They recommended that the Agency prepare a
simplified, one-page version of the guide that captured the critical actions
expected of producers.  Then, working with other government units such as
USDA's Extension Service and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,
widely disseminate the information.  FDA has completed both of the recommended
actions.<P>
The meeting on November 10, 1993, was a closed session to permit discussion of
trade secret or confidential information.  The committee reviewed an
application for a new animal drug for use in a non-food animal that potentially
may be misused in food animals or diverted to illegal use in humans.  After
consideration of the presentations made and after Committee discussion, the
Committee reached the following conclusions:<P>
1.	The formulation under consideration offers no significant increased risk of
diversion and misuse as compared to currently available illicit sources of this
compound.<P>
2.	At this time, no extra restrictions (beyond those proposed by the sponsor)
should be applied to the legal distribution and sale of this product.<P>
The Committee's recommendations reinforced the findings of FDA reviewers.<br>
On May 11-12, 1994, the Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee met in joint
session with the Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee from the Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research.  The meeting was held to discuss the use of
fluoroquinolones in food animal medicine.  The members addressed the relative
benefits and risks to animals and humans of the use of fluoroquinolones in food
animals, in light of possible concerns about microbial resistance to
fluoroquinolones.  Specifically they were asked to provide their perspective on
the following questions:<P>
1.	Is there sufficient scientific basis for FDA action to place limitations on
fluoroquinolone use in animals?<P>
2.	What actions might FDA take to maximize benefits and minimize risks of
fluoroquinolone use in animals, for example, impose use restrictions, require
data generation, enhance drug use management, etc.?<P>
The Committee members generally agreed, explicitly or implicitly, that there is
a need for fluoroquinolones in food animals.  In response to Question 1, all
the members  answered "yes" -- either directly or by implication.  Committee
members made a number of different suggestions in response to Question 2.
Several members merely stated that there should be restrictions or limitations
without identifying specific measures.  Several members stated that the drugs
should be limited to therapeutic use.  Specific suggestions included:<P>
<i>Limit the drugs to prescription use.</i>  Nearly all members made this
recommendation.<P>
<i>Monitor resistance levels.</i>  This was virtually a unanimous
recommendation.<P>
<i>Measures to assure appropriate dosing and use of the drugs.</i>  These
recommendations took several forms, each of which was recommended by a number
of committee members.<P>
(1) <i>Approval requirements:</i> Recommendations included close attention to
establishing dosage ranges; optimal dosages to avoid resistance development;
higher standards for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data; susceptibility
testing as a basis for drug approval; and labeling that includes susceptibility
information, therapeutic indices and similar data.<P>
(2) <i>Educational measures:</i>  Virtually all members recommended educational
efforts directed toward users, e.g., veterinarians and producers.  Specific
recommendations included education as to the need for sensitivity testing prior
to use, and the importance of optimal dosing for the prescribed periods.<P>
(3) <i>Use restrictions:</i>  Several members stated that FDA should take
strong regulatory measures against the misuse of the drugs.  A number of
members specifically recommended against permitting extra-label use of the
drugs.  Several stated that emphasis should be placed on preventing long-term
use.<P>
Although no fluoroquinolones have been approved for use in food animals, this
meeting provided critical guidance to the Agency on approval requirements for
this class of drugs.  It also served to educate members of the human medical
community of the critical need for additional drugs for use in veterinary
medicine.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC61">WORKING
GROUP ON QUALITY ASSURANCE IN AQUACULTURE PRODUCTION
</a></b>
<P>
The Working Group, a task force of the Federal Joint Subcommittee on
Aquaculture, operates under the aegis of the Federal Coordinating Council on
Science, Engineering, and Technology, in the Office of the Science Advisor to
the President.  The mission of the Working Group is to increase understanding
of and compliance with Federal requirements regarding drug and chemical use in
aquaculture production through education and coordination of related efforts of
government, industry and academia.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC62">Current
Efforts
</a></b>
<P>
The Working Group met twice in 1994, once in New Orleans on January 12, 1994,
with approximately 45 people in attendance and again in Washington, DC with 43
people in attendance.  The tone and spirit of the meetings were positive with a
continued commitment to cooperative approaches for resolving problems
associated with the lack of adequate number and types of approved animal drugs.
Highlights of this year included:<P>
The producer guide published.  Funds contributed by the Working Group members
made it possible to print 10,000 copies which will be distributed
free-of-charge to the aquaculture community.<P>
Industry quality assurance program initiatives continued to pick up support.
The United States Trout Farmer's Association published their program and the
Northeast Regional Aquaculture Center provided the National Aquaculture
Association with a $60,000 grant to develop two generic programs (one for fin
fish and the other for shellfish) which individual species groups can adapt to
their respective needs.<P>
Efforts are underway to continue funding and support for the FARAD database.<P>
A Citizen's Petition defining the life stages for various species was submitted
to CVM.<P>
A representative of the Canadian aquaculture industry attended both sessions.
They are interested in cooperating with the U.S. industry on studies to develop
data for approvals in both countries.<P>
FDA representatives reviewed the types of data needed to support approval of
new animal drugs and stressed the need for the industry to work as rapidly as
possible to develop the needed data.<P>
Agreement was reached to seek funding from industry sources to match government
funds to support hiring a full-time national NADA coordinator.<P>
A sub-group was established to investigate the development of an electronic
data base to track the development of data to support aquaculture NADA
approvals.<P>
The sub-group which previously helped to identify the priority drug list was
reformed with the task of reviewing the current drug needs of the industry to
determine if any changes to the list are needed.<P>
A sub-group was formed to develop recommendations on training materials to
support data development efforts.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC63">Recommendations</a></b>
<P>
The issues being addressed by the Working Group are situations that cannot be
resolved quickly.  Therefore, these recommendations are consistent with those
previously offered:<P>
1.	Obtain funding to provide for a full-time national NADA coordinator.<P>
2.	Obtain funding to provide for development of data to support approval of the
high priority drugs previously identified by the Working Group.<P>
3.	Undertake a search to identify existing data that can be used to support
U.S. approvals of needed animal drugs.<P>
4.	Assemble information on the aquaculture industries that can be used by
pharmaceutical companies to determine potential markets for aquaculture
drugs.<P>
5.	Continue to disseminate accurate and consistent information on the proper
use of animal drugs and chemicals in aquaculture production.<P>
6.	Continue to support development and adoption of producer quality assurance
programs.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC64">AQUACULTURE
 ENFORCEMENT POLICY
</a></b>
<P>
During the year, CVM made considerable progress toward the completion of a
comprehensive enforcement policy statement for use of drugs in aquaculture.
This has included policy development in such areas as extra-label use of
approved drugs, designation of certain drugs as "low regulatory priority," and
establishment of "safe levels" for drug residue in edible products.<P>
 

<b>
<a name="RTFToC65">S
&amp; C COMPUTER COORDINATING COMMITTEE
</a></b>
<P>
The group concluded several significant projects this year including
establishing specifications for the upgrade to 486-66MHz computers.  The Office
now has considerably faster operations, hardware consistent with the industry's
technological direction and new media capabilities in CD-ROM technology.  This
places the Office in a position to acquire and apply software applications
projected to be available over the next several years and to benefit from the
enhanced productivity offered from personal and workgroup computing systems.<P>
The committee has also taken a leading role in developing, with Office
management, an ADP-related plan for the Office.  This was initiated by a user
survey and will continue through FY95 to develop a direction coupled with an
acquisition and use plan for continuity of our computer and related operations
across the Office.  Through the committee's collection of user-based input, the
final plan will reflect the needs of our diverse base and provide for
productive application of these technologies.<P>
We have continued to see an improvement in computing capacity of the network.
The committee through its liaison with IRMB has helped to bring many
improvements to the network in S&amp;C.  Coupled with the improving performance
of this backbone we have seen the evolution of network based workgroups
exploring the features promised by the initial project.  <P>
Support of the local area network backbone has allowed its development to the
stage where Internet accessibility from the desktop is feasible.  The
committee's support of pilot projects in World-Wide-Web communicability offers
promise to the development of a Center server on the web to distribute a broad
array of information.  Additional Office investigations into client-server
database distribution will lead to desktop access for all employees of a number
of Center maintained databases across the network.  We are a participant in the
new communications medium characterized by entities such as the Network of
Animal Health, Veterinary Informatics Network and the World-Wide-Web.   These
capabilities will help position the Center well to meet its future challenges.

<TITLE>FDA CVM Samples of Research</TITLE>

<H3>FDA CVM Samples of Research</H3>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Much effort has been devoted to improving the Agency's ability to monitor
milk for unsafe levels of drugs.  An analytical method for determining the presence of
eight sulfonamide drugs at levels as low as five parts per billion was developed and
was successfully subjected to an interlaboratory evaluation.  This procedure  is now
used in FDA's National Drug Residue Milk Monitoring Program and in State laboratories
to ensure the safety of the nation's milk supply.

<li>In addition to sophisticated laboratory tests, simple and fast screening
tests are needed to check milk tanker trucks before they unload at milk processing
plants.  CVM began a program to evaluate commercial screening tests and provide these
assessments to the dairy industry and milk regulators.  The initial study in this
program evaluated and verified the major claims for two screening tests that detected
chloramphenicol in raw milk at levels as low as one part per billion.  These tests
were recommended for use by the milk industry to screen for the presence of this
banned drug in the nation's milk supply.

<li>Beta-lactam drugs, such as penicillin, are approved for use in lactating
dairy cows.  Because of the importance of this drug class, at least 16 different
screening tests are sold to monitor for unsafe levels of these drugs in milk.  One key
aspect of evaluating screening tests is checking their performance in milk containing
naturally incurred residues.  The entire scientific staff participated in a
simultaneous evaluation of 16 screening tests.  This study provided CVM with
tremendous insight into differing levels of performance of the various screening tests
and provided industry with a model for future evaluations of incurred residues for
other drug classes.

<li>Gentamicin has been reported as being used in an extra-label manner to treat
various diseases in dairy cattle, including mastitis.  A study was conducted to
determine the amount of gentamicin secreted into milk following the administration of
various therapeutic doses of the drug and by various routes.  Data from this study
provides the Agency important information regarding the risk of gentamicin residues in
milk from the extra-label use of this drug.

<li>Organic arsenicals are widely used in poultry feeds.  Laying hens could
possibly be exposed to these compounds through mix-ups at the feed mill or through
feed contamination.  Would such an exposure result in residues in eggs and represent a
risk to the human food supply?  A study was conducted to answer this particular
question.  Results of this research demonstrated that consumption of organic
arsenical, at approved use levels in food, by laying hens will not likely result in
residues that exceed the FDA tolerance for arsenical in whole eggs.  The data also
suggested there may be reason to reconsider the usefulness of establishment of
tolerances based on whole eggs.  Approximately 95 percent of the arsenic was deposited
in yolk.
</ul>
<P>
The Center's Office of Science researchers  are recognized by their peers for their
experience and scientific reputations.  This recognition is demonstrated in the
requests for their participation in various scientific and professional functions. 
They serve as reviewers for scientific publications, review grant proposals for the
Agency for International Development and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, chair
sessions at scientific meetings, and serve on various committees in scientific and
professional organizations.

<P>
COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES
</b>
<P>
<b>
<a name="RTFToC18">DESI
Finalization
</a></b>
<P>
During FY 94, CVM progressed toward completing the Drug Effectiveness Study
Implementation (DESI) process for one of the last groups of DESI-reviewed drugs
whose DESI status had not been completed.  This group includes tetracycline and
penicillin products used in animal feeds.  The process had not been completed
because of the drug resistance concerns raised by 21CFR 558.15. The need to
"DESI finalize" has become more important since generic applications for the
drugs cannot be approved until the finalization takes place.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC19">Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy Regulation
</a></b>
<P>
On August 19, 1994, CVM published a proposed rule prohibiting specified offal
from adult (more than 12 months of age) sheep and goats from use in ruminant
feed.  CVM proposed this action because the specified offal may contain the
agent that causes scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of
sheep and goats. In the United Kingdom, feeding of scrapie infected sheep offal
to calves has been associated with the occurrence of Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE), another TSE.  FDA proposed to declare that specified
offal from adult sheep and goats is not generally recognized as safe for use in
ruminant feed.  The public had until November 14 to comment, at which time CVM
will evaluate the comments and finalize the action.  In a companion document
the agency made available four letters to manufacturers of FDA-regulated
products requesting that bovine-derived materials from certain cattle not be
used in the manufacture of FDA-regulated products intended for humans or
animals.  One of the letters was written by CVM and addressed to "Manufacturers
of FDA-regulated products for animals."  The letter requested that
bovine-derived materials from cattle which have resided in or originated from
countries designated as BSE countries by USDA/APHIS not be used in the
manufacture of FDA-regulated products (drugs and feed) intended for animals.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC20">Metric
Labeling
</a></b>
<P>
The proposed rule on metric labeling published in the FEDERAL REGISTER on
December 21, 1993.  The animal health products industry submitted 15 comments.
The comments essentially addressed two issues:  (1) Does the Fair Packaging and
Labeling Act (FPLA) definition of consumer commodity encompass animal feeds and
if so, which products are affected? (2) Is CVM willing to exempt from the dual
dosing requirement pre-filled dosing gun and pre-filled syringe animal
nutrition products and some OTC drug products that have traditionally expressed
net contents exclusively in metric units?  <P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC21">Major
Enforcement Actions in FY 94
</a></b><P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC22">Molinos
de Puerto Rico, To-Ricos, and ConAgra: 
</a></b><P>
 Following a lengthy investigation by the San Juan District Office, injunctive
action was recommended restraining Molinos de Puerto Rico, Inc., To-Ricos,
Inc., and ConAgra, Inc. from manufacturing medicated feeds not in accord with
CGMP requirements at Catano, Las Piedras and Hatillo, Puerto Rico facilities.
Three Class I recalls of horse feeds preceded this recommendation, all
involving horse feeds which may have been cross-contaminated with monensin due
to inadequate manufacturing controls.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC23">American
Cyanamid: 
</a></b><P>
 On March 1, 1994, the American Cyanamid Company pled guilty in U.S. District
Court of Maryland to a misdemeanor charge for violation of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  The company was fined $200,000, assessed $125 in
special fees and agreed to pay $200,000 investigational costs. The charge
stemmed from an investigation conducted by the Newark and Baltimore District
Offices, the Center for Veterinary Medicine, FDA's Office of General Counsel
and Department of Justice's Office of Civil Litigation.  The investigation
revealed that several effectiveness studies conducted by various clinical
investigators throughout the country and monitored by an American Cyanamid
employee contained incomplete, misleading and falsified data or reports.  On
June 24, 1994, in the United States District Court for the District of
Maryland, Dr. David Sharkey was sentenced to 2 years probation and a $5000 fine
for his conviction in the falsification of study data in New Animal Drug
Applications of the American Cyanamid Company.  Dr. Sharkey must also pay the
costs of probation.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC24">Fermenta
Animal Health: 
</a></b><P>
 On May 25, 1994, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri
granted the United States' motion for summary judgement and ordered the
misbranded  animal drugs oxytetracycline and sulfamethazine which had been
seized in a U.S. Customs action destroyed.  The drugs had been purchased by
Fermenta Animal Health, Elwood, Kansas, a manufacturer of veterinary
pharmaceuticals.  The labels falsely represented the bulk active ingredient
drugs as manufactured by "Pliva" of Zagreb, Yugoslavia.  The Court held that
the seized drugs were subject to U.S. Customs authority, not the Food and Drug
Administration. Thus, the drugs could not be re-exported under the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC25">Van
Damme and Andersen: 
</a></b><P>
 On February 11, 1994, two veterinarians pled guilty to a felony violation of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  In the ongoing bulk animal drug
investigation, Douglas M. Van Damme and Clinton D. Andersen, veterinarians,
both of Baldwin, Wisconsin, pled guilty to failure to register a drug
manufacturing establishment, with the intent to defraud and mislead.  In July
1993, a Federal grand jury in Madison had returned a seven-count indictment
against Van Damme and Andersen, charging them with manufacturing and
distributing unapproved and improperly manufactured and labeled animal drugs
from 1986 through mid-1992.  Sentencing took place on April 13, 1994, in the
U.S. District Court, Western District of Wisconsin.  Each defendant was
sentenced to fifteen months incarceration, $250,000 fine, and one-year
probation.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC26">Bennett
Hurt: 
</a></b><P>
 On July 18, 1994, W.W. Bennett Hurt pled guilty in a Federal court in Roanoke,
Virginia, to count three of a seven count criminal indictment.  Hurt is a
livestock dealer from the Blacksburg, Virginia area who had been identified
with approximately 150 illegal residues in cattle offered for slaughter for
human consumption.  Count three charged Hurt with knowingly offering
adulterated animals (food) for introduction into interstate commerce.  The
edible tissue from these animals was found by USDA/FSIS to contain excessive
levels of antibiotics and other new animal drugs.  Hurt's guilty plea was part
of a plea agreement in which the government will ask for a sentence of 6 months
in jail, a substantial fine, and a period of supervised probation.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC27">Argent
Chemical Laboratories: 
</a></b><P>
 On August 11, 1994, a seizure was accomplished at Argent Chemical
Laboratories, Inc., Redmond, Washington, for failure to comply with GMP
regulations.  The $109,270 seizure included the entire aquaculture drug
inventory and one batch of Finquel in production and two batches of Finquel
that had just come off the line and had not been packaged.  Argent responded
with a motion to quash and return the seized goods, claiming that the
warrantless seizure violated Argent's Fourth Amendment rights.  The District
Court granted the motion.  An appeal is in process.<P>
<b>
<a name="RTFToC28">Benton
County Ag Center CGMP violations: 
</a></b><P>
 On August 23, 1994, the Center notified Benton County Ag Center, Inc.,
Keystone, Iowa of its intention to withdraw approval of all of the firm's
approved medicated feed applications (MFAs).  The firm was not in compliance
with the CGMP requirements for the manufacture of medicated feeds even after
prior notice of such CGMP violations. A letter was sent to the president of the
firm on August 23, 1994, to provide an opportunity for the firm to voluntarily
request withdrawal of the approved applications prior to publication of the
intention to withdraw the approvals in the FEDERAL REGISTER. The firm did not
respond to CVM, and the NOOH will publish.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC29">Illinois
Antibiotics Co.:  
</a></b><P>
On November 2, 1993, a consent order of condemnation and permanent injunction
was entered against the Illinois Antibiotics Co., and the veterinarian
president of the company.  This civil proceeding was instituted after the
veterinarian attempted to import 30 kilograms of gentamicin. Under the terms of
the consent order, the defendants are permanently enjoined from importing,
selling, or distributing gentamicin and four other drugs that they were selling
in large quantities.  In addition, the order provides for destruction of the
seized gentamicin, as well as 200 kilograms of dimetridizole, another animal
drug which the Government discovered to be in the veterinarian's possession.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC30">Smith
Family Farms: 
</a></b><P>
 On June 24, 1994, a Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction was signed, for
Smith Family Farms, Clyde, New York.  In addition to the illegal residues, they
had failed to establish adequate management/husbandry practices to avoid or
preclude residues, and they were improperly administering drugs in an
extra-label manner.  Specifically, Smith Family Farms was using a milk residue
test to determine pre-slaughter withholding times rather than following label
directions.  The Consent Decree requires Smith Family Farms to use new animal
drugs in accordance with their label directions, establish systems to identify
animals, establish and maintain medication/treatment records, establish a drug
inventory and accountability system, quarantine or segregate treated animals,
and establish a certification program for animals they sell.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC32">SURVEILLANCE
ACTIVITIES
</a></b><P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC33">DER
Review and Regulatory Supplements
</a></b>
<P>
The evaluation of Drug Experience Reports (DERs) is a critical component of
CVM's ability to ensure safety and efficacy of marketed drugs.  During FY93,
the Division of Surveillance conducted comprehensive DER reviews of adverse
drug reactions, promotional and advertising material, provided consulting
reviews, and requested and reviewed regulatory supplemental applications which
provided for labeling revisions.<P>


<pre>
_   DERs evaluated                            3,080
_   Action letters issued to sponsors for
      various violations and deficiencies       148
_   Adverse drug experience reviewed          1,694
_   Animals affected                        104,503
_   Regulatory supplements reviewed              69
_   Withdrawal of approval of NADAs              12
</pre>
<P>
DER review is the primary means of monitoring a product's post-approval history
to ensure that it is safe and effective under actual conditions of use.  As
time passes following an approval, the relevance of NADA status to the product
quality (safety and efficacy) becomes increasingly dependent on the
post-approval surveillance activities encompassed in the DER review.
Ineffective DER activities by either the industry or CVM can substantially
reduce the difference in quality (safety and effectiveness) between
NADA-products and unapproved products, ultimately devaluing the approval
process.  Regulatory supplements are the primary mechanism whereby approved
product defects and deficiencies are corrected.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC34">Synopsis
of ADR Activities
</a></b>
<P>
Completed Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Summary Report for 1993 for publication
in the <i>FDA Veterinarian.</i><P>
CVM completed a major revision of Adverse Drug Reaction coding materials used
by Veterinary Medical Officers in the evaluation of ADRs.  Additionally, the
ADR database was altered so that all Veterinary Medical Officers can now enter
ADR information directly at their own PCs.  The goal is to have updated ADR
information readily available to Veterinary Medical Officers on the trends and
profile of each approved drug and to allow local data entry by Veterinary
Medical Officers.  The Division initiated modification in the entry system for
accounting ADRs resulting from obvious Extra-Label Use (ELU) of drugs and
modified staff duties to provide for ADR review by all HFV-210 Veterinary
Medical Officers.<P>
Drs. Keller and Parkhie met with Illinois Poison Control Center Staff at their
facility  where they presented an overview of CVM-ADR activities and held
comprehensive discussions regarding the potential for cooperative
activities.<P>
HFV-210 staff conducted an enhanced ADR review of the first 6 months of
Posilac&#174; ADR data, involving review of approximately 100 ADR's.  Results
of these evaluations were presented to senior FDA staff, Congressional
Staffers, and news media.  In addition, a Field inspection of Monsanto's
ADR-reporting process was initiated.  Examples of other ADR-driven regulatory
activities include the addition of Adverse Reaction statements to heartworm
preventive drugs, an action letter to the manufacturer of Xenodine (an
unapproved product which caused adverse drug reactions involving deaths in
cats), and recommended label changes for Otomax to include a "Warning" about
partial hearing loss following Otomax administration.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC35">Regulatory
Actions Initiated
</a></b><P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC36">Withdrawal
of Nitrofurazone (NFZ) Solution Approvals
</a></b>
<P>
FDA withdrew approval of six <b>New Animal Drug Applications </b>concerning
large container sizes of NFZ solution products.   The drug, which is approved
only for use in non-food animals, had been misused in dairy cattle and swine.
This raised a public health concern because nitrofurans have been determined to
be carcinogenic.  Through meetings, correspondence, and phone conferences, CVM
was able to persuade all of the sponsors to request withdrawal.  Removal of the
products reduces the potential for exposure of consumers to unsafe residues.
<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC37">Letters
to Sponsors of NFZ Product
</a></b>
<P>
Letters were sent to firms who package their injectable products in large
volume containers that are labeled for both small and large animals.  Our
concern was that the large volume vials are not suitable to be labeled for
small animals because greater than 20 entries/withdrawals from the vial can
adversely affect the product's sterility, stability, strength, quality, and
also compromise the integrity of the container closure system.<P>
The Division sent letters to the pioneer and the generic drug manufacturers of
xylazine hydrochloride products requesting revisions of their product labeling
to include the Cautionary Statement,  "Caution:  Do not use in cervidae less
than 15 days before or during the hunting season."  Our concern was human food
safety when these products are used in wild cervidae which may be harvested by
hunters.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC38">Post-Approval
Monitoring Program for Posilac&#174;
</a></b>
<P>
OS&amp;C conducted a post-approval monitoring program for Posilac&#174;. In
addition, we initiated expedited action to correct promotional labeling
(Technical Manual) and establish appropriate criteria for submitting Adverse
Reaction Reporting forms.  Based on the ADR reports received so far on
Posilac&#174; under actual conditions of use, FDA does not find any cause for
concern.  <P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC39">Compliance
Verification of Drug Listing  
</a></b>
<P>
In January 1994, the Division of Surveillance initiated a pilot program to
monitor compliance verification of Drug Listing.  The program involves the
Center sending a computer printout of all currently listed products and
requesting that the firm update the listing by deleting unmarketed products,
and updating information on marketed products.  It also reminds firms to submit
listings for newly marketed products.  This active process replaces the
previous passive semiannual listing process.  A total of 372 verification
packages were sent to firms identified in the CVM database as having current
products.  The mailing was sent to nearly 1,000 establishments, including
manufacturers and distributors.  Follow-up letters were mailed to sponsors who
failed to appropriately respond to the initial mailing.  Over 98% response has
been achieved.  This program has resulted in a substantial increase in accuracy
and timeliness of CVM's drug listing information.  For example, changes in
sponsors, firm names, or corporate affiliations become apparent to CVM more
expeditiously now than under the previous system when product label-identified
sponsor/manufacturer changes lagged as much as a year behind actual changes.
From this work, the database contains 4,000 products which are actively
marketed.<P>


<a name="RTFToC40">Draft
Compliance Policy Guide on Compounding
</a></b>
<P>
The Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) on Compounding in Veterinary Medicine was
converted to a CPG format during FY 94.  The document was developed based on
input from FDA consulting pharmacists, internal review, and the 7/94 published
results of the AVMA sponsored Compounding Symposium.  This document is to
clarify the Agency's regulatory policy regarding compounding and illegal
manufacture of drug products intended for use in animals and complies with
provisions of the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC41">Medically
Necessary Veterinary Drug Products
</a></b>
<P>
The Medically Necessary Veterinary Drug Products Shortage Management Policy
became a part of the Policy &amp; Procedures Manual in FY 94.  The purpose of
the guide was to establish Center procedures for the evaluation of essential
animal drug product shortage situations to facilitate appropriate actions.
Three product evaluations under the policy were made in FY 94.  These products
were:  insulin for cats (under several INADA's), ivermectin, and thiamylal
sodium for anesthesia. These medical evaluations were then forwarded to the CVM
Drug Shortage Coordinator for decision as stated in the policy.  Thiamylal
sodium is currently considered to be a Medically Necessary Veterinary
Product.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC42">Veterinarian
On-Line:  
</a></b>
<P>
CVM established a Veterinary Medical Officer Center representative on two
online veterinary networks, VIN (Veterinary Information Network) and NOAH
(Network of Animal Health).  This provides CVM with the capability to monitor
FDCA-relevant events and trends in the profession, supply expedient answers to
simple online requests (e.g., where to report adverse drug reactions and
complaints against unapproved products), and keep abreast of practices and
opinions in "the field."  Additionally, contact with professional experts in
the Veterinary Medical Officer's consulting network is maintained, providing an
efficient means of communication.  <P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC43">Draft
Guideline for Promotion and Advertising of Veterinary Drugs
</a></b>
<P>
The document is under internal review and seeking concurrence. The purpose of
the guideline is to provide guidance to industry on promotion and advertising
issues.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC44">STARS-2
DER Tracking System database 
</a></b>
<P>
DIAL data from the Parklawn Computer Center has been transferred into
Division's STARS-2 database.  This database is regularly updated by Division of
Surveillance  applications examiners.  It provides the current DER status of
each NADA to reviewers locally at their terminals, and replaces the former
card-file system.<P>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC45">Pasteurized
Milk Ordinance (PMO) 
</a></b>
<P>
The Division of Surveillance maintained a high level of activity in the
education and training  of State Milk Inspectors and Sanitarians in the
implementation of the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO) provisions, providing
instructors for training courses in Basic Dairy Farm Inspections for proper
drug labeling use, and storage; Special Problems in Milk Inspection and
Drug-related Issues.  These activities are coordinated with Division of Human
Resource Development/State Training Branch, Office of Regulatory Affairs,
CFSAN, USDA and other organizations (NDRMMP, NCIMS, etc.).  During FY94 a
significant level of international work involving dairy inspections in Canada
and Puerto Rico was accomplished.  Support for these programs helps to maintain
the current highly effective milk safety inspection program by ensuring the
availability of knowledgeable State and FDA Field inspectors.<P>

<a name="RTFToC46">Review
of Marketed Product Labels
</a></b>
<P>
The Center receives numerous potentially violative product labels to review
from a number of sources including industry, veterinarians, FDA Field staff,
and the general public.  In some instances, these labels are from products that
the agency has chosen to allow to be marketed without approval.  In other
instances, these products are determined to be biologics, pesticides,
nutritional supplements, or grooming agents and thus not regulated as animal
drugs.  In some instances, however, the Center determines these products are
unsafe, ineffective, or both, and initiates regulatory action against firms
marketing these products.  In FY 94, more than 932 labels and promotional
pieces were reviewed.<P>

<H3>FDA CVM STRUCTURE & RESPONSIBILITIES</H3>

<P>

The responsibilities of the Center for Veterinary Medicine have a direct effect on the
safety of the human food supply and on the safety to animals of veterinary products. 
CVM works to educate consumers as well as the regulated industry; evaluates data on
proposed veterinary products carefully before permitting them to be marketed; discovers
violative marketed products through surveillance programs and initiates legal action, if
necessary, to bring violators into compliance with the law; and conducts research to
support Center activities.
<P>
Whether developing and disseminating information, approving animal drug products for
marketing, monitoring marketed animal drug products, or conducting research, CVM is
committed to the important goal of protecting animal and human health throughout the
United States -- working together to keep the country's food supply the safest in the
world.
<P>
The management staff is primarily responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operation of
the Center.  They oversee the setting and implementation of its goals and direction. 
They also manage such functions as budget, personnel matters, training for employees,
data processing, document maintenance, and the dissemination of information regarding
the Center's mission to other Centers within FDA, other government agencies, and the
public.
<P>
The pre-marketing staff determine whether or not a drug should be approved for
marketing.  Pre-marketing reviewers study data submitted by drug sponsors to determine
if submitted data are adequate to support a drug's approval for marketing.
<P>
The post-marketing staff monitor marketed animal drugs, food additives, and devices to
assure continuing safety and effectiveness.  They also process legal cases brought
against violators by the Center.
<P>
The research staff in CVM conduct studies to support both pre- and post-marketing
activities by providing information to aid CVM scientists in the review and
decision-making processes.
<P>
A closer look at each of the four groups (and the Director's Office) will show how they
interact to accomplish FDA's mission.

<body>
<H3>Vision of the Food and Drug Administration Center For Veterinary Medicine</H3>
<P>
<hr>
<P>

We are an internationally recognized public health organization responsible for
the evaluation, approval and/or surveillance of animal drugs, food additives,
feed ingredients, and animal devices. We are proactive in our efforts to increase
the availability and diversity of safe and effective products that relieve animal
pain and suffering, sustain their health, improve animal productivity and do not
compromise public health.
<P>
We adapt, align and utilize our resources wisely and make practical use of state
of the art science and technologies to best accomplish our mission.  People with
expertise in product evaluation, research, surveillance, compliance, and other
functional areas work cooperatively as an integrated team.
<P>
We foster open and collegial partnerships with our constituencies to respond to
concerns and needs.
<P>
We maintain a worker-friendly  environment, foster initiative, value cultural
diversity and  nourish individual growth and professional development.  Everyone
exhibits pride in the organization, values and recognizes the contribution and
accomplishments of each member of the CVM team, and demonstrates mutual trust and
respect.  The entire Center pulls in the same direction with purpose,  harmony,
and grace.
<P>
We all live by, and our managers exemplify the Center's guiding principles.  By
recognizing the expertise of everyone, we inspire cooperative decision making . 
All are empowered to participate in the development of policy as well as to take
responsibility for making decisions within those policy boundaries.<P>

(3) General Design of the Experiment<p>

(a) Purpose of the Study: To determine the effectiveness of FBZ 10% suspension
for the removal and control of gastrointestinal nematodes in goats.<p>

(b) Test Animals: Twenty goats of both sexes (buck and does) were selected for
this study. The goats ranged in age from approximately 3 to 8 months and were of
commercial breed (Alpine, Nubian, Sannan or Toggenburg) or crossbreed. The
animals were purchased from local producers and housed in the Large Animal
Research Facility located on the East Campus of the University of Nebraska,
Lincoln, Nebraska. The animals were acclimated 7 to 10 days prior to the
beginning of the study.<p>

(c) Feed: A commercial cattle feed was provided twice daily. Feed intake was not
monitored. The analysis of the feed showed less than 12% crude protein, not less
than 1% crude fat and 18% crude fiber. The feed was devoid of contaminants
capable of interfering with the results of the study. Water was provided ad
libitum with an automatic water device.<p>

(h) Test Duration: Goats were acclimated 7 to 10 days prior to initiating the
study. The study began on May 2, 1987 and was completed on May 25, 1987.<p>

(i) Diagnosis: The gastrointestinal parasitic infection in naturally infected
goats was determined by daily microscopic examination of fecal samples collected
from individual animal during the acclimation as well as the treatment periods
for parasite egg counts. Anthelmintic efficacy of FBZ was finally assessed by
comparing the postmortem worm counts in treated and untreated goats 9 to 12 days
post-treatment.<p>

(j) Dosage Form: Suspension<p>

(k) Route of Administration: Oral<p>

(l) Dosage Used: 5 mg FBZ/kg body weight single administration.<p>

(m) Parameters:<p>
 Daily Observation <br>
Mortality <br>
Microscopic fecal examination of parasite eggs <br>
Necropsy Findings<p>

(4) Results: All the goats were naturally infected with gastrointestinal
nematodes as evidenced by the presence of large numbers of eggs in the fecal
samples when examined microscopically. Final assessment of the anthelmintic
efficacy of FBZ was done by comparing post-mortem worm counts in treated and
untreated goats. In this trial, the efficacy of FBZ (5 mg/kg dose) ranged from
73.3% to 85.5% against <I>Haemonchus contortus</I> and <I>Ostertagia
circumcincta</I>, as shown below.<br>

(5) Conclusions: The results of a clinical study in goats naturally infected with
gastrointestinal nematodes demonstrated that a single oral treatment as a drench
with FBZ 10% suspension at 5 mg/kg dose was efficacious in the removal and
control of gastrointestinal parasitic infection with <I>Haemonchus contortus</I> and
<I>Ostertagia circumcincta</I>.<p>

<B>6. ANIMAL SAFETY</B><p>

A summary of one pivotal study demonstrating the safety of FBZ 10% suspension in
goats is provided.<p>

(1) Type of Study: Target Animal Safety.<p>

(2) Name and Address of Investigator:<p>

Dr. Donald L. Ferguson<br>
Dept. of Veterinary Science<br>
Inst. of Agriculture & Natural Resources<br>
University of Nebraska Lincoln, NE 68583<p>

(3) General Design of the Study<p>

a. Purpose of the Study: To determine the safety of FBZ 10% suspension when
administered orally as a drench in goats.<p>

b. Test Animals: Thirty healthy goats of both sexes (buck and does) of commercial
breed (Nubian, Sannan, Alpine or Toggenburg) or crossbreed were allocated for
this study. The goats were randomly assigned by weight and sex to each dosage
levels and to a nonmedicated control group.<p>

c. Identification: Goats were identified by ear tag and pen number.<p>

d. Feed: A commercial cattle ration was provided twice daily. Feed intake was not
monitored. Feed was free of contaminants to interfere with the results of the
study. Water was provided ad libitum.<p>

e. Dosage form: Suspension<p>

f. Route of Administration: Oral drench<p>

g. Test Duration: 45 days<p>

h. Treatments: There were 5 treatment groups of six animals each: (a)
nonmedicated control, (b) 5 FBZ/kg (1X) treated group, (c) 15 mg FBZ/kg (3X)
treated group, (d) 30 mg FBZ/kg (6X) treated group and (e) 125 mg FBZ/kg (25X)
treated group.<p>

i. Frequency of Drug Administration: Each goat in groups (b), (c), and (d)
received one oral dosage daily for 3 consecutive days and group (e) received only
one single dose.<p>

j. Pertinent Parameters: Daily clinical observations Necropsy Morbidity Mortality<p>

(4) Results: Following drenching with FBZ suspension, all goats were observed
hourly for 4 hours and at about 9 to 15 hours interval during the 14 days for
signs of adverse reaction. The total observation period continued for 35 days and
then the goats were sacrificed. No adverse reactions to FBZ were observed in this
trial. Diarrhea was observed in 4 goats (goat # 0992, 0976, 0982, and 0979), one
from each treatment group. Coccidia oocysts were observed in the feces of these
goats. Two goats died during the experimental period. However at postmortem
examination, the cause of death was diagnosed as pregnancy toxemia (ketosis) in
goat #0981 from 5 mg/kg group and a chronic disease characterized by diffuse
serous atrophy of fat, thymic atrophy and lymphoid depletion of the Peyer's
patches in goat #0976 from the 15 mg/kg group. At the completion of the study,
all the goats were sacrificed and posted. No gross pathology associated with the
use of FBZ was observed in any of the animals at the postmortem examination.<p>

(5) Conclusions: The data demonstrated that goats treated with 5 mg fenbendazole
10% suspension/kg body weight for 3 consecutive days showed no signs of toxicity
associated with the administration of the drug product. Therefore, 5 mg
fenbendazole/kg body weight dosage is safe to goats.<p>

<B>7. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</B><p>

(1) Residue Studies to Establish a Withdrawal Period<p>

The in-life portion of the tissue residue depletion study was conducted by:<p>

Dr. Donald L. Ferguson<br>
Dept. of Veterinary Science<br>
Institute of Agriculture & Natural Resources<br>
University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583<p>

The analysis of the tissue samples was performed by:<p>

Halina T. Kramar<br>
Hazleton Laboratories America, Inc.<br>
P. O. Box 7545<br>
Madison, WI 53707<p>

Twenty-four healthy goats of both sexes from 3 to 8 months of age were used in
the study. Goats were from commercial breeds and weighed approximately 18 to 36
kg. The animals were fed a commercial cattle ration twice daily and water was
available ad libitum. Twenty of the goats received a single oral dose of the
fenbendazole suspension at the rate of 5 mg/kg body weight. The remaining four
goats served as control animals.<p>

The treated goats were sacrificed in groups of four at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 days
postadministration. Liver and muscle samples were collected at necropsy and sent
to the Pesticide Research Center, Michigan State University. Hazleton
Laboratories America, Inc., Madison, WI received the liver and muscle samples
from the Pesticide Research Center for analysis. Samples of fat, kidney and
plasma were retained at the Department of Veterinary Science, University of Nebraska. The liver and muscle
samples were analyzed using the determinative HPLC method developed to analyze
for fenbendazole in cattle liver (NADA 128-620). The method was validated to
0.0201 ppm in goat liver and muscle tissue. The mean residue values (n = 4) with
standard deviation for liver and muscle are shown in the next page.<p>

      9                    < 0.0201             < 0.0201
   Controls                < 0.0201             < 0.0201

*Values below the limit of assay sensitivity are reported as < 0.0201
</pre>
A statistical analysis using a 99% tolerance limit approach with 95% confidence
was performed on the data from the residue study.  The results of that analysis
indicated that residues of parent fenbendazole decline to less than 0.8 ppm in
liver by six days postdosing under the conditions of the study.<p> 

<B>8. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</B><p>

The data submitted in this public master file (PMF) are supporting information
for the effectiveness, target animal safety and human food safety data required
by Section 512 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with regard to the proposed
use of fenbendazole for the removal and control of gastrointestinal nematodes in
goats.  FDA will consider this information along with other required data as
support for NADAs that may be filed for this use of fenbendazole in goats.<p>

The human food safety data indicate that goats treated with fenbendazole at the
recommended dosage will require 6 days for the depletion of fenbendazole residue
from the tissues.<p>

FDA is publishing a notice of availability of this PMF to encourage sponsors to
file new animal drug applications (NADAs) for fenbendazole for the use covered by
the PMF.  Sponsors will need to submit (1) data supporting extrapolation from a
major species in which the drug is currently approved, or authorized reference to
such data; and (2) the remaining data and information required for approval of an
NADA.<p>

Fenbendazole is currently approved for use as a 10% suspension in cattle; see <B>21
CFR 520.905a</B>.<p>

<H3>FDA CVM Research</H3>

<P>
	Decisionmaking within CVM must reflect the "state of the art" in science and
technology.  In order to maintain the level of scientific credibility necessary to
support the authority of regulatory decisions, it is essential that CVM scientists be
involved in the conduct of research programs that reflect areas of scientific
excellence.
<P>
The Office of Science conducts intramural research and coordinates extramural research
grants and contracts that support pre- and post-marketing responsibilities by
providing information to aid CVM scientists in their review and decisionmaking
processes.
<P>
The research group's responsibilities include the following:
<P>
<ul>

<li>Develops and validates quantitative, qualitative analytical procedures for
analyzing drugs, additives, and contaminants in animal tissues and food.

<li>Validates the methods proposed by drug sponsors in support of their New
Animal Drug Application (NADA) to detect drug residues in animal tissue and products,
and in medicated feeds.

<li>Investigates the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of
drugs, feed additives, and contaminants in food animals (including minor species).

<li>Develops models for determining the safety and efficacy of veterinary drugs
and food additives in domestic animals.

<li>Determines the safety and efficacy of diagnostic agents and devices for
animal use.

<li>Investigates the affects of drugs, food additives, and contaminants on
immunological and physiological functions of domestic animals.

<li>Evaluates screening tests for drug residues in animal derived foods. 

<li>Investigates interactions between diet and drugs in food producing animals.
</ul><P>
During the process of carrying out their responsibilities, the research staff
interacts with other groups in CVM, scientists in other government agencies, and
scientists outside the Federal government.
<P>
Research is usually performed in response to a request from another office with the
Center.  There may be a need for studies to validate data submitted in an NADA or an
Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD) exemption, to discover the cause of a
particular adverse effect caused by an animal drug, or to generate scientific data in
support of a legal action.  When a specific need arises, the research facility is
available to other CVM review scientists to conduct studies relating to the Center's
mission within their area of expertise.

<H3>FDA CVM Pre-Marketing (NADE)</H3>
<P>

The Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation (NADE) is responsible for reviewing
information submitted by drug sponsors who wish to obtain approval to manufacture and
sell animal drugs.  A new animal drug is deemed unsafe unless there is an approved
new animal drug application.  Virtually all animal drugs are "new animal drugs"
within the meaning of the term in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
<P>
NADE determines whether or not an animal drug should be approved for marketing. 
Before a new animal drug may receive FDA approval, it must be clinically tested for
effectiveness and safety.  If a product is intended for use in a food-producing
animal, it must also be tested for safety to human consumers, and the edible animal
products must be free of unsafe drug residues.  The sponsor must also develop
analytical methods to detect and measure drug residues in edible animal products.  It
is the responsibility of the drug sponsor (the individual or firm seeking FDA
approval of the drug product) to conduct the necessary tests.
<P>
NADE performs the following tasks in their review of applications:
<ul>
<li>Evaluates the safety  and effectiveness  of new animal drugs.

<li>Evaluates the safety for human consumption of drug residues in food derived
from treated animals.

<li>Evaluates the effect of animal drugs on the environment.

<li>Determines the adequacy of information submitted for proposed use of
investigational new animal drugs.

<li>Evaluates manufacturing methods and procedures for new animal drug products.

<li>Recommends to the Center Director appropriate action on new animal drug
applications and abbreviated new animal drug applications (for generic drugs).

<li>Coordinates the development and implementation of regulations and policies
pertaining to new drugs intended for animal use 
</ul>
<P>
When a sponsor feels that adequate data have been gathered to support the safety and
effectiveness requirements of a new animal drug, the data are organized and submitted
as a New Animal Drug Application (NADA).  
<P>
An "original" NADA (the initial application for approval of a new animal drug) should
contain all of the following information:
<P>
<ul>
<li>A signed copy of the FD 356V (New Animal Drug Application).

<li>A well-organized summary of the information in the application. 

<li>List of Components of the drug product and the resulting new drug substance
when they are combined.

<li>The amount of each component contained in the product.

<li>Full description of methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing,
processing and packing of the drug product.

<li>Samples of the product, if requested by CVM.

<li>Proposed labels and labeling.

<li>Full reports of investigations in animals and humans to prove the safety and
effectiveness for the proposed use.  If the product is to be used in food animals,
full reports related  to the impact of the drug on the resulting food products are
required.

<li>An accompanying Environmental Assessment as required by 21 CFR 25.31.

<li>A Freedom of Information Summary of the data used in determining if the
product is safe and effective.

<li>A Bioresearch Monitoring Statement as required by 21 CFR 514.1(b)(4)(ii).
</ul>
<P>
Pre-marketing divisions are responsible for reviewing NADAs  -- The Toxicology staff
evaluates the safety to the target animal, the public, and the environment; the
Biometrics staff provides statistical analysis of submitted data; and the Chemistry
staff evaluates the manufacturing processes, quality control, and residue levels in
the edible animal tissues.
<P>
During the review process, a sponsor may make changes or "amendments" to information
contained in an NADA.  These amendments must also be reviewed by the pre-marketing
staff.
<P>
If the pre-marketing divisions decide the information in the NADA shows the drug will
be safe and effective for its intended use, a recommendation is provided to the
Center Director that the NADA should be approved.  If the Director agrees, he/she
approves the application and publishes a notice of approval in the Federal Register.
<P>
Following approval of an NADA, the sponsor may propose changes.  These changes may
range from a simple manufacturing change to a major new claim in a new species, and
are submitted in supplemental NADAs.  While the extent of the review is wholly
dependent upon the extent of the proposed changes, the same general review process is
followed. 
<P>
For additional information on the authorization of Investigational New Animal Drugs
(INAD) and the review of NADAs and ANADAs by CVM's pre-marketing group, refer to the
following:
<P>
<ul>

<li>21 CFR 511 and 514.

<li>CVM Staff Manual Guides 1240.3000, 1240.3010, 1240.3030, and 1240.3100.

<li>The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Section 512.
</ul>
CVM's pre-marketing group is involved in two processes in regulating the interstate
shipment of animal drug products.  The first process, the Investigational New Animal
Drug exemption (INAD),  involves the interstate shipment of experimental drugs used
for testing in animals.  This testing may require drugs be given to animals that will
later be used to produce human food products.  FDA must ensure that the food products
derived from these experimental animals will be safe for human consumption.
<P>
The second process is the NADA review.  It includes the evaluation of data regarding
an animal drug's safety to the target animal and to humans who might consume products
from the treated animal; the review also evaluates effectiveness for the purposes
claimed.  To be legally marketed, a new animal drug product must be approved under an
NADA.
<P>
NADA sponsors usually include university researchers, contract researchers, private
practitioners, drug manufacturers, and/or feed or food manufacturers in their
protocols.  The activities of the investigators are monitored through the bioresearch
monitoring program.  Their data generation processes are validated through on-site
inspections by FDA field personnel.  Reports covering laboratory practices relating
to toxicology and safety research, and the functions of clinical investigators and
sponsors are forwarded to CVM for evaluation. 
<P>
A sponsor must conduct certain tests to show that a drug is safe for the target
animal, has the intended effect, and that edible products derived from treated
animals are safe for human consumption.  If animals receiving an investigational drug
are to be slaughtered for consumption, authorization to do so is needed from the FDA.
 These animals must be slaughtered in a federally inspected facility.  The USDA, in
coordination with the FDA, provides for a USDA inspector to monitor the slaughter of
research animals intended for human consumption.
<P>
Once an INAD exemption has been granted according to the requirement of the FFDCA,
the sponsor must do the following:
</ul>
<li>Assure the proper and safe packaging and labeling of investigational drugs.

<li>Report the names and locations of investigators to whom drugs are shipped.

<li>Maintain records of all drug shipments and of all reports received from
investigators.

<li>Notify FDA immediately if a safety problem is observed.

<li>Notify FDA or USDA prior to slaughter of animals treated with the
investigational drug.
</ul>
<P>
To market a generic animal drug product in the United States, a person or a company
must obtain approval of an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA).  Under
the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988, a generic animal
drug product may be approved by providing evidence that it has the same active
ingredients, in the same concentration, as the approved animal drug product, and that
it is bioequivalent to the approved animal drug product.  This information is
submitted to NADE in the form of an ANADA.

<TITLE>FDA CVM Post-Marketing (OS&C)</TITLE>

<H3>FDA CVM Post-Marketing (OS&C)</H3>

<P>
Even though a new animal drug product is carefully tested before it is marketed,
wider use of the product may disclose problems not evident during the pre-marketing
research.
<P>
The CVM post-marketing group, Office of Surveillance and Compliance, works in
cooperation with the FDA Field Offices, monitoring marketed animal drugs, food
additives, and veterinary devices to assure their safety and effectiveness.  This
regulatory responsibility is carried out by scientists and by investigators and
analysts around the country.  Also involved in these activities are the Department of
Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other State and Federal
agencies.  State and Federal field forces conduct inspections of drug and medicated
feed manufacturers to assure that acceptable manufacturing procedures are followed. 
Violations may result in legal action.
<P>
Activities within the post-marketing Divisions are varied, yet closely related.  One
activity is the overseeing of medicated animal feeds.  Another involves monitoring
drugs used in food and non-food animals, and providing scientific expertise for legal
cases.  In addition, information is prepared by this group for dissemination to the
public and regulated industry in an effort to encourage voluntary compliance with the
laws and regulations enforced by FDA.
<P>
One of CVM's highest priorities is assuring the safety of the food supply through
reduction of violative residues in meat and milk.  Drugs are used in food-producing
animals to treat and prevent animal diseases, and to increase animal production. 
However, drug use in food-producing animals is attended by a risk of residues in food
when directions for use are not followed.  For example, the most frequently found
cause of drug residues in meat is failure to follow the indicated withdrawal time on
the label.
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)
is responsible for the inspection of meat and poultry products in Federally-inspected
establishments and has primary responsibility for the wholesomeness of these
products.  FSIS reports violative residues of drugs in meat and poultry to FDA for
regulatory followup.
<P>
FDA conducts followup inspections of producers or others involved in the production
or marketing of food animals or poultry which have tissue residue violations.  The
goal of CVM's Tissue Residue Program is to eliminate violative drug residues in
edible tissue of food animals.  Because of resource constraints, FDA cannot
investigate all of the initial tissue residue violations reported by FSIS.  State
regulatory bodies have stepped in to help carry out followup investigations.  The
States usually conduct investigations on violations caused by fist-time violators and
provide education to producers.  FDA usually focuses its resources on repeat
offenders.  Through these Federal and State programs, progress is being made in
reducing the number of residue violations.
<P>
The responsibility for ensuring the safety of the Nation's milk supply lies with the
FDA.  The Grade A Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO) is the standard used in the
voluntary Cooperative  State/PHS Program for the certification of Interstate Milk
Shippers.  The program involves all 50 States, District of Columbia, and U.S.
Territories.  The states have authority to administer the PMO.
<P>
The PMO is a powerful enforcement tool.  Every producer of Grade A milk must have a
permit to ship the product.  Permits can be suspended for PMO violations such as the
sale of milk with violative drug residues.  Penalties are economic and severe.  In
addition to fines at the farm level, when a producer's milk contaminates a tank truck
load of milk, the producer is financially liable for the entire load of milk.
<P>
The National Drug Residue Milk Monitoring Program (NDRMMP) is another effort to
ensure milk safety.  The NDRMMP routinely tests raw milk for drug residues.  It is a
cooperative effort between FDA and State milk control officials.  Milk samples are
assayed for eight sulfonamide and three tetracycline drugs, chloramphenicol, and the
beta lactam antibiotics.  Analytical methods for more compounds are added as they are
developed.
<P>
Additional functions of the post-marketing group include:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Approves food additive petitions after determining their safety and utility.

<li>Approves medicated feed applications after ensuring the sponsoring firm is
operating in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and properly
labels the medicated feed.

<li>Monitors animal feeds with regard to their safety to the animals which
receive them, to the public who consume the food products derived from treated
animals, and to the environment.

<li>Monitors approved veterinary drugs and food additives to assure their
continued safety and effectiveness.

<li>Monitors marketed unapproved veterinary drugs and veterinary devices.

<li>Prepares for publication in the Federal Register all actions that are being
proposed or taken concerning regulation of animal health products.

<li>Enforces industry compliance with the FFDCA  by coordinating legal cases
brought against violators by the Agency.

<li>Pursues voluntary compliance by sharing information regarding animal drug
use with the regulated industry, the medical community, and consumers.

<li>Withdraws drugs and food additives from the market when conditions warrant
removal based on scientific fact concerning a lack of safety and/or effectiveness.

<li>Assures that good laboratory and manufacturing practices are maintained,
through the monitoring of clinical and laboratory investigators who conduct studies
as part of the NADA approval process.

<li>Continuously monitors and evaluates reports of adverse drug reactions for
animal safety and public health issues.   Withdrawal of an approved drug may be
recommended if it is determined to be unsafe or ineffective.

<BODY>


<H3>FDA CVM Director's Office</H3>
<P>

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act allows the Secretary of Health and Human
Services to delegate his or her authority to others, such as the Commissioner of Food and
Drugs.  The Commissioner has redelegated his authority for a number of functions to CVM. 
Among these redelegated functions are:
<ul>
<li>Authority to approve New Animal Drug Applications and their supplements and
Abbreviated New Animal Drug Applications (for generic drugs).

<li>Authority to issue proposals, notices, and orders relating to refusal to approve
and withdrawal of approval of New Animal Drug Applications and corresponding new animal
drug regulations.

<li>Authority to approve the use of certain food additives.
</ul>
The functions of the Office of the Director are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Directs overall Center activities and coordinates and establishes Center policy
in the areas of research, management, scientific evaluation, compliance, and
surveillance.

<li>Directs systems for planning, programming, and budgeting and provides
administrative and information support for the Center.

<li>Approves New Animal Drug Applications (NADAs) and Abbreviated New Animal Drug
Applications (ANADAs), and issues notices of withdrawal of new animal drug approvals when

</ul>
<P>
The food we eat daily in the United States is the safest in the world.  We are
not faced each morning with case after case of food poisoning as we listen to
the news or read the newspaper.  We feel very safe going to a restaurant,
supermarket, or a roadside stand to purchase food for our families or for our
pets.  We do not fear food-borne diseases.  Nor do we fear the consequences of
drugs we give our pets and our food-producing and recreational animals.  These
drugs are the most thoroughly tested and safest veterinary drugs in the
world.
<P>
The responsibility for protecting and assuring the unparalleled level of
consumer confidence and food supply safety rests with the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and with the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA).
<P>
Within the FDA, there are two Centers responsible for the safety and
wholesomeness of the human food supply.  The Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) regulates foods intended for human consumption.  The
Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) regulates the manufacture and
distribution of food additives and drugs that will be given to animals from
which human foods are derived, as well as food additives and drugs for pet (or
companion) animals.
<P>
To protect the food and drug supply for animals, the FDA develops technical
standards for animal drug safety and effectiveness and evaluates data bases
necessary to support approvals of veterinary drugs.  The USDA monitors the
food supply for animal drug residues.
<P>
Drugs are given to animals for many reasons: to prevent diseases, to cure
diseases, or to control animal temperament.  Drugs are also given to affect
animal productivity, to improve efficiency in converting food to body weight
gain, and to increase or improve the production of milk or eggs.
<P>
This Guide discusses the process FDA uses for determining whether or not a
drug given to animals is safe and effective.  CVM is the FDA unit responsible
for regulating drugs, devices, and food additives given to, or used on, over
one hundred million companion animals, plus millions of poultry, cattle,
swine, sheep, and minor animal species.  (Minor animal species include animals
other than cattle, swine, chickens, turkeys, horses, dogs, and cats.)

 <b>Pioneer Product</b>:<p>	Gentocin&#174; Solution (gentamicin sulfate, 100 	mg/mL),
NADA 046-724 by Schering-Plough Animal 	Health Corporation<p>
 <b>Date Stamped: </b>July 21, 1995<p>
<b>2.	TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><br>
  <br>
	Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended
by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (53 FR 50460,
December 15, 1988; first GADPTRA Policy Letter), an Abbreviated New Animal Drug
Application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an approved new
animal drug (pioneer product).  For certain dosage forms, the Agency may grant
a waiver from conducting an  in vivo     bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645,
June 18, 1990; fifth GADPTRA Policy Letter).  In lieu of bioequivalence
testing, the safety and efficacy of the generic product are based on the
demonstrated chemical equivalence to the pioneer product.  <p>

Based on the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Macleod
Pharmaceuticals was granted a waiver November 5, 1990 (photocopy attached) from
conducting an  <i>in vivo</i>&#160;     bioequivalence study with Gentamex 100.  The
generic and pioneer products are solutions with the same inactive ingredients
and the same concentrations of the active ingredient.<br>
  <br>
<b>3.	HUMAN SAFETY:</b><br>
  <br>
<b>	Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:</b><br>
  <br>
<b>	</b>Regarding consumption of drug residues in food, human safety data were
not required for approval of this ANADA.  This drug is labeled for use in
horses not intended for food.<br>
<br>
	<b>Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:</b><br>
  <br>
<b>	</b>Labeling contains adequate caution/warning statements.<br>
<br>
<b>4.	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>
   <br>
	This is an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) filed under Section
512(b)(2) of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&amp;C) Act. <br>
<br>
	Safety and effectiveness for this generic animal drug, Gentamex 100
(gentamicin sulfate, 100 mg/mL), were established by demonstration of chemical
equivalence to the pioneer product, Schering-Plough Animal Health Corporation's
Gentocin&#174; Solution (gentamicin sulfate, 100 mg/mL, NADA 046-724).<br>
<br>
	This generic product and the pioneer product have identical labeling
indications for use.  The route and method of administration of the two drugs
are identical.  Both drugs are administered by intrauterine infusion.  The
generic and pioneer products are both solutions that contain the same active
and inactive ingredients in the same concentrations.  Both products have the
same pH.  Therefore, in compliance with FDA policy promulgated to implement
Section 512(b)(2) of the FFD&amp;C Act, no additional safety, efficacy, or 
<i>in vivo</i>&#160;      bioequivalency studies were necessary or required.   <p>
  
	This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that Gentamex 100 is safe and effective for its labeled
indications when used under its proposed conditions of use.<p>

 <b>a. Established Name:</b>    Salinomycin sodium<p>
<b>b. Trade/Proprietary Name:</b>   Sacox&#174;<p>
<b>c. Dosage Form:</b>  Type A medicated article<p> 
<b>d. How Supplied:</b> Salinomycin is supplied in 50 lb bags
 <p>
<b>e. How Dispensed:</b> OTC <p>
 <b>f. Amount of Active Ingredient:</b><p>  Salinomycin equivalent to
30 grams    salinomycin sodium per pound <p>
        
 <b>g. Route of Administration:</b><p>  Administer orally by adding
the Type A medicated article to complete broiler feed (Type C medicated
feed). <p>
<b>h. Labeled Dosage:</b><p> Sacox&#174; can be used to
provide concentrations of salinomycin ranging from 40 to 60 g/ton. <p>
 
<b>i. Species:</b>  Broiler Chickens<p>
        
 <b>j.  Indications for Use:</b><p> For the prevention of
coccidiosis in broiler chickens caused by <i>Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E.
acervulina, E. maxima, E. brunetti, </i>and<i>  E. mivati </i><p> 

 <b>k.  Pioneer Product/"Listed" Product: </b><p>   Bio-Cox; salinomycin
sodium; NADA # 128-686; Agri-Bio Corporation <p>
<b>l.  Date Stamped:</b>  February 23, 1994<p>
     
 
<b> 2.  TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
    Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new
animal drug application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product).  New target animal safety data,
drug effectiveness data, and human food safety data (other than tissue residue
data) are not required for approval of an ANADA.  An ANADA relies on the target
animal safety, drug effectiveness, and human food safety data in the pioneer's
new animal drug application.  Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the
generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer.  If bioequivalence is
demonstrated through a clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to
establish the withdrawal time for the generic product is also required.  For
certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in
vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990).<p>
        Where as waivers for Type A medicated articles are not addressed in the
Bioequivalence Guideline, Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Company was granted a waiver
from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study for salinomycin sodium as a
Type A medicated article.  The bioequivalence of the pioneer and generic
products was considered to be self-evident, because the products are Type A
medicated articles with the active ingredient from the same source
(manufacturer), and the products contain the same inactive ingredients.<p>
<b> 3.  HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
<b>a.    Safe Concentration of Residues </b><p>
    The safe concentrations for total salinomycin residues in the uncooked edible
tissues of broiler chickens were established as 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm in
liver, and 1.2 ppm in skin/fat (48 FR 30616, July 5, 1983).  An upper limit of
unchanged salinomycin in skin/fat is established at 200 ppb.<p>
<b>b.    Withdrawal Time </b><p>
    When a waiver from the requirement of an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study
is granted, the withdrawal period assigned to the generic product is the same
as that previously assigned to the pioneer product.  A zero withdrawal is
established for salinomycin sodium in broiler feed.<br>
  <br>
  <b>c.  Regulatory Method:</b><p>
    A regulatory method was not required because the generic product is assigned a
zero withdrawal.<p>
<b> 4.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>  <br>
        This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that salinomycin sodium when used under the proposed conditions of
use, is safe and effective for its labeled indications.<p>

                    Lowell, Arkansas 72745<p>
 <b>Generic Name:</b>       Tylosin (as tylosin phosphate) combined with Sulfamethazine<p>
<b> Trade Name:</b>          Tylan 5, 10, 20 &amp; 40 Sulfa-G Premixes<p>
<b> Date of Summary:  </b>      February 19, 1986<p>
<b> II. Indications for Use:</b><p>
For maintaining weight gains and feed efficiency in the presence of atrophic
rhinitis; lowering the incidence and severity of Bordetella bronchiseptical
rhinitis; prevention of swine dysentery (vibrionic); control of swine pneumonia
caused by bacterial pathogens (Pasteurella multocida and/or Corynebacterium
pyogenes).<p>
Feeds containing Tylosin and Sulfamethazine must be withdrawn 15 days before
swine are slaughtered.<p>
<b> III. Dosage Form:</b> 
<b>Medicated Premix: </b><p> The premix is to be added to the feed such that the
complete feed contains 100 grams of tylosin and 100 grams of sulfamethazine per
ton.<p>
<b> IV. Summary of Safety and Efficacy:</b><p>
The safety and efficacy data upon which this application was approved are found
in NADAs  12-491 and  41-275 for Elanco Products Company and are summarized in
an FOI Summary filed with the Dockets Management Branch under the generic name
of the drugs.<p>
<b> V. Agency Conclusion:</b><p>
Approval of this application is based on safety and effectiveness data
contained in Elanco Products Company's approved NADAs  12-491 and  41-275.  Use
of the data in NADAs  12-491 and  41-275 to support this application has been
authorized by Elanco.  This approval does not change the approved use of the
drug. Consequently, approval of this NADA poses no increased human risk from
exposure to residues of the animal drug, nor does it change the conditions of
the drug's safe use in the target animal species.  Accordingly, under the
Center for Veterinary Medicine's supplemental approval policy (42 FR 643367),
this is equivalent to a Category II supplemental approval, which does not
require reevaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the original
application.<p>

The supplement containing melengestrol acetate provided at a rate of 0.5 to 2.0
pounds per head, may be top-dressed onto or mixed with the feed containing
tylosin.<p> 
This clearance does not provide for the mixing of melengestrol acetate and
tylosin premixes together in a common supplement or in a complete ration
offered for sale by the feed manufacturer.<p>
<b>IV.  Effectiveness (In compliance with combination approval claims)</b><p>
The efficacy of melengestrol acetate for increased rate of weight gain,
improved feed efficiency and suppression of estrus (heat) in heifers fed for
slaughter is well documented and approved (21CFR 558.342).  The effectiveness
of tylosin for reduction of liver abscesses is also established in the same
class of cattle (21CFR 558.625).  For this application, the efficacy of
melengestrol acetate and tylosin when co-administered was established by
conducting a  
series of field trials under a common protocol. These trials were designed to
evaluate the performance of feedlot heifers fed each drug separately and in
combination.<p>
<b>A.  Pivotal Studies</b><p>
A feedlot heifer study consisting of field trials at nine locations with three
replications per location was conducted to generate animals performance data on
the combination of melengestrol acetate and tylosin.  Results of each study are
reported as well as a summary and statistical analysis of the pooled data from
all nine field investigations.<p>

<b>3.  General design of each field investigation:</b><p>
    <b>a.  Purpose of the field investigations:</b><p>  To evaluate the effect of
melengestrol acetate and tylosin phosphate      on the performance of feed lot
heifers when fed singly and in combination.<p>
   <b> b.  Test animals</b><p>
        <b>(1)  Species:</b>  Bovine<p>
        <b>Number/group: </b><p> The number of heifers per treatment group varied from location
to location, and ranged         from 6 to 14 animals per pen (Table 1).<p>
        <b>(2)  Subgroup Identity:</b> <p> Heifers used in the field studies were non pregnant
yearling, the breeds were       typical of those commonly found in commercial
feedlots.  The average initial weights ranged from 674      to 826 pounds (Table
1).<p>
    <b>c.  Control groups:</b><p>
        Groups of heifers fed melengestrol acetate or tylosin alone served as
controls.  Pairwise comparisons         were made to groups of heifers fed the 2
drugs in combination.<p>
    <b>d.  Diagnosis:</b>  Not applicable<p>
    <b>e.  Dosage form:</b><p>
         (1)  Medicated feed:  <p> Feed was medicated using melengestrol acetate or
tylosin premixes.  Final feeds      were prepared using intermediate premixes
which were either mixed into or top-dressed onto the bulk of        the ration.<p>
    <b>f.  Route of drug administration:</b>  (1)  Oral<p>
<b>4.  Effectiveness Pivotal Study Continued:</b><p>
    <b>g.  Dosages:</b><p>  The dosages used in the field study were:<p> melengestrol acetate,
0.5 mg/head/day; tylosin, 10        gm/ton of air dried feed.<p>
   <b> h.  Days on test:</b><p>  The cattle were fed for a minimum of 90 days, the actual
day of trial termination being left         up to the investigator's judgement as to
when the cattle had reached market weight and condition.  The       days on test by

    The combination of melengestrol acetate and tylosin was justified. In the
tylosin vs melengestrol acetate     plus tylosin contrast, the contribution of
melengestrol acetate for estrus suppression (P = 0.000006), feed    efficiency (P
= 0.00346) and average daily gain (P =
0.0004) was     demonstrated. In the melengestrol acetate vs melengestrol acetate
plus tylosin contrast, the effect of tylosin    for control of abscessed livers
(P = 0.00124) was evident (Table 7).<p>
<b>6.  Conclusions</b><p>
    The data generated by the nine location field study demonstrated that the
melengestrol acetate and tylosin    combination is justified for it's effect on
estrus suppression, improved feed efficiency, increased average     daily gain and
reduction of liver abscesses. Each drug, melengestrol acetate and tylosin, has
been shown to   make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of the
combination.<p>
<b>7.  Adverse Reactions</b><p>
    No adverse reactions due to the feeding of melengestrol acetate or tylosin,
either singly or in combination     were reported.<p>
<b>8.  Special Issues</b><p>
    <b>Compliance with combination drug policy:</b><p>
    <b>a.</b>  The effectiveness and safety of melengestrol acetate and tylosin when fed
singly to feed lot cattle are       well documented in their respective approved
NADAs.  The results of adequately controlled studies        were submitted to the
FDA in support of these respective NADAs.  Such data resulted in the approval
of      melengestrol acetate as per CFR 558.342, and tylosin as per CFR 558.625.
Data generated in support of        combination usage have demonstrated that
melengestrol acetate and tylosin fed together are effective         and safe.<p>
        The data support compliance with 21CFR 514.1(b)(8)(v) and CVM's combination
drug guidelines         (November 9, 1983).  The combination is justified as detailed
in sections IV, V and VI of this application.<p>
        The use of untreated controls was not deemed necessary as a test for general
effectiveness because the individual drugs have been previously shown to be
effective and already approved at the levels tested.        The treatment groups
consisting of the individual drugs and the two-way combinations served as the
appropriate controls for the respective three-way combination.  Thus, these
treatment groups essentially        served as negative controls with respect to
21CFR 514.111 (a)(5)(ii)(a)(4), and the studies were properly       controlled.<p>
        To justify the combination, comparisons were made which demonstrated that
each drug made a        statistically significant contribution to the combination.
The two-way combination provides a benefit      that cannot be obtained from the
single compounds.<p>
        A comparison of melengestrol acetate/tylosin vs. melengestrol acetate for
transformed percent liver       abscesses demonstrates the contribution of tylosin
to the combination.<p>
        A comparison of melengestrol acetate/tylosin vs. tylosin for ADG, FE and
estrus suppression          demonstrates the contribution of melengestrol acetate to
the combination.  Significance for any variable         shows that melengestrol
acetate contributes to the combination.<p>
        The proposed ranges for each drug are justified when fed in combination since
the highest levels      proposed were tested in combination for efficiency and
human and animal safety.<p>

<b>V.  Animal Safety</b><p>
<b>A.  Pivotal Study</b><p>
The safety of melengestrol acetate and tylosin in the bovine have been
documented as evidenced by their respective approval (21CFR 558.342 for
melengestrol acetate and 21CFR 558.625 for tylosin) as feed additives.  Studies
utilizing only melengestrol acetate, monensin and tylosin were not conducted, 
the following pivotal study was conducted to establish the target animal
safety of melengestrol acetate, monensin and tylosin when fed in
combination.  This study shall also serve to establish the target animal
safety of melengestrol acetate and tylosin when fed in combination.<p>

had a representative sample     fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for
microscopic evaluation:<p>
<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 2 columns.)</b><P>
<pre>
    Brain                    Diaphragm 
    Pituitary                Rumen 
    Thyroids                 Reticulum 
    Adrenals                 Omasum 
    Pancreas                 Abomasum

    Mammary gland            Ileum 
    Mediastinal lymph node   Cecum 
    Mesenteric lymph node    Colon 
    Lung                     Heart (0ne section from each atrium and ventricle) 
    Liver                    Gall bladder 
    Kidneys                  Aorta (and small arteries) 
    Urinary Bladder          Bone 
    Spleen                   Bone marrow (smear)*

* Bone marrow smears were made at the time of necropsy, air 
  dried and fixed for 30 seconds or more in methanol.  Slides 
  were stained with Wrights stain.</pre> <p>
    The following organs were weighed at necropsy, paired organs weighed
together:<p>
    Adrenals, liver, kidneys and heart.<p>
<b>4)  Results</b><p>
    <b>a.  Clinical observations</b><p>
        No adverse, drug related clinical signs were observed during this study.<p>
        Significant statistical differences were detected for average daily gain
(ADG) at the 3X and 5X dose         level for day 41 and at study termination, which
were lower in magnitude when compared to controls.          This decrease in ADG
coincided with reduced feed consumption (average daily feed, ADF) and
appeared to be related to decreased palatability of the feed at higher dose
levels.<p>
   <b> b.  Clinical pathology</b><p>
        Occasional statistically significant changes in several hematologic and serum
chemistry parameters were       detected, but all values were well within normal
acceptable ranges and only serum cholesterol values showed a dose related
trend.<p>
   <b> c.  Gross and microscopic pathology</b><p>
        Several gross and histologic tissue changes were observed, but due to the
relative even distribution of       the changes in all dose groups including
controls, these findings were considered to be incidental rather        than drug
related.<p>
<b>5.  Conclusions</b><p>
    <b>a.</b>  Based upon the results of this study, the combination of melengestrol
acetate, monensin sodium and        tylosin phosphate in the daily feed of yearling
heifers appears to be non-toxic when fed for 90 days at up      to 5 times the
recommended dose.<p>
<b>VI.  Human Safety:</b><p>
<b>A.  Drugs for use in food animals</b><p>
<b>1.  Toxicity tests</b><p>
    Data regarding toxicity testing in melengestrol acetate and tylosin
phosphatase are contained in the    approved NADAs for the above mentioned
compounds.<p>
<b>2.  Safe concentration of residues</b><p>
    Tolerances for melengestrol acetate and tylosin phosphate are published in the
Code of Federal Regulations.    Melengestrol acetate is currently approved under
21CFR 558.342 for use in heifers at 0.25 to 0.50    mg/hd/day with a 48-hour
withdrawal period.  No residues of MGA may be found in uncooked edible  tissues
of cattle with a method sensitive to 25 ppb (21CFR 556.740).  The tolerance for tylosin phosphate
has been established at 0.2 ppm (negligible residue) in uncooked fat,
muscle, liver and kidney (CFR 556.740).  Tylosin phosphate
has no withdrawal   period established under 21CFR 558.625.<p>
<b>3.  Metabolism and total residue depletion studies</b><p>
    Numerous studies have been conducted relative to metabolism and depletion of
residues of melengestrol    acetate and tylosin when administered individually to
cattle.  The results of those studies have been filed   under the following

</pre>
The animals in each group were slaughtered within 16 hours following their last
feeding.  Perirenal fat was collected from all four treatment groups for the
melengestrol acetate analysis, and liver samples were collected from the group
1 and 2 heifers for the assay of tylosin.<p>
   <b> a.  Residues of melengestrol acetate</b><p>
        The samples of perirenal fat from each animal were assayed for residues of
melengestrol acetate using      the official AOAC gas chromatographic method.
Analysis of the samples from the group 2 (1X)       animals showed that all fat
samples were below the 25 ppb tolerance for MGA and five of the seven       samples
were below the 10 ppb limit of reliable measurement of the assay.  The two fat
samples that        gave positive responses had MGA levels of 12.7 and 13.7 ppb.<p>
        Fat samples from groups 3 and 4 (the heifers dosed at 3X and 5X levels)
yielded average residue levels      of 37.6 and 49.4 ppm, respectively.<p>
   <b> b.  Residues of tylosin</b><p>
        The liver tissue samples from the group 2 (1X) heifers and seven of the
control animals were assayed for        tylosin by the official assay which measures
microbiologically active the drug.  No positive responses       were obtained for
any of the samples by this method which has a limit of quantitation of 0.1
ppm.<p>
<b>5.  Assay noninterference data:</b><p>
    <b>a.  Melengestrol acetate assay</b><p>
        Data were generated using spiked control fat tissue samples to demonstrate
that the presence of tylosin        does not interfere with the assay of MGA.  The
study was also intended to show that MGA is stable in       frozen fat tissue over
a period of 60 days.<p>
        Samples of freshly ground control bovine fat tissue were spiked with MGA and
tylosin at the      following levels:<p>
        MGA:  0.025 ppm<br>
        Tylosin:  1.0 ppm<p>
        The spiked samples were assayed in duplicate for MGA by the official AOAC
method after 0, 15, 30, 45

 <b>   b.  Tylosin assay</b><p>
        Data to demonstrate that the presence of lasalocid and MGA does not interfere
with the assay of tylosin       are contained in study S-AAC-84-03 conducted by the
Elanco Products Company.  Samples of liver      from control heifers were
composited and fortified with 0.2 ppm lasalocid, 0.2 ppm tylosin and 0.2 ppm
MGA.  The samples were assayed for tylosin by the cylinder plate
microbiological method using      <i>  Micrococcus luteus</i>&#160; as the test organism.  No
interference was detected by the presence of lasalocid and      MGA.<p>
        The stability of tylosin in frozen liver tissue was demonstrated in study
MRC8910 conducted by the        Elanco Products Company.  Liver tissue from control
animals was fortified with 0.2 ppm tylosin and      then frozen.  Portions of the
samples were thawed at intervals up to 56 days and assayed for tylosin.  The
stability of tylosin through 56 days was indicated by the recoveries in the

    Regression analysis of these data demonstrates satisfactory tylosin stability
for the period the tissues in the   residue depletion study were stored before
assay.<p>
    The residue depletion and assay noninterference studies presented above
demonstrate that the combined   feeding of melengestrol acetate and tylosin
phosphate at their highest approved levels results in tissue    residues below
the tolerance level of both drugs at 16 hours of withdrawal.  The data also
show that each  drug in the two-way combination does not interfere with the
assay of the other.  This work confirms the     adequacy of the 48-hour withdrawal
time required for the presence of MGA in the combination and    demonstrates that
the use of these animal drugs does not pose a hazard to public health.<p>
<b>6.  Regulatory methods</b><p>
    Practical analytical methods of analysis for tissue residues of melengestrol
acetate and tylosin phosphate   may be found in the <i>Food Additives Analytical
Manual</i>&#160; on display in FDA's Freedom of Information   Public Room (room
12-A-30), 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD  20857.<p>
<b>VII.  Agency Conclusions</b><p>
These NADAs provide for the combination use of MGA and tylosin phosphate at the
levels of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day and 8 to 10 g/ton of feed (to supply 90
mg/head/day), respectively, for increased rate of weight gain, improved feed
efficiency, suppression of estrus (heat), and reduced incidence of liver
abscesses in heifers fed in confinement for slaughter.  Adequate data were
submitted which show that the combination resulted in a significant (P &#60;
.05) improvement in overall performance of heifers when compared to the
performance of heifers fed either drug singly.  The combination, when fed at up
to 5X the highest recommended combination approval (0.5 mg MGA/head/day plus 10
g tylosin phosphate/ton for 90 days), did not produce an adverse effect.  No
changes were made in the approved levels of either compound or in the target
animal and the non-interference of tylosin phosphate and MGA with the
analytical methods for MGA and tylosin phosphate, respectively, was
demonstrated.  Accordingly, approval of these NADAs is not expected to increase
human exposure to drug residues, and therefore did not require a complete
re-evaluation of the human safety data in the original applications. For the
purposes of human food safety review, these original NADAs have been treated as
Category II supplements under the Agency's Supplemental Policy (42 FR 64367).
These production drugs are OTC because they do not raise any special safety
concerns.<p>

<b>V. Agency  Conclusion:</b><P>
Approval  of  this  application  is  based  on  safety  and  effectiveness
data  contained  in  Elanco  Products  Company's  approved
NADAs  12-491  and  41-275.    Use  of  the  data  in  NADAs  12-491  and
41-275  to  support  this  application  has  been  authorized  by
Elanco.    This  approval  does  not  change the  approved  use  of the  drug.
 Consequently,  approval  of  this  NADA  poses  no  increased human  risk
from  exposure  to  residues  of  the  animal  drug,  nor does  it  change  the
conditions  of  the  drug's  safe use  in  the  target  animal  species.
Accordingly,  under  the  Center  for Veterinary Medicine's  supplemental
approval  policy  (42  FR  64367),  this  is equivalent  to  a  Category  II

How to Make a Freedom of Information Act Request to FDA</title>
</head>
<body>
<i>In accord with 45 C.F.R. &#167; 5.43(a) of the Department's FOIA implementing regulations, HHS's fee schedule for manual search/review of records has been revised.  This revised fee schedule is effective immediately.  Calculations are based on hourly salaries for the Washgton/Baltimore/Rockville headquarters area (plus 16 &#37;) but are to be used nationwide. (1/22/97)</i>

<pre>(FDA Backgrounder 9/94)
 
          How to Make a Freedom of Information Act Request to FDA
 
     The Freedom of Information Act allows anyone to request
information from FDA records not normally prepared for public
distribution. Certain materials that are prepared for public
distribution-such as press releases, consumer publications,
speeches, and congressional testimony-are available from FDA
without having to file an FOI request. Simply contact the
appropriate FDA office. Also consumers can ask questions about FDA-
related matters by writing to the Consumer Inquiries Office, HFE-
88, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md.
20857.
 
How to Make an FOI Request
     All FOI requests should be in writing. Address your request to:
               Food and Drug Administration
               Freedom of Information Staff (HFI-35)
               5600 Fishers Lane
               Rockville, MD 20857
     Or send requests via facsimile to: 301-443-1726(facsimile
         operator 301-443-2706).
     Your letter should include the following:
 
   Your name, address and telephone number.
   A statement of the records being sought, identified as
specifically as possible. A request of specific information that is
releasable to the public can be processed much more quickly than a
request for "all information" on a particular subject. Also, a more
specific and limited request will cost less for search, review and
duplication fees.
     The Freedom of Information Act pertains only to existing
records and is not a research service that complies information not
already available and identifiable. Make your request specific
enough to permit an FDA employee familiar with the subject matter
to locate the record in a reasonable period of time.
     Separate requests should be submitted for each firm or product
involved.
 
Fees
     Since FOI requesters may have to pay fees covering some or all
of the cost of processing a request, you may want to mention the
maximum dollar amount you are willing to pay. If the fees will
exceed this amount, FDA will contact you before filling the
request.
     The current schedule for commercial requesters is as follows:
 
   <i>    Search and review time:  GS-1 through GS-8:  &#36;14.00 per hour
                            GS-9 through GS-14 &#36;28.00 per hour
                            GS-15 or above:  &#36;51.00 per hour</i>
                            
       Photocopying:  10 cents per page for standard-size paper or the actual
                      cost per page for add-size paper.
       
       Microfiche:  50 cents per fiche
       
       Certifications:  &#36;10.00 each
       
       Computer charge:  actual cost for the time involved.
       
 
     For noncommercial requesters such as representatives of
educational institutions, public interest groups and the news
media, fees are charged only for duplication (with no charge for
the first 100 pages). Consumers are charged for search time and
duplication (with no charge for the first two hours of search time
and the first 100 pages of duplication).
     Do not send payment with your request. You will be billed if
the total charges are $10 or more. FDA does not accept credit
cards. Payments must be made by check or money order.

<b>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>

Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988; First GADPTRA Policy Letter), an Abbreviated New
Animal Drug Application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product).  For certain dosage forms, the
Agency grants a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo </i>bioequivalence study
(55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy Letter).  In lieu of
bioequivalence testing, the safety and efficacy of the generic product are
based on the demonstrated chemical equivalence to the pioneer product. <p>

Based on the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Med Pharmex
Inc was granted a waiver July 17, 1990 (photocopy attached) from conducting
an<i> in vivo</i> bioequivalence study with Gentavet Otic Solution.  The
generic and pioneer products are solutions with the same inactive ingredients
and the same concentrations of the active ingredient.  It is intended for
topical administration.<p>

<b>3. HUMAN SAFETY:</b><br>

<b>	Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:</b><br>

Regarding consumption of drug residues in food, human safety data were not
required for approval of this ANADA.  This drug is labeled for use in dogs and
cats only and should not be administered to food-producing animals.<p>

<b>Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling, and Administration:</b><p>

Labeling contains adequate caution/warning statements.<p>

<b>4.	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>

	This is an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) filed under
Section 512(b)(2) of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&amp;C) Act. <p>

	Safety and effectiveness for this generic animal drug, Gentavet Otic Solution,
were established by demonstration of chemical equivalence to the pioneer
product, Schering-Plough Animal Health Corporation's Gentocin Otic Solution,
NADA 046-821).  This generic product and the pioneer product have identical
labeling indications for use.  The route and method of administration of the
two drugs are identical.  Both drugs are administered topically.  The generic
and pioneer products are both solutions that contain the same active and
inactive ingredients in the same concentrations.  Both products have the same
pH.  Therefore, consistent with FDA policy implementing Section 512(b)(2) of
the FFD&amp;C Act, no additional safety, efficacy, or <i>in vivo
</i>bioequivalency studies were necessary or required.<p>

This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that Gentavet Otic Solution is safe and effective for its labeled
indications when used under its proposed conditions of use.<p>

SUMMARY</b><p>
<b>1. General Information</b><p>
<b>New Animal Drug Application Number: </b>140-971<p>
<b>Sponsor:</b> <p>
Merck Research Laboratories<br>
Division of Merck &amp; Co., Inc.<br>
P. O. Box 2000<br>
Rahway, New Jersey 07065-0914<p>
<b>Generic Name of Drugs:</b><p>
Ivermectin<br>
Pyrantel (as pamoate salt)<p>
<b>Trade Name: </b>HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus<p>
<b>Marketing Status: </b>Rx<p>
<b>Date of Summary:</b>  1-15-93<p>
<b>2. Indications for Use</b><p>
<b>For use in dogs:</b> <p>
Ivermectin (to prevent canine heartworm disease by eliminating the
tissue  larval stages of <i>Dirofilaria immitis </i>&#160;for a month (30
days) after infection), Pyrantel pamoate (for the treatment and control
of adult <i>Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Ancylostoma caninum</i>&#160;
and <i>Uncinaria stenocephala </i>.)<p>
<b>3. Dosage Form</b><p>
Ivermectin and pyrantel (as pamoate salt) are formulated in a meat-based
chewable tablet. Three dosage strengths are available for dogs of
different weight classes.<p>
<b>Route of Administration</b><p>
HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus is administered orally at monthly intervals during
the mosquito (vector for <i>D. immitis </i>) season.<p> Recommended
Dosage<p> HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus chewable tablets are administered once
monthly and provide a minimum of 6 mcg ivermectin per kg of body weight
(2.72 mcg/lb) and a minimum of 5 mg pyrantel per kg of body weight (2.27
mg/lb) when given as follows:<p>

<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 3 columns.)</b><P>
<pre><b>
Ivermectin      Pyrantel         Dog Weight</b>

68 mcg             57 mg       2.27 to 11 kg (5 to 25 lb)

136 mcg           114 mg         12 to 22 kg (26 to 50 lb)

272 mcg           227 mg         23 to 45 kg (51 to 100 lb)


</pre>
 
Dogs heavier than 45 kg (100 lb) are administered the appropriate combination
of these 
chewable tablets.<p>
<b>4. Effectiveness</b><p>
Adequate data support the efficacy of ivermectin at a dose rate of 6
mcg/kg body weight in preventing the development of heartworm larvae in
dogs. The New Animal Drug Application for HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus
contains data demonstrating that it is equivalent to HEARTGARD-30&#174;
Chewables with respect to ivermectin. The Freedom of Information Summary
for the HEARTGARD-30&#174; Chewables (Merck's NADA 140-886) application
can be referenced to support the dose of ivermectin against the
developing stages of heartworm.<p>
Data from three pivotal dose determination and three pivotal dose
confirmation trials, submitted to this combination NADA, demonstrate
that the two new sources of pyrantel used in the formulation (Farmos
Group, Ltd and Cosmos S.p.A.), at a dose rate of 5 mg/kg, are effective
for the labeled indications for use.<p>
Two pivotal dose confirmation studies with HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus were
conducted against <i>D. immitis</i>. The percent control in both
studies was 100&#37; indicating that the pyrantel does not interfere
with the efficacy of the ivermectin in the combination. In the three
pivotal dose confirmation studies against the intestinal parasites, the
efficacy of HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus was not statistically different than
that of pyrantel, indicating that the ivermectin does not interfere with
the efficacy of the pyrantel in the combination.<p>
<b>A. Bioequivalence Study</b><p>
A bioequivalence trial (Table 1, Trial &#35;12664) was conducted to show
that HEARTGARD- 30&#174; Chewables (Merck's NADA 140-886) are bioequivalent to
HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus, with respect to ivermectin. The study used a
two-period crossover design. Eighteen non- pregnant female dogs received
each of two treatments: HEARTGARD-30&#174; Chewables containing
tritiated ivermectin to provide a dose rate of 6 mcg/kg body weight, or
HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus to provide the same dose of tritiated ivermectin
and pyrantel at 5 mg/kg body weight.<p>
Blood was collected at various intervals after treatment on Day 0
(Period I) and Day 28 (Period II). Plasma was assayed for radioactivity,
and results were calculated based on ng- equivalents of ivermectin per
mL of plasma.<p> Statistical analysis of area under the curve (AUC),
peak ivermectin concentration (Cmax) and time to peak ivermectin
concentration (Tmax) used an analysis of variance for a 2- period
crossover design. Plasma ivermectin concentration data were analyzed
using a repeated measures analysis of variance.<p>
Confidence intervals (90&#37;) were constructed for the true mean values for
HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus.<p>
HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus was equivalent to the HEARTGARD-30&#174;
Chewable  formulation with respect to the bioavailability of ivermectin.
The AUC and Cmax were not statistically significantly different for the
two formulations (p&gt;.20). Confidence intervals confirmed that the AUC
and Cmax for HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus fell within 10&#37; and 15&#37;,
respectively, of the HEARTGARD-30&#174; Chewable  formulation. The Tmax
was longer by about 2.5 hours for HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus, but since the
formulation is intended for monthly use, this
difference is of no clinical significance.<p>
<b>B. Dose Selection</b><p>
<b>1. Pivotal Dose Determination Studies</b><p>
Three well controlled dose determination trials (Table 1, Trial &#35;'s
12665, 12489, and 12444) were conducted against induced and/or natural
infections of ascarids and/or hookworms using pyrantel formulated in the
vehicle for HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus. Trial &#35;12665 was conducted against
induced infections of <i>Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala,
Toxocara canis ,</i> and <i>Toxascaris leonina </i>; Trial &#35;12489
against natural infections of <i>T. canis </i>, and Trial &#35;12444 against
natural infections of <i>T. canis</i>&#160; and induced infections of
<i>A. caninum </i>. Four dogs within each replicate were randomly
allocated to one of four treatments and dosed orally with vehicle only
or with pyrantel at a dose rate of 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg body weight.
Treatments were tailored to the weight of the individual animal. Dogs
were individually penned following treatment. At necropsy 7 days after
treatment, nematodes were recovered from the intestinal tract, counted,
and identified according to species and stage of development. The total
fecal output from each dog was collected daily on approximately Days -1
to 7, and nematode eggs and worms recovered were counted at specific
time points.<p>
Geometric mean parasite counts at necropsy were calculated for each
group for each parasite using log (count +1). In combining data on a
single parasite from 2 or more trials, overall treatment group geometric
means were calculated as the geometric mean of the trial geometric
means, weighting trials equally. The transformed adult <i>T.
canis</i>&#160; counts were analyzed using an analysis of variance and
contrasts to explore dose-response models.<p> The following table shows
the percent efficacy against adult <i>T. canis, T. leonina, A.
caninum</i>&#160; and <i>U. stenocephala</i>&#160; from the three
trials:<p>
<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 4 columns.)</b><P>
<pre><b>
                          2.5 mg/kg      5.0 mg/kg      10 mg/kg</b> 

<i>T. canis </i>                        70.0            94.2             90.7 
<i>T. leonina</i>                       85.6            92.0             97.6 
<i>A. caninum</i>                       88.6            93.8             93.3 
<i>U. stenocephala</i>                 100              93.5             98.7 


</pre>
For all parasites, counts in the control group were statistically
significantly higher than those in the pyrantel groups (p&lt;.01). In
most of the studies, there were no statistically significant differences
between pyrantel treated groups. However, for <i>T. canis, T. leonina
</i>, and <i>A. caninum </i>, the 2.5 mg/kg dose groups had less than
the required 90&#37; efficacy. Based on the results of these studies, a
dose of 5.0 mg/kg was selected as effective. Table 2 shows the percent
efficacy of the selected pyrantel dose (5 mg/kg) in the individual
trials.<p>
<b>2. Pivotal Dose Confirmation Trials</b><p>
Two well controlled studies (Table 1, &#35;'s 12589 and 12590) were
conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus against
the developing stages of heartworms, and three separate studies (Table
1, &#35;'s 12591, 12592 and 13095) confirmed the efficacy against hookworms
and/or ascarids. All trials used the proposed market formulation of
HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus or single component chewable tablets based on
the HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus vehicle.<p>
<b>a. Heartworm</b><p>
Two studies (Table 1, &#35;'s 12589 and 12590) were conducted using induced
infections of <i>Dirofilaria immitis </i>. Each study used 32
heartworm-free Beagles (16 of each sex). These studies evaluated the
components of the combination as well as the combination product. Eight
replicates of 4 dogs each were formed, based on sex and weight. Within
replicates of 4 dogs each were formed, based on sex and weight. Within
replicates, dogs were randomly allocated to one of four treatments: (1)
vehicle, (2) ivermectin, (3) pyrantel, or (4) HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus.
Ivermectin and pyrantel were administered at 6 mcg/kg and 5 mg/kg body
weight, respectively. All treatments were incorporated into the vehicle
of the proposed commercial formulation, tailored to the weight of each
animal and given once orally.<p>
Dogs were infected with <i>D. immitis</i>&#160; larvae and treated 30
days later. Approximately 5 to 6 months after challenge with heartworm
larvae, dogs were euthanized and examined for the presence of
heartworms. HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus was shown to be 100&#37; effective
against 30-day-old larvae of <i>D. immitis </i>. All animals in the
control and pyrantel groups were infected.<p>
<b>b. Intestinal Parasites</b><p>
Three well controlled trials (Table 1, &#35;'s 12591, 12592, and 13095) were
conducted using induced parasitic infections of Ancylostoma caninum,
Uncinaria stenocephala, and Toxascaris leonina and natural infections of
Toxocara canis and Ancylostoma caninum. Ivermectin and pyrantel were
given at 6 mcg and 5 mg/kg body weight, respectively. Trial &#35;12591
included 36 dogs with natural <i>T. canis</i>&#160; and <i>A.
caninum</i>&#160; infections. Trial &#35;12592 included 32 dogs with induced
infections of <i>T. leonina, A. caninum </i>, and <i>U. stenocephala
</i>. In these efficacy studies, dogs within each of 8 replicates were
randomly allocated to receive (1) vehicle, (2) ivermectin, (3) pyrantel
or (4) HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus in the proposed market formulation. The
remaining dose confirmation study (&#35; 13095) was conducted with 16 dogs
to demonstrate the efficacy of HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus against induced
infections of the two hookworm species. Dogs within 8 replicates were
randomly allocated to receive (1) vehicle or (2) HEARTGARD-30&#174;
Plus.<p>
In all trials, dogs were treated orally once on Day 0 and necropsied on
Day 7 at which time worms in the intestinal tract were collected,
counted and identified according to species and stage of development.
Geometric mean counts at necropsy were calculated for each group for
each parasite, using log (count +1). Overall treatment group means
weighted trials equally.<p>
Efficacy of pyrantel at 5 mg/kg against adult <i>T. canis, T. leonina,
A. caninum </i>, and <i>U. stenocephala</i>&#160; is presented in Table
2. In each case, the mean worm count for HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus was
significantly lower (p&lt;.01) than the control mean. In the component
efficacy studies, the efficacy of HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus was generally
significantly higher (p&lt;.02) than the ivermectin-treated group, but
not significantly different from the pyrantel-treated group within
individual studies (p&gt;.20).<p> In study &#35;12591, one dog in group 3
and one dog in group 4 died from parvovirus during the terminal part of
the study (days 5 to 7). The reduction in efficacy against <i>T.
canis</i>&#160; seen in this study (&lt;90&#37;) was possibly due to a
change in intestinal transit time associated with the infection.<p>
<b>3. Corroborative Dose Confirmation Trials</b><p>
<b>a. Heartworm</b><p>
One controlled study (Table 1, &#35;12767) was conducted using an induced
infection of Dirofilaria immitis in 32 heartworm-free Beagles (16 of
each sex). The dogs were formed into 8 replicates of 4 dogs each by
weight and sex. Within replicates, dogs were randomly allocated to one
of four treatments- (1) vehicle, (2) HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus, (3)
pyrantel, or (4) HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus and pyrantel (due to improper
labeling instructions, dogs in the second treatment group received a
combination chewable tablet instead of an ivermectin chewable tablet
alone and dogs in the fourth treatment group received a combination
chewable tablet and a pyrantel chewable tablet instead of the
combination chewable tablet alone). All treatments were given orally 30
days after infection with <i>D. immitis </i>. Five months after
challenge with heartworm larvae, dogs were euthanized and examined for
the presence of heartworms. HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus was shown to be
100&#37; effective against 30-day old larvae of <i>D. immitis </i>. All
animals in the control and pyrantel groups were infected.<p>
<b>b. Intestinal Parasites</b><p>
One controlled study (Table 1, &#35;12765) was conducted in 36 dogs using
natural infections of <i>Toxocara canis</i>&#160; and <i>Ancylostoma
caninum </i>&#160;while a second study (Table 1, &#35;12766) was conducted
in 32 dogs using induced infections of <i>Toxascaris leonina, Uncinaria
stenocephala</i>&#160; and <i>Ancylostoma caninum </i>. The dogs in both
studies were dosed as in the corroborative heartworm study due to the
same labeling error. The percent control of HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus was
91.6&#37; against <i>T. canis </i>, 97.6&#37; against <i>T. leonina
</i>, and 100&#37; against <i>U. stenocephala </i>. The <i>A.
caninum</i>&#160; infections did not take in either study. Two dogs in
group 2 died from parvovirus infection 2 to 4 days following
treatment.<p>
<b>C. Clinical Field Trials</b><p>
Eight clinical field trials (see Table 1) were conducted with 8
investigators in 6 geographic locations using client-owned dogs to
establish the safety, efficacy and acceptability of HEARTGARD-30&#174;
Plus under field use conditions. Dogs were maintained in their normal
environments and were subject to concomitant therapy generally
administered to dogs under veterinary care. Prior to being placed on
trial, dogs &gt; 6 months old were shown to be heartworm-free by means
of a microfilariae test (Knott or Difil&#174;, EVSCO). Fecal examinations for
intestinal tract nematodes were conducted prior to treatment and at
various intervals during the trials.<p>
For each 3 dogs that received HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus, 1 dog (control
group) received HEARTGARD-30&#174; swallow tablets and pyrantel pamoate
(NEMEX&#174;/Pfizer, U.S. or PYR-A-PAM 2/Rotar FIB, London). All medications
were given monthly for 5 to 7 months. HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus was dosed
to provide ivermectin at a minimum of 6 mcg/kg body weight and pyrantel
at a minimum of 5 mg/kg body weight. In the positive control group,
pyrantel and ivermectin were dosed according to the manufacturers'
recommendations.<p>
Owners recorded acceptability of the combination chewable tablet and any
concurrent therapy, reactions or observations during the trial. No owner
had more than 4 dogs on trial. Clinical trial reports were compiled from
owner's and investigator's recorded observations.<p>
A summary of the eight field trials conducted is shown in Table 3. In
all, 323 animals were treated with HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus, and 107 were
included in the control group. The trials included 280 female and 150
male dogs aged 6 months to 14 years and weighing from 1.6 to 68 kg.
These animals represented 122 breeds, varieties or types, including
Collies or Collie crosses.<p>
Although approximately 85-90&#37; of the dogs in the field trials
received all scheduled monthly doses, fifty-five dogs did not complete
the trials because of lack of owner compliance (&#35;30), death/illness due
to unrelated causes (&#35;14), or loss of dog or contact with owner
(&#35;11).<p>
HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus was shown to be effective for the treatment and
control of hookworms and ascarids under field use conditions. No
hookworm eggs were detected in 94.7&#37; of dogs and no ascarid eggs
were detected in 99.0&#37; of dogs. HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus also was shown to
be completely effective in preventing the development of <i>D. immitis
</i>. HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus was consumed with an overall acceptability
of 97&#37;. Four dogs accepted the chewable tablet after it was broken
or crumbled, 2 needed more than 1 attempt before they would accept it, 2
accepted the chewable tablet with some hesitation, and 2 were
force-fed.<p>
A number of vaccines, antibiotics, flea control preparations (dips,
collars, mists, shampoos, etc.), steroids, vitamins, cestocides,
antiinflammatories, anesthetics, tranquilizers, ophthalmic medications
and hormone preparations were administered during the course of the
studies. No adverse reactions occurred with the concomitant use of these
products, demonstrating the safety of HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus when used
under field conditions concurrent with commonly used veterinary
products.<p>
A number of clinical observations were recorded for both treatment
groups during the trial. The incidence of vomiting and diarrhea, the
most commonly observed clinical conditions, was low (1.1&#37; of
administered doses).<p>
<b>D. Controlled Clinical Acceptability</b><p>
The acceptability of 18 to 24-month-old HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus chewable
tablets was compared to that of &lt; 3-month-old chewable tablets (Table
1, &#35;13713). Each of 60 dogs received one of each age chewable tablet
with an interval of 14 days. Acceptability was evaluated by the owners
as 1: Dog accepted the chewable tablet or 2: Rejected. The average
acceptability score for both groups (new and older HEARTGARD-30&#174;
Plus chewable tablets) was 1.0. The acceptability of the 18 to
24-month-old and the &lt; 3-month- old chewable tablets was
equivalent.<p>
<b>E. Conclusions from Drug Effectiveness Studies</b><p>
The results of these efficacy trials demonstrate that HEARTGARD-30&#174;
Plus prevents the development of <i>D. immitis</i>&#160; larvae and is
effective for the treatment and control of infections of <i>A. caninum,
U. stenocephala, T. canis</i>&#160; and <i>T. leonina </i>. Results of
clinical trials confirm that HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus is safe and
effective for use under field conditions in the presence of concomitant
standard veterinary therapy. HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus was consumed with
an overall acceptability of 97&#37; in the clinical field trials.<p>
<b>5. Target Animal Safety</b><p>
In target animal and clinical safety studies, ivermectin has been shown
to have a wide margin of safety in dogs at the recommended
heartworm-preventive dose. This is supported by field use of the product
in several countries worldwide. The bioequivalence study (Table 1, &#35;
12664) demonstrated that HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus and HEARTGARD-30&#174; 
Chewables are equivalent with respect to ivermectin. This allows
reference to the ivermectin safety data presented in the Freedom of
Information Summary for HEARTGARD-30&#174; Chewables (Merck's NADA
140-886).<p> Two pivotal safety studies (Tablet 1, &#35;'s 12666 and 12932)
and one corroborative safety study (&#35;12663) were conducted to determine
the safety in the target animal of the two new sources of pyrantel
(Farmos Group, Ltd and Cosmos S.p.A.) used in the HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus
formulation. These included pup tolerance (&#35;12932), reproductive safety
(&#35;12666) and repeated treatment studies (&#35;12663). The results of these
trials confirm that HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus is safe for use in most
classes of dogs including breeding animals and pups six weeks of age and
older.<p>
<b>A. Pup Safety</b><p>
A study was conducted in Beagles, aged 38-49 days, to demonstrate safety
in pups. Thirty-two pups were treated at 1, 3 or 5X the target dose of
HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus given on 3 successive days and repeated 3 times
within a 30-day period. Replicates of 4 pups from each of 8 litters were
formed.<p>
Within replicates, dogs were randomly allocated to 4 treatment groups:
vehicle, ivermectin/pyrantel (1X use level, i.e., 6 mcg ivermectin and 5
mg pyrantel/kg body weight, respectively), ivermectin/pyrantel (3X use
level, i.e., 18 mcg ivermectin and 15 mg pyrantel/kg body weight,
respectively), or ivermectin/pyrantel (5X use level, i.e., 30 mcg
ivermectin and 25 mg pyrantel/kg body weight, respectively). Treatments,
based on body weights obtained on Days -3, 11 and 25, were given on Days
0, 1, 2, 14, 15, 16, 28, 29 and 30. Hematology, serum chemistry, fecal
analyses and clinical observations were performed. All animals in the
control and high-dose groups were necropsied on Day 35 or 36, and
tissues were examined for gross and microscopic pathology.<p> Clinical
pathology and physical examination data were analyzed by analysis of
variance or covariance for a repeated measures design.<p> Initial and
terminal physical examinations did not reveal any treatment related
effects. Some dehydration was observed in animals of all groups and was
considered to be related to weaning and adapting to solid feed and
individual housing. Random vomiting was reported in all groups and was
usually of one day duration.<p>
Clinical pathology results indicated changes in the treated animals in
the following parameters: calcium, creatinine, MCHC, phosphorus and WBC.
There were also treatment effects seen in eosinophils, platelets,
prothrombin time, albumin, BUN, protein, potassium and phosphorus. None
of these differences were considered to be biologically or clinically
significant. There were no changes in temperature, weight gain or
changes in heart rate and no differences between groups in fecal
bilirubin, occult blood or microscopic examinations. On necropsy there
were no treatment related lesions. Occasional incidental findings in
control and treated animals included agonal congestion in lymph nodes
and thymus, splenic capsule scars, focal areas of pneumonia and normal
but small thyroid lobes. On histopathology there were no drug related
microscopic lesions observed in the tissues examined. Microscopic
findings were either agonal or typical of common background findings in
dogs of this age and breed.<p>
<b>B. Reproductive Safety</b><p>
A trial (Table 1, &#35;12666) was conducted to evaluate safety of
HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus in breeding male and female dogs.<p>
 Thirty-six
bitches were paired by weight and randomly allocated to one of two
treatment groups within pairs. Sixteen males, selected on the basis of a
normal semen analysis, were paired based on pretreatment sperm counts
and were randomly allocated within pairs to treatment. Treatment
consisted of either HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus at 3X the target use level
(a total of 18 mcg ivermectin and 15 mg pyrantel/kg body weight) or
vehicle chewable tablet administered orally. Males were dosed weekly
through Day 63, then daily from Day 68 through breeding. Females
received 8 to 14 weekly doses prior to breeding, then were dosed daily
through the first half of pregnancy and weekly for the remainder of
gestation through weaning.<p>

Semen analysis and body weights were evaluated weekly during the trial.
Physical examinations were performed prior to treatment and at the
conclusion of the trial. Each treatment group of studs was assigned to a
breeding sequence, and bitches were allocated to the appropriate stud
based on onset of estrus. Each bitch had two breeding opportunities.
Breeding began on the final day of semen collection (Day 85).<p>

Fertility, whelping and weaning indices were calculated, and pups that
were born dead or died during the course of the study were necropsied.
Data on semen characteristics; stud, bitch and pup weights; proportion
of pups weaned and percent with abnormalities were analyzed with the
appropriate analysis of variance or covariance. Litter size was analyzed
using an exact randomization procedure.<p>
HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus,
given orally at 3X the target dose through one reproductive cycle, was
found to have no effect on semen evaluations in terms of total sperm
count, speed of progression, motility or pH. Sperm morphology and semen
color in both test and vehicle treatment groups were normal.<p>
The following table shows the breeding indices from both groups:<P>

</pre>
Four puppies in the vehicle-treated group died due to the following: 1
from an umbilical infection, 1 was crushed, 1 was rejected by the dam,
and 1 was unable to nurse due to a cleft palate. Ten puppies died in the
HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus-treated group due to the following: 4 were
crushed, 1 was rejected, 1 was euthanized due to a congenital deformity,
and 4 did not nurse. The treatment groups were not significantly
different for litter size at birth or weaning (p&#62;1.0).<p>
Congenital
abnormalities were seen in 7 of 48 pups born in the vehicle control
group (cleft palate, anasarca, runt, open fontanel, prognathia, harelip,
and flat chest) and 5 of 61 pups born in the group treated at 3X
HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus (missing kidney, gastroschisis, open fontanel,
persistent pupillary membrane and kinked tail). The treatment groups
were not significantly different for percent of pups with abnormalities
(p&#62;2.0). Types and incidence of malformations seen were not markedly
different from those in the breeding colony and therefore were not
attributed to treatment.<p>
<b>C. Corroborative Repeated Treatment Study</b><p>
A study (Table 1, &#35; 12663) was conducted to evaluate the
toxic potential of repeated oral treatment with ivermectin alone or in
combination with 2 levels of pyrantel. Six replicates of 4 Beagles each
were allocated to 4 treatment groups-(1) vehicle only, (2) ivermectin (6
mcg/kg), (3) ivermectin/pyrantel (6 mcg and 5 mg/kg, respectively), and
(4) ivermectin/2X pyrantel (6 mcg/kg ivermectin, 10 mg/kg pyrantel). All
medications were administered daily for 5 consecutive days. Dogs were
evaluated by a physical examination prior to the study and by general
observations through Day 4 and again on Day 7. On Days 0, 1, 4, and 7
blood was drawn and urine collected for CBC, serum chemistry, and urine
analysis. At the end of the trial on Day 7, 3 dogs treated with
ivermectin/2X pyrantel were euthanized, necropsied and examined for any
gross or histopathologic changes.<p>
 Ivermectin alone or in the presence
of up to 2 times the target dose of pyrantel did not cause any
drug-related adverse physical or clinical signs in this study. There
were no gross lesions at necropsy or histomorphologic changes on light
microscopic examination of tissues following necropsy.<p>
 <b>D. Target Animal Safety Conclusions</b><p>
 HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus has a wide
margin of safety when administered repeatedly at elevated doses to dogs
including 6-week-old pups and breeding studs and bitches.<p>
<b>6. Human Safety</b><p>
Human safety: Data on human safety, pertaining to
consumption of drug residues in food, were not required for approval of
this NADA. This drug is labeled for use in dogs, which are non-food
animals.<p>
Human safety relative to possession, handling, and
administration: Labeling contains adequate caution/warning
statements.<p>
<b>7. Agency conclusions</b><p>
The data submitted in
support of this NADA comply with the requirements of Section 512 of the
Act and 21 CFR 514.111 of the regulations. It demonstrates that
HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus Chewable tablets, when used under the labeled
conditions of use, are safe and effective.<p>
 Section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii)
of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act provides a three year period
of exclusivity to this original new animal drug application because new
clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue
studies) essential to this approval were conducted or sponsored by the
applicant.<p>
<B>Compliance with 21 CFR 514.1 (b)(8)(v) and the Center's
Drug Combination Guideline:</B><P>
HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus is a 2-way
combination of ivermectin and pyrantel pamoate. The sponsor conducted
adequate and well controlled safety and effectiveness studies, including
dose determination and field studies, that demonstrate the source of
pyrantel pamoate used in the formulation of HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus is
safe and effective for the labeled indications for use.<p>
The sponsor
also conducted 2 pivotal dose confirmation studies with HEARTGARD-30&#174;
Plus against <i>D. immitis </i>. The percent control in both studies was
100&#37; indicating that the pyrantel does not interfere with the
efficacy of the ivermectin in the combination. In three pivotal dose
confirmation studies against the intestinal parasites, the efficacy of
HEARTGARD-30&#174; Plus was not statistically different than that of the
pyrantel, indicating that the ivermectin does not interfere with the
efficacy of the pyrantel in the combination.<p>
The data submitted in
the NADA demonstrate that the combination of ivermectin and pyrantel is
superior to ivermectin alone or pyrantel alone for the labeled
indications for use.<p>
The drug is restricted to use by or on the order
of a licensed veterinarian as knowledge of veterinary parasitology is
needed for the safe use, monitoring and detection of possible adverse
reactions with this drug.<p>

SUMMARY</b><p>
<b>1. General Information</b><p> 
<b>NADA number:</b> 
140-927<p>
<b>Sponsor:</b><p>
Intervet America, Inc.<br>
P. O. Box 318<br>
405 State Street<br>
Millsboro, DE 19966<p>
<b>Generic Name:</b> 
Chorionic gonadotropin<p>
<b>Trade Name:</b> 
CHORULON&#174;<p>
<b>Marketing Status:</b> 
Rx<p>
<b>Date of Summary:</b>  November 22, 1991<p>
<b>2. Indications for use:</b><p>
CHORULON is indicated for the intramuscular use in cows for the 
treatment of nymphomania (frequent or constant heat) due to cystic 
ovaries.<p>
<b>3. Dosage Form(s), Route(s) of Administration and Recommended 
Dosage(s):</b><p>
CHORULON is supplied in cartons containing five single dose vials of 
freeze-dried powder, plus five 10 mL vials of sterile diluent. When 
reconstituted, each single dose vial (10 mL) contains 10,000 I.U. 
chorionic gonadotropin (equivalent to 10,000 U.S.P. Units chorionic 
gonadotropin) in phosphate-buffered water for injection.<p>
One dose (10 mL) of reconstituted CHORULON should be administered as 
a single deep intramuscular injection. Dosage may be repeated in 14 
days if the animal's behavior or rectal examination of the ovaries 
indicates the necessity for retreatment.<p>
<b>4. Effectiveness:</b><p>
The approval of the new animal drug application for chorionic 
gonadotropin for injection is based on the NAS/NRC (DESI) efficacy 
review published in the Federal Register of December 6, 1969 (34 Fed. 
Reg. 19388). The Food and Drug Administration concurred with the 
Academy's conclusion (id.), and subsequently approved a supplemental 
new animal drug application (NADA) for the DESI-reviewed pioneer 
product (37 <i>Fed. Reg.</i>&#160; 4333; March 2, 1972). U.S.P. bioassay results 
submitted by the sponsor demonstrate biological equivalence to the 
pioneer product.<p>
<b>5. Animal Safety:</b><p>
The NADA for the DESI-reviewed pioneer product was originally 
approved as safe for use as labeled on December 19, 1946. FDA 
reaffirmed that conclusion on March 2, 1972 (37 <i>Fed. Reg.</i>&#160; 4333) when 
it approved the supplemental application for that product. NADA 140- 
927 is approved via demonstration of equivalence to the pioneer 
product. Therefore, no additional target animal safety studies were 
required.<p>
<b>6. Human Food Safety:</b><p>
a) Toxicity studies:<p>
Human chorionic gonadotropin is not orally active; therefore, 
residues of chorionic gonadotropin are safe for human consumption, 
and toxicological studies were not required.<p>
b) Residue studies:<p>
As there was no requirement for toxicological testing, tissue residue 
studies were not required and there is no tolerance, withdrawal 
period, or regulatory method for CHORULON (human chorionic 
gonadotropin).<p>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements 
of section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that CHORULON (chorionic 
gonadotropin), when used under its labeled conditions of use, is safe 
and effective for intramuscular use in cows for the treatment of 
nymphomania (frequent or constant heat) due to cystic ovaries.<p>
The sponsor submitted U.S.P. bioassay results which demonstrate 
biological equivalence to the pioneer product.<p>
Chorionic Gonadotropin injection for use in food-producing animals is 
currently on the market as a prescription drug. Accurate diagnosis 
can only be made, and the conditions for use prescribed on the 
labeling can only be followed, by a licensed veterinarian. Therefore, 
this product, like the pioneer, is a prescription drug.<p>
Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 
1988, this approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under 
section 512(c)(2)(F) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(the act) (21 U.S.C. 360b (c)(2)(F) because the active ingredient in 
this product has been approved under section 512(b) of the act for 
the same indication at the same dose in another NADA.&#26; <p>

<B>F.O.I SUMMARY</B><P>

<B>BAMBERMYCINS IN COMBINATION WITH NARASIN FOR BROILERS</B><p>


<B>1. General Information:</B><p>
<B>NADA:</B>     140-845<p>

<B>Sponsor:</B><p>

Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Company<br>
Route 202-206 North<br>
Somerville, N.J. 08876<p>

<B>Generic Name:</B><p> Bambermycins<br> Narasin<p>

<B>Tradename:</b><p> Flavomycin<br> Monteban<p>

<B>Marketing Status:</B> OTC<p>

<B>Date of Summary:</B> February 7, 1989<p>

<B>2. Indications for Use:</B><p>

For the prevention of coccidiosis in broiler chickens caused by <I>Eimeria
tenella, E. necatrix, E. mivati, E. acervulina, E. maxima , </I>and<i> E.
brunetti,</I>&#160;for increased rate of weight gain and for improved feed
efficiency in broiler chickens.<p>

<B>3. Dosage Form:</B><p>

Bambermycins and narasin are marketed as separate Type A medicated
articles. The bambermycins Type A medicated article is sold in two
concentrations: 2 and 10 grams bambermycins activity per pound. Narasin Type A
medicated article is sold in five concentrations: 36, 45, 54, 72 and 90 grams
of narasin activity per pound. <p>

<B>Dosage:</B><p>

The route of administration of these two drugs is oral
via the feed. The recommended dosage is as follows:<p>

<B>Bambermycins: 1 to 2 g/ton</B><p>

Bambermycins is added to finished broiler feed at a concentration of 1 to 2 g/t 
for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency.<p>

<B>Narasin: 54 to 72 g/ton</B><p>
 
Narasin is added to finished broiler feed at a concentration of 54 to 72 g/t for
the prevention of coccidiosis caused by <I>Eimeria tenella, E. acervulina, E. maxima,
E. brunette, E. necatrix, </I>and<i> E. mivati.</I><p>

The resultant feed containing both drugs is then fed continuously as the sole
ration.<p>

<B>4. Effectiveness:</B><p>

<B>A. Floor Pen Studies - Body Weight Gain and Feed Efficiency</B><p>

The efficacy data for each individual drug are located in its parent NADA and
the FOI contains a summary of the data. (NADA 44-759 - bambermycins - 38 FR 1274 - 
January 11, 1973; NADA 118-980 - narasin - 51 FR 29097 - August 14, 1986).<p>

The New Animal Drug Application on which approval of bambermycins in
combination with narasin is based contains adequate and well-controlled studies
demonstrating the effectiveness of bambermycins and narasin when fed to
broilers. Five experiments using a randomized complete block design were
conducted utilizing 5,420 broilers which were fed from one (1) day of age to market
weight. These experiments are summarized and evaluated below for significant
differences in rate of weight gain and feed efficiency.<p>

In these five studies, pens were randomly assigned to treatments within blocks;
50 to 80 birds of equal sex were selected at random and assigned to each pen;
five to 12 replicates were used per treatment group.<p>

The summary was done using only the combination of treatments necessary under
the revised guidelines for broiler combination efficacy studies (Guideline for
Drug Combinations for use in Animals, Center for Veterinary Medicine, October
1983). The Guideline provides for the granting of a range approval for
production drugs in the combination when the maximum level tested for the
claim(s) is demonstrated to make a significant benefit to the combination.
Thus, the following treatments from each of the five studies were pooled and
subjected to statistical analysis:<ul><p>

<Li>Narasin - 72 g/ton<p>

<li>Narasin - 72 g/ton &#43; bambermycins 2 g/ton.</ul><p>

Studies were designed to simulate varying conditions such as geographical
location, differences in climate, changes in weather, differences in management
practices, and degree of disease contamination of the premises. The chicks
were grown on old litter and diets were balanced to provide adequate levels of
all nutrients. <p>

The effect of bambermycins on rate of weight gain and feed efficiency is
presented in Table 1.<p>

An analysis of the combined data shows an overall significant (P&#60;.05)
increase in rate of weight gain and a significant (P&#60;.05) improvement in
feed efficiency due to feeding bambermycins in the presence of narasin.
Therefore, under the Guideline, these data are adequate for the claims shown on
Page 1, Item 2, under Indications for Use.<p>

<B>B. Noninterference Battery Studies</B><p>

Eight day old broiler chickens were used in seven adequate, well-controlled
battery studies to test for the noninterference of bambermycins on the
anticoccidial efficacy of narasin. Recent isolates of coccidia were used. One
of the following isolates was used in six of the experiments with a combination
of all six isolates used in the seventh experiment: <I>Eimeria acervulina, E.
tenella, E. maxima, E. mivati/mitis, E. brunetti</i>&#160; and<i> E. necatrix.</I> This
arrangement facilitated identification of lesions. The broilers were
randomized and assigned to cages with 4 broilers per cage. There were four (4)
replicates of each treatment group in each experiment. Tables II through VIII show
the treatments used in this battery study along with the results for average
weight gain, feed efficiency, lesion scores, and coccidiosis mortality.<p>

These battery studies adequately demonstrate that there is no interference of
bambermycins on the anticoccidial efficacy of narasin. Therefore, this
combination is compatible.<p>

<B>5. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY:</B><p>

The data in the original NADA for bambermycins (44-759 approved January 11,
1973; 38 FR 1274) and the data in the original NADA for narasin (118-980
approved August 14, 1986; 51 FR 29097) contain complete information on the
safety of the two products to the target animal, (broiler chickens). No
reactions were found when the two drugs were combined showing that they are
equally safe when fed separately or when combined.<p>

The safety data in the parent NADAs combined with the data from the efficacy
floor pen trials and noninterference battery studies for the combination
product demonstrate normal growth with no incidence of disease or other
abnormalities when the two drugs were fed at the highest approved use level.<p>

Further safety studies were not required because:<ul><p>

<li>a. The drugs have been approved singly;<p>

<li>b. Sufficient documentation has been provided to determine that these
compounds are compatible in combination when used in poultry feeds.</ul><p>

</pre>
The data provide corroborative evidence of the safety and efficacy of the
combination of narasin and bambermycins in the feed of broiler chickens, and
these data are consistent with and fulfill all the requirements for the two
drugs to be combined in finished feeds for broiler chickens.<ul><p>

<li>a. Each drug component makes a contribution to the claimed effect.<p>

<Li>b. The dosage of each drug component is such that the combination is safe and
effective.<p>
         
<li>c. This combination demonstrates significant control of coccidiosis for a large
poultry population<p>

<Li>d. The label claims are not antagonistic.</ul><p>

Based on the data in the parent NADAs, the noninterference battery studies and
the floor pen efficacy studies, the combination of these two drugs is safe to
be fed to broiler chickens as indicated by the label.<p>

 
<B>6. HUMAN SAFETY:</B><p>

<B>A. Toxicity Tests:</B><p>

The data in the original NADA for bambermycins (44-759 approved January 11,
1973; 38 FR 1274) and the data in the original NADA for narasin (118-980
approved August 14, 1986; 51 FR 29097) demonstrate that food for human from
animals fed these products is safe for consumption.<p>

<B>B. Safe Concentrations of Residues:</B><p>

The safe concentrations for total narasin residues in uncooked edible chicken
tissues are: 0.6 ppm in muscle; 1.8 ppm in liver; 1.2 ppm in skin/fat, (51 FR
29097, August 14, 1986).<p>

A tolerance for bambermycins is not required, (40 FR 59726; December 30,
1975).<p>

<B>C. Residue Depletion Noninterference Study:</B><p>

The residue data supporting the approved individual uses of narasin and
bambermycins have been submitted in their respective original applications.
These data also, show that a withdrawal period is not required. A summary of
the study conducted for this combination is presented in Table X and
establishes that bambermycins in the presence of narasin is not detected
(method sensitivity &#61; 0.0125) and that narasin in the presence of bambermycins
is well below its established safe concentration. Neither of the drugs
interferes with the other's tissue residue method of assay. The broilers in
that study were fed the combination of narasin (91 g/t) and bambermycins (20
g/t) for 49 days prior to the birds being sacrificed to obtain tissues for drug
assay. Edible tissues, including liver and muscle were assayed for drug
residues. The edible tissues were collected on the withdrawal dates indicated
in Table X.<p>

<B>D. Assay Noninterference</B><p>

Along with the residue depletion results presented in Table X, the sponsor
conducted a noninterference study for the bambermycins tissue assay by spiking
control tissue samples with bambermycins and narasin and conducting assays for
bambermycins residues. The results demonstrated no interference by narasin on
the assay for bambermycins.<p>

The sponsor conducted a noninterference study for narasin by spiking control
tissue samples with narasin and bambermycins and then assaying these tissues
for narasin residues. The results demonstrated no interference by bambermycins
on the tissue assay for narasin.<p>

No bambermycins residues were detected (method sensitivity &#61; 0.0125 ppm) and no
narasin residues were detected above the safe concentration (51 FR 29097;
8/14/86) in any tissues from birds used in this residue depletion study.<p>
<B>E. Regulatory Methods:</B><p>

A microbiological assay method is used to assay tissues for bambermycins
residues. The method titled "Quantitative Agar Well Plate Assay of
Bambermycins (Flavomycins) in Organs and Tissues" is on file with the Food and
Drug Administration (HFV-16) 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.<p>

An HPLC assay method is used to assay tissues for narasin residues. The method
is on file with the Food and Drug Administration (HFV-16) 5600 Fishers Lane,
Rockville, MD 20857.<p>
<B>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</B><p>

The data submitted in support of this original NADA satisfy the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that narasin (54 to 72 g/ton) in
combination with bambermycins (1 to 2 g/ton) is safe and effective for the
claims indicated in Section 2 of this FOI Summary.<p>

Under the agency's supplemental policy (42 FR 64367; December 23, 1977), this
original NADA is regarded as a Category II application which did not require
reevaluation of the safety and efficacy data in the parent NADAs (44-759 for
bambermycins and 118-980 for narasin). The drugs are to be supplied to the
feed mill in individual premixes (Type A medicated articles) for combining in
finished feeds (Type C medicated feeds) in accord with the dosages approved in
the individual parent NADAs.<p>

The residue data supporting the individual uses of narasin and bambermycins
have been submitted in their respective original applications. The residue
level of narasin is well below its
established safe concentration following a zero withdrawal period. Tissue
residue of bambermycins is not detected (method sensitivity &#61; 0.0125 ppm) at
zero withdrawal of bambermycins from the feed. A tolerance for bambermycins is
not required. The residue depletion noninterference studies for the
combination demonstrated that neither drug in the two way combination
interfered with the assay of the other drug.<p>

Shirley, N.Y. 11967<p>
<b>Generic Name:</b> Phenylbutazone Paste<p>
<b>Trade Name:</b> Equiphen Paste<p>
 <b>Marketing Status:</b> Rx <p>
<b>Date of Summary:</b> May 14, 1993<p>
<b>2. Indications for Use:</b><p>
For relief of inflammatory conditions associated with the musculoskeletal
system in horses.<p>
<b>3. Dosage Form, Route of Administration, and Recommended Dosage:</b><p>
<b>Dosage Form:</b><p> Each calibrated plastic syringe contains 12 grams of
phenylbutazone in 60 grams of paste or 6 grams of phenylbutazone in 30 grams of
paste for oral administration.<p>
<b>Route of Administration:</b> Oral.<p>
<b>Recommended Dosage: </b><p>1 to 2 grams of phenylbutazone per 500 lbs of body weight,
but do not exceed 4 grams daily. Use a relatively high dose for the first 48
hours, then reduce gradually to a maintenance dose. Maintain lowest dose
capable of producing desired clinical response.<p>
<b>Guidelines to Successful Therapy:</b><p> 
 <b>a.</b> Use a relatively high dose for the first 48 hours, then reduce gradually to
a maintenance dose. Maintain lowest dose capable of producing desired clinical
response.<p>
<b>b.</b> Response to Equiphen Paste therapy is prompt, usually occurring within 24
hours. If no significant clinical response is evident after 5 days, re-evaluate
diagnosis and therapeutic approach.<p>
<b>c.</b> When administering Equiphen Paste, the oral cavity should be empty. Deposit
paste on back of tongue by depressing plunger that has been previously set to
deliver the correct dose.<p>
<b>d.</b> Many chronic conditions will respond to Equiphen Paste therapy, but
discontinuance of treatment may result in recurrence of symptoms.<p>
<b>4. Effectiveness:</b><p>
The effectiveness of the drug product has been established by the National
Academy of Sciences and the National Research Council (NAS/NRC). NAS/NRC
determined the drug to be effective for the treatment of inflammation
associated with musculoskeletal system in the horse. The Food and Drug
Administration concurred with the NAS/NRC findings. These findings were
published on December 23,1980 in 45 FR 84762.<p>
<b>a. Pivotal Study:</b><p>
<b>1) Type of Study:</b><p>
As per 21 CFR 520.1720c (c) and 514.111, a study was conducted to demonstrate
the comparative bioavailability of Luitpold's Equiphen Paste (test product) to
the NAS/NRC reviewed standard product (Butazolidin Paste, Cooper's Animal
Health).<p>
<b>2) Names and Addresses of Investigators:</b><p>

<b>3) Design of The Investigation:</b><p>
The study was designed to demonstrate the comparative bioavailability of the
test product (Equiphen Paste, Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and the NAS/NRC
review standard product (Butazolidin Paste, Cooper's Animal Health).<p>
Twelve mature quarter horse type animals of mixed sex (6 females and 6
geldings) were utilized. The horses were randomly assigned into two groups of 3
females and 3 geldings each. The horses were determined to be healthy on the
basis of physical examination and baseline hematologic data. Feed and hay were
withheld for 24 hours prior to dosing and 12 hours after dosing to minimize
potential variance due to adsorption of phenylbutazone to hay.<p>
The bioequivalency study was of a crossover design. Horses of Group 1 were
dosed initially with the standard product, and horses of Group 2 were dosed
with the test product. After a 14 day washout period, Group 1 horses received
the test product, and Group 2 horses received the standard product.<p>
Both test and standard products were available as oral paste containing 12
grams of phenylbutazone per 60 grams of paste. The pastes were administered by
the oral route.<p>
A dosage of 2 grams of phenylbutazone per 500 pounds of body weight was
utilized in the study. The dosage of each formulation was weighed and
administered in an individual syringe of known weight. The syringe was
reweighed after dosing and the residue in the syringe was calculated and
subtracted from the total dosage. This was done to hold variability in dosage
to a minimum.<p>
The duration of the test for each replicate in the crossover study was 48
hours.<p>
The pertinent parameters measured included serum drug concentrations for
phenylbutazone at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours after
dosing and the incidence of adverse reactions. Serum samples were collected,
stored frozen, and shipped frozen to Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The content
of phenylbutazone in the samples was determined by High Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC). The chemist who performed the HPLC tests and
calculations was unaware of the group assignments for the study.<p>
<b>4) Results:</b><p>
Table 1 gives the mean serum concentrations of phenylbutazone at each time
period for both the test product and the standard product. Concentrations are
in micrograms per milliliter.<p>

<b>5) Statistical Analysis and Conclusions:</b><p>
The variables area under curve (AUC), maximum blood concentration (Cmax), and
time to maximum concentration (Tmax) for the study were calculated and
subjected to analysis of variance.<p>
Under conditions of this study, the 90% (percentage) confidence intervals for
the difference between test and reference (standard) means were (3.27%, 19.73%)
for AUC, (1.85%, 15.12%) for Cmax, (-

35.55%,
-

12.87%)
for Tmax, (5.56%, 26.11%) for AUMC, and (-

2.77%,
4.56%) for MRT . Using the (percentage) confidence intervals approach, the
results support the claim of bioequivalence between Luitpold and Cooper's
products.<p>
This study was performed prior to the Center for Veterinary Medicine's
Bioequivalency Guideline dated April 12, 1990. However, the study design and
statistical analysis meet the criteria outlined in the Guideline.<p>
<b>6) Adverse Reactions:</b><p>
No adverse reactions were reported during the study.<p>
<b>b. Corroborative Study:</b><p>

Diagnosis was made on the basis of routine clinical evaluation. Of the 52
horses, 31 (60%) were diagnosed as having arthritis or joint related injuries,
16 (31 %) were diagnosed as having inflammatory conditions of the muscle,
tendon, or bone (e.g. myositis, tendonitis, shinbuck), and 4 (8%) were
diagnosed with miscellaneous inflammatory conditions. No diagnosis was
specified in 1 horse.<p>
The route of administration for the study was oral.<p>
The dosage used was 1-

2
grams per 500 lbs of body weight daily.<p>
Duration of the therapy was left to the discretion of the clinician.<p>

<b>4) Conclusions:</b><p>
Based on this study, Equiphen Paste is readily acceptable and palatable under
conditions of field use.<p>
<b>5. Animal Safety:</b><p>
Phenylbutazone Paste was reviewed by the NAS/NRC and found to be safe in horses
at the recommended dosages reflected on the product labeling. Findings of the
NAS/NRC were published December 23, 1980 in 45 FR 84762.<p>
<b>6. Human Safety:</b><p>
Data on human safety pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food were
not required for approval of this NADA. The drug is approved for use only in
horses that are not to be used for food, and the product labeling will contain
the following statement:<p>
<b>"WARNING: Not for use in horses intended for food."</b><p>
Human safety relative to possession, handling, and administration is addressed
by the following statement on the package labeling:<p>
<b>"WARNING: Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children.</b> "<p>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations. The
efficacy and safety of the drug product has been established by the National
Academy of Science/National Research Council/Drug Effectiveness Study
Implementation (NAS/NRC/DESI) which evaluated the drug as being effective for
relief of inflammation associated with the musculoskeletal system of horses (45
FR 84762, December 20, 1980). The Food and Drug Administration concurred with
those findings. The data herein indicate that the new animal drug is
bioequivalent to the NAS/NRC/DESI reviewed standard product and is thus safe
and effective.<p>
This drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian
because a veterinarian is needed for the diagnosis of the conditions for which
the drug is intended.<p>
The approval of this NADA is based on a demonstration of bioequivalency with a
pre-'62
NAS/NRC (DESI) reviewed product; therefore, the product does not qualify for
marketing exclusivity under Section 512(c)2(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(ii), since the application does not
contain reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than
bioequivalence) essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the
applicant.<p>

<b>Dose Titration Study</b> (Pivotal)<p>  
Investigator:<p>

Waunakee, Wisconsin 53597 <p> 
A total of 32 worm free foals were used in a dose titration study to determine
the optimum dose level of pyrantel tartrate administration in the feed on a
daily basis for the prevention of <i>S. vulgaris </i>&#160;  larval infections in
horses.  The animals were divided into the following treatment groups with
8 animals per group: T-1 non-medicated control; T-2 pyrantel tartrate 0.44
mg/kg; T-3 pyrantel tartrate 2.64 mg/kg; T-4 pyrantel tartrate 4.4 mg/kg. The
medicated test animals were administered the drug in their feed on a daily
basis for thirty consecutive days.  All foals were euthanized at the conclusion of
the study for assessment of the efficacy of the test article.  Parameters
measured included arterial lesion and adhesion scores, arterial wall thickness,
larvae intimal tracks and number of larvae recovered.  The arterial lesions and
adhesions present at necropsy were evaluated based on a scoring system of 1
to 10 with 1 being normal and 10 being extremely severe lesions.<p> 
 
Each of the study parameters were first statistically analyzed by one-way
analysis of variance along with application of the Box-Cox method for
determining the appropriate transformation.  Based on the Least-Significant-Difference 
comparisons of treatment means at a 5% level of significance, there
was no significant difference between the non-medicated treatment (T-1) and the
0.44 mg/kg medicated group (T-2) in the lesion score, adhesion score, arterial
wall thickness and number of tracks.  For each of these response variables,
pyrantel tartrate medicated foals at 2.64 mg/kg (T-3) and 4.40 mg/kg (T-4) were
significantly different than the foals at the 0.44 mg/kg dose level and the non-medicated 
foals but were not significantly different from each other.  The mean
number of larvae for foals in the non-medicated treatment group was
significantly higher than that for foals in each of the three pyrantel
medicated treatment groups; however, the mean number of larvae was not
significantly different among the three medicated treatment groups.  Based on
the above analysis and the results found in Table 1, the dose level of 2.64
mg/kg body weight was determined to be the optimum dose for the prevention of
<i>S. vulgaris </i>&#160;  larva infections.

A study was conducted to confirm the efficacy of 2.64 mg/kg body weight of
pyrantel tartrate when administered orally via feed to foals for the prevention
of <i>S. vulgaris </i>&#160;  larval infections.  The treatment groups included dose
levels of 0.0, 2.64, 1.98 mg/kg body weight.  The dose level of 1.98 mg/kg was
included in this study to confirm that feed containing the active drug at the
lower end of the permissible assay variation (PAV) for pyrantel tartrate in
feed would still be effective in preventing <i>S. vulgaris </i>&#160;  larval
infections.  Twenty-four worm free foals were equally assigned to one of three
treatment groups and experimentally infected with 1000 infective larvae of
<i>S. vulgaris</i>.  Foals in treatment groups T-2 (2.64 mg/kg) and T-3 (1.98
mg/kg) were fed daily a top dress pellet containing the pyrantel tartrate (9600
gm/ton) for 35 consecutive days.  Foals in treatment group T-1 were non-medicated controls.  
All foals were necropsied at the conclusion of the study
for assessment of the efficacy of the test article.<p>  
Efficacy was determined by collecting the following data; twice daily clinical
observations, daily drug intake, weekly interval body weights, daily rectal
body temperatures, necropsy observations of adhesions and lesion scores,
arterial wall thickness, larva intimal tracks, and number of <i>S. vulgaris </i>&#160; 
larvae recovered.  The arterial lesions and adhesions present at necropsy were
evaluated based on a scoring system of one to five with one being normal and
five being extremely severe lesions. <p> 
The results of this study found in Table 2 confirm that pyrantel tartrate at
the dose of 2.64 mg/kg body weight daily is effective in the prevention of
<i>S. vulgaris </i>&#160;  larval infections in foals. There were no findings that
suggested an adverse effect of pyrantel tartrate on foals.<p>

A dose comparison study was conducted to demonstrate the equivalent efficacy of
two dosage forms (top dress and complete feed) of pyrantel tartrate when
administered orally via feed to foals at the dose level of 2.64 mg/kg body
weight daily for the prevention of <i>S. vulgaris </i>&#160;  larval infections.  
Twenty four worm free foals were equally assigned to one of three treatment
groups and experimentally infected with 1000 infective larvae of <i>S.
vulgaris </i> .  Foals in treatment groups T-2 (top dress, 9600 gm/ton pyrantel
tartrate) and T-3 (complete feed, 1000 gm/ton pyrantel tartrate) were fed daily
their respective dose forms containing the pyrantel tartrate for 35 consecutive
days.  Foals in treatment group T-1 were non-medicated controls.  All foals
were necropsied at the conclusion of the study for assessment of the efficacy
of the test article. <p> 
Efficacy was determined by collecting the following data; twice daily clinical
observations, daily drug intake, weekly interval body weights, daily rectal

<b>Field Efficacy Studies</b><p>  
A total of two field efficacy studies were conducted in Alabama and Wisconsin
to establish the efficacy of the daily administration of pyrantel tartrate
under field conditions in preventing <i>S. vulgaris </i>&#160;  larval infections and
in controlling helminth infections of horses.  It was determined that due to
the duration of the field studies (534 days) and the extensive data collection
involved that adequate data could be generated from these two studies to
support approval of this new animal drug application.  These same field
studies, as described in the safety section, were also used as the basis for
establishing the reproductive safety of pyrantel tartrate in breeding animals.
Following are summaries of each study.<p>

A total of 64 mares and 35 foals were used in this 534 day study. Treatment
groups included a non-medicated control (T-1) and a medicated group (T-2)
administered pyrantel tartrate daily in a complete grain mix (1000 gm/ton) at
2.64 mg/kg body weight.  Each treatment group was allowed to graze a parasite
contaminated eight hectare native grass pasture.  Animals were fed in groups
with each mare receiving the average dose based on the average body weight for
the group.  Feed was placed in individual mare pans within the feeding pen.
Foals were fed as a group based on the group average body weight. <p> 
Efficacy was determined by collecting the following data: Individual animal
body weights at 28 to 37 day intervals, body condition scores at each weigh
period, twice daily clinical observations, daily drug intake, fecal egg and
larvae culture counts at 28 to 37 day intervals throughout the study.  In
November of both years, six mares and six foals from each treatment group
(total of 24 animals per treatment group) were euthanized for critical worm
counts to assess the efficacy of the test article.  Data collected at necropsy
included speciated worm counts, evaluation of adhesions and arterial lesion
scores due to <i>S. vulgaris </i> , arterial wall thickness, larval intimal
tracks, and number of larvae recovered.  The larvae were identified as small
strongyles, or if of the genus Strongylus were then speciated. <p> 
The results of this trial found in Tables 4 and 5 demonstrate that the
administration of pyrantel tartrate to horses at the dose of 2.64 mg/kg body
weight daily is efficacious in the prevention of <i>S. vulgaris </i>&#160;  larval
infection as well as being effective in controlling infections of large and
small strongyles, pinworms and ascarids.  There were no adverse effects of
feeding the test article daily for up to 534 days on the health or performance
of the mares and foals. <p>

In this field study a total of fifty-six mares and thirty-nine foals were used. The study
covered a period of 535 days.  Treatment groups included a non-medicated
control (T-1) and medicated group (T-2) administered pyrantel tartrate daily as
a top-dress pellet (9600 mg/ton) at 2.64 mg/kg body weight.  Each treatment
group was allowed to graze a parasite contaminated ten acre native grass
pasture.  Animals were individually stalled daily for administration of grain
mix and medicated top-dress pellet.  Mares in the control group (T-1) were
dewormed twice due to the high incidence of clinical parasitism observed in the
group. <p> 
Efficacy was determined by collecting the following data: Individual animal
body weights at 27 to 30 day intervals, body condition scores at each weigh
period, twice daily clinical observations, daily drug intake, and fecal egg and
larvae culture counts at 27 to 30 day intervals throughout the study.  A total
of 19 mares and foals from T-1 and 22 mares and foals from T-2 were euthanized
to establish the efficacy of pyrantel tartrate in controlling helminth
infections and preventing <i>S. vulgaris </i>&#160;  larval infections in horses.  An
additional five animals from T-1 and two animals from T-2 which died the first
year just prior to the scheduled necropsies were also used as part of the
critical worm count collections.  The deaths of these additional animals were
caused by conditions unrelated to the administration of pyrantel tartrate.
Data collected at necropsy included speciated worm counts, measurement of
adhesions and arterial lesion scores due to <i>S. vulgaris </i> , arterial wall
thickness, larval intimal tracks, and number of larvae recovered.  The larvae
were identified as small strongyles, or if of the genus Strongylus were then
speciated. <p> 
The results of this trial found in Tables 6 and 7 provide further evidence that
pyrantel tartrate is effective in preventing <i>S. vulgaris </i>&#160;  larval
infections and in controlling infections of large and small strongyles,
pinworms and ascarids in horses when administered on a daily basis at a dose of
2.64 mg/kg body weight. There were no adverse effects of feeding the test
article daily for up to 535 days on the health or performance of the mares and
foals.<p>

<b>V. Animal Safety <p> 
Long Term Target Animal Safety Study</b> (Pivotal)<p>  
Investigator:<p>  
Diane J. Fagerberg, PhD<br>

Fort Collins, Colorado <p>  
This study was conducted to gather data on the long term safety of pyrantel
tartrate when administered orally via feed to horses at ten times the
anticipated field use level.  A dosing regimen of 26.4 mg/kg body weight per
day was conducted for 196 consecutive days.<p>  
Twelve yearling horses (6 geldings and 6 mares) were provided the 10X
dosage of pyrantel tartrate for 196 consecutive days as an admixed additive to
their daily grain mixture.  Horses were stalled daily only for grain feeding
and otherwise were pasture grazed with supplemental long stem hay and <i>ad
libitum</i> &#160; water.  The test animals were Quarter Horse, Appaloosa, Thoroughbred
and mixed breed.  All test animals were placed on the same treatment regimen.
A 30 day pretrial period of three data collections (days -30, -7 and -1)
provided baseline data for comparison to treatment period data.<p>  
Test article effect was monitored by collecting the following data; twice daily
clinical scores, daily feed and drug intake; and 28 day interval body weights,
body condition scores, complete physical examinations, fecal examinations,
blood and serum chemistries and hematology.  On day 196, three randomly
predesignated horses were necropsied and their tissues examined
microscopically.<p>  
Data from the study were evaluated clinically and statistically. There were no
findings that suggested an adverse effect from the 10X, long term dosage of
pyrantel tartrate when in-life data from the twelve treated horses were compared to
normal values and their respective pretrial baseline values; and when tissues
of three necropsied animals were grossly and histopathologically evaluated.<p>  
<b>Foal Target Animal Safety Study </b>(Pivotal) <p> 
Investigator:<p>  
Diane J. Fagerberg, PhD<br>

Fort Collins, Colorado <p> 
This study was designed to assess the safety of pyrantel tartrate in young
foals.  Three treatment groups received either 0X,  5X, (13.2 mg/kg) or 10X
(26.4 mg/kg) the recommended oral dose of 2.64 mg/kg body weight/day for 84 to
98 days.  Each treatment group was comprised of four male and six female foals
that ranged between one and three months of age at study initiation.<p>  
The foals were co-housed with, and continued to suckle, their parent mares for
the duration of the acclimation and treatment periods.  The acclimation period
encompassed 30 days during which baseline data were collected.  Parameters
measured in this study included body weights, clinical observations, physical
examinations, and blood and fecal clinical pathology evaluations at specific
study intervals.<p>  
There were no distinct biological or statistically significant indications of
treatment effects in the hematology or serum chemistry parameters.  Hematology
values were in general agreement with published values for normal ranges.
There were two overall trends in hematology values, independent of treatment
group: 1) a decline of approximately 14% in total blood cell count and 2) an
upward trend of approximately 25% in total white blood cell counts.  These
changes were considered normal consequences of foal maturation and not
indicative of any blood disorder. <p> 
Overall treatment period serum uric acid values were significantly higher for
foals treated at the 10X level versus the untreated controls, but actual values
for this group were still within the range of normal published values.  The
only general trends, irrespective of treatment group, emerging over the
duration of the acclimation and study periods were a slight increase in blood
urea nitrogen (BUN) and decreasing serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)
levels as the foals became older.  These values were still within the range of
normal published values and the change was considered a function of foal
maturation.<p>  
The results of the physical examinations, clinical observations and fecal
examinations failed to reveal any deleterious effects on the health of the
foals from feeding pyrantel tartrate at a level up to 10X the recommended dose.
The results of this study further substantiate the safety of this product in
horses when administered on a continuous basis.<p>  
 
<b>Drug Tolerance Study</b> (Pivotal) <p> 
Investigator:<p>  
R.M. Bodden<br>
Hazleton Laboratories America, Inc.<br>
Madison, Wisconsin 53604 <p> 
This study was conducted to demonstrate that the administration of up to 25
times the use level of pyrantel tartrate in horses would not cause any adverse
effects.  A total of ten yearling horses (four gelding and six females) were
given pyrantel tartrate at a rate of 66 mg/kg of body weight for 5
consecutive days (25 times the recommended dose).  The test material was
administered by mixing a measured amount into each animals daily grain mix
ration.  The effect of the treatment was measured by feed consumption, water
consumption, body weight, physical examinations and clinical observations.
Blood was collected for hematology and clinical chemistry tests on days -32,
-11, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. <p> 
A transient increase in the WBC count of both sexes was observed on Day 3
and in females only on Day 4 which was characterized by an increase in the
absolute neutrophil count. While mean values for the counts were mildly to
moderately higher than reference limits, they approximate values obtained from
the same horses on day -32.  In the absence of physical evidence of
inflammatory disease and considering that the counts soon returned to levels
similar to day -1, these changes were not considered to be caused by the test
material.<p>  
Statistically significant differences observed in mean corpuscular hemoglobin
(MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and prothrombin time
were inconsistent between sexes and over time and represented very small
changes.  Furthermore, there were no changes in other erythrocyte variables
that would suggest a treatment related effect on red blood cells.<p>  
Glucose was transiently increased on Days 1, 2 and 3 in both sexes.  On
Day 2 the increase was almost 50% above the baseline values.  On Day 5,
the glucose values were similar to the Day -1 values.  It is believed the
addition of molasses to the diet on Days 1 through 4 may have contributed
to this increase in glucose.  When molasses was not fed to the horses on Day
5, the glucose values were not increased.  Other differences seen in the
clinical pathology variables were considered to be the result of normal
biological variation, not related to pyrantel tartrate and not toxicologically
meaningful. The differences represented small changes that were inconsistent,
frequently present before Day -1, and of no pathological significance.<p>  
There were no adverse effects found during the routine clinical observations
and physical examinations that were considered related to the feeding of
pyrantel tartrate.  The results of this study found that no adverse effects
were produced in yearling horses when pyrantel tartrate was fed for five
consecutive days at a level of 66 mg/kg of body weight (25 times recommended
dose).  
<p>
<b>Reproductive Safety Studies</b> (Pivotal) <p> 
Two studies were conducted to evaluate the safety of pyrantel tartrate on the
reproductive performance of mares and stallions when administered daily at 2.64
mg/kg of body weight.  These studies are the same as the field efficacy studies
described earlier in the FOI Summary.  Because these studies were conducted in
conjunction with the field studies in Alabama and Wisconsin, the mares were
administered the test drug at 2.64 mg/kg body weight instead of some multiple
of the recommended dose. Following are the details of the studies: <p> 
A total of 120 mares and nine stallions were used in the two studies to
determine the safety of the test article on reproduction.  All of the medicated
mares were fed the test article for at least 500 consecutive days and in some
cases for over 700 days (two complete breeding cycles).  This duration of
administration is several times the probable duration of use for a single
course of treatment and subjects the test article to a strenuous test of its
safety.  In both studies the test article was administered during each of the
three trimesters of gestation as well as during lactation and breeding seasons
without adverse effects in the mares and stallions or their foals when compared
to the control animals.  The design and duration of these studies were
determined adequate to establish the reproduction safety of pyrantel
tartrate.<p>  
<b>Study Number 6250A-83-004 Reproductive Safety</b><p>
Investigator:<p>  
Hardin Rahe, PhD<br>

Auburn, Alabama 36849 <p> 
A total of sixty-four mares and four stallions were used in this study to evaluate the
reproductive safety in horses of the daily administration of pyrantel tartrate.
The study was conducted over two breeding seasons for a total of 534 days.
Treatment groups included a non-medicated control and a medicated group
administered pyrantel tartrate daily in a complete grain mix (1000 gm/ton) at
2.64 mg/kg body weight.  Mares in each treatment group were allowed to graze a
parasite contaminated eight hectare native grass pasture.  Animals were fed in
groups with each mare receiving the average dose based on the average body
weight for the group.  Feed was placed in individual mare pens within the
feeding pen. <p> 
Mares were bred by either hand-mating or artificial insemination in each of the
two breeding seasons.  Each mare that was bred by artificial insemination
received a minimum of 500 million live, normal sperm per breeding.  Uterine
biopsies were performed on mares that did not conceive at the first breeding.
Pregnancy determination was accomplished by either palpation, ultrasound,
plasma progesterone or a combination of the procedures.  Semen was evaluated
prior to each breeding.<p>  
The parameters measured in the assessment of reproductive safety included:
Individual animal body weights at 28 to 37 day intervals, body condition scores
at each weigh period, twice daily clinical observations, daily drug intake,
number of mares cycling, number bred, percent conception, foaling data which
included type of delivery, condition at birth and early growth rate.  Stallion
semen was evaluated for motility, morphology, concentration and volume.<p>  
The administration of pyrantel tartrate to mares at the dose of 2.64 mg/kg body
weight daily did not adversely effect the reproductive performance as
determined by percent cycling, percent bred, percent conception of mares bred
and pregnancy rates at the conclusion of the study.  The first breeding season
conception rates were 50.0 and 72.7 percent for control and medicated groups
respectively.  Conception rates in the second year were 94.4 percent for each
treatment group.  There was no adverse effect on stallion reproductive efficacy
as determined by semen characteristics and conception rates.  There were no
adverse effects of feeding the test article daily on the health or performance
of mares, stallions or foals.<p>  
In order to obtain additional data on foaling and early growth rate of foals,
23 of the original mares that were determined to be pregnant were selected to
remain on drug until 30 days after foaling (approximately and additional 190
days).  Eleven of the mares in this group were on medication for a total of 724
days at the termination of the study.  Twenty one of the 23 mares delivered a
normal healthy foal.  The administration of pyrantel tartrate daily at 2.64
mg/kg body weight had no apparent adverse effect on parturition or early growth
rate of foals.<p>

In this study a total of fifty-six mares and five stallions were used. The study was
conducted over a period of 535 days.  Treatment groups included a non-medicated
control (T-1) and a medicated group (T-2) administered pyrantel tartrate daily
as a top dress pellet (9600 gm/ton) at 2.64 mg/kg body weight.  Mares in each
treatment group were allowed to graze a parasite contaminated ten acre native
grass pasture.  Animals were individually stalled for daily administration of
grain mix and medicated top dress pellet. Mares in the control group (T-1) were
dewormed twice due to the high incidence of clinical parasitism observed in the
group.<p>  
Estrus cycles of mares in both treatment groups were synchronized with
injectable prostaglandin during each of the two breeding seasons.  Mares were
bred by either hand-mating or artificial insemination.  Each mare that was bred
by artificial insemination received a minimum of 100 million live, normal sperm
per breeding. Pregnancy determination was accomplished by either palpation,
serum PMSG or ultrasound readings.  Semen was evaluated prior to each
breeding.<p>  
The parameters measured in the assessment of reproductive safety included
individual animal body weights at 27 to 30 day intervals, body condition scores
at each weigh period, twice daily clinical observations, daily drug intake,
number of mares cycling, number bred, percent conception, foaling data which
included type of delivery, condition at birth and early growth rate.  Stallion
semen was evaluated for motility, morphology, concentration and volume.<p>  
The administration of pyrantel tartrate to mares at the dose of 2.64 mg/kg body
weight daily did not adversely effect the reproductive performance as
determined by percent cycling, percent bred, percent conception of mares bred
and pregnancy rates at the conclusion of the study.  Over the two years the
conception rates were 36% and 50% for the control and medicated groups,
respectively.  The conception rates were negatively impacted the first year due
to breeding too late in the season, mares in poor body condition and the mares
being subjected to elevated environmental temperatures during early gestation.
The conception rates between the control and medicated groups were both years
of the study with an increased conception rate seen in the medicated group both
years.  There was no adverse effect on stallion reproductive efficacy as
determined by semen characteristics and conception rates.  Moreover, percent
mares foaling and foal performance was not adversely affected by the
consumption of the test article.<p>  
 
<b>VI. Human Safety:</b><p>  
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this NADA.  The drug is approved for use only in
horses that are not to be used for food and is to be labeled:<p><b> WARNING: Not for
use in horses intended for food.</b> <p> 
 
<b>VII. Agency Conclusions: </b><p> 
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.  It
demonstrates that pyrantel tartrate is safe and effective when used in
accordance with the label directions against the following parasites: 
 
For the prevention of <i>Strongylus vulgaris </i>&#160;  larval infection in horses.<p>
For control of the following parasites in horses: <p>
LARGE STRONGYLES (adults) <i>S. vulgaris, S. edentatus, Triodontophorus </i>&#160; 
spp.<br>  SMALL STRONGYLES (adult and fourth-stage larvae) <i>Cyathostomum </i>&#160;  spp.
<i>Cylicocyclus </i>&#160;  spp., <i>Cylicostephanus </i>&#160;  spp., <i>Cylicodontophorus </i>&#160; 
spp., <i>Poteriostomum </i>&#160;  spp.,<br> PINWORMS (adult and fourth-stage larvae)
<i>Oxyuris </i>&#160;  <i>equi </i>&#160; <BR> ASCARIDS (adult and fourth-stage larvae)
<i>Parascaris </i>&#160;  <i>equorum </i> .  
<p>

This product is approved for OTC (over the counter) use as a Type B medicated
feed or top dress in a horses daily ration.  The chances of overdosing are
minimal, since the labeling provides adequate directions for safe use by the
laity.  The drug is effective against all the common helminths of economic
importance in the equine, therefore, a specific diagnosis is not mandatory for
proper use of the medicated feed or top dress.  The parasite of most economic
importance among the parasites listed on the label is <i>Strongylus
vulgaris </i> , especially its migratory larvae.  If not treated the migratory
larvae can cause verminous arteritis which can result in the death of animal.
Strongid 48 prevents strongyle larval migration.  <p>

As shown above a total of 33 birds were treated with Carnidazole resulting in a
cure rate of 75&#37;.  An equal number (32) of birds were included under placebo
treatment.  The spontaneous cure rate for untreated birds was less than 10&#37;,
which supports the conclusion that a single 10 mg Carnidazole oral dose for
adult pigeons is efficacious against<i> Trichomonas columbae</i>&#160; infections.<p>

to clean all the drinking vessels daily. One owner did not take these
precautions in one loft of six pigeons.<p>
<li><b>g. Results and Conclusions:</b><p>
 Administration of a single oral dose of 10 mg tablet
of Carnidazole resulted in a 98&#37; cure rate when all pigeons in the loft were
treated under hygienic precautions.  The data from one loft of six pigeons were
not included in calculating the cure rate, since the owner did not follow the
protocol and therefore his data were considered irrelevant.<p>

<li><b>c. Controls:</b> None<p>

<li><b>d. Dosage:</b><p> Single 10 mg tablet of Spartrix (Carnidazole) for adult and young
unweaned pigeons older than 23 days and half (1/2) a tablet for young unweaned

<li><b>e. Study Design:</b><p> All adult pigeons, weaned and unweaned pigeons 14 to 22 days old
were treated with a single oral dose of Spartrix (Carnidazole) as mentioned
above.  Young pigeons less than 14 days old were left untreated.  This group of
untreated young pigeons got the medication from their mother's crop milk.<p>
Diagnosis of the disease was based on the clinical signs such as listlessness
and random mucus samples for isolation and identification of <i>T. columbae </i>.
Definitive diagnosis of the disease was made by selective autopsies of the
birds and postmortem examination of dead pigeons to isolate the pathogen and by
identifying the pathognomonic lesions in the throat, crop and liver.<p>

<li><b>f. Results:</b><p> The study demonstrated the efficacy of Carnidazole in adult and adult
with young, under the conditions of use.  Sixty nine (69) randomly selected
adult pigeons were negative for organism.  Six (6) adult pigeons with unweaned
young ones were positive for <i>T. columbae </i>.  Probably, the adults were reinfected
while feeding the untreated young.  Three (3) weaned five (5) week old young
pigeons treated with Carnidazole and three unweaned untreated young pigeons
less than five weeks old were negative for <i>T. columbae </i>&#160; in the throat, crop and
liver, on autopsy.<p>
<li><b>g. Conclusions:</b><p> The study demonstrated that 10 mg Carnidazole for adults and 5 mg
Carnidazole for young unweaned pigeons is efficacious against <i>T. columbae </i>&#160;

</pre>
No drug-related adverse reactions were observed in the pigeons treated up to
32 times the recommended therapeutic dose.  At 64 times the therapeutic dose, 4 out of
6 birds exhibited slight vomiting. This study supports a 32 fold margin of
safety for Carnidazole in adult pigeons.<p></ul></ul>
<b>VI. Human Safety:</b><p><ul>
<li>A. Data on human safety pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food are
not required for approval of this NADA.  The drug is labeled for use in
ornamental and homing (non-food) pigeons only.<p>
<li>B. The human safety considerations, other than food safety: The labeling
contains a statement that, in case of accidental human ingestion, notify the
physician immediately and inform him or her that "Spartrix Tablets  each
contains 10 mg of active Carnidazole. Carnidazole is a member of the 5
nitro-imidazole group."<p></ul>
<b>VII. Agency Conclusions:</b><p><ul>
<li>The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section
512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.  The data
demonstrate that Spartrix (Carnidazole) when used under its approved conditions
of use is safe and effective.<p>
<li>This product is OTC (over the counter) because the pigeon fancier has adequate
knowledge to accurately diagnose the disease.  Pigeon flocks have mature and
young pigeons most of the time.  Adult birds are asymptomatic carriers and
rarely show typical lesions of trichomoniasis, other than unthriftiness.  Young
pigeons contract the disease while feeding on crop milk and develop
pathognomonic lesions in the throat.  If untreated, the young birds usually die
in one to two days after exhibiting signs whereas older birds may die in one to
two weeks.  These lesions in young pigeons are easily recognized by pigeon
fanciers.  OTC distribution will assist the pigeon fancier in controlling the
spread of disease by ensuring that the entire loft will be treated when young
pigeons show the first signs of disease.<p> </ul>

	4)Results:<p>
	
All mink from Groups 1-4 (implanted July 12, 1985) were prime and pelted on
October 17, 1985, with the exception of 1 mink from Group 1 implanted with 0.78
mg (24.7% w/w) melatonin, which failed to prime. Controls were prime and pelted
on December 3, 1985. Feed consumption was monitored, and it was determined that
implanted mink consumed an average of .55 pounds of feed per day while control
mink consumed .48 pounds of feed per day. At pelting, the quality of pelts from
implanted animals was equal to that of controls. Although obtained, serum
melatonin data did not provide reliable data for analysis because of variation in
the mean melatonin levels among the groups. This variation may have been due to
an error in the method of analysis or due to the daily cyclic spikes in
endogenous melatonin within the animals.<p>

	5)	Adverse Reactions: There was one mortality recorded - kit no. 29 in
dose group 1.95 mg (24.7% w/w) - due to cardiac puncture. There were no local
reactions associated with the implants identified at pelting.<p>

	6)	Conclusion: All dose levels (4) administered produced early priming in
mink. The 0.78 mg (24.7% w/w) dose produced 90% efficacy while the 1.95 mg (24.7%
w/w), 3.91 mg (24.7% w/w) and 7.82 mg (24.7% w/w) doses were equally effective,
providing 100% effectiveness. A clinically revevant (sic) endpoint dose was not
defined during this study. However, the study provided useful information
concerning variables (such as surface area) which affect the dissipation of the
melatonin from the implant, and therefore, efficacy of the drug.<p>

5)	Results: Melatonin doses of 0.13 mg (3.9% w/w) did not induce early
priming of fur. A dose of 1.26 mg (3.9% w/w) melatonin induced prime furring in
male and female kit mink two weeks earlier than controls. With the exception of
12 mink implanted with 5.19 mg (16.4% w/w) melatonin, all were pelted on May 5,
1986, compared to controls pelted on June 15, 1986. The twelve exceptions were
reported pelted on June 4, 1986.<p>

6)	Adverse Reactions: None were observed.<p>

7)	Conclusion: Analysis of data provided to the NADA file indicates
that the 5.19 mg (16.4% w/w) implant was an effective dose that produced priming
of mink six weeks before control mink. Of 114 implanted mink, 102 (89.4%) were
pelted on May 5, 1986, compared with the control mink which were pelted on June
15, 1986. The 1.26 mg (3.9% w/w) implant did not provide consistent results.
Priming of implanted mink was only two weeks earlier than comparable control
mink. Fractional doses of the 1.26 mg (3.9% w/w) implant [0.63 mg (3.9% w/w), 0.32 mg (3.9% w/w),
and 0.13 mg (3.9 w/w)] did not produce early priming in any mink. This study
provided additional data used to develop a dose of 2.7 mg (11.8% w/w).<p>

		F)	Parameters Measured:<p>

			1)	Date of implant removal<br> 
			2)	Quantitative analysis of implant<p>

5)	Results: Silastic implants were rinsed in alcohol, air dried and
frozen in liquid N2. Implants were pulverized and melatonin extracted and
quantitated by spectrofluorimetry.<p>

Analysis of the implants removed from ferrets at monthly intervals demonstrated a
linear pattern of release through 4 weeks with 18% of the melatonin depleted by
four weeks, 31% depleted by eight weeks, and 33% depleted by twelve weeks. The
data suggests that complete dissipation of the melatonin will ensue by 274 days.
There was a linear release pattern for 60 days post implantation (sic). The lack
of a linear pattern after this point is not relevant to the development of the
autumn molt and subsequent early priming because of the increased production of
endogenous melatonin secondary to the shortening photoperiod.<p>

6)	Adverse Reactions: None were observed<p>

General Summary of Dose Determination Studies<p>

In developing the dose determination studies for melatonin implants, several
variables were considered, including total dose of melatonin contained in an
implant, the percent melatonin by weight, and surface area of the implant.
Results of the study done in Canada (pivotal dose determination study 1)
indicated that a 1.95 mg, 24.7% w/w, 0.032 square inches surface area dose was
more effective than a 0.78 mg, 24.7% w/w, 0.019 square inches surface area dose
in producing early priming of fur. Lower doses tested in that study were no more
effective than the 1.95 mg, 24.7% w/w, 0.032 square inches surface area dose.<p>

Pursuant to the results of that study, a second pivotal dose determination study
was conducted in Argentina and it provided further information on the appropriate
dose of the drug for mink. A dose of 5.19 mg, 16.4% w/w, 0.101 square inches
surface area dose was as effective as the 1.95 mg, 24.7% w/w, 0.032 square iches
(sic) surface area dose in producing early priming by six weeks of pelts. A 1.26
mg, 3.9% w/w, 0.101 square inches surface area dose was less
effective than the 1.95 mg 24.7% w/w, 0.032 square inches surface area dose and
the 5.19 mg, 16.4% w/w, 0.101 square inches surface area dose. It produced early
priming of fur by only two weeks.<p>

Based on these data, a dose of 2.7 mg melatonin at 11.8% w/w with a surface area
of 0.074 square inches was chosen. This dose was within the range that produced
early priming of fur by six weeks (i.e., 3.9%- 24.7% weight to weight, 1.95 mg to
5.19 mg melatonin per implant, and surface area of 0.032-0.101 square inches).<p>

		2)	Pelt Size Distribution (% each size of total)<br>
		3)	Pelt Quality Distribution (% each grade of total)<p>

5)	Results: Subcutaneous implantation of a single implant containing
2.7 mg (11.8% w/w) melatonin between July 14-20, 1986, produced early prime pelts
in all implanted white mink between October 5-7, 1986. White controls were pelted
6 weeks later on November 20, 1986. White mink are normally pelted during the
last half of November. Pelt quality was better among treated white male mink than
among non-treated white males; whereas, there was no difference in quality among
white females. There was no diference (sic) in pelt size between treated and
control white mink. Treated silver blue mink were pelted on October 13 and 14,
1986, and the treated demi- buffs were pelted on October 24, 1986. Untreated
color mink were pelted on November 20, 1994. However, eighty-eight percent of the
non-implanted demi-buffs produced a higher quality pelt than the implanted
demi-buffs, which all produced C grade or below average pelts. Implanted silver
blue mink pelts were generally graded as equal to or better than non-implanted
silver blue mink pelts.<p>

6)	Adverse Reactions:	None were reported.<p>

7)	Conclusion: Implant treatment resulted in early priming, decreased
quality of demi-buff pelts, and increased quality of white male pelts. Treatment
did not affect pelt size.<p>

8)	Special Issues: Once a mink has reached its prime fur it is
economically advantageous to pelt the animal as soon as possible. Thusly, pelting
dates usually closely follow priming dates and in many instances are the same
date.<p>

5)	Results: The results of these studies are summarized in the table
below. The animals were all implanted plus or minus 6 days of the time period
recommended by the package insert for this product (July 7 - July 21). The
treated animals were observed by veterinarians to detect any adverse effects on
the general health of the mink. The 2.7 mg (11.8% w/w) melatonin implant produced
accelerated pelt priming on 90% of 23,373 mink in trials conducted on seven
commercial operating mink ranches. Group 89MN-2, Brown, reported decreased pelt
quality in 1975 mink (8.5% of total study). Group 89MN-9, Kalmon, 300 dark mink
were pelted six weeks later (12/7/89) than they should have been. Late pelting
may have produced decreased pelt quality in this group. Ranch dark mink
characteristically prime 15-30 days later than light colored mink.<p>

7)	Conclusion: Implant treatment resulted in early (4 to 6 weeks) pelt
priming in 90% of 23,373 treated mink.<p>

8)	Special Issues: Once a mink has reached its prime fur it is
economically advantageous to pelt the animal as soon as possible. Thusly, pelting

4)	General Design:<p>

	A)	Purpose: To demonstrate efficacy of the 2.7 mg (11.8% w/w) melatonin
	implant to induce early prime fur in ranched mink under actual field conditions
	of use.<p>
<pre>
    B)  Test Animals:

            Creole  8300

        4)  Sex: male and female
</pre>
	C)	Type of Control: No treatment (not implanted) with identical housing and
	maintenance.<p>

	D)	Dosage Form: Single silastic subcutaneous implant containing 2.7 mg (11.8%)
	of melatonin.<p>

	E)	Route of Administration: Subcutaneous over shoulder area.<p>

	F)	Test Duration: Data for this study were collected between July 14, 1986,
	and November 20, 1986. Mink were implanted July 14-20, 1986, and implanted mink
	were pelted October 6-27, 1986, while control mink were pelted November 20, 1986.<p>

	G)	Parameters Measured:<p>
		1)	Date of Pelting <br>
		2)	Pelt Size Distribution (% each size of total)<br>
		3)	Pelt Quality Distribution (% each grade of total)<p>

5)	Results: All implanted (treated) animals were pelted at least 4
weeks earlier than controls (not treated). Implanted creole-colored mink all
produced C grade or below average quality pelts, while 87% of the nonimplanted
creole mink produced Select/A or the best or above average quality pelts and 13%
produced C grade pelts.<p>

6)	Adverse Reactions: None were observed.<p>

7)	Conclusion: Although implanted creole mink were pelted earlier than
non-implanted controls, they were generally of lesser quality than comparable
non-implanted mink.<p>

8)	Special Issues: Once a mink has reached its prime it is economically
advantageous to pelt the animal as soon as possible. Thusly, pelting dates
usually closely follow priming dates and in many instances are the same date.<p>

At their respective pelting dates, treated males averaged 324 grams more than
their control counterparts. Control females averaged 82 grams more than the
treated (implanted) females.<p>

6)	Adverse Reactions: Elevated doses of melatonin produced advanced
spermatogenesis in male mink when compared to controls.<p>

7)	Conclusion: Use of 10 implants containing 7.8 mg (24.7%) melatonin
each in 5 males and 5 female ranched mink produced no signs of toxicity. On gross
and histologic pathology examination, pelting dates and grade of fur were noted.<p>

The difference in average weight gain (324 grams) between the implanted and
non-treated male mink at pelting could be attributed to environmental or
management factors which occurred after the treated mink were pelted but prior to
pelting of the control animals. The 82 gram difference between implanted and
non-treated females was not considered clinically significant. Advanced
spermatogenesis was noted in melatonin implanted mink pelted on 10/17/85 and
included the presence of mature spermatids in 100% of implanted male animals.
Average testes weight of treated males at pelting on 10/17/85 was 1.62 grams.
There were mature spermatids identified in 66.6% of the control mink. Average
testes weight of the control mink pelted on 12/3/85 was 1.59 grams. Comparing the
presence of mature spermatids and testes weight of melatonin implanted animals
pelted on 10/17/85 to control animals pelted nearly 7 weeks later, it was evident
that spermatogenesis was advanced by 7 weeks. Advanced spermatogenesis had no
adverse effects on pelt quality. All melatonin implanted males with advanced
spermatogenesis graded in the top two grades (Majestic and Canada). Control males
pelted on 12/3/85 graded Majestic, Canada and Unlabeled.<p>

8)	Special Issues: Once a mink has reached its prime fur it is
economically advantageous to pelt the animal as soon as possible. Thusly, pelting
dates usually closely follow priming dates and in many instances are the same
date.<p>

Adverse Reactions in other Clinical Field Trials: Summary data from
international and domestic trials conducted between June 13 and August 10, 1986,
involved 13,619 kit males, 11,623 kit females, 25 adult males and 5,847 adult
females implanted with 2.7 mg (11.8%) melatonin implants. The following adverse
reactions were observed in those trials in which mink were implanted between June
13 and July 7: decreased pelt quality (7.7%), late priming or failure to prime
early (kit male 6.8%, kit female 4.0%), occurrence or brown cast or metallic
sheen and lack of undercoat which reduces value (kit male 4.6%, kit female 1.3%,
adult female 25.5%), smaller pelts, and decreased weight gain (kit female 4.0%).
One percent (1.0%) of kit males and 1.5% of kit females implanted between July 8
and August 10 were observed to have pelts with brown casts or metallic sheens. In
summary, unfavorable early priming results were reported on 15.6% kit males, 9.3% kit females, and 25.5%
adult females implanted between June 13 and July 7. Mink implanted from July 8
through August 10 reported unfavorable results for 1.0% kit males and 1.5% kit
females. No adult females implanted between July 8 and August 10 reported
unfavorable results. Of total kit males implanted, 4.3% were reported to have
failed to prime or primed at a later date. Demi-buffs, in particular, were most
often judged to be unsatisfactory. Diet, genetics, disease, environment, and
premature implantation with melatonin may have been factors in the occurrence of
these conditions. Furthermore, data derived from the dose determination studies,
which provided for a 1.9X dose (5.19 mg) and 2.9X dose (7.82 mg), provided no
evidence of adverse reactions related to the melatonin implant.<p>

<B>6.	HUMAN SAFETY:</B><p>
 Melatonin implants are not for use in domestic animals
or animals to be consumed for food. Data on human safety, pertaining to
consumption of drug residues in food, were not required for approval of this
NADA. The drug is to be labeled for use in mink, which are nonfood animals.<p>

<B>7.	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</B><p>

The data in support of this original NADA complies with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations. It
demonstrates that PRIME-X [2.7 mg (11.8%) melatonin implants] when used under
conditions specified in the label is safe and effective.<p>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, this
approval for non- food producing animals qualifies for FIVE years of marketing
exclusivity beginning on the date of approval because no active ingredient
(including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) has been approved in any
other application.<p>

The product is OTC. It is labeled for use during a very specific time of year and
will be used by persons thoroughly familiar with the management of ranched mink.
There is no diagnosis necessary prior to initiation of treatment. The label
contains adequate directions for use.<p>

All
sows and gilts were injected s.c. on day 112 of gestation (except eight animals
in Martin's 480.2 study which were injected on Day 113).  Animals were moved
into the farrowing house on approximately Day 111 of gestation and housed in
accordance with customary practices in use at each test station. <p>

Data recorded for each study included time from treatment to parturition,
duration of labor, total number piglets born (alive and dead), birth and
weaning weights and post-treatment rebreeding rate.  The mean interval between
injection of fenprostalene and initiation of parturition for each study is
shown as follows:<p>

Results
from each of the above studies show a reduction in mean interval to parturition
when .125 mg fenprostalene or more is administered.<p>
The data from the studies were pooled by analysis of variance in three
steps as follows:<ul><p>
<li>a.  The studies where dose levels 0,  .03125,  .0625, .125, and  
.25 were all present were analyzed together, using only those doses.  Least
square means for time to parturition were determined to be 67.7,  58.5, 44.5,
34.3, and 32.9 for Groups 0,  .03125,  .0625,  .125, and .25 mg, respectively.
A significant effect (P = .04) was seen for dose.  Using linear plateau models,
it was concluded that the .125 and .25 mg doses were superior to lower doses
and, although not significant, the .25 mg dose was numerically better.<p>

The pooled data was also evaluated with respect to the variability
(variances and ranges) of the response time. The least squares means for
variances and ranges of time to parturition for Groups 0, .03125, .0625,  .125,
and .25 were 1420.5,  1124.7, 912.4, 365.9, and 154.0 for variances and 143.1,
107.9,  100.3, 71.2, and 56.3 for ranges, respectively.  The results of these
analyses  
indicate that the overall variability of the interval to parturition was
significantly reduced (P = .11 and P = 
.05 for variances and ranges, respectively).  Again, using linear plateau
models, Groups .125 and .25 were seen to provide the optimum dose with Group
.25 numerically better.<p>
<li>b.  The three studies where dose levels 0,  .25 and .50 mg were all present
were analyzed, again using only those doses.  Least square means for time to
parturition were calculated to be 71.7, 28.9, and 27.2 for Groups 0, .25, and
.50 mg, respectively.  The effect for dose was significant at P = .02 and there
were significant differences between the control and .25 mg (P= .01) and .50 mg
(P= .01) groups but not between the .25 and .50 mg groups (P= .87).<p>
The pooled data was also evaluated with respect to the variability
(variances and ranges) of the response time. The least squares means for
variances and ranges of time to parturition for Groups 0, .25, and .50 mg were
1261.3, 98.1, and 114.6 for variances and 133.0, 40.5, and 37.7 for ranges,
respectively.  The results of these analyses indicate that the variability of
the interval to parturition was significantly reduced (P= .03 for variances and
ranges) with either the  .25 or .50 mg 
groups.<p>
<li>c.  Lastly, the two trials where dose levels 0,  .25,  .50, 
.75,  1.0, and 1.25 were all present were analyzed.   Least squares means
for time to parturition were calculated to be 82.7,  28.5, 26.4, 30.7,  26.8,
and 24.1 for Groups 0, .25,  .50,  .75, 1.0, and 1.25 mg, respectively.  The
effect for dose was significant at P = .0001.  There were no significant
differences between non-zero doses.<p>
As above, the pooled data was evaluated with respect to the variability
(variances and ranges) of the response time.  The least squares means for
variances and ranges of time to parturition for Groups 0,  .25,  .50,  .75,
1.0, and 1.25 mg were 1529.2, 112.8, 132.7,  165.7, 87.7, and 104.09 for
variances and 144.8, 40.1, 39.9, 41.6, 34.0, and 39.0 for ranges, respectively.
There were no significant differences between non-zero doses.</ul><p>
The data indicated steady reduction in interval to parturition, variation
in the time to parturition, and ranges of time to parturition with increasing
dose of fenprostalene through the .25 mg level with a significant positive
response through .125 mg.  Little or no additional response was seen above the
.25 mg level.<p>
 
It is held that for this type of claim, it is more important that a
sufficient quantity of drug be administered to be reasonably certain of
inducing parturition within a short time frame than it is to administer the
"minimum effective dose."  Consequently, it is concluded that the .25 mg dose
is superior to the .125 dose on the basis that it provides a margin of
assurance that virtually all susceptible animals in the proposed treatment
population will be induced to farrow in the minimum amount of time.<p>
No differences were detected between the treated and control groups in
duration of labor, percent born alive, birthweight, or weaning weight for the
induced farrowing.  Also, no differences were detected in rebreeding rate,
litter size at birth, percent born alive, and litter size at weaning for the
subsequent untreated pregnancy and farrowing.  There were no adverse reactions
observed among the fenprostalene-treated animals.<p>

used.  At each location, animals with known breeding dates were injected SC
on approximately 112 days of gestation with either fenprostalene or
carrier. <p>
Parameters measured were time of treatment to farrowing, duration of
parturition, number of pigs born alive and dead, litter weights at weaning, and
number dying between birth and weaning.  The mean interval between injection of

Results
from each of the above studies demonstrate a significant reduction in mean
interval to parturition when either .25 or .5 mg fenprostalene is administered
on Day 112.<p>
No differences were detected in the duration of labor, percent piglets live
born, percent piglets dying between birth and weaning, and weaning weights
between treated and control groups.<p>
A total of 18 adverse reactions were reported involving only slight
reactions at the site of injection.  These reactions consisted of a slight
bruising at the injection site which disappeared after a few days.  No other
drug-related problems attributable to fenprostalene were reported by the
investigators. <p>
<b>B.  Corroborative Study:</b><p>
A preliminary study was conducted by Dr. T.A. Miller, Milford, Indiana to
evaluate various dose levels of fenprostalene for parturition induction in
swine.  Twenty-five pregnant gilts with known breeding dates were randomly
assigned to groups (5/group) and injected s.c. either 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8
mg fenprostalene.  Fenprostalene at all dose levels was efficacious in inducing
parturition.  Mean time from treatment to farrowing was 50.8,  30.5, 27.5,
27.5, and 19.3 hours for Groups 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg,
respectively.<p>
The above results support the claim that fenprostalene effectively induces
parturition in gilts.<p>
There were no differences seen between the groups for the duration of
parturition, the numbers of pigs born live/dead, and the sequence of birth for
the live/dead pigs.  There were no adverse reactions reported for this
trial.<p>
<b>V.   Animal Safety:  <p>
A.   Pivotal Study:  </b><p>
A combined drug tolerance and animal safety study was conducted by Dr.
Doyne Hamm, Research for Animal,  Inc., Fayetteville, Arkansas 72701.<p>
The purpose of this study was to assess the safety to pregnant swine of
fenprostalene when injected subcutaneously at Day 112 of gestation for
induction of parturition.  All females used in this study were 112 days
pregnant at the time of treatment with fenprostalene.  Each group was composed
of two sows and two gilts which were administered fenprostalene subcutaneously
at doses of 0 (Controls), 0.5 (2x), 1.5 (6x), 2.5 (10x), 5.0 (20x), or 12.5
(50x) mg/animal.  Repeat injections of the specified fenprostalene doses were
given at 12 and 24 hours following the initial dose if an animal had not yet
farrowed.   The clinical condition and the bodyweight of the dam and its
piglets were monitored at scheduled intervals during the study.  The time from
injection to parturition, duration of labor, proportion live-born, proportion
surviving between birth and weaning, and weaning weight were recorded.  Blood
cytology and chemistry parameters were evaluated in specimens collected on
pretreatment days -7 and 0 (prior to dosing), and on posttreatment days +1, +7,
+14, and +28.   On study day +28 (i.e.  28 days following treatment), one sow
and one gilt from each group were sacrificed and subjected to gross and
histopathologic evaluations. <p>
For the 24-hour period following treatment the 6x to 50x groups showed a
mild transient increase in temperature.  The 6x to 50x groups exhibited slight
reactions at the sites of injection.  An increase in duration of labor was seen
in the 6x and above dose groups.  Blood samples obtained from treated animals
revealed no group-wide biologically meaningful alterations in blood cytology or
chemistry values during the course of the trial.  Gross and microscopic
examination of the tissues derived from treated animals revealed no changes
attributable to the experimental regimen except for local changes seen at the
injection sites.<p>
It was concluded that fenprostalene is safe for pregnant sows and gilts at
the 0.25 mg/animal dose.  At the 6x dose animals start exhibiting longer
duration of labor, difficulties in farrowing, and inflammation at the injection
site.   Treatment with fenprostalene up to 50x (12.5 mg/animal) produced no
changes in the blood and serum profiles, nor was lethal to the target
animal.<p>
<b>VI.     Human Safety:  <p>
A.  Toxicity Tests and Safe Concentrations</b><p>
Reference is made to NADA 128-549 Freedom of Information Summary for more
detailed information on toxicity testing.<p>
1.  Utilizing a no-effect level of 8.0 mcg/kg/day established in the rhesus
monkey study, safe concentrations for human consumption of edible swine tissue
would be:  muscle 10 ppb, fat 40 ppb, and injection site 100 ppb.<p>
2.  Pienta Assay<p>
Fenprostalene was evaluated in a system designed to assay <i>in vitro</i>&#160;  
transformation of Syrian hamster embryo cells. Fenprostalene did
not induce the appearance of any transformed colonies over the concentration
range of 239 mcg/ml to 39.0 mcg/ml. This concentration range corresponded to
approximately 7.7&#37; to 78.7&#37; survival in the transformation assay.  Therefore,
the test material was considered to be inactive in the <i>in vitro</i>&#160;
 transformation of Syrian hamster embryo cells assay.<p>
The results of these studies continue to support the assignment of this
drug to Category A in the Threshold Assessment. <p>

<b>B.  Residue and Metabolism Studies</b><p>
The levels of drug related residues of fenprostalene in the tissues of
swine were determined in a total residue depletion study conducted with tritium
labeled fenprostalene.  Eight gilts of breeding age were each administered a
0.5 mg dose of 
3H-fenprostalene by subcutaneous injection.    The animals were then killed
in groups of two at 1, 2, 3 and 7 days post dosing.  Blood, urine and feces
were collected at intervals up until slaughter, and samples of liver, kidney,
muscle, fat and injection site tissue were collected from each animal at the
time of slaughter.  The radioassays of the tissue samples yielded the mean
values shown below.<p>

* The day 2 values represent a single animal due to a dosing 
error in the second gilt in that group.


</pre>
A maximum average plasma concentration of 0.410 (&#177; 1.33) ng equiv/ml was
 observed at 12 hours post dosing, and it declined to
0.117 (&#177; 0.040) ng equiv/ml for the three gilts killed at seven days post
dosing.  Radio-activity amounting to 61.2&#37; of the administered dose was
recovered in the 0-72 hour urine collections of the four gilts in the day three
and day seven sacrifice groups.  Radioactivity in the feces of the same animals
during the 0-72 hour period was an average of 14.8&#37; of the administered
dose.<p>
The fenprostalene metabolites present in liver tissue were investigated in
a separate study involving two gilts treated with 
3H-fenprostalene.  Each animal received a single 0.485 mg subcutaneous
injection of 3H-fenprostalene, and both were killed 12 hours post dosing.  A
composite sample of the livers from the two gilts was subjected to a tissue
work-up procedure using reverse isotope dilution, thin layer chromatography,
and high pressure liquid chromatography. <p>
The composite swine liver sample contained a fenprostalene total residue
level of approximately 2 ppb, and the greater part of that residue (68&#37;) was
nonextractable radioactivity.  A small part of the total residue (about 4&#37;) was
attributed to combined parent fenprostalene and fenprostalene acid, which was
the only identified metabolite.  Approximately 25&#37; of the residue was
attributed to unidentified acidic metabolites.  Structural identification of
those metabolites was considered impractical because of the small amount of
radioactivity present in the 
tissue.<p>
A comparison of the metabolite data summarized above was made with data
from earlier studies conducted in the heifer, dog, monkey, and rat.  Those
studies also showed that, one day after injection of fenprostalene, the single
identified major metabolite was deesterified fenprostalene.  The identity of
that metabolite was confirmed by GC/MS analysis in the monkey and the heifer.
These data indicate that the residue present in tissues of swine have been
adequately tested for toxicity.<p>
<b>C.  Withdrawal Time and Regulatory Method</b><p>
Neither a withdrawal time nor a regulatory method to monitor for residues
of the drug are required with the use of fenprostalene in swine for induction
of parturition because total residues of the drug do not exceed the safe
concentrations in tissues at 24 hours post dosing.  The human food safety
evaluation of this drug use was based on the total residue values at 24 hours
post dosing rather than the usual 8 to 12 hours because of an inherent
withdrawal period of approximately one day from the time of drug administration
to the time of parturition.<p>
<b>VII.   Agency Conclusions:  </b><p>
The Center for Veterinary Medicine has concluded that the data submitted in
support of this New Animal Drug Application comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act.  The data demonstrates that Porcilene&#174; is safe and
effective for induction of parturition in swine pregnant at least 112
days.<p>
The Center has also concluded that because of the potential for adverse
reactions in humans using Porcilene&#174;, prescription labeling is required.
Women of child-bearing age, asthmatics, and persons with bronchial and other
respiratory problems should exercise extreme caution when handling this
product.   In the early stages, women may be unaware of their pregnancies.
Fenprostalene is readily absorbed through the skin and can cause abortion
and/or bronchiospasms. <p>
Because this application was for a new major species, rereview of the
underlying human food safety data for fenprostalene was necessary. However,
data in NADA 128-549 were found to be satisfactory to assess the toxicity and
establish the safe concentration for use of the drug in sows and gilts.  The
metabolism study in swine, compared with the metabolism studies in the heifer,
dog, monkey, and rat that had been done in support of NADA 128-549, established
that further metabolite testing was unnecessary.  Residue studies submitted by
the sponsor were adequate to establish that a withdrawal time and a regulatory
method are not needed.<p>

bacitracin methylene disalicylate to broiler chickens. The studies (listed below)
were conducted at Lilly Research Laboratories, PO Box 708, Greenfield, IN
46140.<p>

Eight-day old Hubbard White Mountain broiler cockerels were used in each
experiment.     Chicks were housed in a coccidia free environment prior to the
initiation of each     experiment. Stainless steel batteries especially designed
for anticoccidial effectiveness     evaluation were used in these experiments.
Water and medicated feed were supplied <i>ad     libitum</i>&#160; and proper ambient
temperature and a constant lighting schedule were maintained     for the duration
of each experiment.<p> A typical broiler starter ration was used in these
experiments. Medicated feed was     administered for two days prior to coccidial
exposure. All rations were assayed for     bacitracin methylene disalicylate and
narasin.<p> Two days after initiation of medicated feeding the birds were
inoculated with coccidia. In     six experiments inoculation was by single
species challenge, i.e., one experiment for each     of the six species of
Eimeria approved for narasin. In the seventh experiment, all six     species were
combined as the mixed inoculum of <i>Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E.
acervulina, E. maxima, E. mivati</i>&#160; and <i>E. brunetti .</i> Inocula were
intended to produce clinical coccidiosis in the infected nonmedicated birds. The
treatment regimen is delineated below.<ol><p>
<li>Infected, non-medicated controls<br>
<li>Narasin (60 ppm)<br>
<li>Narasin &#43; Bacitracin methylene disalicylate (60 &#43; 110 ppm)</ol><p>
Each treatment was replicated four times using four birds per replicate.
Parameters measured were, mortality, weight gain, feed efficiency and intestinal
lesion scores. Experiments were conducted for 7 days post inoculum.<p> The data
from these experiments are summarized in Tables I through VII. These data
demonstrate that birds fed narasin in combination with bacitracin methylene
disalicylate had reduced lesion scores when compared to infected nonmedicated
birds. The addition of bacitracin methylene disalicylate to feeds had no adverse
effect on the ability of narasin to control coccidial infection. Thus bacitracin
methylene disalicylate was compatible with
narasin when the drugs are fed to growing broiler chickens.<p>

In this experiment, 840 broiler chickens were housed in a conventional type, dirt
floor  broiler house on the premises of 3T Research, Hamilton, TX. Pens trial
were arranged in  two rows with a center aisle. Each 5' x 10' pen was equipped
with a cylindrical hanging  self-feeder, a bell-type automatic waterer and a
thermostatically controlled gas brooder.  Natural light was supplemented with
incandescent lighting over the center aisle. Used litter  was top-dressed with
new shavings.<p> 
Thirty male and 30 female day-old chicks were randomly allocated
to 14 experimental  pens. Treatments were assigned to pens in a randomized
block design. The 14 pens  allowed for 7 replications of the 2 treatments.<p>
The experiment consisted of 2 dietary treatments, i.e., narasin 72.5 grams per
ton and  narasin 72.5 grams per ton &#43; bacitracin methylene disalicylate
50 grams per ton.  Commercial mixing procedures were followed and feed samples
were assayed for drug  content. Birds were on medicated feed for 46 days.<p>

In this experiment, 560 chicks were housed in a conventional broiler house, Four
Towers  Research Center, University of Georgia. Twenty male and 20 female
day-old Arbor Acre x  Peterson chicks were allocated randomly to 14 pens. All
pens were equipped with  automatic bell-type waterers, a circular feeder and
an electric heat bulb for brooding. Each  pen received approximately 2 inches
of new litter and top dressing was applied as  necessary using new pine
shavings. Medicated feeds were prepared as per standard  commercial practice.
Finished feeds were assayed for drug content. Chicks were  medicated for 49
days.<p>
Seven pens were assigned to each treatment group as follows: narasin 72.5 grams
per ton  and narasin 72.5 grams per ton &#43; bacitracin methylene
disalicylate 50 grams per ton.<p>
<b>Results: </b><p>
The addition of bacitracin methylene disalicylate to the diet increased the rate

(Table VIII). </ul><p>
<b>Summary of Floor-Pen Study</b><p> The six described floor-pen studies, using
5,020 broiler chickens were conducted in  different geographical locations to
determine the growth promoting effects of bacitracin  methylene disalicylate
in combination with narasin. The studies were designed and  conducted to
simulate varying conditions such as climate, geographical location, weather, 
management practices, and degree of disease contamination of the premises.<p>
Consistent with pen size 20 to 50 birds of each sex were selected at random and
assigned  to pens. Six to nine replicates were used per treatment group.
Bacitracin methylene  disalicylate at 0 and 50 grams per ton of feed was used
in combination with narasin at  72.6 grams per ton of feed in each study.<p>
A pooled statistical analysis of the six studies was conducted. The data
demonstrate that  the addition of bacitracin methylene disalicylate to the
diet at 50 grams per ton increased  the rate of weight gain and improved feed
efficiency significantly (p &#190; .05) when compared  to birds fed narasin
alone.<p>
<b>Summary of Effectiveness Studies</b><p>
The results of the floor-pen studies qualify this application for range approval
for the drug  combination under CVM's Drug Combination Policy, revised
October, 1983. The data  demonstrate that both drugs contributed to the
effectiveness of the combination drug.<p>
These data support approval of this application for the use of narasin at 54-72
g/ton and  bacitracin methylene disalicylate at 10-50 g/ton for the prevention
of coccidiosis caused by  <i>Eimeria acervulina, E. brunetti, E. maxima, E.
mivati, E. necatrix ,</i> and <i>E. tenella</i>&#160; and for  increased rate of
weight gain and improved feed efficiency in broiler chickens.<p>

<b>V. ANIMAL SAFETY:</b><p>
The animal safety data for bacitracin methylene disalicylate may be found in the
parent  NADA 46-592 sponsored by A. L. Laboratories, Inc. (approved March 15,
1976, 41 FR  10993); for narasin the data may be found in the parent NADA
118-980 sponsored by  Elanco Products Co. (approved August 14, 1986, 51 FR
29098). The efficacy studies  shown in Section IV demonstrate that no adverse
effects were observed when the drug  were combined, indicating that the drugs
are as safe when fed in combination as when fed  alone.<p>
Additional safety studies were not required because: (1) The drugs have been
approved  singly, and (2) adequate documentation has been provided to show
that these compounds  are compatible in combination when used in broiler
chicken feeds. Therefore, based on the  data in the original NADAs, the
non-interference study, the floor-pen efficacy studies, and  drug residue
depletion study, it is concluded that this combination of drugs may be safely 
fed to broiler chickens.<p> <b>VI. Human Food Safety</b><p>
<b>A. Toxicity Tests</b><p>
The toxicity data that support the safety of residues of bacitracin methylene
disalicylate are  filed in the parent NADA 46-592 sponsored by A. L.
Laboratories, Inc., (approved March  15, 1976, 41 FR 10993). The toxicology
data for narasin are contained in the parent NADA  118-980 sponsored by Elanco
Products Co. (approved August 14, 1986, 51 FR 29098).<p>
<b>B. Tolerances and Safe Concentrations of Residues</b><p>
The tolerance for residues of bacitracin methylene disalicylate in uncooked
tissues of  chickens is established at 0.5 ppm negligible residue (21 CFR
556.70). A tolerance for  residues of narasin in chickens was not established
because total residues of the drug  (parent &#43; metabolites) are below the
safe concentrations for the drug at zero withdrawal.  The safe concentrations
for total narasin residues in chicken tissues are: 0.6 ppm in  muscle; 1.8 ppm
in liver; and 1.2 ppm in skin with adhering fat and fat.<p>
<b>C. Tissue Residue Non-Interference Studies</b><p>
Data to demonstrate that the residue levels of bacitracin MD and narasin are not
adversely  affected when the two drugs are fed to chickens in combination were
generated in two  residue studies conducted with the three-way combination of
bacitracin MD, narasin, and  roxarsone. Both studies used overdosing levels of
bacitracin MD and narasin.<p>
The first study (LA-B-TR-1-82) was conducted for A. L. Laboratories, and it
provided data  to demonstrate that residue levels of bacitracin MD are not
adversely affected by the other  components of the combination. The
investigator for the dosing phase of the study was  John A. Herbert, Ph.D., at
the Louisiana State University, and the assays for residues of  bacitracin MD
were conducted by the Morris County Testing Laboratory, Morristown, NJ.<p>
Sixty-five broiler chicks were fed a ration containing the combination of narasin
(90 g/ton),  roxarsone (45.5 g/ton) and bacitracin MD (200 g/ton) for the
period between two to seven  weeks of age. Muscle tissue was collected for the
bacitracin MD assay from six birds  (three males and three females) killed at
zero withdrawal and from another group of six  birds at two days of
withdrawal. The mean residue values obtained in the assay for 
microbiologically active residues of bacitracin MD are shown below. The dosing
level in the  study (200 g/ton) was four times the level approved under this
NADA, and all residue  values reported were below the 0.5 ppm tolerance for
bacitracin MD.<p>


<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 3 columns.)</b><P>
<pre><b>

Tissue     Days of Withdrawal     Bacitracin MD (ppm)</b>

muscle                0                       0.40
muscle                2                       0.43


</pre>
The non-interference on residue levels of narasin by the other components of
the  combination was demonstrated in a second residue study (MO-B-TR-3-88).
The dosing  phase of the study was conducted for A. L. Laboratories, Inc., by
the Ponderosa Research  Company, French Village, Missouri, with Mr. Randall A.
Primo as investigator. The narasin  assays were conducted by Lilly Research
Laboratories, Greenfield, Indiana.<p> One hundred broiler chickens were fed a
ration containing the combination of narasin (80  g/ton), roxarsone (45.5
g/ton), and bacitracin MD (100 g/ton) from one day of age to  approximately
seven weeks of age. Groups of six birds (three males and three females)  were
selected and killed at zero (six hours), 24, or 48 hours of withdrawal from
the  medicated feed. Samples of abdominal fat were collected from each bird
and were  assayed for microbiologically active residues of narasin by Lily
Method AM-AA-CA-R108-AB-755. The mean assay results are shown below. <p>


<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 3 columns.)</b><P>
<pre><b>

Tissue            Days of Withdrawal     Narasin (ppm)</b>

abdominal fat                0.25                 0.048
abdominal fat                1                    NDR*
abdominal fat                2                    NDR


*  No detectable residues at the assay sensitivity of 20 ppb


</pre>
Metabolism data generated under NADA 118-980 has shown that microbiologically active
residues of narasin represent one-third of the total residue present in abdominal fat at
zero withdrawal.  With that relationship, the 0.048 ppm residue value listed above for zero
corresponds to approximately 0.15 ppm total residues, which is well below the 1.2 ppm
safe concentration for narasin fat tissue. <P>
The residue non-interference studies described above confirm that each drug in the 
presence of the other does not exceed its approved safe  concentration or tolerance.
Therefore, these data support a zero withdrawal period for the use of this combination
in broilers under CVM's combination drug policy.<P> 
<b>D. Assay Non-Interference Studies</b><p>
<b>1. Bacitracin methylene disalicylate assay</b><p>
The non-interference on the assay for bacitracin MD by the presence of residues
of narasin was demonstrated by the assay of control samples of chicken muscle
tissue that were spiked with bacitracin MD (0.5 ppm) with and without narasin
(0.5 ppm). The recovery values for the two sets of samples were comparable.<p>
<b>2. Narasin assay</b><p>
 The non-interference by residues of bacitracin MD on
the narasin assay used in the non-interference study was determined by the assay
of spiked chicken fat. Samples of control abdominal chicken fat were fortified
with narasin (0.05 ppm), bacitracin MD (0.5 ppm), and roxarsone (0.2 ppm) and
with bacitracin MD alone. The assay of those samples by Lilly Method
AM-AA-CA-R108-AB-755 gave no detectable response for the bacitracin MD-fortified
sample and an average narasin recovery of 90% for the samples fortified with the
combination.<p>
<b>E. Regulatory Methods</b><p>
<b>1. Bacitracin methylene disalicylate</b><p>
An analytical method for microbiologically active residues of bacitracin MD in
tissues is<br> described in the following reports: 1) "Antibiotics Residue in
Milk, Dairy Products and Animal Tissues: Methods, Reports, Protocols,"
National Center for Antibiotic Analyses,<br> Dept. HEW Washington DC 20204, Rev.
October 1968; and 2) "Modified Method for  Determination of Bacitracin in
Tissue," Test Procedure Code 9A, A. L. Laboratories, Inc., One Executive
Drive, PO Box 1399, Fort Lee, NJ 07024.<p>
<b>2. Narasin</b><p>
The use of narasin in broiler chickens was approved under NADA 118-980 without
the  need for a tolerance or an official regulatory method. However,
analytical methods for the  drug are available, and one example is the
bioautographic method used in the residue  non-interference studies for
combination approved with this NADA. That method measures  microbiologically
active residues of narasin and has TLC and HPLC confirmation  procedures. It
is described in the following report: "Determination and Confirmation of 
Narasin Residues in Chicken Target Tissue, Abdominal Fat," Method
AM-AA-CA-R108-AB-  755, Lilly Research Laboratories, Greenfield, Indiana
46140.<p>
<b>VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS  </b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section
512 of the  Act and demonstrate that narasin (54-72 g/ton) plus bacitracin
methylene disalicylate (10-50 g/ton) are safe and effective for the claims
indicated in Section II of this FOI Summary.<p>
Pursuant to 21 CFR 514.106 (b)(2), this combination NADA approval is regarded as
a  Category II supplemental change which did not require a reevaluation of the
safety and  effectiveness data in the parent applications. The drugs are to be
fed in Type C Medicated  feeds, in accordance with Section II and III of the
FOI Summary and the Blue Bird  Labeling that is attached to this document.<p>
Residue depletion studies in this application demonstrate that residues of
narasin at 0-day  withdrawal will be below the safe concentration of 1.2 ppm
in skin with adhering fat. It has  been determined that measurement of parent
narasin in skin with adhering fat represents  one-third of the total residue
present. Therefore, the reported 0.048 ppm level of parent  narasin in skin
with adhering fat is well below one-third of the established safe 
concentration of 1.2 ppm in skin with adhering fat and is appreciably different
from the  previously reported values for narasin alone.<p>
Residues of bacitracin methylene disalicylate in edible tissues are below the
tolerance of  0.5 ppm established in 21 CFR   556.70. Adequate information was
submitted to  demonstrate non-interference between the assays for each drug.
The approval of this  application will not significantly increase human
exposure to drug residues.<p> Non-interference studies demonstrate that narasin
in the presence of bacitracin methylene  disalicylate prevented an outbreak of
coccidiosis when the birds were exposed to the six  major species of Eimeria.
The data from six well-controlled floor pen studies demonstrate  the
effectiveness of bacitracin methylene disalicylate for increased rate of weight
gain and  improved feed efficiency in broiler chickens in the presence of
narasin. The policy outlined  in CVM's guideline for drug combinations for use
in animals provides for the granting of  range of approval for narasin (54 to
72 g/ton) for the prevention of coccidiosis caused by  <i>Eimeria acervulina, E.
brunetti, E. maxima, E. mivati, E. necatrix ,</i> and <i>E. tenella  </i>; for  bacitracin
methylene disalicylate (10 to 50 g/ton) for increased rate of weight gain and 
improved feed efficiency in broiler chickens.<p> Section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, provides a three-year  period of
exclusivity to NADAs for previously approved active ingredients that require 
reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or
residue studies)  and, in the case of food producing animals, human food
safety studies (other than  bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to
the approval of the application and  conducted or sponsored by the applicant.
This new animal drug application qualifies for  such an exclusivity period
which will expire three years from the date of publication of the  approval
letter.<p>

mL/100 lbs.) of body weight once daily for five days. <p>
   <b>Indications for Use:</b> <p>  "Tradename" (flunixin meglumine) solution is
recommended for the alleviation of inflammation and pain associated with
musculoskeletal disorders in horses.  It is also recommended for the
alleviation of visceral pain associated with colic in horses.<p>
  <b> Pioneer Product:</b> <p>  Banamine&#174;(flunixin meglumine),
manufactured by Schering-Plough Corporation, (NADA 101-479).<p>
<b>Approval Date:</b> September 25, 1995<p>
<b>2.   TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988; first GADPTRA Policy Letter), an Abbreviated New
Animal Drug Application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product).  For certain dosage forms, the
Agency grants a waiver from conducting an   <i>in vivo</i>&#160;   bioequivalence study
(55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; fifth GADPTRA Policy Letter).  In lieu of
bioequivalence testing, the safety and efficacy of the generic product are
based on the demonstrated chemical equivalence to the pioneer product.<p> 
Based on the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Fort Dodge
Laboratories was granted a waiver July 6, 1990, (photocopy attached) from
conducting an   <i>in vivo </i>&#160;  bioequivalence study with Banamine&#174;.
The generic and pioneer products are solutions with the same inactive
ingredients and the same concentrations of the active ingredient.<p>
<b>3.   HUMAN SAFETY:</b><p>
<b> Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:</b><p>
Regarding consumption of drug residues in food, human safety data were
not required for approval of this ANADA.  This drug is labeled for use in
horses not intended for food.<p>
<b>Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:</b><p> 
 Labeling contains adequate caution/warning statements.<p>
<b>4.   AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that "Tradename" (Flunixin Meglumine) is safe and effective for
its labeled indications when used under its proposed conditions of use.<p>
    This is an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) filed under
Section 512(b)(2) of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&amp;C) Act.<p>
    Safety and effectiveness for this generic animal drug, "trade   name" (flunixin
meglumine, 50 mg/mL), were established by demonstration of chemical
equivalence to the pioneer product, Schering-Plough Corporation's<b>
</b>Banamine&#174;(flunixin meglumine, 50 mg/mL<b>,
</b>NADA#101-479).<p>
    This generic product and the pioneer product have identical labeling
indications for     use.  The route and method of administration    of the two drugs
are identical.  Both    drugs are administered by intravenous or intramuscular
injection and repeated for  up to five days.  The generic and pioneer products
are both solutions that contain     the same active and inactive ingredients in
the same concentrations.  Both products     have the same pH.  Therefore, in
compliance with FDA policy promulgated to   implement Section 512(b)(2) of the
FFD&amp;C Act, no additional safety, efficacy, or    <i> in vivo</i>&#160;
  bioequivalency studies were necessary or required.<p>

<b>Trade Name:</b>  Tylan&#174;<p> 
<b>Marketing Status:</b>    OTC<p> 
<b>Date of Summary:</b> August 6, 1990<p> 
<b>II.  Indications for Use:</b><p> 
For increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency, suppression of
estrus (heat), and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in heifers fed in
confinement for slaughter.<p> 
<b>III.  Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage:</b><p> 
<b>Dosage Form:</b>  Feed<p> 
<b>Route of Administration:  </b>Oral<p> 
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><ul><p>
    <li>melengestrol acetate - 0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day<br>
    <li>monensin sodium - 5 to 30 g/ton of air dried complete feed<br>
    <li>tylosin phosphate - 8 to 10 g/ton of air dried complete feed (to provide 90
mg/hd/day)</ul><p> 
    Approval has been granted to feed 0.25 to 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate (MGA)
per head per day in combination     with 5 to 30 g monensin per ton of air dried
complete feed and 8 to 10 g tylosin per ton of air dried complete   feed (to
provide 90 mg/hd/day) when each additive is provided via separate supplements
or a supplement     containing MGA is fed in combination with a
complete feed containing monensin and tylosin.<p> 
    The supplement containing melengestrol acetate provided at a rate of 0.5 to
2.0 pounds per head may be top-dressed onto or mixed with the feed containing
monensin and tylosin.<p> 
    This clearance does not provide for the mixing of melengestrol acetate,
monensin and tylosin premixes together     in a common supplement or in a
complete ration offered for sale by the feed manufacturer.<p> 

<b>IV.  Effectiveness:  (In compliance with combination approval claims)</b><p> 
The efficacy of melengestrol acetate for increased rate of weight gain,
improved feed efficiency and suppression of estrus (heat) in heifers fed in
confinement for slaughter is well documented and approved  (21 CFR 558.342).
Further, the effectiveness of monensin for improved feed efficiency and
increased rate of weight gain of feedlot  cattle is established and approved
(21 CFR 558.311) as is the effectiveness of tylosin for reduction of liver
abscesses in the same class of cattle (21 CFR 558.625).  For these applications,
the efficacy of melengestrol acetate, monensin and tylosin when
co-administered was established by conducting a series of field trials under a
common protocol.  These trials were designed to evaluate the performance of
feedlot heifers fed each drug separately and in combination.<p> 

<b>A.  Pivotal Study</b><p> 
A feedlot heifer study consisting of field trials at nine locations with three
replications per location was conducted to generate animal performance data on
the combination of melengestrol acetate, monensin and tylosin.  Results of
each study are reported as well as a summary and statistical analysis of the
pooled data from all nine field investigations.<p>

<b>3.  General design of each field investigation</b><p>
    <b>a.  Purpose of the field investigation:</b><p>  To evaluate the effect of
melengestrol acetate, monensin sodium and          tylosin phosphate on the
performance of feedlot heifers when fed singly and in combination.<p> 
   <b> b.  Test animals</b><ul><p>
        <li>(1)  Species:  Bovine<br>
        Number/group:  The number of heifers per treatment group varied from location
to location, and ranged from        6 to 14 animals per pen (Table 1).<p> 
        <li>(2)  Subgroup Identity:  Heifers used in the field studies were non-pregnant
yearlings and the breeds were       typical of those commonly found in commercial
feedlots.  The average initial weights ranged from 674 to       826 pounds (Table
1).</ul><p> 
    <b>c.  Control groups</b><p>
        Groups of heifers fed melengestrol acetate, or monensin or tylosin alone, or
monensin and tylosin in            combination served as controls.  Pairwise,
comparisons were made to groups of heifers for the 3 drugs in
combination.<p>
    <b>d.  Diagnosis:</b>  Not applicable.<p> 
   <b> e.  Dosage form:</b><p>
        (1)  Medicated feed:  Feed was medicated using melengestrol acetate,
monensin or tylosin premixes.  Final       feeds were prepared using intermediate
premixes which were either mixed into or top-dressed onto the bulk of       the
ration.<p> 
    <b>f.  Route of drug administration:  </b> 
        (1)  Oral<p> 
   <b> g.  Dosages: </b><p> The dosages used in the field study were: melengestrol acetate,
0.5 mg/head/day; monensin, 30      gm/ton of air dried feed; tylosin, 10 gm/ton
of air dried feed.<p> 
   <b> h.  Days on test: </b><p> The cattle were fed for a minimum of 90 days, the actual
day of trial termination being left up      to the investigator's judgement as to
when the cattle had reached market weight and condition.  The days on       test by
location are listed on Table 1.<p>

tylosin, and monensin   contrast, the estrus suppression effect of melengestrol
acetate was demonstrated (P &#61;  0.0000003) as was the     average daily gain
contribution of melengestrol acetate and monensin (P &#61;  0.00010).  The
contribution of     tylosin for control of liver abscesses (P &#61;  0.00752) was
evident in the melengestrol acetate vs. melengestrol    acetate, monensin and
tylosin contrast (Table 7).<p>
<b>6.  Conclusions</b><p>
    The data generated by the nine location field study demonstrated that the
melengestrol acetate, monensin, tylosin     combination is justified for it's
effect on estrus suppression, improved feed efficiency, increased average daily
gain and reduction of liver abscesses.<p>
 <b>7.  Adverse Reactions</b><p>
    No adverse reactions due to the feeding of melengestrol acetate, monensin, or
tylosin, either singly or in    combination were reported.<p>
<b>8.  Special Issues</b><p>
    Compliance with combination drug policy:<ul><p>
       <li> a.  The effectiveness and safety of melengestrol acetate, monensin, and
tylosin when fed singly to      feedlot cattle are well documented in their
respective approved NADAs.  The results of adequately           controlled studies
were submitted to the FDA in support of these respective NADAs.  Such data
resulted in the approval of melengestrol acetate as per CFR 558.342, monensin
as per CFR 558.355 and  tylosin as per CFR 558.625.  Data
generated in support of         combination usage have demonstrated that melengestrol
acetate, monensin and tylosin fed together are      effective and safe.<p>
        The data support compliance with 21 CFR 514.1(b)(8)(v) and CVM's combination
drug guidelines         (November 9, 1983).  The combination is justified as detailed
in sections 4, 5 and 6 of this application.<p>
        The use of untreated controls was not deemed necessary as a test for general
effectiveness because the       individual drugs have been previously shown to be
effective and already approved at the levels tested.        The treatment groups
consisting of the individual drugs and the two-way combinations served as the
appropriate controls for the respective two-way combination.  Thus, these
treatment groups essentially        served as negative controls with respect to
21 CFR 514.111(a)(5)(ii)(a)(4), an the studies were properly         controlled.<p>
        To justify the combination, comparisons were made which demonstrated that
each drug made a            statistically significant contribution to the combination.
The three-way combination provides a benefit        that cannot be obtained from any
of the possible two-way combinations.<p>
        A comparison of melengestrol acetate vs melengestrol
acetate-monensin-tylosin for transformed percent        liver abscesses demonstrates
the contribution of tylosin to the combination.  This comparison is based       on
the the fact that neither melengestrol acetate nor monensin has an effect on
liver abscesses.  Data in       the monensin-tylosin NADA (104-646) verify the
assumption that monensin has no effect on liver         abscesses and data in NADA
(138-995) verify that melengestrol acetate has no effect on liver abscesses.<p>
        A comparison of tylosin vs melengestrol acetate-monensin-tylosin addresses
melengestrol acetate's      contribution to the combination. Since melengestrol
acetate has estrus suppression activity and             monensin does not, this
comparison is a valid measure of the effect of melengestrol acetate in the
combination.  This assumption is verified by data in NADA 124-309 (melengestrol
acetate-monensin).<p>
        A comparison of melengestrol acetate-tylosin vs melengestrol
acetate-monensin-tylosin addresses          monensin's contributions that
significantly improved feed efficiency is available with the three-way
combination when compared to the two-way, melengestrol acetate-tylosin.<p>
        The proposed ranges for each drug are justified when fed in combination
since the highest levels            proposed were tested in combination for efficiency
and human and animal safety.</ul><p>

<b>4)  Results</b><ul><p>
    <li>a.  Clinical Observations<p>
        No adverse, drug-related clinical signs were observed during this study.
Although there were no significant     
         differences in average daily gain (ADG) between treated and control animals
at mid-study and at termination,        there was a trend toward decreased ADG at
the 3X and 5X levels of treatment.<p> 
    <li>b.  Clinical pathology<p>
        Occasional statistically significant changes in several hematologic and serum
chemistry parameters were       detected, but all values were well within normal
acceptable ranges and no dose-related trends were seen.<p> 
    <li>c.  Gross and microscopic pathology<p>
        Several gross and histologic tissue changes were observed, but due to the
relative even distribution of the       changes in all dose groups including
controls, these findings were considered to be incidental rather than drug-related.</ul><p> 
<b>4.  Conclusions</b><p>
    a.  Based upon the results of this study, the combination of melengestrol acetate,
monensin and tylosin phosphate in  the daily feed of yearling heifers appears
to be non-toxic when fed for 90 days at up to 5 times the recommended   dose.<p>

<b>VI.  Human Safety:</b><p> 
<b>A.  Drugs for use in food animals</b><p> 
<b>1.  Toxicity tests</b><p>
    Data regarding toxicity testing in melengestrol acetate, monensin sodium and
tylosin phosphate are contained in  the approved NADAs for the three above
mentioned compounds.<p> 

<b>2.  Safe concentration of residues</b><p>
Tolerances for melengestrol acetate, monensin sodium and tylosin phosphate
are published in the <i>Code of Federal     Regulations</i>.&#160; Melengestrol acetate
is currently approved under 21 CFR 558.342 for use in heifers at 0.25 to 0.50
mg/head/day with a 48-hour withdrawal period.  No residues of melengestrol
acetate may be found in uncooked    edible tissues of cattle with a method
sensitive to 25 ppb (21 CFR 556.380).  The tolerance for monensin in    edible
tissue of cattle under 21 CFR 556.347 is 0.7 ppm with no withdrawal period
established for cattle under    21 CFR 558.311.  The tolerance for tylosin
phosphate has been established at 0.2 ppm (negligible residue) in   uncooked
fat, muscle, liver and kidney (CFR 556.740).  Tylosin phosphate has no
withdrawal period established   under 21 CFR 558.625.<p> 

<b>3.  Metabolism and total residue depletion studies</b><p>
Numerous studies have been conducted relative to the metabolism and depletion
of residues of melengestrol     acetate, monensin, and tylosin when administered
individually to cattle.  The results of those studies have been     filed under
the following submissions:<p>

    The animals in each group were slaughtered within 16 hours following their
last feeding.  Perirenal fat was    collected from all four treatment groups for
the melengestrol acetate analysis, and liver samples were collected     from the
group 1 and 2 animals for the assay of monensin and tylosin.<p> 
    <b>a.  Residues of melengestrol acetate</b><p>
        The samples of pererenal fat from each animal were assayed for residues of
melengestrol acetate using the      official AOAC gas chromatographic method.
Analysis of the samples from the group 2 (1X) animals           showed that all fat
samples were below the 25 ppb tolerance for MGA and five of the seven samples
were        below the 10 ppb limit of reliable measurement of the assay.  The two
fat samples that gave positive          responses had MGA levels of 12.7 and 13.7
ppb.<p> 
        Fat samples from groups 3 and 4 (the heifers dosed at 3X and 5X levels)
yielded average residue levels of       37.6 and 49.4 ppm, respectively.<p> 
   <b> b.  Residues of monensin</b><p>
        Liver tissue that was collected from the seven control animals and the seven
heifers fed the group 2 (1X)        ration were assayed for monensin by a method
that measures microbiologically active residues of the drug.        No positive
responses in any of the samples were obtained by this method which has a limit
of quantitation         of 0.04 ppm.<p>
     <b>c.  Residues of tylosin </b><p>
        The liver tissue samples from the group 2 (1X) heifers and seven of the
control animals were assayed for         tylosin by the official assay which measures
microbiologically active residues of the drug.  No positive responses were      obtained for
any of the samples by this method which has a limit of quantitation of 0.1
ppm.<p>
  <b>5.  Assay noninterference data</b><p>
    <b>a.  Melengestrol acetate assay</b><p>
        Data were generated using spiked control fat tissue samples to demonstrate
that the presence of tylosin and        monensin does not interfere with the assay
of MGA.  The study was also intended to show that MGA is        stable in frozen fat
tissue over a period of 60 days. <p>
        Samples of freshly ground control bovine fat tissue were spiked with MGA,
tylosin and monensin at the         following levels:<p>
        MGA:  0.025<br>
        monensin sodium:  5.0 ppm<br>
        Tylosin phosphate:  1.0 ppm<p> 
The spiked samples were assayed in duplicate for MGA by the official AOAC
method after 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 days of storage at -20&#176;C.  The average
recoveries are shown below.<p>

   <b> b.  Monensin assay</b><p>
        The data to demonstrate that the presence of tylosin and MGA does not
interfere with the assay of monensin        in cattle liver are contained in study
S-AAC-84-02 conducted by Elanco Products Company.  In that study,       samples of
liver tissue from control heifers were composited and fortified with 0.06 ppm
monensin, 0.2 ppm       tylosin and 0.2 ppm MGA.  The analysis of those samples by
the thin-layer bioautographic method for        monensin showed no interference by
tylosin and MGA.<p>
        The stability of monensin in frozen liver tissue was demonstrated through
the use of fortified control            samples.  Liver tissue from control animals was
spiked with monensin at 0.06 ppm, frozen for 26 days, and  
         then assayed for monensin.  Recoveries averaged 104% of the theoretical
spike.<p>
   <b> c.  Tylosin assay</b><p>
        Data to demonstrate that the presence of MGA and monensin does not interfere with
the assay of tylosin were       generated by Elanco Products Company in study
S-AAC-84-02.  Samples of liver from control heifers were        composited and
fortified with 0.2 ppm MGA, 0.2 ppm monensin, and 0.2 ppm tylosin.  The samples
were        assayed for tylosin by the cylinder plate microbiological method using
<i>Micrococcus luteus</i>&#160; as the test           organism.  No interference was
detected by the presence of monensin and MGA.<p>
        The stability of tylosin in frozen liver tissues was demonstrated in study
MRC8910 conducted by the Elanco         Products Company.  Liver tissue from control
animals was fortified with 0.2 ppm tylosin and then frozen.         Portions of the
samples were thawed at intervals up to 56 days and assayed for tylosin.  The
stability of        tylosin through 56 days was indicated by the recoveries in the

        Regression analysis of these data demonstrates satisfactory tylosin stability
for the period the tissues in the       residue depletion study were stored before
assay.<p> 
        The residue depletion and assay noninterference studies presented above
demonstrate that the combined feeding       of melengestrol  acetate, monensin
sodium, and tylosin phosphate at their highest approved levels results in
tissue residues below the tolerance levels for each of the three drugs at 16
hours of withdrawal.  The data also         show that each drug in the three-way
combination does not interfere with the assays for the others.  This        work
confirms the adequacy of the 48 hour withdrawal time required for the presence
of MGA in the           combination and demonstrates that the use of these feed
additives in combination does not pose a hazard to      public health.<p> 

<b>6. Regulatory methods</b><p>
    Practical analytical methods of analysis for tissue residues of melengestrol
acetate, monensin sodium and tylosin   phosphate may be found in the <i>Food
Additives Analytical Manual</i>&#160; on display in FDA's Freedom of Information
Public Room (Room 12-A-30), 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.<p>

<b>VII.  Agency Conclusions:</b><p> 
 
These NADAs provide for the combination use of MGA, monensin sodium, and
tylosin phosphate at the levels of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day, 5 to 30 g/ton of
feed, and 8 to 10 g/ton of feed (to supply 90 mg/head/day), respectively; for
increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency, suppression of estrus
(heat), and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in heifers fed in confinement
for slaughter.  Adequate data were submitted which show that the MGA, monensin,
tylosin combination is justified for its effects on estrus suppression,
improved feed efficiency, increased rate of weight gain, and reduction of liver
abscesses.  Each drug; MGA, monensin, and tylosin has been shown to make a
significant (P &#60; .05) contribution to the effectiveness of the combination.  The
combination, when fed at up to 5X the highest recommended combination approval
(0.5 mg MGA/head/day plus 30 g monensin/ton, and 10 g tylosin phosphate/ton for
90 days), did not produce an adverse effect.  No changes were made in the
approved levels of the compounds or in the target animal and the
non-interference of tylosin phosphate, monensin sodium, and MGA with the
analytical methods for MGA, monensin and tylosin phosphate, respectively, was
demonstrated.  Accordingly, approval of theses NADAs is not expected to
increase human exposure to drug residues, and therefore did not require a
complete re-evaluation of the human safety data in the original applications.
For the purposes of human food safety review, these original NADAs have been
treated as Category II supplements under the Agency's Supplemental Policy (42
FR 64367).  These production drugs are OTC because they do not raise any
special safety concerns.<p>

<p>   
<b>1. General Information </b><p>    
<b>NADA Number: </b>        140-910
<p>   
<b>Sponsor:</b><p>             HESS &amp; CLARK, INC. <br>
                    7th &amp; Orange Sts. <br>
                    Ashland, OH  44805 <p>   
<b>Generic Name:</b>        Nitrofurazone Soluble Powder <p>   
<b>Trade Name:</b>       NFZ Wound powder <p>   
<b>Marketing Status:</b>    OTC <p> 
<b>Date of Summary:</b>  July 17, 1989<p>  
<b>2. Indications for Use</b> <p>   
For the prevention or treatment of surface bacterial infections of wounds,
burns, skin ulcers and abscesses after incision.  For use only on dogs, cats
and horses (not for food use). <p>   
<b>3. Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage </b><p>   
a.  Dosage Form - Water soluble antibacterial powder containing 0.2%
nitrofurazone. <p>   
b.  Route of Administration - Topical application. <p>   
c.  Recommended Dosage - As needed.  Apply several times daily to the lesion or
affected area. <p>   
<b>4. and 5.  Effectiveness and Safety </b> <p>   
Nitrofurazone Ointment (Furacin Soluble Powder Veterinary, NADA 6-475)
was the subject of a review by the National Academy of Sciences/National
Research Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group, the results of which
were published in the Federal Register of January 19, 1979 (44 FR 4014).
NAS/NRC concluded, and FDA concurred, that the product was "effective" for the
prevention or treatment of surface bacterial infections of wounds, burns, skin
ulcers, and abscesses after incision. Due to concern for the safety of residues
from food producing animals, FDA concluded that use of this and other NAS/NRC-

reviewed
nitrofurazone topical products must be limited to dogs, cats, and horses (not
intended for food use). The Federal Register publication dated January 19 1979,
on Nitrofurazone Topical Preparations for use in non-food animals, states that
applications providing for the effective conditions of use identified in that
notice need not include data required by 21 CFR 514.111 to establish the
effectiveness of the drug for these uses. <p>   
Under Center for Veterinary Medicine policy, the principles of 21 CFR 320.22
providing for a waive of the requirement for submission of evidence of <i>in vivo</i>&#160;
bioavailability and bioequivalence are applied to NAS/NRC reviewed topicals
which have been found to be effective. Therefore, such data were neither
required nor submitted. <p>   
<b>6. Human Safety</b><p>   
  
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this NADA.  The drug is approved for use only on
dogs, cats and horses (not for food use) and is labeled: <p>
Warning:  Do not use on horses intended for food. <p>   
<b>Human safety relative to possession, handling, and administration: </b><p>   
Labeling contains adequate warning statements. <p>   
Labeling states: <p>   
"HUMAN WARNINGS: <p>   
Carcinogenesis:  Nitrofurazone has been shown to produce mammary tumors in rats
and ovarian tumors in mice. <p>   
Some people may be hypersensitive to this product.  Either wear gloves when
applying, or wash hands afterwards." <p>   
In addition, the labeling contains the following statement: <p>   
"KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN " <p>   
<b>7. Agency Conclusions</b> <p>   
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the conclusions of
NAS/NRC review as concurred in by FDA and with CVM's policy concerning
bioequivalence of topical drugs and demonstrate that NFZ Wound Powder (0.2%
nitrofurazone soluble powder) when used under its approved conditions of use,
is safe and effective for the prevention or treatment of bacterial infections
of wounds, burns, skin ulcers and abscesses after incision on dogs, cats and
horses (not for food use). <p>   
The drug is labeled for over the counter (OTC) use for the following reasons:
<p>   
a.  It is a generic topical antibacterial preparation with a long OTC marketing
history of safe and effective use for the above indications. <p>   
b.  A diagnosis by a veterinarian is not necessary, as the labeled use
conditions are easily recognized by the layman. <p>   
In view of the above, it is approved for OTC marketing because adequate
directions for use by the layman can be written. <p>

<b>m. Date of Summary:  </b>April 6, 1994<p>
<b>2.    TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), following
the approval of an ANADA for a genetic Type A medicated article (ANADA 200-075;
generic salinomycin sodium), Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Company is entitled to
the approval of generic salinomycin in combination with virginiamycin.
Bioequivalence studies are not required for the approval of this genetic
combination (Type C medicated feed). Salinomycin sodium is codified under 21
CFR &#167;  558.550. Virginiamycin is codified under 21 CFR &#167;
558.63 5. The combination of salinomycin sodium and virginiamycin is codified
under 21 CFR &#167;  558.550(a) and (b)(1)(x) and (xi).<p>
<b>3.   HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), tissue
residue studies are not required for the approval of this generic combination
(Type C medicated feed).<p>
<b>a.    Tolerances/Safe Concentrations for Residues</b><p>
The safe concentration established for the pioneer salinomycin sodium product
applies to the generic salinomycin sodium product. The safe concentrations for
total salinomycin residues in the uncooked edible tissues of broiler chickens
were established as 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm in liver, and 1.2 ppm in
skin/fat.<p>
Tolerances for negligible residues of virginiamycin in edible broiler chicken
tissues are established at 0.5 ppm in kidney, 0.3 ppm in liver, 0.2 ppm in
skin/fat, and 0.1 ppm in muscle (21 CFR &#167;  556.750).<p>
<b>b.   Withdrawal Time</b><p>
As provided in 21 CFR &#167;  558.550(b)(1)(x) and (xi), a 0-day withdrawal
time is required for the combination of virginiamycin and salinomycin.<p>
<b>c.    Regulatory Method for Residues</b><p>
Regulatory methods for salinomycin and virginiamycin were not required because
residue levels in all broiler tissues (kidney, muscle, liver, and skin/fat)
were significantly below the established safe concentration for total
residues.<p>
 <b>4.   AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
    This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic    Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that the  combination of salinomycin sodium and virginiamycin,
when used under its proposed    conditions of use, is safe and effective for
its labeled indications.<p>

<b>2.   TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><P>
    Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988; first GADPTRA Policy Letter), an Abbreviated New
Animal Drug Application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product).  For certain dosage forms, the
Agency grants a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo </i>&#160;bioequivalence study
(55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; fifth GADPTRA Policy Letter).  In lieu of
bioequivalence testing, the safety and efficacy of the generic product are
based on the demonstrated chemical equivalence to the pioneer product.  <P>
Based on the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Halocarbon
Laboratories was granted a waiver January 24, 1994 (photocopy attached) from
conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence study with Isoflurane, USP.  The
generic and pioneer products are liquid anesthetics with the same inactive
ingredients and the same concentrations of the active ingredient.<P>
<b>3.   HUMAN SAFETY:</b><P>
<b>Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:</b><P>
Regarding consumption of drug residues in food, human safety data were
not required for approval of this ANADA.  This drug is for use in dogs, which
are non-food animals, and for horses that are not to be used for food, and is
labeled:  "Warning:  Not for use in horses intended for food."<P>
<b>Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:</b><P>
A cautionary statement which pertains to the safety of this drug product
for humans is included in the labeling of the drug product, as follows:
"Caution:  Operating rooms should be provided with adequate ventilation to
prevent the accumulation of anesthetic vapors."<P>
<b>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><P>
This is an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) filed under Section
512(b)(2) of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&amp;C) Act. <P>
Safety and effectiveness for this generic animal drug, Isoflurane, USP, were
established by demonstration of chemical equivalence to the pioneer product,
Anaquest, Inc.'s AErrane(TM) (Isoflurane, USP, NADA 135-773).<P>
This generic product and the pioneer product have identical labeling
indications for use.  The route and method of administration of the two drugs
are identical.  Both drugs are administered by inhalation.  The generic and
pioneer products are both liquid anesthetics that contain the same active and
inactive ingredients in the same concentrations.  Therefore, in compliance with
FDA policy promulgated to implement Section 512(b)(2) of the FFD&amp;C Act, no
additional safety, efficacy, or <i>in vivo </i>&#160;bioequivalency studies were
necessary or required.<P>
This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that Isoflurane, USP is safe and effective for its labeled
indications when used under its proposed conditions of use.<P>

<br>
Dear Mr. McDowell:<br>
<br>
We refer to your Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) dated July
14,
1993 (AOOO0) for Isoflurane, USP liquid), an inhalant anesthetic proposed for
the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in horses and dogs The
application was submitted based on the generic Animal Drug and Patent Term
Restoration Act (GADPTRA) of 1988. The approved pioneer product is AErrane&#174;,
manufactured by Anaquest, Inc. (NADA 135-773). For administrative purposes, we
have assigned number 200-129 to your ANADA.<br>
<br>
The AOOO0 submission requested a waiver of the requirement for <i>in vivo
</i>&#160;bioequivalency testing and provided information to establish the
equivalence of the generic and pioneer products. It also provided information on
the components and composition of the drug; the manufacturing methods,
facilities and controls; pioneer and generic labeling; an Environmental
Assessment (EA); and a Freedom of Information
(FOI) Summary.<br>
<br>
After reviewing the submission, we have concluded that the application is
incomplete and have the following comments:<br>
<br>
<b>DEBARMENT STATEMENT: Complete.<br>
 <br>
SAFETY AND EFFICACY: Complete.</b><br>
<br>
We have reviewed your submission requesting a waiver of <i>in vivo
</i>&#160;bioequivalence testing for the proposed generic product of isoflurane, USP.
Your request is granted.<br>
<br>
Your product contains the same active ingredient in the same concentration as
the pioneer product. The physicochemical characteristics of your proposed
generic product conform to the USP XXII specifications for isoflurane. On the
basis of the formulation and physicochemical characteristics of your proposed

Xylazine was administered by a single IV injection into a catheter inserted
into a catheter inserted in the jugular vein; tolazoline or diluent control was
administered in the same manner 8 minutes later.<p>
h)	Test duration:<p>
Tests were conducted during a 24 hour period.  Testing and injection times
relative to tolazoline injection were as follows:<p>
Measurements were made 6 times on each horse, twice prior to any injections,
once after the xylazine injection, and three times after the antagonist
injection.  Electrocardiograms were conducted 7 times, with the seventh
measurement one day after the tolazoline injection.<p>

With reference to tables 1, 2, and 3 ,there were no significant differences
between the 1X group (4.0 mg/kg) and the 2X group (8.0 mg/kg) at times 4 and 5.
Therefore, the lower dose of 4 mg/kg is appropriate for the recommended
dose.<p>

Elevation of heart rate is an undesirable side effect noted at the 2X dose.
Since the 1X and 2X doses had similar efficacy, 4.0 mg/kg (1X) is the
recommended dose.<br>
<br>

d)	Side Effects:<p>
Side effects that were reported included pink mucous membranes (evidence of
peripheral vasodilation), piloerection, licking of the lips, elevated heart
rate, and restlessness.  These effects were not severe and dissipated within 30
minutes.<p>

5)	Conclusions drawn from the study data:<p>
Tolazoline was effective at intravenous doses of 4.0 and 8.0 mg/kg in reversing
the sedative effects of xylazine, and safe at doses from 2.0 to 8.0 mg/kg.
Since elevation of the heart rate occurs at 8.0 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg is the optimum
dose.  The Anderson/Nelson linear-plateau, plateau-linear-plateau models were
used to support the choice of 4.0 mg/kg as the dose.<p>

</pre>

3)	General design of the investigation:<p>
a) 	Purpose of study:<p>
The purpose of the study was to confirm the efficacy of the tolazoline dose as
a reversing agent and antagonist for xylazine in horses and to test its safety
under field conditions.<p>
b)	Test animals:  102 horses of various age, sex, weight, and breed<p>
c)	Two types of controls were used:<p>

(1) each animal was tested for behavioral/pharmacologic effects before and
after injection of the Tolazine(TM); <p>

(2) half of the test animals were administered tolazoline; half were given
saline instead of tolazoline.<p>

d)	Diagnosis and procedures for sedation:<p>
Testing was done on healthy animals which were given xylazine for procedures
indicated for its use (for example, clipping, cleaning prepuce, suturing
lacerations).  Veterinarians conducting the clinical trials were instructed to
administer either intravenous or intramuscular xylazine (AnaSed&#174;, Lloyd
Laboratories Division of Vet-A-Mix).  The route of xylazine administration was
determined using a randomization table.  The IM dose of xylazine was 1.0 mg/lb;
the IV dose was 0.5 mg/lb.<p>

e)	Dosage form:  Sterile aqueous solution<p>
The product tested was identical to the product to be marketed.<p>

f)	Route of tolazoline administration:  IV<p>

g)	Dosage used:<br>
Dose used in study was 4.0 mg/kg body weight (1.8 mg/lb) Tolazine(TM) injection (4 mL per 100 kg or 220 lb).<p>

h)	Test duration:<br>
	Each animal was observed for 50-60 minutes.<p>
The testing and injection times relative to the injection of xylazine are given
in Table 1 and Table 2.<p>

(1)	Sedation scores (Head Carriage, Startle	Response)<br>
(2)	Analgesia (Prick response)<br>
(3)	Clinical Signs:  Heart Rate, Respiration Rate<p>

Head carriage and startle response were assessed by using a score of 0, 1, 2 or
3 representing levels of sedation with 0 being alert and 3 being sedated.  The
effect on analgesia was assessed by needle prick using a like scoring system
with 0 being no analgesia and 3 being complete analgesia.  Heart and
respiratory rates were measured in beats and breaths per minute, respectively.

5)	Conclusions drawn from the study:<p>
Tolazoline at 4 mg/kg (1.8 mg/lb) of body weight effectively reversed the
sedation and analgesia that were induced by xylazine.<p>

6)	Adverse effects reported were minimal and not unexpected.  The effects noted
were injected mucous membranes of the conjunctiva and pink muzzle in two
animals (evidence of peripheral vasodilation), and piloerection in three other
horses.<p>

<br>
(e)	Route of administration:  IV<p>
(f)	Test duration:<p>
Each dose was administered through a catheterized jugular vein three times at six hour intervals.<p>
(g)	Statistical Considerations:<p>
Statistical analyses were conducted by Repeated Measures Analyses using SYSTAT,
MGLH module.  ANOVAs were conducted at each Time and the groups compared by the
post hoc tests of DUNNETT test and TUKEY HSD Multiple Comparison test.<p>
(h)	Parameters measured:<p>

(1)	Clinical signs:<p>

Clinical observations for adverse signs were made at -1 day, -60 min, -30 min,
0 min (tolazoline injection #1), +360 min (injection #2), and +720 min
(injection #3).  Ponies were also monitored closely during the hour following
each injection.  Monitoring for adverse clinical signs continued daily for 7
days following the drug trial. <p>

(2)	Hematology:<p>

Blood samples were collected at -(3 to 10 days), -1 day, +1 day, +3 day, and +7
days.  The following parameters were evaluated:  PCV,Hb, plasma protein, and
WBC with differential. <p>

(3)	Serum biochemistry:<p>

Blood samples were collected at -(3 to 10 days), -1 day, +1 day, +3 day, and +7
days.  The following parameters were evaluated:  BUN, GGT, AST, CPK, glucose,
calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, and chloride.<p>

(4)	Electrocardiogram (ECG):<p>

ECG were scheduled relative to the first tolazoline injection at -60 to -30
min, -30 to -10 min, +6 to +8 min, and +360 min (immediately prior to second
injection).<p>

(5)	Necropsy and Histopathology:<p>

One male and one female pony each were necropsied from the control group (0X)
and the 5X group on day 7.  Histopathology was performed on adrenal glands,
kidney, liver, and any grossly abnormal tissues.<p>

4)	Results:<p>

(a)	Clinical Signs:<p>

Clinical observations for adverse signs provided a clear picture of the
physiological response to tolazoline without prior xylazine treatment.  Side
effects included evidence of peripheral vasodilitation (bright pink mucous
membranes), licking and flipping lips, piloerection, clear lacrimal and nasal
discharge, sweating, and muscle fasciculation.  An apparent increase in
gastrointestinal motility was demonstrated by signs of abdominal discomfort and
increased defecation or tenesmus with flatulence.  These signs were of greater
intensity with increasing doses and many of these signs increased in intensity
with subsequent doses.  All noted signs were transient in nature.<p>

(b) Hematology:<p>

Hematology results were unremarkable.<p>

(c)	Serum biochemistry:<p>
Serum biochemistry results were unremarkable.<p>

(d)	Electrocardiogram (ECG):<p>

A dose related response was shown in that the control group and the 1X group
had no ECG abnormalities, but the 3X and the 5X groups showed tachycardia and
cardiac conduction disturbances (evidenced by increased QRS waves and decreased
QT waves).  The changes did not persist.<p>

The Dunnett test was used to compare the control group (0X) to each of the
treatment groups (1X, 3X, and 5X).  At p&lt;.05, group differences were
demonstrated at +6 to +8 minutes after tolazoline administration in the 3X and
5X treatment groups for increased heart rate and in the 5X group for increased
QRS wave and decreased QT wave durations.<p>

(e)	Necropsy and Histopathology:<p>

Routine necropsy and histopathology failed to detect any treatment related
changes.<p>

5)	Conclusions based on study data:<p>

Side effects associated with the administration of tolazoline at 4.0, 12.0, and
20.0 mg/kg body weight are dose related and transient.  Cardiac and
gastrointestinal data demonstrate the main safety concerns associated with the
use of tolazoline when given a total of three doses at six hour intervals.
Doses of 3X or greater in healthy horses are of questionable safety due to
tachycardia and cardiac conduction disturbances.<p>

4)	Results:<p>
Two tolazoline related deaths occurred immediately following administration of
the 5X dose of tolazoline (see necropsy results and conclusions discussed
below).<p>
(a)	Clinical Observations:<p>
	(1)	Mucous membrane color:<p>
	Nearly all horses showed injected mm (increased peripheral vasodilation) after
administration of tolazoline at all dose levels.  Mucous membranes were normal
in all horses within 24 hours.<p>
	(2)	Piloerection was observed in two horses after receiving tolazoline.<p>
	(3)	Lip flicking and licking:<p>
	Hyperalgesia of the lips was observed in two horses after receiving
tolazoline.<p>
	(4)	Sweating:<p>
	Sweating was seen in most horses that received xylazine/placebo and
xylazine/tolazoline.  It was more intense and lasted longer for horses treated
with xylazine/tolazoline.<p>
	(5)	Lacrimal and nasal discharge:<p>
	Nasolacrimal discharge was observed in xylazine/placebo horses and in
xylazine/tolazoline horses.  The side effect was not tolazoline dose
related.<p>
	(6)	Muscle fasciculation was seen in three horses (one in the xylazine/placebo
group and two in the xylazine/tolazoline groups)<p>
	(7)	Increased defecation was seen more frequently in horses that received
tolazoline compared to the control group (not dose related).<p>
	(8)	Colic and diarrhea:<p>
	One horse in the 3X group experienced mild, transient colic and fluid stool on
the second and third days of the trial.  No treatment was required.<p>
	(9)	Gastrointestinal motility:<p>
	Most horses experienced xylazine-induced hypomotility.  Within five minutes of
tolazoline administration in many horses, intestinal motility was scored as
normal compared to the control group.  Two horses in the 3X group experienced
gastrointestinal hypermotility, one of which colicked.  The hypermotility
resolved more quickly on day one compared to the second and third days in the
trial (see table).<p>

(b)	Electrocardiogram (ECG):<p>
Prolongation of the QRS complex occurred immediately after dosing in four of
six horses in the 3X tolazoline group and in all four of the surviving horses
in the 5X tolazoline group.  ECG measurements after 5X tolazoline
administration could not be obtained from the two horses that died.  However,
tolazoline related cardiac conduction disturbances were the most likely cause
of death (see conclusions below).<p>

________________________________________________________________

</pre>
<p>
Horses in the 0X group (xylazine only) had BP below the referenced normal
value by time 5 on all three days. None of the horses that received tolazoline
had BP below the referenced norms at time 5 on any of the three injection days.
Tolazoline helped reverse xylazine-induced hypotension. <p>

Some horses experienced hypertension after receiving tolazoline.  The highest
values were seen in the 3X and 5X horses at times 3 and 4 on day 1 (elevated
systolic BP ranged from 148  to 240 mm Hg).  On days 2 and 3, all 5X horses (4
horses) showed an initial decline in BP quickly followed by increased BP by
5-10 minutes post-tolazoline.  Fewer horses became hypertensive on days 2 and
3, after the initial transient decline in BP.<p>

Only one horse in the 1X dose group exhibited persistent hypertension (on day 3
at time 5).  BP returned to normal by 3 hours post-tolazoline.  BP for this
horse was within the normal reference range on days 1 and 2 after tolazoline
administration.<p>

(e)	Respiratory Rate (RR):<p>

RR generally decreased following xylazine administration.  Tolazoline raised RR
back in some horses to prexylazine rates.  In others, administration of
tolazoline did not have an effect on RR.  One horse in the 1X dose group showed
a unique increase in RR to approximately twice baseline following each
treatment.  RR returned to the pretolazoline RR within one hour after
treatment.<p>

(f)	Hematology and Serum Biochemistry:<p>

The hematology and serum biochemistry results did not identify any safety
concerns associated with the administration of xylazine followed by
tolazoline.<p>

(g)	Urinalysis:<p>

The urinalyses results did not identify any safety concerns associated with the
administration of xylazine followed by tolazoline.<p>

(h)	Necropsy:<p>

Two mortalities occured immediately after administration of tolazoline at the
5X dose to horses that had received a 1X dose of xylazine.  These two
horses were completely necropsied.  The cause of death could not be determined
from gross findings or histopathology alone.  However, diffuse congestion
coupled with the lack of other necropsy findings and the clinical history,
suggested that effects on the cardiac conduction system contributed to death
and that these effects were probably due to a 5X dose of tolazoline. <p>

(i)	Weight:<p>

Changes in weight did not correlate with dose group and were not considered
significant. <p>

5)	Conclusions:<p>

The major adverse reaction clinically observed during the study was the death
of two horses that received a 5X dose of tolazoline following administration of
xylazine.  The four surviving horses in the 5X dose group and four (of six)
horses in the 3X dose group showed prolonged QRS waves immediately after
receiving tolazoline.  Prolongation of the QRS complex can predispose to
ventricular arrhythmias and possibly death.  No ventricular arrhythmias were
recorded during the study; however, no ECGs were recorded immediately before
the horses died.  Transient tachycardia occurred after tolazoline
administration at the 1X, 3X, and 5X doses.<p>

Based on tachycardia, ECG conduction disturbances, and negative necropsy
findings, ventricular arrhythmia caused by an overdose of tolazoline is the
most likely cause of death.<p>

Therefore, a single dose of 1X or 2X tolazoline is safe in clinically normal
horses.  <i>Doses of 3X or higher cannot be considered safe in healthy horses,
due to tachycardia, cardiac conduction disturbances and death.</i><p>
Gastrointestinal side effects were much more pronounced when tolazoline was
administered alone to healthy horses (see safety study #1).  Gastrointestinal
side effects were much less frequent and less severe in the TAS study using
xylazine and tolazoline.  As long as tolazoline is always administered after
xylazine, these effects do not represent a safety concern in healthy horses at
the 1X dose.  Doses of 3X or higher are of questionable gastrointestinal safety
(one horse with colic and persistent hypermotility). <p>

Tolazoline reversed xylazine-induced hypotension with a mild hypertension
resulting in some horses.  Hypertension or hypotension related to the use of
tolazoline in healthy horses was not a safety concern in this study.  <p>
Other clinical signs (injected mucous membranes, piloerection, hyperalgesia of
the lips, sweating, lacrimal and nasal discharge, and muscle fasciculation)
associated with the use of tolazoline were observed to occur less frequently
and less intensely when tolazoline was administered after xylazine (see TAS
study results using tolazoline alone).  These side effects do not represent a
safety concern in healthy horses at doses up to 5X.<p>

of Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.
The data demonstrate that Tolazine (tolazoline hydrochloride), when used under
its labeled conditions of use, is safe and effective.<p>

Tolazoline is labeled for use only after xylazine hydrochloride administration
as a xylazine antagonist.  Xylazine is a prescription drug used by licensed
veterinarians to induce sedation and analgesia.  Accordingly, tolazoline
hydrochloride is a prescription new animal drug.<p>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval qualifies for 5 years of marketing exclusivity beginning on the
date of approval because no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of
the active ingredient) of the drug has been approved in any other application.

<b> 2.  INDICATIONS </b><p>
    
OXY-TET 200/BIO-MYCIN 200 (OXY-TET 200 will hereafter denote both OXY-TET 
200 &amp; BIO-MYCIN 200
throughout this summary)      
 is intended for use in the treatment of the
following diseases in beef cattle, nonlactating dairy cattle and swine when due
to oxytetracycline susceptible organisms.<p>      
<b>CATTLE</b><p>      
OXY-TET 200 is indicated in the treatment of pneumonia and shipping fever
complex associated with <i>Pasteurella</i>&#160; spp. and <i>Hemophilus</i>&#160; spp.;
infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (pinkeye) caused by <i>Moraxella
bovis </i>; foot rot and diphtheria caused by <i>Fusobacterium necrophorum ;</i>
bacterial enteritis (scours) caused by <i>Escherichia coli </i>; wooden tongue
caused by <i>Actinobacillus lignieresi </i>; leptospirosis caused by
<i>Leptospira pomona </i>; and wound infections and acute metritis caused by
strains of staphylococci and streptococci organisms sensitive to
oxytetracycline.  <p>      
<b>SWINE</b><p>      
In swine, OXY-TET 200 is indicated in the treatment of bacterial enteritis
(scours, colibacillosis) caused by <i>Escherichia coli </i>; pneumonia caused by
<i>Pasteurella multocida </i>; and leptospirosis caused by <i>Leptospira
pomona </i>.  <p>
In sows, OXY-TET 200 is indicated as an aid in the control of infectious
enteritis (baby pig scours, colibacillosis) in suckling pigs caused by
<i>Escherichia coli.</i> <p>
        
  <b>   3.  DOSAGE  </b><p>
      <b> CATTLE</b><p>      
OXY-TET 200 is to be administered by intramuscular or intravenous injection to
beef cattle and nonlactating dairy cattle.<p>      
A single dose of 9 mg of OXY-TET 200 per pound of body weight administered
intramuscularly is recommended in the treatment of the following conditions:
1) bacterial pneumonia caused by <i>Pasteurella</i>&#160; spp. (shipping fever) in
calves and yearlings, where retreatment is impractical due to husbandry
conditions, such as cattle on range, or where their repeated restraint is
inadvisable;  2) infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (pinkeye) caused by
<i>Moraxella bovis </i>.<p>      
OXY-TET 200 can also be administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection
at a level of 3 to 5 mg of oxytetracycline per pound of body weight per day.
In the treatment of severe foot-rot and advanced cases of other indicated
diseases, a dosage level of 5 mg per pound of body weight per day is
recommended.  Treatment should be continued 24 to 48 hours following remission
of disease signs; however, not to exceed a total of four consecutive days.
Consult your veterinarian if improvement is not noted within 24 to 48 hours of
the beginning of treatment.<p>      
<b>SWINE</b><p>      
In swine a single dose of 9 mg of OXY-TET 200 per pound of body weight
administered intramuscularly is recommended in the treatment of bacterial
pneumonia caused by <i>Pasteurella multocida</i>&#160; in swine, where retreatment is
impractical due to husbandry conditions or where repeated restraint is
inadvisable.<p>      
OXY-TET 200 can be administered by intramuscular injection at a level of 3 to 5
mg of oxytetracycline per pound of body weight per day.  Treatment should be
continued 24 to 48 hours following remission of diseases signs; however, not to
exceed a total of four consecutive days.  Consult your veterinarian if
improvement is not noted within 24 to 48 hours of the beginning of
treatment.<p>      
For sows, administer once intramuscularly 3 mg of oxytetracycline per pound of
body weight approximately 8 hours before farrowing or immediately after
completion of farrowing.<p>      
For swine weighing 25 lb of body weight and under, OXY-TET 200 should be
administered undiluted for treatment at 9 mg/lb but should be administered
diluted for treatment at 3 or 5 mg/lb.  <p>
      
<b> 4.  TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY and DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
       <b> a.  PIVOTAL STUDY:</b><p>      
<b>1)  Type of Study:  BIOEQUIVALENCE STUDY (CALVES)</b><p>      
Two-period crossover design using 24 calves divided into two groups.  Each calf
received single intramuscular doses of either test or reference products at
rates of 20 mg oxytetracycline per kg (9 mg/lb) of body weight in each of two
crossover test periods.<p>      
<b>Test Product:  </b><p>  Oxytetracycline 200 mg/mL Injectable Solution (BIAHI) labeled as
OXY-TET 200.<p>      
<b>Reference Product:  </b><p>  LIQUAMYCIN LA-200, 200 mg/mL oxytetracycline injectable
solution (Pfizer, Inc.).<p>

        Fort Collins, Colorado  80526<p>      
<b>3)  General Design of Investigation:</b><p>      
<b>a)  Purpose of Study:</b><p>      
To demonstrate bioequivalence between an oxytetracycline 200 mg/mL injectable
solution generic formulation (OXY-TET 200) and LIQUAMYCIN LA-200 using
production type beef cattle which are a target species and class for which the
product is intended.<p>      
<b>b)  Test Animals:</b><p>      
Twenty-four (24) healthy commercial crossbred steer and heifer calves, 12 of
each sex, from 5 to 6 months of age, weighing an average of 496 pounds each,
were randomly assigned to one of two groups.  Selection was based upon health
status, serum chemistry and hematology values, and body weight uniformity.<p>      
<b>c)  Dosage Form:</b>     
Sterile injectable solution.<p>      
<b>d)  Route of Administration:</b><p>      
The products were administered by intramuscular injection, within the
semimembranosus muscles on the left side of the animal in Phase I and the right
side in Phase II.  Intended injection sites were marked by clipping the hair in
the area.  No more than 10 mL was injected at any one site.<p>      
<b>e)  Dosage Used:</b><p>      
Both the test product and the reference product were administered at the 20
mg/kg (9 mg/lb) body weight level.<p>      
<b>f)  Test Duration:</b><p>      
In Phase I, the calves in Group 1 received a single dose of the test product
and calves in Group 2 received a single dose of the reference product.  After a
42-day washout interval, the dosing was repeated with Group I calves receiving
the reference product and Group 2 calves receiving the test product.  The time
period from the initial Phase I injection to final observations of Phase II was
48 days.<p>      
<b>g)  Pertinent Parameters Measured:</b><p>      
The primary test parameter was the determination of serum oxytetracycline
concentration at the following intervals:  predose (baseline), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6,
8, 10, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, and 108 hours following intramuscular
injection in each study period.<p>

<b>5)  Statistical Analysis:</b><p>      
<b>a)  Identification of Statistical Methods:</b><p>      
The bioavailability of the test product (OXY-TET 200) relative to the reference
product (LIQUAMYCIN LA-200) was compared on the basis of the untransformed
study data.  Differences between the test and reference products were
statistically evaluated by means of confidence intervals.  Each pharmacokinetic
measure was analyzed via an analysis of variance procedure (ANOVA) using a
linear model identifying the effects attributable to intersubject variability,
sequence, treatment, and period.  This ANOVA model is considered appropriate
for comparing treatment effects based upon a two-period, two-treatment,
two-sequence crossover study design.<p>      
The criterion for product bioequivalence was whether the 90% confidence
intervals about the difference in product means (test minus reference values)
were within +/-20% of the reference mean.  Using this criterion, the test
product was demonstrated to be equivalent to the reference product with respect
to the rate (AUMC0-108, CMAX) and extent (AUC0-108) of oxytetracycline
absorption.  These results meet the requirements for demonstrating product
bioequivalence.<p>      
<b>6)  Conclusion:</b>      
The two products are bioequivalent.<p>      
<b>7)  Adverse Reactions:</b>     
No adverse drug reactions were observed.<p>

<b>5)  Statistical Analysis:</b><p>      
The bioavailability of the test product (OXY-TET 200) relative to the reference
product (LIQUAMYCIN LA-200) was compared on the basis of the untransformed data
for CMAX and TMAX and the log-transformed data for AUC(0-108) and AUMC(0-108).
Differences between the test and reference products were statistically
evaluated by means of confidence intervals.  Each pharmacokinetic measure was
analyzed via an analysis of variance procedure (ANOVA) using a linear model
identifying the effects attributable to intersubject variability, sequence,
treatment, and period.  This ANOVA model is considered appropriate for

bioequivalence.<p>      
<b>6)  Conclusion:</b><p>      
The products are therapeutically bioequivalent.  However, a statistically
significant period by sequence interaction was seen in the ANOVA for comparing
product apparent terminal elimination rates.  This observation resulted in the
collection of additional data to address human food safety concerns (see
Section 6).<p>      
<b>7)  Adverse Reactions:</b><p>      
No adverse drug reactions were seen.  <p>      
    <b>5.   HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
      <b> Tolerance </b><p>      
The tolerances established for the pioneer product apply to the generic
product.   A tolerance of 0.1 ppm is established for the uncooked edible
tissues of cattle, beef calves, nonlactating dairy cattle, dairy calves, and
swine under 21 CFR 556.500. <p>      
 <b> Withdrawal Time </b><p>
 
  <b> a.   Withdrawal Period in Cattle</b><p>      
A tissue irritation study and a blood level bioequivalence study (summarized
under the effectiveness section) were conducted which showed the bioequivalence
of OXY-TET 200 and Pfizer's Liquamycin LA-200 in calves.  <p>      
<b>1)  Tissue Irritation Study</b><p>      
The level of tissue irritation of OXY-TET 200 injectable was evaluated in a

<b>a)  Purpose of Study:</b><p>      
To evaluate injection site tissue irritation following intramuscular
administration of OXY-TET 200 at a dose level of 20 mg/kg body weight, with no
more than 10 mL per site in beef cattle.<p>      
<b>b)  Test Animals:</b><p>      
Twenty-five (25) healthy, commercial, production type, crossbred calves (10
heifers and 15 steers), weighing an average of 500 pounds of body weight and
estimated at 5-6 months of age.<p>      
<b>c)  Route of Drug Administration:</b><p>      
The test article was administered by intramuscular injection.<p>      
<b>d)  Time and Duration of Dosing:</b><p>      
Each calf received 20 mg/kg body weight of oxytetracycline with no more than 10
mL per injection site.  The sites that received a full 10 mL dose were selected
for examination.<p>      
<b>e)  Results:</b><p>      
The right semimembranosus muscle injection site was clinically evaluated by
palpation prior to injection; then 4 hours following injection; and on days
postdose 1, 2, 6, 9, 16, 23, and 30 on animals that remained on each of those
days.  Clinical parameters evaluated included heat at injection site, degree of
swelling, induration (increased tissue density), pain response from tactile
contact, and measurement of swollen tissue diameter with a caliper.<p>

<b>f)  Conclusions:</b><p>      
Injection site swelling, of slight to moderate severity which subsided over
time, was the only significant antemortem post injection observation.
Postmortem injection site irritation observations were made on core samples
taken from the right semimembranosus muscle of each treated animal.  By Day 28,
only trace to mild amounts of fibrosis, inflammation, and Zenker's degeneration
were noted.  This study confirms that a 28 day withdrawal period is appropriate
for this generic product.       <p>      
<b>2)  Blood Level Bioequivalence Study in Cattle (see Section 4 above).</b><p>      
    When bioequivalence is demonstrated by a blood level study, the generic
product is assigned the same withdrawal time as the pioneer's product.
Therefore, a withdrawal time of 28 days has been assigned for the use of the
generic product in beef cattle and non-lactating dairy cattle.<p>      
<b>b.  Withdrawal Period in Swine</b><p>      
A tissue residue study was conducted in market weight swine using OXY-TET(TM)
200 at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight.<p>

Thirty-four pigs were randomly allocated to six groups of 5 pigs each.  Four
pigs served as treated controls.  Each pig was treated once intramuscularly
with OXY-TET(TM) 200 (200 mg oxytetracycline/mL) at a dose of 20 mg/kg.
Animals were slaughtered at 2, 5, 8, 11, 21, and 28 days postinjection.
Tissues were collected from the kidney intra-abdominal fat, liver, muscle, and
injection site for residue analysis.  Tissue samples were analyzed using a
validated adaptation of the regulatory method.<p>

A left-censoring regression algorithm was used to calculate a withdrawal period
for the use of OXY-TET(TM) 200 in swine.  Using one-sided upper 95% confidence
bound for the 99th percentile yields a 42-day withdrawal.<p>      
  <b>Regulatory Method:</b><p>      
The analytical method for detection of residues in tissues is the cylinder
plate microbiological method using  <i>Bacillus cereus</i>&#160; var. <i>mycoides</i>&#160;
(ATCC 11778) as outlined in the "Antibiotic Residues in Milk, Dairy Products
and Animal Tissues:  Methods, Reports, and Protocols" October 1968, National
Center for Antibiotic and Insulin Analysis, FDA, Washington, D.C. 20204.<p>      
<b> 6.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
     
        This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that oxytetracycline injection when used under the proposed
conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled indications.<p>

C. Recommended Dosage:  Ten (10) mg of albendazole per kg of body weight (4.45
                       mg/lb) administered orally with a suitable syringe.<p>


<b>IV. Effectiveness:</b><P>
 Albendazole is an effective anti parasitic agent with broad
spectrum activity against gastrointestinal and other nematodes, as well as
cestodes and trematodes.  Based on preliminary data, developmental research in
cattle was conducted in a series of ten dose titration and 14 dose confirmation
efficacy trials in 11 different geographic locations in the United States as well
as internationally.  Doses of 2.5 to 45 mg albendazole per kg body weight, given
orally, were used in these studies, and the most effective dose of albendazole
for use in cattle was 10 mg/kg.<P> Albendazole, in a suspension
formulation, was administered orally as a drench, and was evaluated for efficacy
using the controlled test, as recommended by the Center for Veterinary Medicine
in its "Guidelines for Evaluation of Bovine Anthelmintics".  Briefly stated, a
certain number of infected cattle remain untreated, the remainder receive
medication.  After a suitable period of time post treatment (usually five to
seven days, but longer in some circumstances), treated and untreated (control)
animals are killed and necropsied.  Remaining parasites are identified and
counted for each animal.<P> In these studies the animals were either
experimentally or naturally infected with one or more species of nematodes,
cestodes, and/or trematodes.  The claim for each major parasitic species is
supported by adequate and well controlled studies.<P> Efficacy was
expressed in percent removal of worms as compared to controls. The percent
removal was calculated as follows:

<pre>

Percent          (N)* Control - (N) Treated  
Removal of  =     ________________________ x 100    
Parasites              (N) Control


    
* (N) = Number of Parasites
</pre> 
<P>Efficacy of albendazole was in the 90% range for each parasite
claimed. Data from all major controlled efficacy studies were analyzed
statistically using non-parametric procedures.  The results supported the
conclusion that when given orally to cattle at 10 mg/kg body weight, albendazole
is a effective anthelmintic with a wide spectrum of activity against adult and
larval stages of gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, tapeworms and liver
flukes infecting cattle.<P> The investigator and efficacy against
individual parasitic species are given in Tables 1,2,3 and 4.<P>

Dose titration studies were carried out to determine the dose of albendazole needed
to control trematodes, cestodes, gastrointestinal and pulmonary nematodes. 
Approximately 400 cattle were used, three fourths of which were treated with
albendazole and the remaining cattle served as untreated controls. An oral
suspension formulation was utilized with dosages ranging from 2.5 to 45 mg/kg. 
Accepted husbandry practices were duplicated with respect to breeds of cattle,
diets, and grazing conditions. Standard procedures were followed for allocating,
dosing, collecting samples, enumerating and identifying parasites, and performing
necropsies.  The parasitic infections were experimentally induced in five of the
trials and naturally acquired in the remaining five trials.  Based on the data
collected, an optimum effective dose of 10 mg/kg albendazole per kg body weight
was determined.

This trial was conducted in cattle with a
natural infection of F. hepatica, using the oral suspension.  The cattle were
obtained from two sources: 30 yearling steers from Sealy, Texas and 45 animals
ranging from year old calves to aged cows from Brazoria, Texas.  Prior to
treatment, the animals were weighed and randomly allocated to five groups (15
animals per group).  Four of the groups were treated with a single oral dose of
15, 25, 35 or 45 mg/kg of albendazole.  The fifth group was left untreated and
served as controls.  The cattle were held on dry lot for three weeks and then
necropsied.  The percent removal of the worms listed below was recorded for each
dose level.  No adverse reaction occurred.<P>

<b>C. Clinical Field Trials:</b> 
<P>Well-documented clinical field
trials were conducted in the United States according to an approved protocol
which was modified to accommodate the parasite(s) of interest and local
management conditions.  Groups of cattle with at least a moderate worm infection,
as determined by egg counts in their feces, were selected.  Approximately the
same numbers of animals were treated with albendazole or were left untreated, as
controls.  Worm eggs in fecal samples were counted before and after treatment,
and animals were visually observed for side effects. <P>
Thirteen investigators 
studied albendazole suspension in 12 states.  They treated cattle of various 
breeds and compared them to untreated controls. Investigators, trial locations 
and numbers of animals in these studies are tabulated on the following pages. The
results of these clinical field trials confirm the results of the controlled 
studies indicating elimination or reduction of fecal egg counts in virtually all
treated cattle.  The recommended treatment was found to be safe and practical 
under field conditions.<P>

<b>V. Target Animal Safety:</b><P>
Studies to evaluate the safety of 
albendazole in cattle were conducted at SmithKline Animal Health

Study A-78/5<P>
Purpose: The objective of
this study was to identify the "toxic syndrome" characterized by responses of the
target animal to the administration of toxic doses of albendazole. <P>
Methods: Twenty ruminating calves weighing 175 to 520 pounds were selected for
this study.  Albendazole suspension was administered orally to groups of four
cattle as a single oral dose of 22.5, 45.0, 112.5 or 150.0 mg/kg.  A similar
group of four calves served as an untreated control.  After the administration of
the compound, the animals were observed daily for 14 days.<P>  Results: No
symptoms other than soft feces were seen in two animals which received 45 mg/kg
dose.  At the two higher doses toxic symptoms included decreased activity and
anorexia followed by a severe watery diarrhea. Subsequently, one animal in each
of these two dose groups died.  Necropsy changes consisted of fibrinous
peritonitis and ascites, hydrothorax and acute pleuritis, congestion of the
abomasum and acute enteritis.<P>  Conclusion: The dose at which no overt
effect was observed in cattle in this study is 45 mg/kg; i.e., 4.5 times the
highest recommended therapeutic dose.<P>

Study A-75-1241<P> 
Purpose: The
objective of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of
albendazole in cattle.<P>  Methods: A single dose of albendazole (suspended
in 0.5 Methocel) was administered orally by drench to Aberdeen Angus cattle
(weighing 300 to 700 pounds), at levels of 75 (two male and two female), 106 (two
male and two female), 150 (two male and two female) or 300 mg/kg (one male and
one female). After the administration of the compound, all animals were retained
for a 14 day observation period followed by necropsy of all survivors.<P> 
Results: At the highest dose, 300 mg/kg, both animals died; one at five and the
other, six days after dosing.  A syndrome of anorexia, lethargy, recumbency, and
slight weight loss was observed in both animals prior to death.  Similar signs,
along with rough hair coat, occurred in one male which received the 150 mg/kg
dose and in one male and one female which received the 106 mg/kg dose. All
animals, including those which died, were necropsied.  There was no macroscopic
tissue change considered related to drug administration, therefore, no histologic
examination of the tissues was performed.<P>  Conclusion: The maximum
tolerated dose in this study was 75 mg/kg.<P>

Study A1003<P>
  Purpose:
The objective of this study was to determine potential toxic effects of
albendazole when administered to cattle eight weeks after artificial infection
with <i>F. hepatica.</i><P>  Methods: Sixteen head of cattle, weighing 450 to 620
pounds, were randomly divided into four groups of two males and two females,
each.  Two of the groups were experimentally infected with <i>F. hepatica</i>; the other
two groups remained uninfected and served as controls.  Eight weeks after
infection, one non infected group and one infected group were given a single oral
dose of 45 mg/kg of albendazole.  Thereafter, all animals were observed for four
weeks and then necropsied.<P>  Results: Prior to treatment sorbitol
dehydrogenase (SDH) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) serum levels in the
infected groups rose during the first few weeks of the study while gamma glutamyl
transpeptidase (GGTP) levels rose sharply at eight weeks following infection. One
week after albendazole administration, significantly lower SDH and GGTP serum
levels were observed in the infected treated animals (i.e., these values returned
to normal pre infection levels) as compared to the non-treated infected group.
Hematocrit values remained essentially within normal range in all groups
throughout the study.  Appetites of all animals were good throughout the study.
No adverse clinical sign was noted in any animal prior to or following
administration of albendazole. No macroscopic nor histopathologic change occurred
which was considered related to albendazole administration.<P>  Conclusion:
Administration of albendazole at 4.5 times the recommended therapeutic dose
produced no evidence of toxicity in animals infected with <i>F. hepatica.</i> <P>

 Purpose: The objective of this study was to determine the potential
toxic effects of albendazole when administered weekly for eight consecutive
weeks.<P>  Methods: Three Hereford cows, weighing 565 to 680 pounds,
received a single oral dose of 75 mg/kg of albendazole suspension, once weekly
for eight consecutive weeks.  Three other Hereford cows were left untreated and
served as controls.  Ten days after the initial dose and at bi-weekly intervals
thereafter, blood samples were drawn from each animal and assayed for alkaline
phosphatase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic
transaminase, serum bilirubin, albumin and globulin.  All surviving treated
animals were necropsied two weeks following the last dose of albendazole.
<P> Results: One animal died spontaneously six days after receiving the fifth
dose of albendazole.  The macroscopic changes observed at necropsy were
indicative of pneumonia; however, extensive autolysis precluded meaningful
histopathologic examination and definitive diagnosis.  No adverse clinical sign
was observed in the other two animals; no clinicopathologic or histopathologic
change occurred which was attributable to albendazole administration.<P> 
Conclusion: Administration of 75 mg/kg of albendazole at weekly intervals for
eight weeks was well tolerated by the cattle.<P>

Study A75-1242<P> 
 Purpose: The objective of this study was to assess the toxicity
of albendazole when administered daily for five consecutive days.<P> 
Methods: Twenty four Aberdeen Angus cattle weighing 300 to 700 pounds were
selected for this study.  Albendazole, suspended in 0.5% Methocel, was
administered orally to groups of 3 males and 3 female cattle for five days at
levels of 7.5, 25.0 or 40.0 mg/kg per day.  A similar group of three males and
three females were untreated and served as a control.  The animals were examined
before and after treatment for clinical signs of toxicity by observation,
hematology and clinical chemistry tests. Two males and two females from
each group were necropsied 24 hours after the last dose.  The remaining animals
were retained for a nine day observation period and then necropsied.  The
untreated controls and the animals in the highest treatment group and the livers
from the animals in the mid dose group were also examined for histopathologic
signs of toxicity.<P>  Results: Three animals, one control and two receiving
40 mg/kg/day died spontaneously prior to termination.  These animals were
necropsied and death was considered to have been caused by repeated trauma
induced by the speculum used for intubation each day.   <P> Conclusion:
Evaluation of all in life (physical observations, body weight, hematology, and
clinical chemistry) and post mortem parameters did not reveal any change
considered related to the administration of albendazole.<P> <hr> Four
reproductive safety studies were conducted in pregnant cows which received either
single or multiple doses of albendazole suspension at various stages of
gestation. <P>

Purpose: The objective of this
study was to determine the effects of albendazole on the embryo when administered
to mated cows during the first 61 days of gestation.<P>  Methods: Two groups
of 27 Hereford cows, two to three years old, received multiple oral doses of 25
mg/kg of albendazole suspension either on days seven and 14 of gestation or on
days 21, 31, 41, 51 and 61 of gestation.  An additional group of 27 Hereford cows
which served as a control was treated once with 25 mg/kg of albendazole
approximately 30 days prior to calving in order to evaluate the drug for a
possible abortifacient effect.<P>  Results: Albendazole administration at
2.5 times the highest recommended therapeutic dose had no significant effect on
duration of pregnancy, incidence of assisted delivery or stillborn calves or
weight of the calves at birth.  No abnormal calf was born.  The pregnancy rates
at 60 days after first mating were 85% for controls, 63% for cows treated twice
on days seven and 14 of gestation and 85% for cows treated with multiple doses on
days 21, 31, 41, 51 and 61 of gestation.<P>

Purpose: The
objective of this study was to determine the effects of albendazole on the early
embryo when administered to heifers either seven or 14 days after
insemination.<P>  Methods: Groups of 90 or more heifers (Hereford and/or
Black White face), 18 to 24 months old, received a single oral dose of
albendazole suspension at 25 mg/kg on either day seven or 14 of gestation.  A
similar group of heifers remained untreated and served as a control.  All animals
were bred only once.<P>  Results: The conception rates were 75% for
controls, 61% for heifers treated on day seven of gestation and 8% for heifers
treated on day 14 of gestation.<P>  Conclusion: Based on these three
studies, an adequate margin of safety (i.e., three to five times the recommended
dose of 10 mg/kg) when administered during the first month after mating has not
been established.  Therefore, a cautionary statement contraindicating use of the
product during the first 45 days of pregnancy is included in the labeling.<P>

Study A-2017<P>
Purpose: The objective of this study was
to determine the effects of albendazole when administered during early pregnancy
on conception rates following estrus and ovulation synchronization. <P>
Methods: For this study, 159 Hereford heifers, 15 to 20 months of age, were
divided into four groups of 39 or 40 animals each. Estrus was synchronized, using
an intramuscular injection of cloprostenol, and the heifers were artificially
inseminated.  In each of the four groups one half of the heifers received four 10
mg/kg doses of albendazole seven, 14, 28 and 42 days after artificial
insemination; the remaining animals in each group received 30 mL of water and
served as controls.<P>  Results: At 100 days post insemination 36 of the 79
treated heifers were pregnant i.e., a conception rate of 45.5%; 34 heifers out of
the 80 controls were pregnant representing a conception rate of 41.5%.  Using the
Chi Square test the difference was not statistically significant.<P> 
Conclusion: Treatment with albendazole suspension at a dose of 10 mg/kg
administered four times during early gestation (viz on days seven, 14, 28 and 42)
had no detrimental effect on the conception rate of the heifers.<P>

 Purpose: The objective of this
study was to determine the effects of albendazole on spermatogenesis, seminal
quality and libido in bulls.<P>  Methods: A single oral dose of 22.5 mg/kg
of albendazole suspension was administered to 12 two year old Hereford and/or
Angus bulls.  14 bulls of similar age, weight and breed were untreated and served
as controls.  The following parameters were measured over a 70 day period
following treatment: scrotal circumference, libido, spermatozoal ejaculate,
initial and post thaw motility, total solids, acrosomal integrity (post thaw),
and plasma testosterone.  Groups of treated and control bulls were castrated on
days seven, 28, 49 and 70 post treatment and total testicular weight, weight of
the tunical albuginea (testicular capsule), testicular parenchymal weight,
epididymal weight, and number of spermatids were determined as well as
quantitative testicular histology. <P> Results: There was no adverse effect
of spermatozoal production, spermatozoal output, quality of freshly ejaculated or
frozen semen, libido, or serum testosterone levels in the treated bulls.<P>
Conclusion: Treatment with albendazole suspension at a dose of 22.5 mg/kg (i.e.,
2.25 times the highest recommended therapeutic dose) exerted no detrimental
effect on the treated bulls.<P>

 Methods:
Albendazole was administered daily to equisexual groups of eight beagle dogs via
gelatin capsules for three months at doses of 2, 10 and 30 mg/kg.  A similar
group of dogs received empty gelatin capsules and served as a control.<P>
Results: Erythrocytes cholinesterase activity was statistically significantly
lower in the high dose males than controls at months one and three.  However, no
pharmacologic effect or histopathologic change was noted that could be attributed
to a depression or inhibition of cholinesterase activity.  In addition, no
similar change which was statistically significantly different from control was
noted in the females.  It was concluded; therefore, that the depression of the
cholinesterase in the high dose males was attributable to extreme variation in
the assay procedure.  Evaluation of general observations of body weight and food
consumption data, hematology, urinalysis, organ weights, organ/body weight ratios
and histologic examination did not reveal any effect attributable to the
administration of albendazole.<P>Conclusion: The no effect level in this
study was 30 mg/kg/day.<P>

 Methods: Twenty four male and 24
female beagle dogs were equally distributed into four groups of six
animals/sex/group and given 0, 5, 30 or 60 mg/kg of albendazole daily in gelatin
capsules for six months.  Hematology, clinical chemistry and cholinesterase
evaluations were performed pretest and at monthly intervals. Brain cholinesterase
was evaluated at termination.  Urinalysis was performed pretest and at two, four
and six months. Ophthalmoscopic examinations were conducted pretest and at
termination.  At the end of the experiment the animals were killed and the
tissues from all dogs were evaluated histopathologically.<P>Results:
Several toxic responses were seen among the high dose dogs.  These included
hematologic dyscrasia, reduced body weight gains, slightly higher liver weights,
significant decreases in both the absolute and relative weights of the testes,
hypocellular bone marrow, and one undiagnosed death.  The only effect seen among
the mid-dose (30 mg/kg/day) dogs was a reduced white blood cell count and no
evidence of toxicity was noted in any of the low dose dogs.<P>Conclusion:
The dose of 5 mg/kg/day of albendazole was established as the no effect
level.<P>

Study A-1022 <P>
Methods: Albendazole was administered daily
in the diet at dose levels of 3.5, 7.0 or 20.0 mg/kg to male and female F1a rats
(Charles River CD, derived from F0 generation given albendazole at dose levels of
1.0, 2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg/day for approximately 60 days prior to mating and
throughout the mating, gestation, lactation and post weaning segments of the
study).  One hundred rats per sex per group were used.  Two additional groups of
100 rats of each sex received unmedicated diet and served as controls.  All
surviving male rats were terminated at week 121 and all surviving female rats at
week 122.<P>Results: Evaluation of ophthalmology, physical observations,
body weight, food consumption, urinalysis, terminal organ and organ/body ratios
did not reveal any effect attributable to the administration of albendazole. 
Mean total leukocyte and segmented neutrophil counts were slightly reduced
in the high dose males at 22 and 24 months and in the high dose females at 24 and
28 months.  Slight decrease was observed in these parameters in the high dose
males and females at some earlier bleeding intervals; however, these changes were
not consistent over time and were within the range of values observed in one or
more of the control groups.  The other hematologic parameters evaluated were
unremarkable in the treated males and females throughout the study.  Mean
alkaline phosphatase values were slightly increased in the high dose males at
three and six months, but not during the remainder of the study.  Mean
cholesterol values were slightly elevated in the high dose females at three, six,
12, 18, 24 months and at the termination of the study.  Other clinical chemistry
parameters were unremarkable.  Histopathologic evaluation of the tissues
revealed testicular degenerative lesions and liver vacuolation among the high
dose rats; however, the incidence observed was within the range occurring in the
historical control data of this laboratory.  Analysis of the neoplasm
data focused attention on an increase of histiocytic sarcomas primarily in the
male and on the increase of uterine endometrial stromal polyps and sarcomas.<P>
Conclusion: Histiocytic sarcomas are spontaneous, commonly occurring,
lymphoreticular tumors appearing with a rate that is highly variable from study
to study.  The increase in all groups in this study was within historical control
range, and the incidence in the control groups was at the low end of the range.
In addition, if the histiocytic sarcomas were combined with the
lymphoreticular/hematopoietic tumors, as is commonly and acceptably done, the
apparent increase disappears.  The above considerations lead to the conclusion
that the slight increase in the incidence of histiocytic sarcomas was not
considered to be biologically significant.  Uterine endometrial stromal
tumors, particularly polyps, are spontaneous, common tumors, highly variable in
incidence.  The incidence in all groups is within the range of historical control
data.  In view of the highly variable historical incidence of combination with
the sarcomas, was not considered to be biologically significant.  
Albendazole was determined not to be carcinogenic in the rat.  The no observed
effect level is 7 mg/kg/day.<P>

Study A-1024<P>

Methods: Albendazole
was administered daily in the diet to male and female Charles  River CD-1 mice at
dose levels of 25, 100 or 400 mg/kg.  One hundred mice per sex per group were
used.  Two additional groups of 100 mice of each sex received unmedicated diet
and served as controls.  All surviving mice were terminated after 25 months on
test.<P>Results: No compound related changes were seen in general
appearance and behavior, physical observations or mortality.  The high dose males
and females exhibited reduced mean erythrocyte counts and elevated mean platelet
counts throughout the study. These effects were more pronounced in the females
than in the males.  During months three to 18, mean leukocyte counts were
slightly decreased in the high dose males, as compared to the controls, at most
bleeding intervals. However, during the last six months of the study this trend
reversed and the high dose males exhibited total leukocyte counts which were, for
the most part, slightly elevated relative to control.  With few exceptions, the
differences from control mice were not statistically significant. The patterns
noted in the mean erythrocyte, total leukocyte and platelet counts of the high
dose males and females were considered suggestive of a treatment related
effect.  At necropsy, the incidence of high dose males with flaccid
and/or small testes and high dose females with endometrial polyps of the uterus
was increased compared to controls.  Microscopically, bilateral degeneration of
the tubular germinal epithelium of the testes of the high dose males and
cytoplasmic vacuolation of centrilobular hepatocytes of the liver in the high
dose males and females were considered treatment related.  There were no other
histopathologic findings which were attributable to the administration of
albendazole.<P>Conclusion: Albendazole was demonstrated not to be a
carcinogen in mice in this study.  Based on the drug related changes seen in the
livers of the male and female mice, in the testes of the male mice and the uterus
of the female mice, 25 mg/kg/day was established as the no effect level for this
study.<P>

Study A-1007<P>
Methods: Albendazole was administered in
the diet at fixed concentrations of 0, 30, 75 or 150 ppm to Long Evans rats
continuously for three successive generations.  Each parental generation (F0, F1
and F2) consisted of 12 males and 24 females.<P>Results: No drug related
effect was seen in mating, pregnancy or fertility indices, offspring viability at
birth, litter survival to weaning or pup sex distribution data.  At the
high dose a slight, although statistically significant, decrease in mean
gestation length was noted in the first pregnancies of the F0 generation. During
the ensuing lactation interval (F1a litters) a statistically significant decrease
in pup survival indices on days zero to four and four to 21 was noted in this
same group.  For the remainder of the study (F1b litters, F1 and F2 generations)
the gestation length and pup survival data for the high dose group were
comparable to control.  No drug related effect on gestation length or pup
survival occurred in the low or mid dose groups.  Mean pup body weight
data during lactation were comparable between the controls and the low and mid
dose groups throughout the study. In the high dose group, mean pup body weights
during lactation tended to be slightly lower than control throughout most of the
study, with the exception of the F2a litter, for which mean pup weights were
slightly higher than controls.  Gross necropsy examination of the adults
(F0, F1 and F2) and offspring did not reveal any change attributable to
administration of albendazole.<P>Conclusion: A no effect level of 150 ppm
was established for albendazole in this study.<P>

Methods: Albendazole was administered orally by gavage as a
single daily dose to groups of 25 pregnant Charles River CD rats at doses of 5,
20 or 40 mg/kg. An identical group of rats received the vehicle only (0.5%
aqueous Methocel) and served as a control. Nineteen rats in each group were
treated on days 16 to 20 of gestation while the remaining six were treated from
day 16 of gestation through day 20 of lactation.  All dams were allowed
to deliver and the resulting litters were culled to ten pups (five males, five
females, if available) and evaluated for developmental and behavioral parameters.
Maternal criteria evaluated includes maternal body weight gain, appearance and
behavior, survival, gestation length, parturition, fertility and uterine
observations.  Offspring evaluations included gross examinations for external
malformations, viability, sex ratios, weight gain and neuropharmacologic tests at
weaning.<P>Results: There was no observable treatment related effect at
either the low or mid dose levels.  Decreased viability and external and skeletal
malformations were observed at the high dose (40 mg/kg/day).  At the high dose
there was a statistically significant decrease in mean pup body weight on days
zero, four, 12 and 21 of lactation and decreased survival of the pups during
lactation.  A slight decrease in mean maternal body weight gain was observed in
the high dose dams during lactation days zero through four.<P>Conclusion:
The no effect level in this study is concluded to be 20 mg/kg/day.<P>

Study A-2008<P>
Methods: Albendazole (doses of 0, 2, 5, 10 or 30 mg/kg/day) was
given by gavage to groups of 20 mated female Long Evans rats from days six
through 15 of gestation.  Fetuses were delivered by Caesarean section on day 20
of pregnancy. Behavior and general condition, food consumption and body weight
were monitored for the dams.  Live and dead fetuses, resorption, and implantation
sites were counted.  The fetuses were weighed, their sex determined and they were
examined for external appearance and detectable abnormalities.  Approximately two-thirds 
of the fetuses were processed for determination of skeletal abnormalities
and the remaining for soft tissue malformations.<P>Results: Embryotoxic
effects at the 30 mg/kg/day dose level were noted in all in life parameters.  The
number of dams with viable fetuses and the number of viable fetuses within a
litter were significantly less and resorption greater than in the control. Fetal
weight and size were also markedly less than control.  A definite teratogenic
effect of the drug as evidenced by an increased incidence of skeletal and soft
tissue malformations also occurred at the high dose level.  Small increases in
malformations at lower dose levels were observed that indicated possible
teratogenicity but a dose related pattern was not evident.<P>Conclusion:
Albendazole at 30 mg/kg/day appears to be fetotoxic and teratogenic in rats.  The
increased incidence of malformations in the other treated groups did not occur in
a dose related pattern.  The nature of the malformations precluded determination
of a no effect level.  The following study was used to determine the no effect
level.<P>

mg/kg/day albendazole was embryotoxic and teratogenic.  At the lower dose levels
(0.5, 2.0 or 5.0 mg/kg/day) there was no evidence of either maternal or fetal
toxicity, nor was there any effect on the reproductive parameters, fetal
viability, size or sex.  There was no indication of teratogenicity in either the

Methods:
Albendazole or one of its ten identified metabolites was administered by gavage
to groups of mated female albino Sprague-Dawley (OFA strain) rats from day eight
through 15 of pregnancy. In order to insure good comparison of one compound
against another, the daily dose administered was equimolar rather than equal in
weight.  In the case of albendazole the doses administered (MX10-4g/kg) ranged
from 5.3 to 13.25 mg/kg.  A similar group of female rats served as a control.
Fetuses were delivered on the 21st day of pregnancy by Caesarean Section.
Parameters studied in this experiment were similar to those in the other rat
teratology studies.<P>Results: At doses of 6 mg/kg and lower, albendazole
impaired neither the general health of the mothers nor the intrauterine
development of the fetuses. At doses greater than 6 mg/kg, albendazole and its
sulfoxide metabolite were embryotoxic and produced teratogenic effects.  No
embryotoxic or teratogenic effect was noted following administration of the other
metabolites of albendazole.<P>Conclusion: The no effect level for
albendazole and its sulfoxide metabolite for the parameters studies was 6

teratogenic effects. This was manifested by a higher mortality rate in the does,
as compared to controls, a significantly lower number of viable fetuses with a
concomitant increase in the number of resorption, slightly lower fetal weight and
size at birth, and the occurrence of ectrodactyly in all viable fetuses.  At the
10 mg/kg/day dose albendazole was embryotoxic.  The observations in the other

<b>2. Safe Concentration for Albendazole Residues:</b>

The no observed effect level for establishing the safe concentration of the total
residues of albendazole is 5 mg/kg/day. This is based on the teratogenic effect
in the rat teratology study.  The rat is considered the most sensitive species
and the teratology study the most sensitive study.  Therefore, with a 1000 fold
safety factor, the safe concentration for albendazole residues is:

 * One animal 
 </pre> <P> Liver and kidney from cattle  
in the residue studies described above were subjected to wet chemistry procedures
to establish the profiles of 14-C-albendazole metabolites present in those
samples. A number of extraction procedures were used with liver and kidney tissue
which varied in the extraction solvent and the use of sample pretreatment with
enzymes or acid hydrolysis.  The techniques used to isolate and quantitate
metabolites included thin layer chromatography, autoradiography, and reverse
isotope dilution.<P>In general, the qualitative profiles of the major 
metabolites present in the liver and kidney were very similar regardless of the
profiling procedure used. There were, however, significant variations in the
amounts of the individual metabolites observed because metabolite stability and
solubility parameters varied. The greatest single factor affecting the
quantitative profile was the use of acid hydrolysis, which released metabolites,
particularly the 2-aminosulfone metabolite, from the bound residue present in
liver.<P> At one day withdrawal, 52% of the 14-C-albendazole residues 
present in cattle liver was freely extractable into ethylacetate. By four days of
withdrawal, the percentage of freely extractable residues had declined to about
3% of the total radioactivity in liver.  These results established that freely
extractable residues of albendazole were present in significant amounts only at
short withdrawal times.  By four days post dosing the majority of the residue
(about 97%) was present as bound residue.<P>The use of more vigorous
extraction procedures, particularly the use of acid hydrolysis as noted earlier,
effected the release of increasing amounts of drug related residues from the
bound residue.  This effort resulted in the isolation and identification of
parent albendazole and its sulfoxide, sulfone, and 2-albendazole major
metabolites in liver tissue.  Two minor metabolites, the 2-aminosulfoxide and the
hydroxypropylsulfone, were also shown to be present but in small amounts and only
at short withdrawal times.  The table below presents the quantitation of the
major metabolites as percentages of the extractable radioactivity present in
liver tissue.  The extractable radioactivity in the samples ranged between 17%
and 66% of the total radioactivity present in the tissue depending upon the
extraction procedure used and the length of the withdrawal time.<P>

A comparison was made of the metabolite patterns present in
cattle liver and kidney with those present in the urine collected from the rats
and mice.  The comparison showed that parent albendazole and all other
metabolites identified at any time period in cattle liver and kidney were also
present in the urine of the laboratory species.  Therefore, the test species were
exposed to all of the metabolites shown to be present in the liver and kidney
from cattle treated with albendazole.<P><b>D. Marker Residue, Target
Tissue, and Rm (Tolerance) for Albendazole in Cattle</b> <P>The data in the
tables of total residue values shown on two of the previous pages established
that liver contains the highest levels of total drug related residues of
albendazole and that it is the tissue in cattle from which residues are the
slowest to deplete to the safe concentration.  These observations suggested liver
as the likely choice of target tissue for albendazole in cattle.<P>The
metabolism data, summarized in Section C., confirmed liver as the target tissue
and led to the selection of the 2-aminosulfone metabolite as the marker
substance.  Those data demonstrated that the 2-aminosulfone metabolite was
present in sufficiently high concentration and had the proper depletion
characteristics in liver to serve as the marker substance in that tissue.<P>
The Rm (tolerance) for albendazole was set from data obtained from the
analysis of liver tissue from cattle in total residue study Nos. 2 and 4.  The
livers from the cattle in those studies were assayed for the 2-aminosulfone
marker by the determinative assay of the regulatory method.  The method involves
a one hour hydrolysis of the liver samples with 6N HCl, as discussed in Section
E. The hydrolysis step releases the marker substance from the non freely
extractable (bound) residue as a consistent proportion of the total residue.<P>
The livers in study No. IV were obtained at 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 days
post dosing from cattle which received a 10 mg/kg dose of 14-C-albendazole.  When
assayed by the determinative procedure, the livers contained the 2-aminosulfone
marker at levels averaging 19.3% of the total residue present (range: 13.7% to
23.6%).  The livers in study No. II were obtained at 4, 6, 12 and 14 days
post dosing where the cattle received a 15 mg/kg dose of the radio-labelled drug.
When these livers were assayed, the concentration of the 2-aminosulfone marker
averaged 18.0% of the total residue (range: 17.0% to 20.3%).<P> These
results demonstrated that, when measured by the determinative procedure, the
2-aminosulfone metabolite represents approximately 18% of the total residue
present in liver tissue through the period of four to 180 days post dosing,
regardless of the dose administered.  Based on that relationship, a value of 0.2
ppm was assigned as the Rm (tolerance) for the albendazole marker in cattle
liver.  That value is the level of the 2-aminosulfone metabolite (the marker
substance) expected to be present in liver (the target tissue) when the total
residues of albendazole in that tissue have depleted to the safe concentration of
1.2 ppm (0.2 ppm &#137; 18% of 1.2 ppm).<P><b>E. Regulatory Methods for
Residues</b><P><b>Albendazole Determinative Assay Procedure</b> <P>The
determinative assay for measuring residues in liver from cattle treated with
albendazole is based on the measurement of the marker substance, the
2-aminosulfone metabolite, by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with
fluorescence detection.<P>Homogenized cattle liver (2.5 g) is fortified
with the internal standard, hydrolyzed in 6N hydrochloric acid, adjusted to pH
8.0-9.5 with sodium carbonate and extracted with ethyl acetate.  The albendazole
marker and internal standard are back extracted into 1N hydrochloric acid and the
ethyl acetate removed by aspiration. The aqueous phase is adjusted to pH 8.0-9.5
with sodium carbonate, and then extracted with toluene, which is removed by
aspiration. The aqueous phase is applied to a SEP-PAK C-18 cartridge where the
compounds of interest are retained and subsequently eluted with ethyl acetate.
The ethyl acetate eluate is concentrated to dryness.  The residue is
reconstituted in water/methanol, filtered, and the marker residue quantified
using HPLC.<P>The quantitative sensitivity of the method is 25 ppb.<P>
<b>Albendazole Confirmatory Assay Procedure</b> <P>The confirmatory
procedure for albendazole may be performed on the same sample extract obtained
for the determinative HPLC analysis described above.  The dry residue from the
water/methanol filtrate from that procedure is treated to form the t-butyl
dimethylsilyl (t-BDMS) derivative which is then subjected to GC/MS analysis. The
mass spectral analysis monitors for the presence of three ions that are
characteristic of the t-BDMS derivative of the marker residue.  The presence of
albendazole residues in the sample of cattle liver is confirmed when the relative
intensities of those three ions agree to within +/- 10% of standard samples.<P>
<b>Validation</b> <P>A method trial of the determinative and confirmatory
procedures was satisfactorily completed by FDA and USDA laboratories.  The
validated regulatory methods for residues of albendazole are filed in the Food
Additives Manual on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Room
12A-30, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857).<P><b>F. Marker Residue
Depletion Study and Calculation of a Withdrawal Time</b> <P>Depletion of the
marker residue following administration of albendazole in the suspension
formulation was determined in a study utilizing 32 head of beef cattle.  The
animals each received a single oral dose of albendazole suspension at 10 mg/kg.
The cattle were euthanized in groups of eight (four heifers and four steers per
group) at 20, 24, 28 or 32 days post dosing.<P>The livers (target tissue)
were collected at the time of slaughter and were assayed for the marker residue
(the 2-aminosulfone metabolite) using the determinative procedure.  The results
are presented in the table below.<P>

</pre> A statistical analysis of the depletion data using the upper tolerance
limit containing a 99 percentile of the population with 95% confidence limits
yielded a withdrawal period of 24 days.  A withdrawal time of 27 days is used for
labeling purposes with the albendazole suspension in order to have a single
common withdrawal time for the various oral dosage forms of albendazole being
developed.<P><b>G. Safety to Handler</b> <P>The drug was also
evaluated for <i>untoward effects</i> which might result from <i>physical contact</i> with
it:<P>Albendazole was not irritating when applied directly to abraded or
non abraded rabbit skin (500 mg applied to each side).  Similarly, no irritation
was observed in either non irrigated (non washed) or irrigated eyes of any rabbit
immediately, 24, 48 or 72 hours after instillation of 100 mg of albendazole.<P>
A single oral dose of 3000 mg/kg of albendazole failed to produce death when
administered to mice.  This dose represents approximately 300 times the highest
recommended therapeutic dose.<P>The studies demonstrated that the drug
would have no ill effects on persons handling it if it is used according to label
recommendations.<P><b>VII. Agency Conclusions:</b> <P>The data
submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section 512 of the
Act and demonstrate that albendazole (Valbazen&#174;) is safe and effective when
administered as an oral suspension at a dosage level of 10 mg/kg body weight to
cattle for the indications stated in the product labeling.<P>In the
initial Threshold Assessment of albendazole the Agency assigned albendazole to
Category D.  This assessment was based upon literature reports that structurally
similar benzimidazoles gave positive responses in mutagenicity assays.
Additionally in 1981, the Agency concluded that because of the high score
assigned to albendazole negative mutagenicity tests would not remove it from the
requirements for carcinogenicity testing in two rodent species.  Consequently,
albendazole underwent chronic carcinogenicity testing in the mouse and rat.<P>
The submitted data including negative carcinogenicity studies in two rodent
species are adequate to satisfy the Agency's food safety requirements.  The safe
concentrations for total albendazole in uncooked edible beef tissues are: 0.6 ppm
in muscle, 1.2 ppm in liver, 1.8 ppm in kidney and 2.4 ppm in fat.  A regulatory
tissue residue method has been developed for the determination of the marker
compound, the 2-aminosulfone metabolite, with a tolerance of 0.2 ppm in cattle
liver.<P>The Agency concludes that adequate directions for use have been
written for the proposed over the counter use of this broad spectrum anthelmintic
which is indicated for the removal and control of parasites commonly occurring in
cattle.<P>

SUMMARY</b><p>
<b>1. General Information:</b> <p>
 <b>NADA Number:</b>       140-869<p>
<b> Sponsor: </b><p>          Purina Mills, Inc.<br> P.O. Box 66812<br> St. Louis,  
                    Missouri  63166-6812<p>
 <b>Generic Name: </b>         Medicated Feed Block containing 6.6% Poloxalene <p>
 <b>Trade Name:</b>         Purina Bloat Block <p>
 <b>Marketing Status:</b>      OTC <p>
 <b>Date of Summary:</b>  August 8, 1989<p>
<b>2. Indications for Use:</b>  <p>
For control of legume (alfalfa, clover) and wheat pasture bloat in cattle when
consumed at the prescribed rate. <p>
<b>3. Dosage Form, Route of Administration, and Recommended Dosage:</b> <p>
Medicated Feed Block containing 6.6% Poloxalene.  To be fed free choice to
pasture cattle on pasture at a rate of 0.8 oz. (0.05 lb) of block/100 lb body
weight per day. <p>
<b>Dosage Form:</b>  Medicated Feed Block <p>
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><p>  0.8 oz (0.05 lb) of block/100 lb body weight to provide
each animal 1.5 grams of Poloxalene/100 lb body weight per day. <p>
<b>4. Effectiveness:</b> <p>
<b>Summary </b><p>
Poloxalene is already approved for use in pasture feeds for the control of
legume and wheat pasture bloat in cattle as specified in 21 CFR 558.465.  Since
authorization was granted to Purina Mills, Inc. by SmithKline Animal Health
Products to refer to the dose response data contained in NADA 32-704v,
no other dose response study was conducted. However, the following efficacy and
consumption studies were conducted with the proposed block to show the drug to
be effective in the free choice feed. <p>
<b>Efficacy</b> <p>
This study was conducted by E.G. Johnson, Parma, Idaho.  Four groups of 15
steers each were used in the double blind study to evaluate the effectiveness
of poloxalene in controlling frothy bloat when administered in a free choice
high molasses block.  The study was conducted on lush alfalfa pastures as it is
more likely to precipitate bloat than is wheat pasture.  The four groups of
animals were placed on four grass pastures until the experiment was initiated.
At random, two groups of steers with an average initial weight of 558 lbs were
assigned to the medicated blocks and the remaining two groups of steers with an
average weight of 555 lbs were assigned to the non-medicated blocks.  Animals
were offered the experimental blocks before being placed on alfalfa pasture to
allow ruminal levels of poloxalene to reach an efficacious amount in the steers
on the blindly assigned medicated blocks. Each animal group was rotated
approximately every seven days among 16 pastures.  The study was conducted for
91 days. <p>
Animals were individually monitored for bloat and for severity of rumen
distention using scoring system of zero through three for daily animal
evaluation. <p>
0 = no abdominal distention <br>
1 = distention of left side <br>
2 = distention of left and right side, animal distressed <br>
3 = severe distention of left and right side, animal in severe  
distress, terminal unless relieved. <p>
Weights were taken on a full animal weight basis and were done at 0 day and
each 28 days thereafter.  The reason for full weights was to prevent poloxalene
levels in the medicated groups from becoming depleted to inefficacious levels
at a time of substantial forage intake following a fast.  Full weights were
taken at the same time of the day to reduce variability due to fill. <p>
Poloxalene was consumed free choice at an average of 1.7 g per 100 lbs full
body weight.  Pooled consumption data across animal groups showed a coefficient
of variations of 37.9%.  When poloxalene was consumed in a free choice high
molasses compressed block by cattle grazing alfalfa pastures, the incidence of
severe ruminal distentions was significantly reduced compared to cattle
consuming non-medicated
blocks (31 vs. 209 total animal days with a bloat score).  The total number of
animal days with a non-zero
score were greater (P .01) with the non-medicated
vs. the medicated group of steers. <p>
<b>Consumption studies </b><p>
Three consumption studies were conducted in three different locations as
follows: <p>
<b>a.  Arkansas Study:</b> <p>This study was conducted at the University of Arkansas,
Batesville, Arkansas, by Ken Harrision, Resident Director of Experiment
Station. <p>
Three groups of 15 heifers each were used in the 50 day study. Three wheat
pastures were used, each approximately 10 acres in size.  Heifers were weighed
and allotted to their three groups one week prior to the start of the
experiment.  The three groups of animals were placed on their initially
assigned wheat pastures and offered non-medicated blocks prior to the start of
the experiment to acquaint them with block feeding.  The non-medicated blocks
were removed on day 1 and replaced with medicated blocks at a feeding rate of
one per five animals in all three groups.  The three groups were rotated
approximately every 14 days among three wheat pastures. Blocks were weighed
weekly and recorded on separate record sheets for each group of animals.  New
blocks were added when judged necessary to prevent each group from running out.
<p>
The following consumption results were obtained: <p>

Pooled consumption data across animal groups showed a coefficient of variation
of 24.8%. <p>

<b>b.  Texas Study:</b><p> This study was conducted at Texas Agricultural  
Experiment Station, by D.P. Hutchinson, Amarillo Texas. Three groups of 15
steers each were used in the 91 day study.  Steers  
were weighed and placed into three groups on the basis of weight and breed.
Steers were alloted to their groups on day 1 of the experiment. One to two
weeks prior to the start of the experiment, the steers were exposed as a group
to non-medicated blocks to acquaint them with block feeding.  After being
alloted to three groups on day one, the three groups were placed on their
initially assigned wheat pastures and offered medicated blocks at a feeding
rate of one per five animals in all three groups.  The three groups were
rotated approximately every 14 days among  
the three pastures. <p>
Each week, the amount of blocks remaining in the feeders were weighed in each
pasture.  New blocks were added to prevent each group from running out.  Three
wheat pastures were used, each approximately 13 acres in size.  Pasture
conditions were observed every 14 days and recorded. <p>
The following consumption results were obtained: <p>

<b>c.  Idaho Study:</b><p> This study described previously under efficacy was conducted
to collect both efficacy and consumption data in one location. <p>
The following consumption results were obtained in this study: <p>
<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 3 columns.)</b><P>
<pre><b>

All  
Groups   786 lbs                .0575                          1.7  
</pre>
Pooled consumption data across animal groups showed a coefficient of variation
of 37.9%. <p>
Although there was some overconsumption of the drug in the Arkansas study, the
variations in intake in the consumption studies compared favorable with the
variations in intake in the efficacy study. <p>
<b>5. Safety for the Target Species:</b>  <p>
Data contained in this application show an average block consumption of .067
lbs medicated block to provide an average dose of 2 g poloxalene per 100 lbs
body weight without causing any adverse effect.  Reference is also made to
safety data contained in NADA 32-704v.
<p>
 
<b>6. Human Food Safety:</b> <p>
Authorization has also been granted to refer to the human food safety data
contained in NADA 32-704v.<p>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b>  <p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of section
512 of the act and demonstrate that Poloxalene 6.6% Medicated Feed Block when
used under its proposed conditions of use is safe and effective for the control
of legume (alfalfa, clover) and wheat pasture bloat in cattle when consumed at
the prescribed rate. Because of the drug's route of administration, conditions
to be treated, and adequate directions for use for the layman, the Agency
concluded that Poloxalene 6.6% Medicated Feed Block (containing molasses) can
be marketed over the counter. <p>
Poloxalene Type A Medicated Articles are currently codified in sections 21 CFR
558.464 (Poloxalene) and 558.465 (poloxalene free choice liquid Type C Feed)
for use in cattle providing for the same conditions of use. It is also codified
in section 21 CFR 520.1840 for use in cattle as a drench or in molasses block
or as a 53% Poloxalene top dressing on individual rations of ground feed. <p>

<b>Marketing Status:</b>    OTC<p>
<b>Date of Summary:</b>  August 8, 1990<p>
<b>II.  Indications for Use</b><p>
For increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency, suppression of
estrus (heat), and reduced incidence of liver abscesses in heifers fed in
confinement for slaughter.<p>
<b>III.  Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage</b><p>
<b>Dosage Form:</b>  Feed<p>
<b>Route of Administration:</b>  Oral<p>
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><p>
    melengestrol acetate:   0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day<br>
    tylosin phosphate:  8 to 10 g/ton of air dried complete feed (to provide 90
mg/hd/day)<p>
Approval has been granted to feed 0.25 to 0.5 mg melengestrol acetate (MGA) per
head per day in combination with 8 to 10 g tylosin per ton of air dry complete
feed when each additive is provided via separate supplements or a supplement
containing MGA is fed in combination with a complete feed containing
tylosin.<p>
The supplement containing melengestrol acetate provided at a rate of 0.5 to 2.0
pounds per head, may be top-dressed onto or mixed with the feed containing
tylosin.<p> 
This clearance does not provide for the mixing of melengestrol acetate and
tylosin premixes together in a common supplement or in a complete ration
offered for sale by the feed manufacturer.<p>
<b>IV.  Effectiveness (In compliance with combination approval claims)</b><p>
The efficacy of melengestrol acetate for increased rate of weight gain,
improved feed efficiency and suppression of estrus (heat) in heifers fed for
slaughter is well documented and approved (21CFR 558.342).  The effectiveness
of tylosin for reduction of liver abscesses is also established in the same
class of cattle (21CFR 558.625).  For this application, the efficacy of
melengestrol acetate and tylosin when co-administered was established by
conducting a  
series of field trials under a common protocol. These trials were designed to
evaluate the performance of feedlot heifers fed each drug separately and in
combination.<p>
<b>A.  Pivotal Studies</b><p>
A feedlot heifer study consisting of field trials at nine locations with three
replications per location was conducted to generate animals performance data on
the combination of melengestrol acetate and tylosin.  Results of each study are
reported as well as a summary and statistical analysis of the pooled data from
all nine field investigations.<p>

    The combination of melengestrol acetate and tylosin was justified. In the
tylosin vs melengestrol acetate     plus tylosin contrast, the contribution of
melengestrol acetate for estrus suppression (P = 0.000006), feed    efficiency (P
= 0.00346) and average daily gain (P =
0.0004) was     demonstrated. In the melengestrol acetate vs melengestrol acetate
plus tylosin contrast, the effect of tylosin    for control of abscessed livers
(P = 0.00124) was evident (Table 7).<p>
<b>6.  Conclusions</b><p>
    The data generated by the nine location field study demonstrated that the
melengestrol acetate and tylosin    combination is justified for it's effect on
estrus suppression, improved feed efficiency, increased average     daily gain and
reduction of liver abscesses. Each drug, melengestrol acetate and tylosin, has
been shown to   make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of the
combination.<p>
<b>7.  Adverse Reactions</b><p>
    No adverse reactions due to the feeding of melengestrol acetate or tylosin,
either singly or in combination     were reported.<p>
<b>8.  Special Issues</b><p>
    <b>Compliance with combination drug policy:</b><p>
    <b>a.</b>  The effectiveness and safety of melengestrol acetate and tylosin when fed
singly to feed lot cattle are       well documented in their respective approved
NADAs.  The results of adequately controlled studies        were submitted to the
FDA in support of these respective NADAs.  Such data resulted in the approval
of      melengestrol acetate as per CFR 558.342, and tylosin as per CFR 558.625.
Data generated in support of        combination usage have demonstrated that
melengestrol acetate and tylosin fed together are effective         and safe.<p>
        The data support compliance with 21CFR 514.1(b)(8)(v) and CVM's combination
drug guidelines         (November 9, 1983).  The combination is justified as detailed
in sections IV, V and VI of this application.<p>
        The use of untreated controls was not deemed necessary as a test for general
effectiveness because the individual drugs have been previously shown to be
effective and already approved at the levels tested.        The treatment groups
consisting of the individual drugs and the two-way combinations served as the
appropriate controls for the respective three-way combination.  Thus, these
treatment groups essentially        served as negative controls with respect to
21CFR 514.111 (a)(5)(ii)(a)(4), and the studies were properly       controlled.<p>
        To justify the combination, comparisons were made which demonstrated that
each drug made a        statistically significant contribution to the combination.
The two-way combination provides a benefit      that cannot be obtained from the
single compounds.<p>
        A comparison of melengestrol acetate/tylosin vs. melengestrol acetate for
transformed percent liver       abscesses demonstrates the contribution of tylosin
to the combination.<p>
        A comparison of melengestrol acetate/tylosin vs. tylosin for ADG, FE and
estrus suppression          demonstrates the contribution of melengestrol acetate to
the combination.  Significance for any variable         shows that melengestrol
acetate contributes to the combination.<p>
        The proposed ranges for each drug are justified when fed in combination since
the highest levels      proposed were tested in combination for efficiency and
human and animal safety.<p>
<b>B.  Corroborative Studies.</b> N/A<p>
<b>V.  Animal Safety</b><p>
<b>A.  Pivotal Study</b><p>
The safety of melengestrol acetate and tylosin in the bovine have been
documented as evidenced by their respective approval (21CFR 558.342 for
melengestrol acetate and 21CFR 558.625 for tylosin) as feed additives.  Studies
utilizing only melengestrol acetate, monensin and tylosin were not conducted, 
the following pivotal study was conducted to establish the target animal
safety of melengestrol acetate, monensin and tylosin when fed in
combination.  This study shall also serve to establish the target animal
safety of melengestrol acetate and tylosin when fed in combination.<p>

* Bone marrow smears were made at the time of necropsy, air 
  dried and fixed for 30 seconds or more in methanol.  Slides 
  were stained with Wrights stain.</pre> <p>
    The following organs were weighed at necropsy, paired organs weighed
together:<p>
    Adrenals, liver, kidneys and heart.<p>
<b>4)  Results</b><p>
    <b>a.  Clinical observations</b><p>
        No adverse, drug related clinical signs were observed during this study.<p>
        Significant statistical differences were detected for average daily gain
(ADG) at the 3X and 5X dose         level for day 41 and at study termination, which
were lower in magnitude when compared to controls.          This decrease in ADG
coincided with reduced feed consumption (average daily feed, ADF) and
appeared to be related to decreased palatability of the feed at higher dose
levels.<p>
   <b> b.  Clinical pathology</b><p>
        Occasional statistically significant changes in several hematologic and serum
chemistry parameters were       detected, but all values were well within normal
acceptable ranges and only serum cholesterol values showed a dose related
trend.<p>
   <b> c.  Gross and microscopic pathology</b><p>
        Several gross and histologic tissue changes were observed, but due to the
relative even distribution of       the changes in all dose groups including
controls, these findings were considered to be incidental rather        than drug
related.<p>
<b>5.  Conclusions</b><p>
    <b>a.</b>  Based upon the results of this study, the combination of melengestrol
acetate, monensin sodium and        tylosin phosphate in the daily feed of yearling
heifers appears to be non-toxic when fed for 90 days at up      to 5 times the
recommended dose.<p>
<b>VI.  Human Safety:</b><p>
<b>A.  Drugs for use in food animals</b><p>
<b>1.  Toxicity tests</b><p>
    Data regarding toxicity testing in melengestrol acetate and tylosin
phosphatase are contained in the    approved NADAs for the above mentioned
compounds.<p>
<b>2.  Safe concentration of residues</b><p>
    Tolerances for melengestrol acetate and tylosin phosphate are published in the
Code of Federal Regulations.    Melengestrol acetate is currently approved under
21CFR 558.342 for use in heifers at 0.25 to 0.50    mg/hd/day with a 48-hour
withdrawal period.  No residues of MGA may be found in uncooked edible  tissues
of cattle with a method sensitive to 25 ppb (21CFR 556.740).  The tolerance for tylosin phosphate
has been established at 0.2 ppm (negligible residue) in uncooked fat,
muscle, liver and kidney (CFR 556.740).  Tylosin phosphate
has no withdrawal   period established under 21CFR 558.625.<p>
<b>3.  Metabolism and total residue depletion studies</b><p>
    Numerous studies have been conducted relative to metabolism and depletion of
residues of melengestrol    acetate and tylosin when administered individually to
cattle.  The results of those studies have been filed   under the following
submissions:<p>

</pre>
The animals in each group were slaughtered within 16 hours following their last
feeding.  Perirenal fat was collected from all four treatment groups for the
melengestrol acetate analysis, and liver samples were collected from the group
1 and 2 heifers for the assay of tylosin.<p>
   <b> a.  Residues of melengestrol acetate</b><p>
        The samples of perirenal fat from each animal were assayed for residues of
melengestrol acetate using      the official AOAC gas chromatographic method.
Analysis of the samples from the group 2 (1X)       animals showed that all fat
samples were below the 25 ppb tolerance for MGA and five of the seven       samples
were below the 10 ppb limit of reliable measurement of the assay.  The two fat
samples that        gave positive responses had MGA levels of 12.7 and 13.7 ppb.<p>
        Fat samples from groups 3 and 4 (the heifers dosed at 3X and 5X levels)
yielded average residue levels      of 37.6 and 49.4 ppm, respectively.<p>
   <b> b.  Residues of tylosin</b><p>
        The liver tissue samples from the group 2 (1X) heifers and seven of the
control animals were assayed for        tylosin by the official assay which measures
microbiologically active the drug.  No positive responses       were obtained for
any of the samples by this method which has a limit of quantitation of 0.1
ppm.<p>
<b>5.  Assay noninterference data:</b><p>
    <b>a.  Melengestrol acetate assay</b><p>
        Data were generated using spiked control fat tissue samples to demonstrate
that the presence of tylosin        does not interfere with the assay of MGA.  The
study was also intended to show that MGA is stable in       frozen fat tissue over
a period of 60 days.<p>
        Samples of freshly ground control bovine fat tissue were spiked with MGA and
tylosin at the      following levels:<p>
        MGA:  0.025 ppm<br>
        Tylosin:  1.0 ppm<p>
        The spiked samples were assayed in duplicate for MGA by the official AOAC
method after 0, 15, 30, 45  
        and 60 days of storage at -20&#176;C.  The average recoveries are shown

        Data to demonstrate that the presence of lasalocid and MGA does not interfere
with the assay of tylosin       are contained in study S-AAC-84-03 conducted by the
Elanco Products Company.  Samples of liver      from control heifers were
composited and fortified with 0.2 ppm lasalocid, 0.2 ppm tylosin and 0.2 ppm
MGA.  The samples were assayed for tylosin by the cylinder plate
microbiological method using      <i>  Micrococcus luteus</i>&#160; as the test organism.  No
interference was detected by the presence of lasalocid and      MGA.<p>
        The stability of tylosin in frozen liver tissue was demonstrated in study
MRC8910 conducted by the        Elanco Products Company.  Liver tissue from control
animals was fortified with 0.2 ppm tylosin and      then frozen.  Portions of the
samples were thawed at intervals up to 56 days and assayed for tylosin.  The
stability of tylosin through 56 days was indicated by the recoveries in the

    Regression analysis of these data demonstrates satisfactory tylosin stability
for the period the tissues in the   residue depletion study were stored before
assay.<p>
    The residue depletion and assay noninterference studies presented above
demonstrate that the combined   feeding of melengestrol acetate and tylosin
phosphate at their highest approved levels results in tissue    residues below
the tolerance level of both drugs at 16 hours of withdrawal.  The data also
show that each  drug in the two-way combination does not interfere with the
assay of the other.  This work confirms the     adequacy of the 48-hour withdrawal
time required for the presence of MGA in the combination and    demonstrates that
the use of these animal drugs does not pose a hazard to public health.<p>
<b>6.  Regulatory methods</b><p>
    Practical analytical methods of analysis for tissue residues of melengestrol
acetate and tylosin phosphate   may be found in the <i>Food Additives Analytical
Manual</i>&#160; on display in FDA's Freedom of Information   Public Room (room
12-A-30), 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD  20857.<p>
<b>VII.  Agency Conclusions</b><p>
These NADAs provide for the combination use of MGA and tylosin phosphate at the
levels of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/head/day and 8 to 10 g/ton of feed (to supply 90
mg/head/day), respectively, for increased rate of weight gain, improved feed
efficiency, suppression of estrus (heat), and reduced incidence of liver
abscesses in heifers fed in confinement for slaughter.  Adequate data were
submitted which show that the combination resulted in a significant (P &#60;
.05) improvement in overall performance of heifers when compared to the
performance of heifers fed either drug singly.  The combination, when fed at up
to 5X the highest recommended combination approval (0.5 mg MGA/head/day plus 10
g tylosin phosphate/ton for 90 days), did not produce an adverse effect.  No
changes were made in the approved levels of either compound or in the target
animal and the non-interference of tylosin phosphate and MGA with the
analytical methods for MGA and tylosin phosphate, respectively, was
demonstrated.  Accordingly, approval of these NADAs is not expected to increase
human exposure to drug residues, and therefore did not require a complete
re-evaluation of the human safety data in the original applications. For the
purposes of human food safety review, these original NADAs have been treated as
Category II supplements under the Agency's Supplemental Policy (42 FR 64367).
These production drugs are OTC because they do not raise any special safety
concerns.<p>

body weight (1 ml reconstituted sterile solution per 100 lb body
weight).  Treatment should be repeated every 24 hours for a total
of three treatments.  Additional treatments may be given on days
four and five for animals which do not show a satisfactory
response (not recovered) after the first three treatments.<p>

<b>IV. EFFECTIVENESS:<p>

A. Pivotal Studies (4)<p>

Summary</b><p>
Four separate studies were completed to determine the efficacy of
ceftiofur for treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD also
referred to as shipping fever or bovine pneumonia).  Each is
considered a "pivotal" study.  No "corroborative" efficacy studies
were conducted.<p>
The initial cattle study included 84 head with naturally occurring
disease, 42 non-medicated controls and 42 ceftiofur treated
animals.  Drug treated animals each received ceftiofur at 1 mg/lb
body weight intramuscularly for three consecutive days.  Results
showed that this drug, ceftiofur, was effective at 1 mg/lb body
weight for treatment of BRD (see Table in section 1(d) for details).<p>
In the first dose response study 220 cattle with spontaneously
occurring disease were assigned to 44 blocks of five animals
(treatments) per block.  Treatments were 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0
mg/lb body weight given intramuscularly for three consecutive
days.  Results from this study showed all drug concentration
treatment groups to be effective relative to no therapy and not
different from each other (see Table in section 2(d) for details).<p>
A second dose response study was conducted using 235 cattle
blocked into 47 blocks of five animals (treatments) per block. 
Doses evaluated were 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0 mg/lb body
weight given intramuscularly for three consecutive days.  Results
showed 0.5 and 1.0 mg/lb treatment groups to be similar and each
superior to the non-medicated control group.  Other treatment
groups were not deemed different either from control or from the
two higher dosed treatment groups.<p>
Collectively considering data from the three previously described
trials, a dose of 0.5 mg/lb body weight was the optimal dose of
ceftiofur for treatment of BRD.<p>
Finally, a seven location clinical trial was conducted.  This
included 629 cattle with spontaneously occurring disease and three
treatment groups.  These were 1) non-medicated control, 2)
ceftiofur at 0.5 mg/lb and 3) ceftiofur at 1.0 mg/lb body weight. 
Placebo and ceftiofur treatments were administered by
intramuscular injection once per day for three or five days. 
Results indicated that each of the two ceftiofur doses (0.5 and
1.0 mg/lb) was significantly better than placebo.  The two
ceftiofur dosed groups provided similar responses.<p>

<b>1. Initial Efficacy Study<p>

(a) Type of Study</b><p>
The first cattle study was an efficacy trial using calves with
spontaneously occurring disease to determine whether or not
ceftiofur would be effective for treatment of BRD when
administered intramuscularly at 1.0 mg/lb body weight for three
consecutive days.<p>

<b>(b) Investigator</b><p>
G. G. Stocking, D.V.M.<br>
The Upjohn Company<br>
Kalamazoo, Michigan 49001<p>

<b>(c) General Design</b><p><ul>
<li><b>Purpose</b> of this study was to determine whether ceftiofur would be
effective for treatment of BRD in cattle with spontaneously
occurring disease.<p>
<li><b>Animals</b><p>
- Feeder cattle ranging in weight from 350 to 456 lbs<br>
- approximate age was 6 mos.<br> 
- mixture of bulls and steers of Angus, Hereford and Angus/Hereford crossbreeding<br>
- 42 head for each of two treatment groups.<p>

<li><b>Control</b> was a non-drug sterile diluent administered
intramuscularly at 8 ml/animal for three consecutive days.<p>

<li><b>Diagnosis</b><p> BRD was diagnosed by an elevated body temperature
(104.5&#176;F or greater) and the presence of at least two additional
signs of the disease such as depressed physical appearance,
increased or labored respiration, cough and anorexia.  Nasal swabs
were taken from each animal just prior to treatment to determine
presence of BRD pathogens.<p>

<li><b>Dosage Form </b><p> Dosage from was an aqueous solution containing 50 mg
ceftiofur equivalents per ml.<p>
<li><b>Route of Administration: </b>Intramuscular.<p>
<li><b>Dose</b><p> Doses tested were 0 and 1.0 mg ceftiofur per lb body weight
administered intramuscularly three consecutive days.<p>
<li><b>Test Duration:</b> This was a 28 day study.<p>
<li><b>Pertinent Parameters Measured:</b><p><ul>
<li>The primary parameter for determining drug effectiveness in this
preliminary study was body temperature drop between days one and
four of the study.<p>
<li>Other measurements were:<p><ul>
<li>gain or loss in body weight at days 4, 10, 28 of the study<br>
<li>success (clinical) on days 4, 10, 28 of the study<br> 
<li>mortality at days 4, 10, 28 of the study.<p></ul></ul></ul>

<b>(d) Results</b><p>
<i>Pasteurella hemolytica</i>&#160; was isolated from 128 (54&#37;) of the 235 pre-treatment

was isolated from 18 (26&#37;) of the lungs from cattle that died
during the 28 day study, indicating that it was a part of the
etiology of the disease in the study.  <i>Mycoplasmas </i>&#160; were isolated
from 199 (85&#37;) of the nasal swabs and there were six animals whose
nasal swabs produced no organisms.  These were distributed among

The treatment means are unadjusted for differences that occurred
between trials.  The control group and the 1.0 mg/lb group were
common to all three studies.  The LSD values (0.05) are an over
estimate since they are the values associated with sample sizes of
44 cattle per treatment group.  The LSD values were nearly
identical across the three studies, therefore, combined LSDs could
only be smaller.  Consequently, any difference significant with
the above listed LSDs would be more significant with LSDs
calculated from the combined data.<p>
<b>(c) Conclusions</b><p>
The combined set of data from the three previously described
studies support a conclusion that 0.5 mg/lb is an effective dose
for the treatment of BRD.<p>

<b>(c) General Design</b><ul><p>

<li><b>Purpose</b> of this multi location study was to determine whether or
not ceftiofur at 0.5 mg/lb body weight given intramuscularly for
three to five days is effective for the treatment of BRD under
typical feedlot conditions.<p>
<li><b>Animals</b><p>
- 629 head of feedlot cattle ranging in weight from 281 to 562 lbs.<br>
- calves ranged from six to ten months in age<br>
- typical feedlot animals, mixed steers and bulls<br>
- 209 head per treatment group.<p>

<li><b>Control</b> was a non-drug sterile diluent administered
intramuscularly at 8 ml/animal for three consecutive days.<p>

<li><b>Diagnosis:</b><p> BRD was diagnosed by an elevated body temperature
(104.5&#176; F or greater) and the presence of at least two
additional signs of the disease such as depressed physical
appearance, increased or labored respiration, cough and loss of
appetite.  Nasal swabs were taken from each animal just prior to
treatment to determine presence of BRD pathogens.<p>

<li><b>Dosage Form:</b><p> Dosage form was an aqueous solution containing 50 mg
ceftiofur equivalents per ml.<p>
<li><b>Route of Administration: </b>Intramuscular.<p>

<li><b>Dose: </b><p>Control was the sterile vehicle (Bacteriostatic Water for
Injection) given intramuscularly at 8 ml per animal.  Ceftiofur
was administered intramuscularly either at 0.5 or 0 mg/lb body
weight three or five consecutive days.  On day four of the trials,
the investigators evaluated the condition of all surviving animals
and determined whether or not they were recovered.  If they were
deemed "recovered", no further medication was given.  If they were
judged "not recovered" two more daily treatments were administered
on days four and five.  This procedure also included placebos.<p>

<li><b>Test Duration:</b> This was a 28 day study.<p>
<li><b>Pertinent Parameters Measured:</b><p>
                                 
- body temperature drop at day 4<br>
- clinical success at day 10<br>
- clinical success at day 28<br>
- mortality by day 28</ul><p>

<b>(d) Results</b><p>
Nasal swabs were taken for pre-treatment culture and organism
identification from 618 cattle used in this study.<p>
The most commonly isolated pathogen was <i>Pasteurella hemolytica</i>&#160;
which was present in 385 (47&#37;) of the specimens.  <i>Pasteurella</i>
<i>multocida</i>&#160; was found in 163 (20&#37;) of the swabs.  <i>Hemophilus
somnus</i>&#160;
was present in 41 (5&#37;) and <i>Mycoplasma </i>&#160; spp. in 309 (37&#37;).  There
were 210 (25&#37;) cattle from whose nasal swabs no organisms could be

Based on necropsy results, all but two of the 79 calves which died
during the 28 day study were caused by typical BRD syndrome.  Of
the two, one was diagnosed as septicemia and the other anemia,
dehydration and nutritional deficiency complicated by the stress
of handling and shipping.<p>

<b>V. ANIMAL SAFETY:</b><p>
<b>Summary</b><p>
Three specifically designed Target Animal (cattle) Safety Studies
were conducted to address the tolerance to and safety of
ceftiofur.  Additionally, four clinical efficacy trials were
conducted wherein target animal safety was also determined.<p>
Based on results of these seven trials, ceftiofur is safe when
administered intramuscularly at doses up to 1.0 mg. ceftiofur per
lb body weight daily for five days.  Local pain reaction to the
injection is deemed transient and not detrimental to safety of an
already sick animal.<p>

<b>A. Pivotal Studies<p>
1. Safety/Toxicity Study<p>
(a) Type of Study</b><p>
This was a five day study in cattle where drug was administered at
daily doses of 0, 1 mg/lb, 3 mg/lb, or 5 mg/lb body weight to
determine the pharmacologic and toxicologic effects of ceftiofur
following the intramuscular injection.<p>

<b>(c)  General Design</b><p><ul>
<li><b>Purpose</b> of this study was to determine the pharmacologic and
toxicologic effects of ceftiofur following the intramuscular
injection in the bovine.  Potential target organs and tissues were
to be identified through clinical observations, histologic
examination, hematology and serum chemistries.  Red blood cell
counts, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, serum creatinine and blood
urea nitrogen values were also parameters of interest.  Finally,
injection site irritation was evaluated by use of histopathology
and serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK).<p>
<li><b>Animals</b><p>
               
- Crossbred beef type steers<br>
- body weight range 370 to 450 lb<br>
- 20 animals for four treatment groups.<p>
<li><b>Control</b> was a non-drug containing sterile diluent administered
intramuscularly daily at 5 ml/100 lb body weight.<p>
<li><b>Dosage Form:</b> Sterile aqueous solution containing 100 mg drug/ml.<p>
<li><b>Dosage Used:</b><p> 0, 1, 3 or 5 mg/lb body (e.g., 1, 3, or 5 ml sterile
solution containing 100 mg/ml per 100 lbs.  Controls received 5 ml
per 100 lb body weight.<p>
<li><b>Route of Administration: </b>Intramuscular<p>
<li><b>Test Duration: </b>7 days<p>
<li><b>Pertinent Parameters Measured:</b><p>
                                   
Clinical observations, hematologic and serum chemistry
measurements, body weight changes, organ weights and gross and
microscopic evaluations were used to assess the potential toxicity
in the steers.<p></ul>


<b>(d) Results</b><p><ul>
<li><b>Clinical Observations:</b><p>  No clinical signs of toxicity or illness
were observed during this study.  Occasionally a steer would react
to the injection of the compound by vocalizing and/or exhibiting a
limp on the injected rear leg for the first few strides out of the
squeeze-chute.  The limp was always transient and was no longer
noticeable by the time the steer returned to its pen.<p>

<li><b>Hematology:</b><p> Statistical analysis of the data identified a slight
but significant decrease in hematocrit (HCT) and hemoglobin (HGB)
values when the high dose animals were compared to controls. 
However, the pretest hematology data contained a comparable
statistically significant difference in hematocrit values between
the control and high dose group.  It should also be noted that the
hematocrit and hemoglobin values decreased similarly in all
groups, including the untreated controls, over the duration of the
study.  All mean hematologic values were within the normal
biologic range for the bovine, and since there was no significant
decrease in red blood cell numbers, the hematologic differences
noted were not attributed to treatment.<p>

<li><b>Serum Chemistries:</b><p> Significantly elevated CPK values (P &#190; .05)
were observed in the high dose animals when compared to the
controls.  The CPK values also increased in the 3 mg/lb group but
were not statistically different from the control value.  In
contrast, the untreated control and 1 mg/lb group CPK values were
similar.  The elevated CPK values correlated with the muscle
damage at the injection site which was observed
histopathologically.<p>
There were no other treatment related differences between treated
and controls regarding clinical chemistry measurements.<p>
<li><b>Body Weights:</b><p> The five day treatment regimen with U-64,279 had no
significant effect on body weight in any of the groups.<p>
<li><b>Organ Weights:</b><p> There were no significant differences between
control and any of the dose groups for any of the five organs
weighed.<p>
<li><b>Gross and Histologic Observations:</b><p>
The only gross change associated with the use of this drug was the
focal areas of hemorrhage and/or muscle discoloration at the
injection sites.  Occasional, focal lung lesions were observed,
but the incidence was uniformly distributed among the treatment
groups.<p>
Drug related histopathologic changes were confined to the skeletal
muscle at the injection sites.  There appeared to be greater
muscle fiber degeneration and localized inflammation at the
highest dose.  Localized edema, hemorrhage, mononuclear
inflammatory cell infiltration and myofibril degeneration and
mineralization were observed at the injection sites, leading to
the morphologic diagnosis of mild to severe subacute necrotizing
myositis.  However, this study was not designed to correlate
sequential histopathologic changes in the intramuscular injection
sites with time.<p>
Two steers in the 10X group had evidence of a mild abomasitis. 
One lesion was composed of a mild infiltrate of eosinophils,
plasma cells and lymphocytes and may have been a response to a
parasite or a piece of plant material that might have become
lodged in that area of the abomasum.  The other lesion was a focal
lymphoid reaction that was probably triggered by a local
irritation.  The findings of abomasitis appeared to be unrelated
tissue changes with no evidence of being an effect of treatment.<p>
Other histopathologic findings were seen with similar frequencies
in all dose groups and were not attributable to treatment.<p></ul>

The hypothesis of no treatment effect associated with the
measurements of most interest, RBC count, Hgb, PCV, BUN and serum
creatinine, was tested at the .10 level of significance.  Planned
contrasts of dose groups with control were one-sided tests at the
.10 level of significance, since only increases in BUN and serum
creatinine and decreases in RBC count, Hgb, and PCV were of
concern.  The hypothesis of no treatment effect associated with
the remainder of the variables was tested at the .05 level. 
Planned contrasts of dose groups with control were two-sided at
the .05 level.<p>
Organ weights were also analyzed using least squares analysis of
variance.<p>
The histopathologic data were analyzed using Fisher's Exact test
at the .10 level of significance.<p>
<b>(f) Conclusions</b><p>
No systemic drug related effects were detected following
intramuscular administration of aqueous U-64,279 at dosages of 1,
3 and 5 mg/lb of body weight for five days, as was evidenced by
the various parameters that were monitored during this study.<p>
Gross and microscopic tissue changes were confined to localized
areas of muscle damage at the injection site.  This lesion was
most pronounced at the highest dose tested (5 mg/lb) which
correlated well with the only significantly elevated (P &#190; .05) CPK
value.<p>
<b>2. Five Day Tolerance Study In Feeder Calves</b><p>
<b>(a) Type of Study</b><p>
This was a five day tolerance study in feeder calves.  Formulated

<b>(c) General Design</b><p><ul>
Purpose of this tolerance study was to determine the pharmacotoxic
effects of formulated freeze dried ceftiofur following
intramuscular injection at an exaggerated daily dosage of 50X the
highest labeled dose (0.5 mg/lb body weight) for five consecutive
days.<p>
<li><b>Animals</b><p>
- crossbred beef type animals (steers)<br>
- starting weight ranged from 182-316 kg and age ranged from 6-10 months<br> 
- eight animals total, four used as controls and four given 50X drug treatment.<p>

<li><b>Control</b> was bacteriostatic water for injection (vehicle used as
diluent for making sterile solution from the ceftiofur sterile
powder) 50 ml per 100 lb body weight.<p>
<li><b>Control and Treatment</b> each administered intramuscularly.<p>
<li><b>Dose</b> of 25 mg/lb body weight given in a 50 mg/ml formulation or 50
ml per 100 lb body weight.<p>
<li><b>Test period</b> was 15 days, first five as daily treatments of either
25 mg/lb or vehicle.<p>
<li><b>Pertinent Parameters Measured:</b><p>
Toxicological evaluation was predicated on clinical signs
including body weight changes, six hematological and 17 clinical
chemistry measurements, and gross pathologic observations.  Tests
of statistical significance were made at the P &lt; 0.05 level.<p></ul>


<b>(d) Results</b><p>
All of the calves survived.  Formulated ceftiofur did not cause
any overt signs of toxicity during the five day dosing period or
during the 10 day post treatment observation interval.  The only
changes were the significant elevations in aspartate transaminase
(AST) and in creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) in both vehicle and
drug treated animals on study day five relative to pretreatment
baseline values.  These AST and CPK values returned to baseline by
day 15 of the study.  These transient elevations depict local
muscle irritation associated with the formulated drug and the
vehicle <i>per se </i>.<p>
<b>(e) Statistical Analyses</b><p>
The hematologic and clinical chemistry parameters were analyzed by  
the BMDP repeated measure routine to test the hypothesis that
there is no difference between the means of dose groups.  The
adjustments were made for the initial values of the parameters
(covariate).  Tests of statistical significance were made at the
0.05 level.<p>
A time by time t-test supported general findings of the repeated
measures analysis.<p>
<b>(f) Conclusions</b><p>
In conclusion, formulated ceftiofur diluted in Bacteriostatic
Water for Injection, USP with Benzyl Alcohol 0.945&#37; w/v was well
tolerated in feeder calves at 50 times the highest recommended
dosage of 1.0 mg/lb/day (25 mg/lb/day) for 5 consecutive days. 
Results showed that formulated ceftiofur administered
intramuscularly had no systemic toxic effects.  Local effects of
muscle irritation were detected after the last dose (five
consecutive daily doses) as evidenced by significant elevated AST
and CPK values.  However, these transient elevated values returned
to baseline values 9 days post treatment.<p>

<b>3. 15 Day Intramuscular Safety/Toxicity Study</b><p>
<b>(a) Description</b><p>
In this study cattle were administered formulated ceftiofur at
daily doses up to 20X the highest proposed doses for 15 days,
which is 3X the longest proposed duration of use.  Toxicological
assessment was based on clinical signs, hematological and clinical
chemistry measurements, urinalysis measurements and gross and
microscopic evaluations.  The study included 5 M and 5
F, each at daily doses 0, 1, 3, 5 or 10 mg/lb body weight.<p>

reconstituted with Bacteriostatic Water for injection, USD to make
the resulting solution.<p>
<li><b>Dose Used: </b><p>Daily doses of 1, 3, 5 or 10 mg drug/lb body weight was
given intramuscularly using a sterile solution which contained 50
mg/drug/ml.  Controls were administered 30 ml vehicle per head/day
(based on volume the mg/lb treatment group would receive).<p>
<li><b>Route: </b><p>Intramuscular injection (no injection site was injected with
more than 10 ml; when &gt;10 ml was indicated multiple sites of the
same anatomical area were used).<p>
<li><b>Test Duration: </b>15 days; animals were sacrificed on day 16 and
necropsied.<p>
<li><b>Pertinent Parameters Measured:</b><p>
Toxicological evaluation was based on clinical signs including body
weight changes, hematological and clinical chemistry measurements,
urinalysis measurements and gross and microscopic evaluation.  All
tests of statistical significance were made at the P &lt; 0.05 level.<p></ul>


<b>(d) Results</b><p>
There were no systemic effects attributable to formulated ceftiofur
sodium based on clinical signs, hematological, clinical chemistry
and urinalysis parameters and on gross and microscopic
determinations.<p>
Local effects of muscle irritation were evidenced by
histopathologic evaluation.  Lesions were microscopic in size and
difficult to find even with the aid of injection site markers.<p>

<b>(e) Statistical Evaluation</b><p>
Data for each sex were analyzed separately.  The body weight was
analyzed by BMDP repeated measures routine to test the following
null hypothesis:  (i) there is no difference between the means of
dose groups, (ii) the dose groups behave the same over time.  The
organ weight, ratio organ weight to body weight, blood chemistry
and hematology variables were analyzed by one way analysis of
variance.  Whenever the analysis indicated a dose difference, a
Dunnett's t test was used to compare each active group to the
control group.  All tests of statistical significance were made at
P&lt;0.05 level.<p>
<b>(f) Conclusions</b><p>
Formulated ceftiofur is safe when injected intramuscularly into
cattle.  The formulation is deemed to be a slight muscle irritant.<p>

contains methods for the analysis of unadjusted proportions as well
as the life table related techniques of Tarone (1975), Cox (1972)

For the unadjusted analysis, an exact test for trend was used to
test for an increase (or decrease) in lesion incidence as the
dosage administered increased.  Additionally, Fisher's exact test
was used to compare the proportion exhibiting a particular lesion
in each treated group to the proportion exhibiting that same lesion
in the vehicle control group.  Both tests were two-tailed, using
the P value obtained by doubling the one-tailed probability.<p>
Similarly, for the adjusted analysis, tests for trend and treatment
groups to vehicle control group comparisons were conducted on the
time adjusted proportions.  <p>
<li>Conclusions<p> Ceftiofur sodium, administered orally to rats for 30
days, was markedly toxic at 6,000 mg/kg, moderately toxic at 3,000
mg/kg and minimally toxic at 1,500 mg/kg. The target organ was the
gastrointestinal tract as evidenced by the clinical signs of
diarrhea, distended abdomen, and hardened stomach contents, and
grossly by the formation of stomach concretions of the drug food
mixture at 3,000 mg/kg or greater.</ul><p>

<Li>Species and Strain  -  Sprague Dawley Rats<p>
<Li>Number Animals Per Sex Per Treatment Group  -  20 M and 20 F<p>
<Li>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing  -  0, 30, 100, 300,
1,000 and 3,000 mg/kg body weight for 90 or 91 days.  <p>
<Li>Route of Drug Administration  -  Oral intragastric intubation <p>
<Li>Parameters Tested<p> Parameters utilized to assess toxicity included
clinical signs, weekly body weight and food consumption, body
weight gains, hematologic, clinical chemistry and urinalysis
measurements, selected organ weights, and gross and microscopic
evaluation.  Tests of statistical significance on the parameters
denoting toxicity per sex per group were made at the .05 level.<p>

<Li>Significant Toxicity Observed<p> The target organ was the
gastrointestinal tract as evidenced by the clinical signs of
diarrhea and hardened stomach contents and grossly by a dose-related 
increase in stomach content weights at 300 mg/kg/day or
greater.  In males and females at 3,000 mg/kg/day, the incidence of
diarrhea was -5 to 83&#37; and the incidence of hardened stomach
contents was 86 to 100&#37;. At 1,000 mg/kg/day diarrhea occurred at an
incidence of 6 to 42&#37; in males and females and there was a 5&#37;
  incidence of hardened stomach contents for the males. Only
transient diarrhea (incidence of 5 to 11&#37;) occurred in males at
300 mg/kg/day and in females at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day.  This
transient diarrhea did not occur in females at 300 mg/kg/day.<p>

At 3,000 mg/kg/day there was formation of gastric concretions of
the drug food mixture at an incidence of 83&#37;.  These concretions in
the stomach could not pass through the pylorus ("mechanical
toxicity"), which led to poor or impaired nutritional status and
secondary effects of suppressed body weight gain (-36&#37;) in the males
only, gastric erosions and/or ulcers, thickening of the gastric
ridge (males only), and death of 10 percent (4/40) of the rats
after 9 to 91 days of treatment.  The impaired or poor
nutritional condition at 3,000 mg/kg/day was also associated with
decreased serum glucose values, electrolyte imbalance, sparseness
of fat deposition in the abdominal cavity, and, microscopically, by
the lack of hepatocellular glycogen deposition and atrophy of the
germinal centers of the spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus.  The
impaired nutrition and lowered glucose values at 3,000 mg/kg/day,
along with a significant increase in food consumption and
significant changes in urinary ketones (increase) and pH
(decrease) at both 1,000 and 3,000 mg/kg/day, suggest a
deficiency in carbohydrate metabolism at 1,000 and 3,000 mg/kg/day. 
In addition, the lowered urinary pH at 100 mg/kg/day or greater
probably reflected the excretion of the compound or its
metabolites, including furic acid.  Hence, the lowered pH at 100
mg/kg/day, without any other significant changes, suggested that
the compound was being metabolized and excreted as acidic
metabolites.<p>

Additionally, based on microscopic findings, the compound caused
colitis at an incidence of 25&#37; for males at 1,000 mg/kg/day or
greater and in females at an incidence of 10&#37;, 30&#37; and 15&#37; at 300,
1,000 and 3,000 mg/kg/day, respectively.  Also, cecitis and/or
ileitis occurred at an incidence of 10&#37; (females) to 20&#37; (males)
at 3,000 mg/kg/day.  Colitis, cecitis, and ileitis were probably
associated with the changes in bacterial flora in the gut produced
by the antibiotic properties of ceftiofur sodium.  Males at 300
mg/kg/day or greater had an inflammatory response (mononuclear
cells) located in the renal corticomedullary junction.  This change
may have been related to the compound favoring the formation of a
possible enterotoxin in the gut of these animals.  The acid urine
(lowered pH) associated with the metabolism of ceftiofur apparently
resulted in a significant increase in nephrocalcinosis for females
only given ceftiofur sodium at 3,000 mg/kg/day.<p>

Statistical Method  -   Data for each sex were analyzed separately. 
Treatment group differences were analyzed using analysis of

significant variables, treatment groups were compared to the
vehicle control using the Least Significant Difference method.

The computer program of Thomas, Breslow and Gart (1977) was used to
analyze the data.  This program contains methods for the analysis
of unadjusted proportions as well as the life table related
techniques of Tarone (1975), Cox (1972), and Breslow (1970) for
analysis of lesion incidence.<p>
For the unadjusted analysis, an exact test for trend was used to

Similarly, for the adjusted analysis, tests for trend and treatment
groups to vehicle control group comparisons were conducted on the
time adjusted proportions.<p>
<Li>Conclusions<p> Based on the results, the NOEL was 30 mg ceftiofur
sodium per kg of body weight for 90 days.  Also, the results
indicated that ceftiofur administered orally to the rats for 90
days was markedly toxic at 3,000 mg/kg/day, moderately toxic at
1,000 mg/kg/day and minimally toxic at 300 mg/kg/day.</ul><p>

breeding stage.<p>
<Li>Route of Drug Administration  -  via gavage<p>
<Li>Parameters Tested<p> Males (4-47 days of age) were dosed daily
via gavage for 70 days and females (5-59 days of age) were
dosed daily via gavage for 14 days prior to the cohabitation of F0
breeding pairs (1 male and 1 female per cage); daily dosing of
males and females was continued throughout the study.  Females were
singly housed on the day sperm were found in the vaginal lavage or
at the end of the 21 day cohabitation period. On the day a litter
was cast (pnd 0), the following reproductive parameters were
recorded:  (1) day of delivery and length of gestation for each
dam, (2) the number of live or dead pups in each litter, and (3)
the sex and clinical condition of each live pup. The body weight of
each live pup was recorded on pnd 0, 4, and 21.  On pnd 4, live
litters were randomly culled to a maximum size of 10 pups per
litter. Postnatal viability of Fl pups was evaluated on pnd 0,
during the perinatal period (days 0-4) and during the remainder of
lactation (days 4-21).  On pnd 21 (day of weaning), 30 male
and 30 female pups per group were randomly selected, orally dosed
at the prescribed levels and designated for subsequent use of F1
breeders. All remaining F1 pups were sacrificed and necropsied and
observations were recorded.  Following weaning of F1 litters, F0
rats were sacrificed (79th day of exposure for females; 136th day
of exposure for males); each F0 rat was evaluated at necropsy and
reproductive organs, gross lesions and/or masses from the control
and high dose groups were evaluated histopathologically.  In
addition, histopathologic evaluation was performed on reproductive
organs, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, adrenal or gross lesions
and/or masses of animals that died or were moribund during the
course of the study.<p>
<Li>Significant Toxicity Observed<p> Body weight gain (g) for males
was significantly suppressed in a dose-related manner throughout
the study (weeks 0-2, 2-6, 6-10, 10-14, 14-18 and 
18-necropsy). The effect of ceftiofur upon male body
weight gain varied in severity during different phases of the
study, suggesting a possible interaction of treatment with length
of exposure and/or growth rate during development.  Weight gain
during the first 2 weeks of exposure was suppressed in the mid
and high dose groups.  All ceftiofur treated groups were below
controls for body weight gain (g) and percent body weight gain for
the treatment period as a whole (weeks 0-necropsy).  Thus,
potential effects of ceftiofur on male reproductive capacity were
evaluated within a dose range which produced a statistically
significant suppression in male body weight gain.<p>
Female body weight gain was not affected during the first two weeks
of exposure to ceftiofur (i.e., prior to cohabitation). For
confirmed mated females with litters, body weight gain was
significantly suppressed for all ceftiofur exposed groups during
gestational days (gd) 16-20, and weight gain during gestation
(days 0-20) was significantly suppressed at the high dose. 
Body weight gain for females with litters was significantly
increased during the first 2 weeks of lactation at the mid and
high doses, but was not affected during the third and final week of
lactation or for the lactation period as a whole.  Thus, female
body weight gain was not affected prior to breeding, but dose
related changes in body weight gain were observed during gestation
and lactation.<p>
No dose-dependent adverse effects on fertility or reproductive
performance were associated with exposure to ceftiofur.  Ceftiofur
treated groups were similar to controls for the following
endpoints:  (1) the proportion of cohabited females with confirmed
mating, (2) the proportion of mated females with confirmed
pregnancies, (3) the proportion of confirmed pregnancies producing
live litters, (4) the length of gestation in confirmed pregnant
females, (5) the number of live pups per litter on pnd 0, 4 or 21,
and (6) the proportion of live male pups on pnd 0 or 4.  Postnatal
viability of pups in ceftiofur treated groups was equivalent to
controls on pnd 0, and for pnd 4 to 21.  During the perinatal
period (pnd 0 to 4), 100&#37; of pups in the high dose group survived,
thus contributing to a statistically significant trend toward
increased survival; this statistical effect appears to lack
biological relevance since survival in all groups was high (avg. &#37;
viable pups per litter ranging from 97.57-100&#37;), and since the
relevant statistical tests are not optimized when zero variance is
observed in any dose group.  Live pup body weight per litter was
not affected by ceftiofur exposure on pnd 0 or 4; on pnd 21,
the low dose group exhibited a significant suppression in body
weight relative to the control group (-7.3&#37;), but the absence of an
effect at higher exposure levels suggests that this was not a
treatment related effect.<p>
Grossly, enlargement of the cecum occurred at an incidence of 59 to
97&#37; in the treated groups compared to 0&#37; in the control.  In
survivors, no compound related microscopic lesions were observed in
the reproductive organs of either sex at the high dose (1000
mg/kg/day) compared to the controls.  Moreover, there were no
compound related changes in the reproductive organs, heart, lungs,
spleen, kidneys or adrenal of animals that died during the course
of the study.  Documented histopathological findings were
considered to be secondary to gavage accidents, unspecified
etiologies or background lesions common to rats of this strain and
age.<p>
<Li>No Observed Effect Level - 1000 mg/kg for reproductive performance.<p>
<Li>Statistical Analysis <p>Endpoints were statistically evaluated using
SAS&#174; software.  ANOVA including linear trend analysis and Dunnett's
tests for comparison of treatments with controls was used for most

<Li>Conclusions<p> Daily oral administration of ceftiofur sodium at
dosages of 0, 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day in Sprague Dawley rats
failed to produce any adverse effects upon fertility or
reproductive performance, or any histopathological alterations in
the reproductive organs of either sex in the F0 generation.  Hence,
the no observable effect level (NOEL) for reproductive performance
and fertility of the F0 generation in rats was 1000 mg ceftiofur
sodium per kg of body weight.</ul><p>

<li>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing<p> 0, 100, 300 or 1,000
mg/kg/day.  Animals (F1) were dosed once daily beginning on the day
of weaning (postnatal 21) and continuing until the day before
scheduled sacrifice (females for an average of 153 days and males
an average of 152 days).  At 12-15 weeks of age the F1 males and
females were cohabited for 21 days.  Resulting F2 pups were
sacrificed at time of weaning (day 21 of age).<p>
<li>Route of Administration  -  via gavage<p>
<li>Variables Tested<p> In this study, F1 males and females from each
respective group were dosed daily via gavage beginning on pnd 21
(weaning) and continuing until the day before scheduled sacrifice.
At 12-15 weeks of age, the F1 males and females were cohabited
in nonsibling breeding pairs for a maximum of 21 days.  On the day
sperm were found in the vaginal lavage or at the end of the 21 day
cohabitation period, females were singly housed and checked at
least twice daily thereafter for the presence of pups in the cage.
On the day a litter was found (pnd 0), the following reproductive
parameters were recorded:  (1) day of delivery and length of
gestation for each dam, (2) the number of live and dead pups in
each litter, and (3) the sex and clinical condition of each live
pup. The number of live pups of each sex and the average pup body
weight for live pups of each sex per litter were recorded on pnd 0,
4, and 21.  On pnd 4, live litters were randomly culled to a
maximum size of ten pups per litter.  Postnatal viability of F2
pups was evaluated on pnd 0, during the perinatal period (days 0
to 0) and during the remainder of lactation (days 4-21). 
On pnd 21 (day of weaning), all F2 pups were sacrificed,
necropsied, and observations were recorded.  Following sacrifice of
F2 litters, F1 adult animals were sacrificed (146th-160th day of
exposure for females; 145th-159th day of exposure for males).
Each F1 animal was evaluated at scheduled sacrifice and the
gastrointestinal tract, gross lesions and masses from all dose
groups were evaluated histopathologically.  The reproductive organs
of both sexes were evaluated histopathologically for all control
and high dose animals.  In the absence of any compound related
changes in the reproductive organs at the high dose relative to the
controls, comparable tissues from the low and mid dose groups were
not microscopically examined, as per study protocol.  For animals
that died or were moribund during the course of the study
histopathologic evaluation was performed on reproductive organs,
heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, adrenal, or gross lesions and
masses.<p>
<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<p> Except for mechanical effects due to
dosing, clinical signs were not related to treatment.  Males and
females in all ceftiofur sodium groups had an increased tendency to
struggle during dosing.  Thirty three (33) rats (18 males and 15
females) died or were moribund over the course of the study.  When
these data from males and females were combined, the incidence of
dead or moribund animals increased in a dose-related manner (0/60,
1/60, 11/60, and 21/60 at 0, 100, 300, and 1,000 mg/kg/day,
respectively).  Ninety-four percent (17/18) of these occurrences in
males and 87&#37; (13/15) in females were associated with evidence of
accidental causes.  For the remaining three (3) (e.g., one male at
1,000 mg/kg/day, one female at 300 mg/kg/day, and one female at
1,000 mg/kg/day), the cause of death could not be determined.<p>
The potential effects of ceftiofur sodium on F1 male reproductive
capacity were evaluated within a dose range which produced a
statistically significant increase in male body weight gain
(weaning necropsy) at the low and mid doses, but did not affect
weight gain at the high dose.  Body weight gain for females was not
affected during the first twelve weeks of exposure to ceftiofur
sodium (i.e., prior to cohabitation) or during gestation, but was
significantly increased at the high dose throughout lactation.<p>
Fertility and reproductive performance of the F1 generation and
development of F2 litters through weaning (pnd 21) were not
adversely affected by daily ceftiofur sodium exposure.  Nor were
there any treatment related gross lesions observed in the F2 pups
at scheduled sacrifice. Thus, ceftiofur sodium had no adverse
effects on fertility and reproductive performance of the F1 adults
or the resulting F2 pups.<p>
Evaluation of F2 animals at scheduled sacrifice revealed an
increased incidence of enlargement of the cecum at 300 and 1,000
mg/kg/day, but not at 100 mg/kg/day when compared to the controls. 
In addition, males in the 300 and 1,000 mg/kg/day groups and
females in all ceftiofur sodium dose groups exhibited increased
weight of the gastrointestinal tract (i.e., with or without stomach
contents) relative to the vehicle control group.  At 300 and 1,000
mg/kg/day, there was a greater incidence of degenerative changes in
the non glandular stomach (six and 92&#37;, respectively) and
hypersecretion of mucus in the neck cells of the glandular stomach
(12 and 79&#37;, respectively) as compared to the control and 100
mg/kg/day groups.<p>
For F1 animals which survived to scheduled sacrifice, no compound
related microscopic findings were observed in the reproductive
organs of either sex at the high dose (1,000 mg/kg/day) compared to
the vehicle controls.  Microscopic changes in the reproductive
organs, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, or adrenal of animals that
died or were moribund during the course of the study were not
compound related.<p>

<li>Conclusions <p>Daily oral administration of ceftiofur sodium at
dosages of 0, 100, 300, or 1,000 mg/kg/day to Sprague Dawley rats
produced gross enlargement of the cecum and microscopic changes in
the stomach at 300 and 1,000 mg/kg/day as compared to the controls. 
These effects were not observed at 100 mg/kg/day.  Ceftiofur sodium
failed to produce any adverse effects upon fertility or
reproductive performance of the F1 generation.<p>
Likewise, no adverse effects were observed with regard to the
growth and viability of F2 litters through weaning (pnd 21). 
Hence, the no observable effect level (NOEL) for reproductive
performance and fertility of the F1 generation in rats was 1,000 mg
ceftiofur sodium per kg of body weight.</ul><p>

<li>Study Director  -  T. A. Marks<p>
<li>Location of Study  -  The Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo MI <p>
<li>Identification of Substance and Dosage Form  -  ceftiofur sodium
powder formulated with sterile filtered deionized water to form a
solution.<p>
<li>Species and Strain  -  Sprague Dawley Rats<p>
<li>Number Animals Per Sex Per Treatment Group  -  24 bred rats per group <p>
<li>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing  -  0, 800, 1,600 and 3,200
mg/kg/day on days 6-15 of gestation <p>
<li>Route of Drug Administration  -  Oral by gastric intubation<p>
<li>Parameters Tested<p> All dams were weighed on the day of insemination
(day 0 of gestation), throughout the dosing period, and on day
20, the day cesarean sections were performed.  Sex, weight, number
and location of each dead and reabsorbed fetus.  Live fetuses were
evaluated for gross, visceral and skeletal anomalies.<p>
<li>Significant Toxicity Observed  <p>  Ceftiofur administration led to dose-related 
maternal toxicity (soft stools, porphyrin staining of the
eye and nares) especially in the high dose group (diarrhea, blood
in stools).  However, in spite of administration at such high
dosages, this cephalosporin did not appear to adversely affect the
reproductive capacity of the dams.  Although there was a
statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01) decrease in the proportion of
dams in the high dose group that conceived, the fact that the drug
was not given until day 6 of gestation, as well as the lack of
significant effects on early embryo development (early implant
sites and resorption), suggested that this effect occurred by
chance.<p>
The only statistically significant adverse effect on the embryos
was a dose-related decrease in mean fetal body weights.  However,
the actual decreases did not exceed 7&#37; and no other indication
of toxicity toward the offspring was found.  Thus, it was concluded
that ceftiofur was not embryotoxic.  Since there were no
biologically significant increases in the incidence of variations
or malformations, it was also concluded that this drug was not
teratogenic to the rat.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level  -  3,200 mg/kg body weight for teratogenic
effects.<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis<p> Several different procedures were used,
depending on the end point, ranging from non parametric procedures
to Analysis of Variance with LSD Method for pair wise comparisons.<p>
<li>Conclusions  -  Ceftiofur sodium is not teratogenic in the rat at
doses up to and including 3,200 mg/kg body weight.</ul><p>

<li>Parameters Tested<p> Dogs were evaluated prior to study initiation by
physical examination.  During the study, food consumption data were
collected 7 days per week and clinical observations were made
daily; body weights were documented on a weekly basis.  Blood chemistry
and urinalysis data were collected prior to study initiation, during
week 6, and before study termination; ophthalmologic examinations
were done prior to study initiation and at termination of the study. 
Hematology data were collected from all dogs prior to study initiation
and 6 times during the study (including termination) at approximately
2-week intervals.  Coombs' tests were performed in blood from all
dogs given 300 mg/kg/day and 3 dogs per sex given vehicle only at
day 41; at day 83 blood from all dogs was tested.  Examinations of blood
smears and differential leukocyte counts were done for all dogs prior
to study initiation, at the 6-week bleeding, and at the last
bleeding; smears were analyzed from every bleeding for dogs which
became anemic and/or Coomb's test positive.  A complete necropsy was
done on all dogs; selected organs were weighed and protocol tissues
were fixed in formalin, processed, and evaluated histopathologically.<p>
<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<p> Administration of 100 mg/kg/day or more
of ceftiofur was associated with a non-progressive thrombocytopenia 
in at least 4 dogs.  Multiple dogs treated with 300 mg/kg/day
became positive for the Coombs' test indicating the presence of
immunoglobulin on the surface of erythrocytes.  Two dogs treated at
this level became severely anemic and there was no apparent
regenerative response by bone marrow until administration of
compound ceased (one dog).  Major clinical signs were associated
with anemia and included pale mucous membranes and depression.<p>
Necropsy observations and major histopathologic findings were
related to the process of anemia.  A minor inflammatory lesion was
noted in the pelvis of kidneys from dogs given 100 mg/kg/day or
more of compound; its significance is unknown.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level - 30 mg/kg<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis<p> Body weights, food consumption, organ
weights, hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, and his-

plus control (positive and negative)<p>
<li>Route of Drug Administration -  Not Applicable - <i>in vitro</i>&#160; Test <p>
<li>Parameters  Tested<p> The mammalian cell mutagenesis assay is an 
accepted <i>in vitro</i>&#160; short term testing procedure for detecting
potential mutagens and carcinogens.  This assay uses V79 (Chinese
hamster) cells and measures the production of mutants resistant to
6-thioguanine (TG) as a result of exposure to the test compound. 
Mutant cells without HGPRT  activity  cannot  metabolize  TG, and
thus escape its lethal effect.<p>
Some compounds are negative in this assay unless they are
metabolized to reactive forms.  Because the V79 cell is incapable
of such metabolic activation, an exogenous activation system is
required.  The rat liver S9 system is a widely used activation system
for bacterial and mammalian cell mutagenesis.  Thus, ceftiofur was
tested with and without an S9 activation system.<p>
<li>Significant  Toxicity  Observed <p>  There  were  no  significant
differences between the mutation frequencies of cultures treated
with ceftiofur and control cultures.  All the treatment/control
ratios were very close to 1.0, and there was no significant linear
dose response.  Thus, ceftiofur with or without S9 activation, was
not mutagenic in this study.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level -  not applicable<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis<p> The raw data was entered into a computer
program which calculated the mutant frequencies and generated
summary tables and a statistical analysis.  The mutation
frequencies of the cultures were transformed to
(1 + mutants/10e6)raised to 0.15 power).  The mean response at each dose was compared
to the mean control (no treatment) response using the one sided t-test. 
 The mean square error from a two way analysis of variance
(AOV) was used for a variance estimate.  In addition, a one sided
t-test was used to test for an increasing linear relationship
between log dose and the transformed response.  The mean square
error from a covariance model with assays as the grouping variable
was used for the variance estimate.  To increase the sensitivity of
the latter test, the control vehicle responses were incorporated
into the analysis by assigning them dose values equal to R times
the smallest dose where R is the ratio of two successive doses.<p>
The alpha levels of the statistical tests were adjusted so that the
experimental alpha level was not greater than .1.  Thus, the alpha
levels were set at .025 for the four-dose assays.<p>
<li>Conclusions - Ceftiofur was not mutagenic in this study.</ul><p>

<li>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing -  0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1
mg ceftiofur/ml with a solvent control and UV light as a positive
control.<p>
<li>Parameters Tested<p> Genotoxins are agents that can damage DNA or
alter chromosome structure and with very few exceptions are
generally mutagenic or carcinogenic.  As a class of compounds,
genotoxins have wide structural diversity.  Some are active <i>per se</i>&#160;
but most require metabolic activation before they are capable of
exerting  their biological effects.  Not all types of DNA damage
lead to mutagenic or carcinogenic endpoints.  Some types of DNA
damage are repaired by the cellular repair system before the
deleterious consequences are manifest.  DNA repair, therefore,
implies DNA damage and as such can be used as an endpoint for
assaying genotoxic action.  Cells vary greatly in their ability to
repair genotoxic lesions and depending on the type of lesion formed
can be repaired in a variety of ways.  A brief description of DNA
excision repair serves to illustrate the repair process.  Briefly,
a genotoxic lesion is recognized and excised from the DNA strand by
repair endonucleases, along with several nucleotides on either side
of the lesion.  The resulting gap is patched with nucleotides,
using the opposite strand as a template.  This repair is known as
unscheduled DNA synthesis or UDS and can be measured by a variety
of methods.  The most common method used to monitor unscheduled DNA
synthesis is by observing increased incorporation of [3H] thymidine
into the repair patches by autoradiography.<p>
Primary rat hepatocytes have three characteristics that make them
useful for detecting UDS.  First, hepatocytes are nondividing,
therefore, a UDS response is not confused with cells undergoing
semi-conservative replication (scheduled DNA synthesis).  Second,
hepatocytes have good capabilities for metabolic activation of
genotoxins.  Third, hepatocytes have excellent DNA repair
capabilities.<p>
For this test an increased frequency of nuclear grains indicates
DNA repair and implies that the agent responsible for the increase
may be carcinogenic and mutagenic.<p>
<li>Significant Toxicity Observed: UV light (1.5 joules/sq m) was used as
a positive control and resulted in a 4-fold increase of nuclear
grains as compared to controls.<p>
Ceftiofur did not cause a dose-related increase of UDS nor did it
cause a doubling of UDS relative to untreated control cultures that
received equivalent volumes of vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide).<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level - Not applicable<p>
<li>Conclusions - Under the conditions employed for this study,
ceftiofur did not act as a DNA damaging agent.</ul><p>

<li>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing<p> Ceftiofur at 250, 500
and 1,000 mg/kg body weight given in two equal doses 24h apart
intraperitoneal (ip), water controls and cyclophosphamide as a
positive control at 1 ml/kg.<p>
<li>Route of Administration -  intraperitoneal<p>
<li>Parameters Tested<p> The micronucleus test is an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; procedure
used for the detection of compounds that cause chromosome damage or
nondisjunction of chromosomes (as induced by spindle poisons).<p>
Micronuclei are chromosome fragments (as a result of clastogenic
events) or whole chromosomes (a result of nondisjunctional events)
that are left behind after expulsion of the nucleus during
maturation of erythroblast to erythrocytes in the bone marrow of
mammals.  For this test an increased frequency of micronucleated
polychromatophilic erythrocytes indicates chromosome damage,
nondisjunction, or chromosomal deletions from the genome.<p>
At 30 and 48 hours after the first dose (i.e., 6 and 24 hours
after the second dose), the rats were sacrificed by cervical
dislocation.  The long bones of the hind quarters were exposed and
the epiphyseal ends were snipped off to expose the  marrow.  A  20-gauge 
needle, on a 1 ml syringe containing 0.2-0.3 ml fetal calf
serum, was inserted into the marrow cavity while simultaneously
providing aspiration with the syringe plunger.  The marrow plugs of
the long bones of the hind quarters were dispersed in a disposable
test tube, after which the cell suspension was placed on a
microscope slip and spun at maximum speed for ten seconds in a
Perkin Elmer slide spinner.  The slides were air dried overnight at
room temperature.<p>
<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<p> Cyclophosphamide, a mutagen that
requires metabolic activation, was used as a positive control and
significantly increased the incidence of micronucleated PCEs.  None
of the ceftiofur treatment groups exhibited a statistically
significant increase in the rate of micronucleated PCEs over that
of the control group, nor was the test for a positive dose response
relationship statistically significant.  These results indicate
that ceftiofur did not have clastogenic or nondisjunctional effects
on the chromosomes of rat bone marrow cells.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level -  Not applicable<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis <P>  Summary statistics were calculated for each
treatment group.  Each ceftiofur treatment group was compared  with
the vehicle control group using the rank transformation of the one
sided t-test.  The existence of a positive dose response
relationship was tested using the rank transformation of the one
sided t-test for a positive slope.<p>

as a clastogen or chromosomal mutagen.</ul><p>

102 and TA-1537) of <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>&#160; were thawed from frozen
permanent and grown in Oxoid broth No. 2 for 12 hours. The
bacteria (108) were combined with top agar (45&#176; C), and then
the test agent or solvent control (DMSC) was added either with or
without metabolic activation S-9 mix to give a total volume of 2.5
ml.  The molten mixture was then poured onto a petri plate (each
plate results from an independent treatment tube) containing
histidine deficient base agar and was incubated at 37&#176; C for
2 days.  The plates were examined for evidence of toxicity as
shown by a diminished or absent background lawn.  After incubation
the colonies were counted using an automatic colony counter (Artek
Inc.).<p>
<li>Criteria for judging an Ames <i>Salmonella </i>/microsome assay<p>
 The
criteria for judging any <i>in vitro</i>&#160; assay fall into two categories,
namely, those which affect the acceptability of the assay and those
which affect the interpretation of the result of the assay.  The
data presented here relate only to the criteria for the
acceptability of the test as valid.<p>
<li>Criteria for the acceptability of an Ames <i>Salmonella </i>/ microsome
assay <p>   The following conditions define an acceptable Ames
<i>Salmonella </i>/microsome assay -  <ul> <p>
<li>1. Negative control frequencies should fall within the acceptable
range for each strain and the negative control plates should
display normal growth (as shown by the presence of a background
lawn of microcolonies).  The mean spontaneous frequency of
revertants is typically higher in the presence than in the absence
of S-9.  Individual strains outside the acceptable range should be
excluded from data interpretation.<p>
<li>2. Positive control frequencies should fall within the acceptable
ranges or within the expectations established with range finding
experiments if other positive controls are used.  Failure of a
positive control to perform as expected is interpreted to indicate
any of several problems and data for that particular
strain/activation combination should not be the subject of further
interpretation. <p>
Experiments in which the negative controls and positive controls
are acceptable may be further interpreted.</ul><p>  
<li>Criteria for a positive
or negative response in an Ames <i>Salmonella </i>/microsome assay - <p>
The following conditions define a positive response in the Ames
<i>Salmonella </i>/microsome assay - <uL><p>
<li>1. A reproducible dose response, i.e. systematic increase in
revertants per plate as a function of dose or<p>
<li>2. A reproducible elevation of mutant colonies per plate at a
single dose which amount to a tripling of the spontaneous frequency
of revertants in any strain. </ul> <p>
The following conditions will define a negative response in the
Ames test - <ul><p>
<li>1. No evidence of systematic reproducible elevation of mutation
frequencies is observed in any strain/activation group and,<p>
<li>2. No dose level produces a reproducible doubling of the background
frequency of revertants in any strain.</ul><p>
Cases which do not clearly fit into the positive or negative
category, i.e.  between a doubling and a tripling of the background
frequency of revertants, may be judged equivocal.  These cases will
require further testing in other test systems to resolve the
question of potential mutagenicity of the test agent. <p>
<li>Significant Toxicity Observed <p>  At no dose level was an appreciable
increase in colonies per plate observed, while the strain specific
positive controls worked properly in all cases.  The concentrations
used in the study were chosen on the basis of preliminary range-
finding experiments. <p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level -  not applicable.<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis -  none.<p>
<li>Conclusions<p> The Ames <i>Salmonella </i>/microsome assay is a qualitative
assay for mutagenicity and as such has gained considerable standing
(Haworth et al, 1984, Dunkel <i>et al </i>, 1985) in the evaluation of a
variety of agents for mutagenic potential.  The simplicity of
conduct and ease of performance have led to the adoption of its use
by government, industry and academic laboratories as a tool in
investigation of mechanisms, discovering hazardous materials and
regulatory decision making.<p>
The results of the study of 2-furoic acid failed to demonstrate any
tendency to cause mutations in bacteria.  Therefore, 2-furoic acid
is judged to be non-mutagenic under the conditions of this test. 
These results confirm the previously obtained negative results with
furoic acid.</ul><p>

<LI>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing -  1, 3, 10, 30,
100, 300 and 1,000 ug/ml plus two positive controls (DMN and 2AAF)
and a negative (solvent) control<p>
<LI>Route of Administration -  not applicable<p>
<LI>Parameters Tested<P> This DNA repair assay, as developed by G. M.
Williams measures unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in primary
cultures of rat hepatocytes treated with the test compound <i>in
vitro </i>.  This assay is useful as a genotoxicity screen because it
measures the repair of DNA damage induced by many classes of
mutagens and carcinogens.  Genotoxic compounds or their metabolites
react with DNA to form adducts which are repaired by an enzymatic
process in which the adduct is excised, and the DNA strand is
polymerized and ligated.  This process, referred to as unscheduled
DNA synthesis, can be quantitated by measuring the incorporation of
labeled thymidine into the nuclear DNA of cells not in S phase. 
Thus, compounds that induce repairable DNA damage without
inhibiting that repair can be detected by measuring UDS.<p>
Primary hepatocytes are particularly useful for this assay because
of their high capacity to metabolize procarcinogens to a genotoxic
form.  In addition, the cultures are essentially non dividing, so
that normal replicative DNA synthesis is too low to interfere with
UDS detection.<p>
A test compound is considered a positive if the UDS net grain count
of any tested concentration is &gt; = 5 NG in both the preliminary
and replicate assays and if the percentage of cells in repaid (&#37;
IR) is &gt; = 10.  The results are considered as either inconclusive
or a potentially weak positive response if the highest UDS net
grain count for any tested concentration is between 0 and 5 NG. 
The results are considered negative if all tested concentrations of
the test article have a UDS net grain count of &lt; = 0 NG, and if
testing was performed to the limits of solubility or cytotoxicity,
or at 3.0 mg/ml.<p>
<LI>Significant Toxicity Observed<P> Cytotoxicity was observed at 1,000
&#181;g/ml.  The net grain counts were negative for each concentration
of furoic acid, and for the negative controls.  There  was  no 
significant  difference  in  net  grain  counts between furoic acid
and the negative controls.  DMN and 2-AAF each induced a strong
positive response.<p>
<LI>No Observed Effect Level -  Not applicable<p>
<LI>Statistical Analysis -  The mean and cell-to-cell standard deviation
(SD) for the nuclear, cytoplasmic and net grain counts were
calculated for each slide.  The NG mean, slide-to-slide standard
error (SE), and frequency distribution were calculated for each
dose.<p>
<LI>Conclusions<p> Furoic acid did not induce a significant increase in
UDS over the negative controls.  Therefore, furoic acid was not a
genotoxic agent under the conditions of this <i>in vitro</i>&#160; rat
hepatocyte DNA repair assay.</ul><p>

<LI>Route of Administration -  <i>in vitro</i>&#160; test not applicable <p>
<LI>Parameters Tested<P> The V79/11GPRT Mammalian Cell Mutation Assay is
one component of a battery of tests used at The Upjohn Company to
evaluate chemicals for their ability to cause genotoxic effects. 
The V79 assay is widely used and accepted in the field of genetic
toxicology as a valid means of estimating the potential of
chemicals to cause gene mutations in mammalian cells in culture. 
We report here the results of furoic acid in the V79/HGPRT
Mammalian Cell Mutation Assay.<p>
The V79/HGPRT assay measures the ability of a test compound to
induce point mutations at the hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyl
transferase (HGPRT) locus in Chinese hamster V79 cells.  Cells
which are unable to synthesize the enzyme HGPRT (presumptive
mutants) cannot metabolize the purine analog 6-thioguanine (6-TG)
to its toxic form and are therefore resistant to it.  The V79/HGPRT
Assay has been described and reviewed in the literature, and is a
widely accepted means of estimating the ability of chemicals to
induce forward point mutations in mammalian cells.<p>
<LI>Significant Toxicity Observed<P> According to criteria for positive 
response  (either a dose-related or statistically significant 
increase in mutation frequency compared to vehicle  controls), 
furoic acid was nonmutagenic in the V79/HGPRT Mammalian Cell
Mutation Assay either with or without metabolic activation. 
Positive controls (DMBA or MNU)  Induced mutation frequencies
similar to expected values.<p>
<LI>No Observed Effect Level -  Not applicable<p>
<LI>Statistical Analysis<P> Raw data (plate counts) were used to generate 
mean  mutation counts per treatment group and each furoic acid
group compared with controls.<p>
<LI>Conclusions -  Furoic acid was not mutagenic in this test system.</ul><p>

were usually given in 10-fold increments. Routinely, oral

<LI>Parameters Tested<p> Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis (PCA) following IV
and/or oral challenge.  Briefly, skin sites on guinea pigs were
passively sensitized with antibody of desired specificity and five
days later the sensitized animals were given Evans blue dye and
challenged by either the IV or oral route with appropriate test
material.  Sensitized skin sites were subsequently examined for
evidence of PCA reactions as indicated by the leakage of Evans blue
dye from the vascular system into the skin.<p>
<LI>Significant Findings<p> Regardless of dose, there were no positive
reactions of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) when guinea pigs
sensitized with penicillin antibody were challenged by either route
with any form of ceftiofur.<p>
Guinea pigs sensitized with ceftiofur antibody did not respond to
challenges with parent compound by either route.  However, positive
PCA reactions occurred following challenge with protein conjugate
by both routes.  While an IV challenge of 0.01 mg/kg produced
positive reactions, oral exposure resulted in PCA activity only at
a challenge level of 10 mg/kg.<p>
Metabolite II caused PCA reactions over a wide range of dose levels
when given by either the IV or oral route to guinea pigs sensitized
with ceftiofur antibody.  While as little as 0.076 &#181;g/kg produced
positive responses following IV challenge, levels of at least 76
&#181;g/kg were required to induce positive PCA activity as a sequel to
oral exposure.<p>
Guinea pigs sensitized with ceftiofur antibody then challenged IV
with conjugates of Compound A or Compound B responded to the
challenge.  These positive responses confirm that the model is able
to recognize all metabolites in the extract of kidney or muscle.<p>
Guinea pigs sensitized with ceftiofur antibody and challenged
orally at a level of 0.83 mg/kg with acetic acid extract of drug
(ceftiofur) residue from kidney and injection-site muscle were
uniformly negative.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level -  0.83 mg/kg. The relevant NOEL is for oral
challenge of sensitized animals with the acetic acid extract of
ceftiofur residue from kidney and injection site muscle.<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis -  Not applicable.<p>
<li>Conclusions<P> Antibody to benzylpenicillin G did not react with any
form of ceftiofur tested, regardless of route or dose.  Data from
the IV challenges indicate that ceftiofur antibody used for this
study was capable of detecting the drug as a conjugated hapten in
challenge material given at a level as low as .01 mg/kg body weight
(lowest level tested).  Positive PCA reactions also occurred with
IV challenges of Metabolite II at levels as low as .076 &#181;g/kg body
weight (lowest level tested).  The route was of considerable
importance for both the protein conjugate and Metabolite II because
of the differences in the level of challenge necessary to elicit a
positive PCA reaction.  With both materials, the oral challenge
level necessary to produce a positive response was approximately
1,000X the minimum level required for a PCA reaction following IV
challenge.  This suggests that the gastrointestinal tract may play
an important role in modulating the effect of potential
hypersensitive reactions with ceftiofur. <p>
Further, the data suggest that ceftiofur does not exist in residue
from injection site muscle or kidney in a form or concentration
such that PCA reactions occur following oral exposure of animals
sensitized with ceftiofur antibody and challenged with extract of
the residue.  Levels of extract tested were at least 10X the
maximum anticipated human exposure level, based on consumption of
injection site muscle at the time of maximum residue concentration.</ul><p>


<b>2. Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) Inhibition with Human Serum</b><UL><p>

<li>Number Animals Per Sex Per Treatment Group -  Not applicable <p>
<li>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing -  Not applicable <p>
<li>Route of Administration -  Not applicable<p>
<li>Parameters Tested<P> The procedures for the RAST assay are the ones
routinely used.  Briefly, subjects were skin tested with a full
battery of penicillin determinants and serum from positive reactors
were subsequently studied using a penicilloyl RAST system.  Serum
samples from individuals with negative reactions were used as
controls.<p>

PENICILLOYL RAST: Benzylpenicillin G was conjugated to human serum
albumin in the penicilloyl configuration by the pH method.  This
material was then conjugated to cyanogen bromide activated
cellulose disks for use in RAST assays.  Studies with positive and
negative sera validated the assay. Serum giving apparently positive
tests were further evaluated by preincubating the serum in the
presence of 100 &#181;g/ml of penicilloylbenzylamine (BPO-BA) as a
positive inhibition control.  Buffer alone served as a negative
control.  These preparations were then studied for their ability to
bind in the standard RAST assay.<p>

CEFTIOFUR INHIBITION: ceftiofur was conjugated to bovine gamma
globulin (BGG) using the pH method, resulting in a binding ratio of
16 ceftiofur determinants per BGG molecule.  The resultant BGG-ceftiofur 
molecule was then used as a potential inhibitor, as was
done with BPO-BA.<p>
<li>Significant Results<P> The BPO-BA molecule was able to significantly
inhibit the binding of serum antibody from 17 patients to the
penicilloyl molecule.  However, in no case was the preincubation of
BGG-ceftiofur with serum from any of the patients able to
significantly inhibit the binding of antibody to the penicilloyl
molecule.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level - Not applicable<p>
<li>Conclusions<P> Ceftiofur-derived determinants do not react with IgE
to penicillin in the RAST system and therefore, individuals
allergic to penicillin are not at risk if exposed to ceftiofur.</ul><p>

total residues is 3.0 ppm.</ul><p>

2. This compound is a Category A compound as derived from the
Threshold Assessment considerations.  Based on Structural Activity
Assessment it was assigned to Category C (non carcinogen). 
Subsequent to this the 90 day feeding studies allowed it to be
classified as Category A.  Because of the therapeutic use on
specific animals it is considered a Low Use Drug.  Accordingly,
Chronic studies were not required, and based on 90 day studies, a
Safety Factor (SF) of 1000 is used in the Safe Concentration (SC)
calculations.<p>

<b>E. Comparative Metabolism Study Results</b><ul><p>
Including the parent compound, ceftiofur, there are eight known
metabolites of ceftiofur.  These are identified as I (ceftiofur),
II, IV, V, VII, VIII, IX and furoic acid.  A polar
metabolite U-3 also occurs in small amounts in some rats and in
cattle.<p>
Rats were orally dosed 14-C labeled ceftiofur sodium at 800 mg/kg
body weight for five consecutive days then sacrificed 8 h post last
feeding.  The dose approximates the highest NOEL (1,000 mg/kg)
observed in any of the oral rat feeding studies.  Cattle were
intramuscularly administered 14-C labeled formulated ceftiofur
sodium at 1 mg/lb for five consecutive days at a 24 h interval then
sacrificed eight hours post last treatment.  Metabolic profiles
were compared between the rat and cattle in urine, kidney and liver
tissues.  Kidney is the limiting tissue because observed
concentrations of total residues are highest in this tissue
relative to the calculated safe concentration.<p>

<li>Urinary Metabolites<p>
In both species, the initial metabolite is II.  Further metabolism
of II in rats from oral treatment gave rise to IX which was not
present in any significant amounts from IM treatment of cattle with
ceftiofur.<p>
The major metabolite V in the urine of cattle was also present
in the rat urine from oral treatment.  Most of the metabolite V
may not be a true metabolite but is an artifact which forms from
II.<p>
A similar situation applies to the metabolite VII.  When fresh
samples of urine were analyzed from treatment of rats with 14-C
ceftiofur, very high concentrations of II were found and very small
amounts of VII or the U-3 polar metabolites were present.  It
appears that when II is not analyzed within a few hours, VII and
U-3 are present in higher amounts.  This finding supports the view
that these compounds are formed from II.<p>
Metabolite IV is a product of II and its formation has been
observed in rats and in cattle.  Similarly VIII is formed from
VII and is present in both rats and cattle.<p>
Metabolite IX was present in the rat urine but not present in
bovine urine.  There were no major metabolites present in bovine
urine but absent from rat urine.<p>

<li>Kidney and Liver Metabolites<p>
Free metabolites in kidney and liver of rats and cattle are
similar.  Polar metabolite U-3 was present in both tissues of both
species.  Metabolites VII/VIII are major metabolites in both
tissues of both species while metabolites II/IV are present in
lesser amounts in both tissues of both species.  The majority of
the metabolites present in both rat and bovine liver and kidney
tissues could be converted to a common derivative (compound X). 
This shows that liver and kidney tissues in rats and cattle all had
related structures.  Bound residue was metabolite II linked to
macromolecules in both tissues of both species.  There are no major
metabolites present in either tissue of cattle but absent from
rats.  Likewise, there are no major metabolites present in the rat
but not present in corresponding bovine tissues.<p>
These data support the contention that the rat was autoexposed to
metabolites to which humans would be exposed from consuming edible
tissues of ceftiofur-treated cattle.  Therefore, the toxicology
studies in the rat accurately reflect the toxicity of these
metabolites to which man would be exposed.</ul><p>
<b>F. Tolerance for the Marker Residue</b><p>
Total residues at zero day withdrawal are substantially lower than
corresponding calculated safe concentrations for edible tissues,
therefore neither a marker compound nor a tolerance for a marker
compound is required.  The permitted safe concentration for total
residues in edible tissues is as follows:<p>
muscle    3.0 ppm<br>
kidney    9.0 ppm<br>
liver          6.0 ppm<br>
fat      12.0 ppm<p>
<b>G. Study Establishing Withdrawal Period</b><p>
Based on the toxicology data, and using the lowest No-Observed-Effect-Level 
of 30 mg/kg, a permitted Safe Concentration (SC) of 3
ppm in muscle and 9 ppm in kidney was established (Part C. of this
section).  Since the hypersensitivity studies demonstrated
the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction due to ingestion of
ceftiofur residues to be insignificant, the SC based on the
toxicology data is applied.<p>
Data presented in Part D. of this section  showed that the
mean concentrations of total ceftiofur residues at zero day
withdrawal following the administration of 1.0 mg/lb (2X label
dosage) were well below the permitted Safe Concentration. 
Therefore, a zero day pre-slaughter drug withdrawal has been
established and no residue decline studies were required.<p>

<b>H. Regulatory Method</b><p>
A regulatory method is not required; the residue and toxicology
data support a zero withdrawal period (see Part G. of this
Section).<p>

<li>Significant Toxicity Observed<p> During the first hour of exposure,
most of the rats exhibited salivation and/or nasal discharge.  By
the end of the 4-hour exposure all the rats exhibited slight
dyspnea.  However, when the rats were removed from the chamber
approximately 1 hour post exposure, all but 1 of the rats
appeared normal.  Following exposure, diarrhea was observed in 6
rats for 1 to 2 days between days 2 and 5 post exposure. 
By day 6 post inhalation exposure no significant compound related
pharmacotoxic signs were observed except for 1 male appearing
unkempt between post exposure days 4 and 10, and 1 female
showing a red material encrusted around the nares from days 10 to
12 post exposure.  Gross necropsy examination of the rats, which
were sacrificed at the end of the 14 day study period, revealed no
compound related gross lesions.  Histopathological examination of
the lungs, liver, kidney, trachea and nasal turbinates revealed no
significant changes.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level -  No effect at 8 mg/l<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis -  Not applicable to data generated from this

<li>Conclusions<p> The acute 4-hour median lethal concentration (LC50)
for rats is greater than 8.3 mg/l. Thus, ceftiofur sodium dust is
unlikely to cause any harmful effects to humans at concentrations

<b>2. Primary Eye Irritation Study in Albino Rabbits</b><ul><p>
<li>Technical Report No. 7277-85-008, December 9, 1985<p>
<li>Starting Date -  May 30, 1985<p>
<li>Termination Date -  June 13, 1985<p>
<li>Study Director -  Basil K. J. Leong<p>
<li>Location of Study -  The Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo MI<p>
<li>Identification of Substance and Dosage Form -  Ceftiofur sodium
pulverized powder<p>
<li>Species and Strain -  New Zealand White Rabbits<p>
<li>Number Animals Per Sex Per Treatment Group -  6 M and 6 F<p>
<li>Drug Levels Tested and Duration of Dosing - 100 mg instilled       
once into the conjunctival sac of the right eye of each rabbit;
left eye used as control.<p>
<li>Route of Drug Administration -  Ocular exposure<p>
<li>Parameters Tested <p>
Clinical - treated and non treated eyes were examined and compared at
1, 24, 48 and 72 h and at 4, 7 and 14 days after
treatment.  Grading and scoring of irritation were performed in
accordance with Draize's procedure.<p>
Pathology - complete gross necropsy was performed on all rabbits that
died during the study.<p>
Histopathology - tissues and organs obtained from dead animals of the
first 6 tested rabbits included lungs, kidney, heart, urinary
bladder, liver, cecum, eyes, adrenal, pancreas, mesenteric lymph
node, duodenum, rectum, thymus and from the second 6 tested
rabbits included eyes, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum,
colon, rectum, lung, heart, liver, kidney, adrenal and spleen.<p>

<li>Significant Toxicity Observed <P> In the first experiment, a single
100 mg dose of ceftiofur sodium bulk drug powder was instilled into
the conjunctival sac of the right eyes of 3 male and 3
female albino rabbits.  The left eyes were untreated and served as
controls.  At one hour post dosing all the treated eyes exhibited
slight conjunctival redness and/or swelling.  In addition the
treated eyes of 2 male and 3 female rabbits also exhibited
slight to moderate discharge.  By 24 hours post treatment, the
treated eyes of all 6 rabbits appeared normal.  However, on day
3 post instillation, 2 of the 6 rabbits were found dead. 
One had died from severe pulmonary edema, and the other from severe
necrotizing cecitis.  The remaining 4 rabbits appeared normal
for the remainder of the 14 day study period.<p>
Because of the unexpected deaths, the eye irritation experiment was
repeated on another group of 3 male and 3 female rabbits. 
Added to the experimental procedure were daily observations for
pharmacotoxic signs and terminal necropsy and histopathologic
examination on all animals.  The results indicated that the eye
irritation was minimal, as it was in the first experiment. 
However, 5 of the 6 rabbits exhibited diarrhea and body weight
loss beginning 2 to 3 days post treatment and 2 of the 5
affected rabbits were found dead in 5 and 13 days post
treatment, respectively.  The cause of death was apparently
enteritis in one rabbit and mucoid enteropathy in the other.  It
was concluded that the cause of death in the Experiment 1 rabbit
with cecitis and the Experiment 2 rabbit with enteritis may have
been enterotoxemia, which may have been related to ceftiofur.<p>
<li>No Observed Effect Level -  Not applicable<p>
<li>Statistical Analysis -  None<p>
<li>Conclusions<P> The experimental results indicated that ceftiofur
sodium powder is minimally irritating to rabbit eyes.  However, the
drug was apparently absorbable via the ocular route and caused
detrimental systemic effects in some rabbits.<p>
For industrial hygiene purposes, avoid gross eye exposure to the
bulk drug powder.  Should eye exposure occur, promptly rinse the
contaminated eye(s) with water and obtain medical attention.</ul><p>


<b>VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
 
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements
of 512 of the Act and demonstrate that Naxcel, when used under its
proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for the labeled
indications.<p>
The agency has granted an exemption under 21 CFR 201.105 from the
requirement of "adequate directions for use" in section 502(f)(l)
of the Act.  Therefore, labeling will restrict this drug to use by
or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.  This decision was
based on the following factors:  (a) Naxcel is a new chemical
entity and the first parenteral product of this antibiotic class
for use in food producing animals; (b) the drug is to be supplied
as a sterile powder which must be carefully reconstituted with
sterile diluent and maintained under strictly controlled
temperatures; and (c) adequate directions for over-the-counter use
of the drug for its labeled indications could not have been
prepared.<p>
Approval of this application poses no human risk from exposure to
residues of ceftiofur because the data submitted in support of this
NADA demonstrate that total residues in edible tissues from treated
cattle are below the calculated safe concentration at a practical
zero withdrawal.  For these reasons, a regulatory method for
residues is not required.<p>

<b>n.  Date of Summary:</b>  September 30, 1993<p>
<b>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
 Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new
animal drug application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product). New target animal safety data, drug
effectiveness data, and human food safety data (other than tissue residue data)
are not required for approval of an ANADA. An ANADA relies on the target animal
safety, drug effectiveness, and human food safety data in the pioneer's new
animal drug 
application. Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the generic product is
bioequivalent to the pioneer. If bioequivalence is demonstrated through a
clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to establish the
withdrawal time for the generic product is also required. For certain dosage
forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo
</I>&#160;bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990).<p>
Based upon the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Agri 
Laboratories. Ltd. was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</I>&#160;
bioequivalence study for tetracycline hydrochloride soluble powder. The generic
and pioneer products are soluble powders with the same active and inactive
ingredients. The generic and pioneer products also contain the same
concentration of active ingredient.<p>
<b>3.   HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
<b>Tolerance for the marker residue</b><p>
The tolerance for the pioneer product applies to the generic product.<p>
A tolerance of 0.25 ppm (negligible residue) is established for tetracycline
residues in the uncooked edible tissues of calves, swine, chickens and turkeys
under 21 CFR 556.720.<p>
<b>Withdrawal times</b><p>
When a waiver of the <i>in vivo </I>&#160;bioequivalence study is granted, the
generic product withdrawal times are those previously assigned to the pioneer
product (21 CFR 520. 2345d).<p>
Withdrawal Times: 4 days in swine, chickens and turkeys; 5 days in cattle<p>
<b>Regulatory Method</b><p>
The analytical method for the determination of tetracycline in tissues uses a
microbiological procedure. This method is found in the <i>Antibiotic Residues
in Milk, Dairy Products, and Animal Tissues: Methods, Reports and Protocols ,</i>
revised October 1968, National Center for Antibiotic and Insulin Analysis, FDA,
Washington, D.C. 20204.<p>
<b>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that tetracycline hydrochloride, when used under its proposed
conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled indications.<p>
<b>5.  ATTACHMENTS:</b><p>

<b>C.Recommended Dosage:</b><P>

Seven and one-half (7.5) mg of albendazole per kg of body weight (3.4
mg/lb)  administered orally with a suitable syringe or dosing gun.<P>

<b>4.Effectiveness</b><P>

This NADA relies on adequate well-controlled studies demonstrating the
anthelmintic effectiveness of albendazole in cattle included in approved NADA
110-048 (Albendazole Suspension, 54 FR 25114, June 13, 1989) and NADA 128-070
(Albendazole Paste, 54 FR 51385, November 17, 1989).<P>

In these studies, the cattle were either experimentally or naturally infected
with one or more species of nematodes, cestodes and/or trematodes.  The claim
for each major parasitic species is supported by adequate and well-controlled
studies.<P>

Arithmetic means were calculated to determine efficacy and efficacy was
expressed in percent removal of worms as compared to controls.  The percent
reduction was calculated as follows:<br>


<pre>
               Arithmetic mean no. parasites in control animals 
Percentage                         minus
Reduction of = Arithmetic mean no. parasites in treated animals     X 100
Parasites      ________________________________________________
               Arithmetic mean no. parasites in control animals
</pre>
<P>

As a product for use in sheep, albendazole qualifies for review under the
"Minor Use Drug Program."  NADA 110-048 (oral suspension) and NADA 128-070
(oral paste) serve as representative formulations approved for use in a major
species (cattle).  Since there were no drugs approved for treatment of liver
fluke infections, albendazole was made available for treatment of cattle and
sheep from 1980 to 1985 on an emergency investigational new animal drug basis
in the states where liver fluke disease prevailed.<P>

Developmental research in sheep was conducted in nine pivotal studies
consisting of six dose-titration and three dose-confirmation efficacy trials in
four different geographic locations in the United States as well as
internationally.  Doses ranging from 2.5 to 15 mg albendazole per kg body
weight, were given orally.  The results from these studies were used to
determine the most effective dose.  A dose of 7.5 mg/kg was effective against
the greatest number of parasite species infecting sheep.<P>

Albendazole, in a suspension formulation, was administered orally as a drench,
and was evaluated for efficacy using the controlled test, as recommended by the
Center for Veterinary Medicine in its "Guidelines for Evaluation of Bovine
Anthelmintics," which serves as a guide for all ruminant species.  Briefly
stated, a certain number of infected sheep remain untreated; the remainder
receive medication.  After a suitable period of time post-treatment (usually 5
to 7 days, but longer in some circumstances), treated and untreated (control)
animals are killed and necropsied.  Remaining parasites are identified and
counted for each animal.<P>

Albendazole was effective for each parasite claimed.  The study conducted
against the deer fluke, <i>Fascioloides magna</i>&#160;demonstrated 57%
efficacy.  Albendazole will become the only approved therapy for this highly
pathogenic parasite in sheep.  The results from major controlled efficacy
studies supported the conclusion that when given orally to sheep at 7.5 mg/kg
body weight, albendazole is an effective anthelmintic with a wide spectrum of
activity against adult and larval stages of gastrointestinal roundworms,
lungworms, tapeworms and liver flukes infecting sheep.  <P>

<b>A. Dose Titration</b><P>

Pivotal dose-titration studies were carried out to determine the dose of
albendazole needed to control trematodes, cestodes, gastrointestinal and
pulmonary nematodes.  Approximately 170 sheep were used, three-fourths of which
were treated with albendazole.  The remaining sheep served as untreated
controls.  An oral suspension formulation was utilized with dosages ranging
from 2.5 to 15 mg/kg.  Accepted husbandry practices were duplicated with
respect to breeds of sheep, diets, and grazing conditions.  Standard procedures
were followed for allocating, dosing, collecting samples, enumerating and
identifying parasites, and performing necropsies.  The parasitic infections
were experimentally induced in four (4) of the trials and naturally acquired in
the remaining two (2) trials.  Based on the data collected, an optimum
effective dose of 7.5 mg albendazole per kg body weight was determined.<P>

<b>1) Dose-Titration Study, No. A-8008-75</b><P>

T. O. Gurnell<br>
Terenure Research Farm<br>
Isando, South Africa<P>

A total of 46 lambs was experimentally infected with metacercariae of <i>F.
hepatica</i>&#160;and divided into five groups.  The controls and the first
three treatment groups were also experimentally infected with larvae of <i>O.
circumcincta, N. spathiger</i> and <i>Oe. columbianum.</i>  One group of nine
lambs remained untreated and served as a control.  The remaining four groups
received albendazole suspension as a single oral dose of 5.0, 7.5, 10.0 or 15.0
mg/kg (8, 11, 11 and 7 lambs, respectively).  Ten days after treatment the

<b>C. Field Trials</b><P>

Well-documented clinical field trials were conducted in the United States
according to an approved protocol which was modified to accommodate the
parasite(s) of interest and local management conditions.  Groups of sheep with
at least a moderate worm infection, as determined by egg counts in their feces,
were selected.  In one of the trials the same number of animals was treated
with albendazole or was left untreated and served as controls.  In the other
four trials, due to the severity of the infection and the death losses that had
occurred, all animals in the flock were treated with albendazole.  Worm eggs in
fecal samples were counted before and after treatment, and animals were
visually observed for side effects.<P>

Five investigators studied albendazole suspension in four states.  Sheep of
various breeds were treated.  Investigators, trial locations and numbers of
animals in these studies are tabulated on the following pages.  The results of
these clinical field trials confirm the results of the studies indicating
elimination or reduction of fecal egg counts in virtually all treated sheep.
The recommended treatment was found to be safe and practical under field
conditions.<P>

Clinical field trials conducted by foreign investigators were also submitted.
They further confirm the efficacy of albendazole against a broad spectrum of
gastrointestinal roundworm, lungworm, tapeworm and liver fluke infections in
sheep.<P>

<b>Study 77/SAF20/205/UK</b><P>

<b>Purpose:</b><P>

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of albendazole on the
progress and outcome of pregnancy in sheep when administered as a single dose
on Day 17 of gestation.<P>

<b>Methods:</b><P>

Approximately 360 Dorset Horn Cross and Clun ewes were mated naturally.
After mating, the ewes were randomly assigned to one of five groups.  There was
a control group and four treatment groups receiving a single dose of
albendazole at 7.5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, or 20 mg/kg 17 days after mating.
The numbers of lambs born, mortality rates from the neonatal period through
slaughter, initial lamb examination (body weight, general condition, viability
estimation, external malformations), lamb index, viability index, mean litter
size, live birth, and lamb birth weights were recorded.  Maternal factors were
pregnancy rate, gestation length, and parturition difficulties. <P>

<b>Results:</b><P>

All the treated groups had lower pregnancy rates than the control group.  The
lamb index and viability index were much lower for the group receiving 20 mg
albendazole/kg body weight.  There were teratogenic effects of increasing
frequency in the treated groups corresponding to increasing dose.  At 20 mg/kg
body weight, there were cranial, spinal, and renal defects.  At 15 mg/kg body
weight, only renal defects were seen.  At 10 mg/kg, there was one case of renal
agenesis.  At 7.5 mg/kg body weight, there were no defects observed that could
be related to treatment.<P>

<b>Conclusion:</b><P>

Administration of albendazole at 10 mg/kg (1.3 times the highest recommended

<b>Study A-76-6</b><P>

<b>Purpose</b>:<P>

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of albendazole on
spermatogenesis, seminal quality and testicular tissue in rams.<P>

<b>Methods</b>:<P>

A single oral dose of 15 mg/kg of albendazole suspension was administered to
six 2 year old rams.  A similar group of rams were untreated and served as a
control.  The following parameters were measured over a 56-day period following
treatment:  semen volume, color, consistency, mobility and proportion of live;
dead spermatozoon.  Histopathologic examination of stained testicular sections
was performed on treated and control animals immediately following the final
semen collection (i.e. 56 days following drug administration).<P>

<b>Results:</b><P>

No significant differences could be determined in semen volume, color,
consistency, mobility and proportion of line to dead spermatozoa between
treated and control groups or between pre- and post- treatment periods within
each group.  Histopathological examination of stained testicular sections
showed no differences between treated and control animals.<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>:<P>

<b>6. Human Food Safety</b><P>

<b>A. Toxicity Tests</b><P>

The pivotal toxicity studies conducted to support the safe
concentration of albendazole in the edible tissues of sheep are described in
the FOI Summary for the approved NADA 110-048 (albendazole suspension for
cattle, 54 FR 25114, June 13, 1989).<P>

<b>B. Safe Concentration of Residues</b><P>

The data from the toxicity studies and the tissue consumption
factors for sheep allow assignment of the safe concentrations for residues of
albendazole in tissues.<P>

The no-observed-effect level for establishing the safe concentration of the
total residues of albendazole is 5 mg/kg/day.  This is based on the teratogenic
effect in the rat teratology study.  The rat is considered the most sensitive
species and the teratology study the most sensitive study.  Therefore, with a
1000 fold safety factor, the safe concentration for albendazole residues is:<P>

Livers from sheep in the residue studies previously described were subjected to
wet chemistry procedures to establish the profiles of 14C-albendazole
metabolites present in those samples.  A number of extraction procedures were
used with liver tissue which varied in the extraction solvent and the use of
sample pretreatment with enzymes or acid hydrolysis.  The techniques used to
isolate and quantitate metabolites included thin layer chromatography,
autoradiography, and reverse isotope dilution.<P>

In general, the qualitative profiles of the major metabolites present in liver
were very similar regardless of the profiling procedure used.  There were,
however, significant variations in the amounts of the individual metabolites
observed because metabolite stability and solubility parameters varied.  The
greatest single factor affecting the quantitative profile was the use of acid
hydrolysis, which released metabolites, particularly the 2-aminosulfone
metabolite, from the bound residue present in liver.<P>

The extractable radioactivity in the liver samples ranged between 13% and 99%
of the total radioactivity present in the tissue depending upon the extraction
procedure used and the length of the withdrawal time.  At one day withdrawal,
99% of the 14C-albendazole residues in sheep liver was freely extractable into
ethyl acetate.  That percentage declined to about 37% by four days of
withdrawal and to 13% by eight days of withdrawal.<P>

The use of more vigorous extraction procedures, particularly the use of acid
hydrolysis as noted earlier, effected the release of increasing amounts of
drug-related residues from the bound residue.  This effort resulted in the
isolation and identification of the albendazole sulfoxide, sulfone, and
2-aminosulfone metabolites in liver tissue.  Parent albendazole and the
2-aminosulfoxide metabolite were also shown to be present but in small amounts
and only at short withdrawal times.  The table below presents the quantitation
of the major metabolites as percentages of the extractable radioactivity
present in liver tissue.<P>

A comparison was made of the metabolite patterns present in sheep liver with
those present in the urine collected from the rats and mice.  The comparison
showed that parent albendazole and all other metabolites identified at any time
period in sheep liver were also present in the urine of the laboratory species.
Therefore, the test species were exposed to all of the metabolites shown to be
present in the liver from sheep treated with albendazole.<P>

<b>D. Assignment of Marker Residue, Target Tissue and Rm (Tolerance)</b><P>

The data in the tables of total residue values shown on two of the previous
pages established that liver contains the highest levels of total drug-related
residues of albendazole and that it is the tissue in sheep from which residues
are the slowest to deplete to the safe concentration.  These observations
suggested liver as the likely choice of target tissue for albendazole in
sheep.<P>

The metabolism data summarized in Section B confirmed liver as the target
tissue and led to the selection of the 2-aminosulfone metabolite as the marker
residue.  Those data demonstrated that the 2-aminosulfone metabolite was
present in sufficiently high concentration in liver and had the proper
depletion characteristics to serve as the marker substance in that tissue.<P>

The Rm (tolerance) for albendazole in sheep liver was set from the liver total
residue data in Study No. II and the marker residue depletion (cold) study
described in Section D.  In the latter study, residues of the marker residue
were assayed by the determinative procedure of the regulatory method.  That
assay is based on HPLC and is described in Section E.<P>

An overlay of the total radioactivity and marker residue decline curves
demonstrated that the albendazole 2-aminosulfone metabolite (marker residue) is
at a concentration of approximately 250 ppb when total
14C-albendazole residues in sheep liver are at the safe
concentration of 3.0 ppm.  Accordingly, the Rm (tolerance) for the marker
residue in sheep liver is established at 250 ppb.<P>

<b>E. Studies Demonstrating a Withdrawal Time</b><P>

The withdrawal time for the suspension formulation of albendazole in
sheep was calculated from the marker residue depletion data in a study which
involved 20 treated sheep.  Those animals each received a single 7.5 mg/kg dose
of the albendazole suspension formulation and were euthanized in groups of 6,
4, 4, or 6 sheep (equal sex distribution per group) at 2, 5, 8 or 11 days,
respectively, post dosing.<P>

A statistical analysis of the depletion data using the upper tolerance limit
containing a 99 percentile of the population with 95% confidence limits yielded
a withdrawal period of seven days for the albendazole suspension
formulation.<P>

<b>F. Regulatory Methods</b><P>

<b>Albendazole Determinative Assay Scheme</b><P>

The determinative assay for detecting residues of albendazole in sheep liver
involves measurement of the 2-aminosulfone metabolite by high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection.  The assay is based
on the method developed for monitoring residues of albendazole in cattle liver
(NADA 110-048), with the only differences being modifications in the standard
curve range (5 - 1600 ppb) and fortification level (200 ppb) of the internal
standard to better accommodate the higher Rm (tolerance) for the 2-aminosulfone
metabolite in sheep liver.<P>

<b>Albendazole Confimatory Assay Scheme</b><P>

The confirmatory procedure for residues of the albendazole 2-aminosulfone
metabolite in sheep liver is identical to the confirmatory procedure developed
for residues of albendazole in cattle.  That method involves formation of the
t-butyl dimethylsilyl (t-BDMS) derivative which is then subjected to gas liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis.<P>

<b>Validation</b><P>

The determinative and confirmatory procedures as developed for residues in
cattle are filed in the Food Additives Manual on display in FDA's Freedom of
Information Public Room (Room 12A-30, 5600 Fisher's Lane, Rockville, MD
20857).<P>

<b>G. Safety to Handler</b><P>

The drug was also evaluated for untoward effects which might result from
physical contact with it:<P>

Albendazole was not irritating when applied directly to abraded or non-abraded
rabbit skin (500 mg applied to each side).  Similarly, no irritation was
observed in either non-irrigated (non-washed) or irrigated eyes of any rabbit
immediately, 24, 48 or 72 hours after instillation of 100 mg of albendazole.<P>

A single oral dose of 3000 mg/kg of albendazole failed to produce death when
administered to mice.  This dose represents approximately 300 times the highest
recommended therapeutic dose.<P>

The studies demonstrated that the drug would have no ill effects on persons
handling it if it is used according to label recommendations.<P>

<br>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions</b><P>

The data submitted in support of this original NADA comply with the
requirements of section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that albendazole (4.55%)
when used under the proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective.  These
data from the controlled studies demonstrate the effectiveness of albendazole
for its labeled indications as an anthelmintic for sheep when administered as
an oral suspension at a dosage level of 7.5 mg/kg of body weight.  These
studies demonstrate the efficacy of a single dose of albendazole for removal
and control of the following parasites:  <br>

The safe concentration for albendazole in uncooked edible sheep tissues is
0.6 ppm in muscle, 3.0 ppm in liver, 3.0 ppm in kidney and 3.0 ppm in fat.  The
tolerance for the albendazole marker compound, 2-aminosulfone metabolite, is
established at 0.25 ppm in sheep liver.  The withdrawal time for sheep is 7
days.<P>

Albendazole is currently approved in cattle as an over-the-counter
product.  Accurate diagnosis can be made with reasonable degree of certainty by
the layman.  Adequate directions for use have been written for the layman, and
the conditions for use prescribed on the labeling are likely to be followed in
practice.  Therefore, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has concluded
that this product for sheep shall also, have over-the-counter marketing
status.<P>

Under Section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the FFDCA, this approval for food-producing
animals qualifies for THREE years of marketing exclusivity beginning on the
date of approval because the application contains reports of new clinical or
field investigations essential to the approval of the application and conducted
or sponsored by the applicant.<P>

<b>m.  Date of Summary:  </b>March 18, 1994<p>
<b>2.    TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), following
the approval of an ANADA for a generic Type A medicated article (ANADA 200-075;
generic salinomycin sodium), Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Company is entitled to
the approval of generic salinomycin in combination with bambermycins.
Bioequivalence studies are not required for the approval of this generic
combination (Type C medicated feed). Salinomycin sodium is codified under 21
CFR &#167;  558.550. Bambermycins is codified under 21 CFR &#167;
558.95. The combination of salinomycin sodium and bambermycins is codified
under 21 CFR &#167;  558.95Co)(1)(xii).<p>
<b> </b><p>
<b>3.    HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
In accordance with the Centers policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), tissue
residue studies are not required for the approval of this generic combination
(Type C medicated feed).<p>
<b>a.    Tolerances for Residues</b><p>
The tolerance established for the pioneer salinomycin sodium product applies to
the generic salinomycin sodium product. The safe concentrations for total
salinomycin residues in the uncooked edible tissues of broiler chickens were
established as 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm in liver, and 1.2 ppm in skin/fat.<p>
Bambermycins has a no-tolerance clearance as published in 40 FR 59726 (December
30, 1975). The safe concentration for total bambermycins residues in the
uncooked edible tissues of broiler chickens were established in NADA 44-759 (38
FR 1274; January 11, 1973).<p>
<b>b.   Withdrawal Time</b><p>
Based on the information in 21 CFR &#167;  558.95(b)(1)(xii), a 0-day
withdrawal time is required for the combination ofbambermycins and
salinomycin.<p>
<b>c.   Regulatory Method for Residues</b><p>
A regulatory method for salinomycin was not required because residue levels in
all three broiler tissues (muscle, liver, and skin/fat) were significantly
below the established safe concentration for total residues.<p>
A microbiological assay method is used to assay tissues for bambermycins
residues. The method entitled "Quantitative Agar Well Plate Assay of
Bambermycins (Flavomycin) in Organs and Tissues" is on file at the Center for
Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl.,
Rockville, MD 20855.<p>
 
<b>4.   AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that the combination of salinomycin sodium and bambermycins when
used under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for its
labeled indications.<p>

<b>Generic Name of Drug:</b>        Ivermectin <p>
<b>Trade Name:  </b>     HEARTGARD-30 Chewables <p>
<b>Marketing Status: </b>   Rx <p>
<b>Date of Summary:</b>  July 3, 1989<p>
<b>2. Indications for Use</b><p>
For use in dogs to prevent canine heartworm disease by eliminating the tissue
stage of heartworm larvae (<i>Dirofilaria immitis </i>) up to a month after infection.
<p>
<b>3. Dosage Form </b><p>
The ingredients of HEARTGARD-30
Chewables are formulated into palatable, meat based chewable cubes.  Three
dosage sizes are available for dogs of different weight classes. <p>
<b>Route of Administration</b> <p>
HEARTGARD-30
Chewables are orally administered at monthly intervals during the period of the
year when mosquitoes (vectors), potentially carrying heartworm larvae, are
active. <p>
<b>Recommended Dosage</b> <p>
HEARTGARD-30
Chewables supply a minimum of 6.0 mcg ivermectin per kg (2.72 mcg/lb) of body
weight when given at the following recommended dose levels: <p>
<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 3 columns.)</b><P>
<pre><b>


   Dog           Chewables         Ivermectin

Up to 25 lb            1                  68 mcg  
26 to 50 lb            1                 136 mcg  
51 to 100 lb           1                 272 mcg 


Give dogs heavier than 100 lb the appropriate 
combination of these sizes. 

</pre>
<b>4. Effectiveness</b> <p>
The New Animal Drug Application for ivermectin chewables contains data
demonstrating that the product is the pharmacological equivalent of HEARTGARD-30
tablets and thus is also effective in the prevention of canine heartworm
disease when given monthly at dose levels of at least 6 mcg of ivermectin per
kg of body weight. <p>
For additional information on efficacy studies for ivermectin in dogs refer to
the Freedom of Information Summary, NADA 138-412
(52 FR 11041, 11042, 4/7/87). <p>
<b>Bioavailability</b> <p>
A bioavailability trial was conducted at Research Triangle Institute in
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.  Sixteen non-pregnant adult female
Beagles, with no history of a tendency to vomit, were selected for the trial.
All dogs received one ivermectin chewable and one ivermectin tablet in a two-period 
crossover design.  Radio-labeled ivermectin was used in both
formulations.  Treatments were separated by 42 days.  No other medications were
given. <p>
Dogs were dosed orally and were carefully observed for emesis for 4 hours after
each dosing.  All dogs accepted and retained both the chewable and tablet
formulations.  Ivermectin was given at 6 mcg/kg, the lowest level that would be
administered following label directions. <p>
Blood samples (5 ml) were taken from each dog at Hour -24, and following each
treatment at Hours 1,2,3,4,6,10,and 24, and at Days
2,3,5,7,10, and 14 (i.e., Hours 48, 72, 120, 168, 240 and 336).
Three additional blood samples (at Hours 8, 12 and 15) were collected
following the second treatment to define more precisely the radioactivity peak.
Blood was centrifuged and plasma samples were frozen immediately for subsequent
assay. <p>
Two or 3 aliquots from each plasma sample were analyzed for total
radioactivity in a scintillation spectrometer.  The recovery of tritium from
tritiated ivermectin was  &#240;97%.  Radioactivity counts per minute were
converted to ivermectin ng-eq/g
plasma using the specific activity of [3H]-ivermectin standards.  Statistical
analysis of area under the curve and of the natural logarithm of peak
ivermectin concentration used an ANOVA for a two-period crossover design;
plasma ivermectin concentration data were transformed using natural logarithms
and analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA.  There were no significant Period
or Sequence (i.e., Period x Formulation) effects for any variable  
analyzed. <p>
The bioavailability of the two formulations was similar although not identical.
Area under the curve was 22% greater for the chewable formulation than for the
tablet (p&#208;0.03);  peak ivermectin plasma concentration was comparable for
both formulations (p &#240;.05).  Mean time-to-peak ivermectin plasma concentration
was longer for the chewable formulation than for the tablet, but for both
formulation, peak plasma concentrations were reached by 10 hours for 15 of the
16 dogs. Considering these results, a medical determination was made that the
chewable formulation would provide comparable efficacy to the tablet. <p>
<b>Conclusion </b><p>
Ivermectin has been shown to be effective in preventing heartworm 
disease in dogs at dose levels of 6 mcg/kg and higher. HEARTGARD-30
tablets are a dosage form of ivermectin which has been approved for use in this
regard (NADA 138-412).
 Because the tablet and chewable dosage forms have been shown to be
pharmacokinetically similar and the chewables are as bioavailable to dogs as
the tablets, HEARTGARD-30 Chewables are effective in preventing canine 
heartworm disease with a minimum
monthly dose of 6 mcg ivermectin/kg body weight. <p>
<b>5. Animal Safety:</b> <p>
For additional information on safety studies for ivermectin in dogs refer to
the Freedom of Information Summary, NADA 138-412.
<p>
<b>Field Trials</b> <p>
The acceptability and safety of the chewable formulation were tested in four
similar controlled field trials.  The investigators are listed below: <p>
<pre>
<b>Investigator                       Location </b>

Dr. Mark W. Coleman                Gainesville, Florida  
Dr. Kenneth E. Acre                Winter Park, Florida  
Dr. John W. Huigenbos              Ontario, Canada  
Dr. Robert S. Blakely              Canterville, Illinois
</pre>  
  
Three hundred eighty-four client-owned dogs were enrolled in these trials.  The
dogs were maintained at home and their usual routines were maintained including
treatment with a wide variety of commonly used animal health products.  The
owners administered the assigned trial medications, made observations, and kept
records. The investigators examined the dogs at the start of the trial  and
provided routine veterinary care.  In two of the trials, dogs were brought back
to the clinics for follow-up
examinations after 4 to 6 months. <p>
Of the 384 dogs, 255 received monthly treatment with ivermectin  
chewables according to the recommended dosage schedule.  Control dogs received
monthly treatment with HEARTGARD-30
tablets, or daily treatment with Filaribits&#174; and monthly placebo (ALPO Beef
Bites(TM)). Most of the dogs received 3 to 6 doses of monthly trial
medication.<p> All dogs (except pups too young to require testing) were initially
confirmed to be negative for heartworm, and all dogs brought back to the
clinics for re-examination (in 2 trials) after 4 to 6 months were
negative for heartworm.  Test methods used were a Modified Knott or Difil-Test&#174; (Evsco)
and an antigen test.<p> The age range of dogs included in the trials was from 4
weeks to 14 years old and included 21 pups 14 weeks old or younger.  There were
83 breeds, varieties or types of dogs, and 170 owners participated. One bitch
whelped and another was bred and whelped while on HEARTGARD-30
Chewable treatment.  Fifteen dogs did not complete the field trials for reasons
unrelated to treatment. <p>
No adverse reactions were attributed to treatment with ivermectin 
chewables.  The most common observations were vomiting and diarrhea, and these
were observed with lower incidence among dogs receiving ivermectin chewables
than among those in either control group.  One dog consumed 16 X 272 mcg
ivermectin chewables at one time (resulting in a dose of 152 mcg/kg) and no
untoward signs were observed. <p>
Other observations included dermatoses of various etiologies. Three dogs on
ivermectin chewables and three dogs on HEARTGARD-30
tablets were lethargic or sluggish.  Two dogs were bitten by snakes and one of
these dogs died; two dogs were hit by  cars and one died.  A number of other
unrelated observations were recorded, including:  nephritis, cystitis,
tachycardia, weight loss, coughing, protein losing enteropathy,
tracheobronchitis, heart murmur, lump on shoulder, <i>Sarcoptes</i>&#160; infestation,
chronic hip pain, sprained shoulder, throat infection, chewing on hip, and
pharyngeal abscess. <p>
More than 97% of the dogs on study accepted all doses of the ivermectin
chewables.  Owners of the 6 dogs which rejected the chewable on one or more
occasions generally dosed their dogs by putting the ivermectin chewable in the
dog's mouth as they would a swallow tablet.  Comparative acceptability scores
were best for dogs receiving the ivermectin chewables. <p>
<b>Palatability </b><p>
In order to demonstrate the palatability and acceptability of the chewable
formulation, a total of 91 dogs were used in a trial. Dogs were offered one
chewable containing 85 to 112 mcg of ivermectin; owners were not given special
instructions on how to administer the chewable, but rather, offered the
chewable "free choice".  Acceptance or rejection of the product, as well as any
reactions, was recorded by owners who also made their own comments on the
formulation. <p>
More than 93% of the trial dogs consumed their ivermectin chewable when
offered, 5 did not consume it and 1 ate half.  No adverse reactions were
observed after administration of the chewables. Comments concerning
acceptability were generally very favorable. Twenty-four owners (26 dogs)
remarked that their dogs were usually finicky, fussy, or hard to medicate but
accepted the ivermectin chewable.  Many breeds were included in the trial; the
smallest dogs were two, 9-week old pups weighing 2.7 lb and 3 lb,
respectively. <p>
<b>Conclusion</b> <p>
The safety and efficacy of ivermectin in dogs have been established in trials
included in a previous submission (HEARTRGARD-30 tablets, NADA 138-412).  
Information on these studies is included in the Freedom of Information Summary for 
this previously approved product.<p>

Demonstration of the safety and acceptability of ivermectin chewables in dogs
was found in the 4 field trials conducted using 384 dogs. Ivermectin
chewables were given monthly, according to the recommended label direction, to
255 of these dogs; most dogs received 3 to 6 doses. No adverse reactions
attributable to ivermectin were observed. <p>
<b>6. Human Safety</b> <p>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residue residues in
food, were not required for approval of this NADA. This product is labeled as a
prescription drug for use only on dogs which are non-food animals. <p>
Human safety relative to possession, handling, and administration: <p>
Labeling contains adequate caution statement. <p>
Labeling states:  Keep this and all drugs out of reach of children. <p>
<b>7. Agency Conclusions</b> <p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.
The data demonstrated that HEARTGARD-30
Chewables when used under the labeled conditions of use are safe and effective.
<p>
The drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a licensed  
veterinarian because all dogs should be tested and treated for existing
heartworm infection prior to starting treatment with HEARTGARD in a prevention
program. <p>

<b>4. EFFECTIVENESS</b><p>
Effectiveness trials were conducted with tiamulin-medicated feeds prepared
from three tiamulin premixes.  These included the 25&#37; tiamulin premix
(DENAGARD), a formulation of tiamulin in cornstarch (TIAMUTIN&#174;-Sandoz) and a 
tiamulin-extruded formulation (DYNAMUTILIN&#174;-Squibb). The formulations have 
been shown to be equivalent on the basis of blood level bioequivalency studies. <p>
<B>a. CONTROL OF SWINE DYSENTERY</B> <p>
<b>(1) Pivotal Studies</b>&#160;<p>
The effectiveness of DENAGARD (tiamulin) premix for the control of swine
dysentery associated with <I>Treponema hyodysenteriae</I>&#160;susceptible to tiamulin has
been demonstrated by the results of three well-controlled laboratory and field
trials conducted in three states with 512 pigs. <p>
Dose determination trials with tiamulin at 20, 35 and 50 g/t were conducted in
the laboratory (induced infection) and in the field (natural infections).<p>
No adverse reactions to tiamulin were observed in any of these trials. <p>

The purpose of this trial of randomized block design was to evaluate
tiamulin at 20, 35, and 50 g/t of feed vs. nonmedicated controls for the
control of swine dysentery. Forty-eight crossbred pigs, 28 barrows and 20
gilts, averaging 34 pounds in weight were allotted 6 pigs per pen, 2 pens per
treatment on the basis of weight and sex. All pigs were infected on test days
0 and 40 by feeding infective material (colonic tissue and contents) taken from
pigs with clinical signs of swine dysentery. Medicated feed was self-fed from
after infection on test day 0 to test termination on Day 63. <p>
A tiamulin premix was used to prepare medicated feed in this trial. <p>
Throughout the trial, pigs were observed and individually rated daily for
general appearance, dehydration, diarrhea and presence of blood in feces.
Weight gains and feed consumption were determined periodically throughout the
test. All pigs were examined for the presence of treponemes on test days 1, 7,
14, 28, 42, and 56 by dark field microscopic examination of rectal swab
material.<p>
Results of this study were pooled with results from the other pivotal
studies and statistical analysis appears later in this summary. <p>

This trial was conducted to evaluate continuous medication with tiamulin at
20, 35, and 50 g/t for the control of swine dysentery under practical
conditions on a farm with a recent history of the disease. <p>
A total of 240 crossbred pigs averaging 71.9 lb and approximately 11 weeks
of age were used in this test of randomized block design. There were two
replications of thirty pigs per treatment.  Pigs were weighed and randomly
allotted to pens and treatments were randomly assigned to pens within
replications. Observations and ratings for diarrhea (0-3) and presence of blood
in feces were recorded at least twice weekly.  Pigs that died were weighed and
a postmortem exam conducted to establish cause of death. After swine dysentery
was confirmed present among non-medicated control pigs, the controls were fed
feed containing tiamulin at 35 g/t for the final 3 weeks of the 57-day trial to
reduce unnecessary animal loss. <p>
No signs of toxicity or adverse reactions to tiamulin were observed in this
trial.<p>
The results of this trial were pooled with the other pivotal studies and
statistical analysis appears later in this summary. <p>

A field trial was conducted in a commercial swine operation in Indiana
utilizing the tiamulin premix to evaluate continuous medication at 20, 35, and
50 g/t (active ingredient) in controlling swine dysentery in pigs housed in a
facility in which the disease repeatedly occurred. <p>
A total of 224 crossbred barrows and gilts average 50.2 lbs were randomly
allotted to 8 pens in each of 2 similar adjacent rooms in a completely confined
growing-finishing facility.  Pens in these rooms were formed by solid
partitions over a completely slotted floor. <p>
In 3 of the 4 test treatments, pigs were continuously fed feed mixed to
contain tiamulin at 20, 35, and 50 g/t over the total 13-week test period. The
fourth treatment, nonmedicated controls, was maintained as such for five weeks
after the start of the trial when swine dysentery was diagnosed present on the
basis of clinical signs and observations at necropsy. Control pigs were then
fed tiamulin at 35 g/t to test end. <p>
Observations and ratings for diarrhea (0-3) and the presence of blood in
the feces were recorded at least once weekly.  Pigs which died were weighed and
a postmortem examination performed to determine cause of death.
Results of the 91-day trial are summarized in the following table.<p>
No signs of adverse reactions or toxicity due to tiamulin were
observed. <p>
Results of this study were pooled with results from the other pivotal
studies and statistical analysis appears later in this summary. <p>

<B>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</B> <P>
Statistical analysis of the most meaningful parameters consistent among the
trials was conducted.  The parameters were percent test days with diarrhea,
percent pig days with diarrhea and average diarrhea scores. <ul><p>
<li>a.  Because of the number of 0 percentages and other small percentages, the
arcsin of the square root of the proportion was used to transform the data.
The value of 1/(4 X n) was substituted for zero values before transformation.<P>
<li>b.  The use of Bartlett's test for homogeneity of variance found that the
variances from location to location are homogeneous (P&#62;.005) for all
parameters.  No weighted analysis was necessary.<P>
<li>c.  An analysis of variance of the transformed data included effects for
location, reps within location, treatment, treatment by location and error.
For the three parameters analyzed, the treatment by location effect was 
always significant (P&#60;.20) and was used to test the treatment effect, 
which were all significant (P&#60;. 01).<P>
<li>d.  Least square means derived from these analyses were subjected to
model fitting, both linear plateau models as well as polynomial models. Two
models, linear and Model III-2 (linear response from 0 - 35 gm/ton and plateau
from 35 to 50 gm/ton), showed nearly equal characteristics of optimum fit for
all parameters. Both models had R-squares greater than .93, all had
coefficients that significantly contributed to the model and all had
insignificantly little variation left to explain by fitting a different model.
The linear model indicated the optimum dose to be 50 gm/ton whereas the Model
III-2 indicated 35 gm/ton. Observing the means and graphs, it appeared that
the response at 50 gm/ton was somewhere between the plateau and a straight
linear relationship. It is not generally recommended to use pairwise testing
in dose titration studies to determine the optimum dose, but in this case, the
lack of significance between the 35 and 50 gm/ton levels (P&#62;.40) would point
to 35 gm/ton being a sufficient dose. </ul><p>
<B>(2) Corroborative Studies</B><p>
Four trials involving 673 pigs are included as supporting evidence
of effectiveness of tiamulin for the control of swine dysentery. These trials
were conducted in Iowa (2), Missouri, and Wisconsin. <p>
Tiamulin was tested at concentrations ranging from 20 to 
50 g/t in the feed. Each trial included infected nonmedicated controls and
3 of the 4 trials included a positive control treatment (lincomycin). <p>
The results of these trials support the conclusions reached in the pivotal
efficacy studies.<p>
No adverse reactions to tiamulin were observed in these trials. <p>

The purpose of this trial was to evaluate tiamulin at 35 g/t in feed for
the control of swine dysentery. Mixed breed barrows and gilts averaging 72.4
lbs and about 15 weeks of age were randomly allotted 8 per pen to 12 pens.
Three pens were nonmedicated controls; 9 pens were fed tiamulin at 35 g/t
beginning after deliberate infection on Test Day 0. Pigs were weighed
individually on Test Days -2, 49, and at test end on Day 70. Daily
observations were made and pen groups rated for diarrhea and presence of bloody
feces. Two pigs per pen (25&#37;) were checked for spirochetes by dark field
microscopic examination of rectal swabs taken on Test Days 0, 49 and 63.
Bacterial culture of swab material for <I>T. hyodysenteriae</I>&#160;was also performed on
Days 49 and 63 and on pigs with bloody feces on other days. Results of the
70-day trial are summarized below. <p>

This field trial was conducted to evaluate continuous tiamulin medication
at 20, 35, and 50 g/t for effectiveness in controlling swine dysentery under
practical conditions on a farm with a history of the disease. <p>
A total of 367 crossbred pigs, approximately half barrows and half gilts,
and averaging 89 lbs were sorted by weight and origin and assigned to a total
of 8 pens in an open-front Cargill-type finishing facility. There were two
pens per treatment. The nonmedicated control treatment was maintained until
about six weeks after the start of the trial when swine dysentery was diagnosed
as present on the basis of clinical signs and confirmed present on the basis of
postmortem examination of dead test pigs submitted to the state veterinary
diagnostic laboratory. Control pigs were then treated with tiamulin in the
drinking water at 60 ppm for 5 days and put on a diet containing tiamulin at 35
g/t to test end. <p>
Observations and ratings for diarrhea (0-3) and the presence of blood in
the feces were recorded at least twice weekly. Pigs that died were weighed and
a postmortem examination performed to determine cause of death.
Pleuropneumonia was a complicating factor in this trial. <p>
Pigs were withdrawn from medication and removed from the trial on a
pen-by-pen basis as they approached market weight or between 56 and 81 days
after the start. Test results are summarized in the following table. <p>
Continuous medication with tiamulin in the feed at 20, 35 and 50 g/t was
effective in controlling signs of swine dysentery in this trial. Apparent
weight gain response to levels of tiamulin in controlling swine dysentery may
have been confounded by pneumonia in this trial. <p>
No signs of adverse reaction or toxicity due to tiamulin were
observed. <p>

A field effectiveness trial was conducted to evaluate tiamulin at 35 g/t
for controlling a natural infection of swine dysentery an a commercial swine
operation. Lincomycin at 40 g/t was used as a positive control treatment. One
pen of nonmedicated controls was used to show that the disease was present in
the facility. Swine dysentery was confirmed present in the control pigs on the
basis of clinical signs observed during the 114-day trial and on the basis of
gross lesions and the presence of <i>Treponema hyodysenteriae</i>&#160;in 
the colonic tissues of a control pig killed for necropsy at test end. <p>
All pigs were rated for clinical signs of swine dysentery at least twice
weekly throughout the test. Weight gains and feed consumption were determined
on test days 65 and 114. Fecal material collected by rectal swabs from 5 pigs
per pen on test days 1 and 65 and from all pigs on test day 114 were examined
for the presence of spirochetes by microscopic examination and/or for
<i>Treponema hyodysenteriae</i>&#160;by bacterial culturing.<p>

<B>(1) Pivotal Studies (Three Trials: P-8-14-LT, P-9-3-NT, P-8-15-LT) </B><p>
Three controlled trials with a total of 300 pigs, at an average initial
weight of 23.5 lbs, were conducted in three states to demonstrate the
effectiveness of tiamulin for increasing rate of weight gain to 125 lbs body
weight. Tiamulin was evaluated at levels of 2.5 to 40 g/t in the diet. The 0, 
10 and 20 g/t treatments were common to all three trials, while the 40 g/t
level was tested in two trials. <p>
Analyses of combined data from the three pivotal studies examined average
daily gain and feed conversion values to market weight only for the 0, 10, 20,
and 40 g/t treatment groups due to the imbalance in dose groups from location
to location. Tiamulin at 10 g/t was found in the combined analysis to have
significantly (p&#61;.001) increased average daily gain. Feed conversion was not
significantly different among treatments. The least squares means and standard

The purpose of this trial was to evaluate tiamulin at 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 g/t
vs. nonmedicated controls for effect on growth performance of swine. <p>
One hundred-twenty crossbred pigs averaging 24 lbs were randomly assigned
to pens by weight, sex and sire. There were 6 pigs per pen, 2 pens of barrows
and 2 pens of gilts per treatment listed below. Treatments were randomly
assigned to pens within replications in this test of randomized block design.
Diets composed largely of grain sorghum and soybean meal were self-fed
throughout with feeds formulated to contain 18, 16, and 14&#37; protein fed from
the start to 50 lbs, from 50 to 125 lbs and from 125 lbs to market weight
(200-225 lbs), respectively.<p>
Nonmedicated pigs were used as a negative control treatment. A 25&#37;
tiamulin premix was used to provide tiamulin at 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 g/t in feed
which was self-fed to 125 lbs. Following withdrawal of test drugs,
nonmedicated feed was fed to market weight. The results of this growth test
are summarized below for the total pericd of feeding to market weight (average
210 lbs). <p>

<B>5. SAFETY</B><p>
The safety of DENAGARD (tiamulin) has been demonstrated in safety and
effectiveness trials. A total of 1254 pigs received tiamulin in efficacy
trials in which tiamulin was fed at levels up to 50 g/t, for as long as 114
days. In none of the trials were any signs of toxicity or adverse reactions to
tiamulin observed. <p>
A series of well controlled studies are available to establish safety in
the target species using both technical (unformulated) tiamulin and the water
soluble (formulated) drug. These studies are discussed in the FOI Summary for
DENAGARD Soluble Antibiotic NADA 134-644. <p>
Experimental tiamulin premix formulations used in some efficacy and safety 
studies were shown in bioequivalence tests (cross-over blood level studies) 
to be equivalent to the formulation proposed for marketing.<p>
A study to evaluate the safety of long term administration of tiamulin in
the feed of swine was conducted by the Squibb Agricultural Research Center,
E.R. Squibb and Sons, Inc., Three Bridges, New Jersey. <p>
Male and female pigs averaging about 32 lbs. (14.8 kg) were fed feed
containing tiamulin at 0, 40, 120 and 200 g/t continuously for 99 days when the
pigs averaged about 206 lbs. (93.7 kg). These levels of medication are greater
than 1, 3 and 5X the highest proposed use level of 35 g/t. There were 8 pigs
per treatment level (32 total pigs) in the trial.<p>
Weight gains and feed consumption were measured periodically throughout the
test period. Blood samples and urine specimens were collected on Test Days -6,
0, 29, 57, 85 and 99. Urine samples were tested for pH, specific gravity,
protein, ketones, glucose and sediment (microscopic exam). Blood glucose,
calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum
glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) were determined. Hematologic examinations
included hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, white blood cell count,
differential white cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, platelet count
and clotting time.<p>
At necropsy, liver, kidneys, adrenal, heart, spleen and thyroids were
weighed. Histological examinations were made of the following tissues:
spleen, liver, kidneys, thyroid/parathyroid, skeletal muscle, heart, lung,
stomach (fundic and pyloric portions), duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon
and any tissue that did not appear normal on gross examination. Bone marrow
smears taken at necropsy were also examined. <p>
There were no drug-related changes in any of the clinical laboratory
parameters tested. Organ weights were not different between treatments. The
results of examinations for gross and microscopic pathology did not indicate
any drug-related changes. Pigs fed tiamulin at 40, 120 and 200 g/t for 99 days
gained weight more rapidly and efficiently observed on medicated pigs. No
adverse reactions to the drug were observed.<p>
<B>6. HUMAN SAFETY</B><p>
<B>a. TOXICITY TESTS</B><p>
In addition to several short-term toxicity studies in mice, pigs, rats,
rabbits, dogs, chickens, and turkeys with graded doses of tiamulin, the
following pivotal toxicity studies were conducted to demonstrate the safe and
effective use of tiamulin:  one-year feeding study in dogs, a lifetime feeding
study in mice, a lifetime feeding study in rats, a three-generation
reproduction and teratology study in rats, a rabbit teratology study, and
fertility studies in male and female rats. These studies are discussed in
detail in the FOI Summary for NADA 134-644 (DENAGARD Soluble
Antibiotic).<p>
<B>b. SAFE CONCENTRATION OF RESIDUE </B><p>
The tolerance for total tiamulin residues in edible tissue of swine is
established in 21 CFR 556.738. For a discussion of the tolerance calculation,
see the FOI Summary for NADA 134-644. <p>
<B>c. METABOLISM AND RESIDUE STUDIES</B> <ul><p>
<LI>(1) Results of metabolism studies of tiamulin in rats and the target
species are found in the FOI Summary for NADA 134-644 as well as a discussion
of major metabolites, selection of the marker residue (8-alpha-hydroxymutilin),
and the validated regulatory (GC) and confirmatory (GC-MS) methods for
detection of the marker substance in the target tissue, swine liver. <p>
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions, a description of
the regulatory method for detection and confirmation of residues of tiamulin is
filed in the Feed Additives Analytical Manual on display in FDA's Freedom of
Information Public Room (Room 12A-30), 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD
20857. <p>
<LI>(2) A withdrawal period of 2 days for the use of tiamulin in the control of
swine dysentery was established in a residue depletion study in which 22 male
and 22 female feeder pigs weighing 37.5 to 61.5 kg received feed containing
tiamulin at the maximum proposed dosage of 35 g/t. The medicated diet was fed
for 10 days to 16 pigs and for 18 days to the remaining 28 pigs. Both 10 and
18 day feeding provided steady-state residue data and residue data from both
groups were used to determine the withdrawal period. The daily drug intakes
were in the range from 1.7 to 2.1 mg/kg BW. Groups of 8 to 12 pigs were
slaughtered at 2, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hours after cessation of medication. Liver
samples were collected from each pig for the determination of
8-alpha-hydroxymutilin residues by an approved determinative method. The
recovery of 400 ppb 8-alpha-hydroxymutilin in 5 fortified control liver samples
ranged from 78.8 to 100&#37; and averaged 86.5&#37;. The mean values for marker
residues of 8-alpha-hydroxymutilin in the target tissue (liver) of the
medicated swine (males and females were equally represented) are shown in the
following table.<p>

Based on these data, a withdrawal time of two days was assigned using the
residue concentration corresponding to the 99&#37; statistical tolerance limit with
95&#37; confidence and the tolerance of 400 ppb for the marker residue.<p>
<LI>(3) A zero day withdrawal period for the use of tiamulin to increase rate
of weight gain in pigs from weaning to 125 pounds body weight was established
in a residue depletion study in which 12 male and 12 female feeder pigs
weighing 25.0 to 31.5 kg received feed containing tiamulin at the level of 10
g/t for 10 days. The daily drug intakes were in the range from 0.5 to 0.6
mg/kg BW. Groups of 8 pigs were slaughtered at 8, 12 and 16 hours after 
cessation of medication. Liver samples were collected from
each pig for the determination of 8-alpha-hydroxymutilin residues by the
approved determinative method. The recovery of 100-400 ppb
8-alpha-hydroxymutilin in 13 fortified control liver samples ranged from
74.8 to 114.0&#37; and averaged 96.6&#37;. The mean values for marker residues of

<B>7. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</B><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and demonstrate that
DENAGARD (tiamulin) PREMIXES (Type A Medicated Articles) when used in swine
feeds under the proposed conditions of use, are safe and effective for 1) the
control of swine dysentery associated with <i>Treponema hyodysenteriae
</i>&#160;susceptible to tiamulin; 2) increased rate of weight gain from
weaning to 125 pounds body weight. <p>
The basis of approval for human food safety for this original new animal
drug application was based on contemporary standards. Several short-term
toxicity studies in mice, pigs, rats, rabbits, dogs, chickens, and turkeys with
graded doses of tiamulin, and a pivotal toxicity study were conducted to
demonstrate the safe use of tiamulin: one-year feeding study in dogs, a liftime
feeding study in mice, a lifetime feeding study in rats, a three-generation
reproduction and teratology study in rats, a rabbit teratology study, and
fertility studies in male and female rats. These studies are discussed in
detail in the FOI Summary for NADA 134-644 (DENAGARD Soluble Antibiotic). The
tolerance for total tiamulin residues in edible tissue of swine is established
in 21 CFR 556.738. A residue depletion study for the swine dysentery indicated
use established a 2-day withdrawal period. An additional residue depletion
study for the increase in weight gain use established 0-day withdrawal. <p>
The requirements of 21 CFR Section 558.15 were met for use of tiamulin in
swine feed to 50 g/t. These requirements were met by determining that tiamulin
fed to swine did not significantly increase the Salmonella shedding or increase
the frequency of antibacterial drug resistance in Salmonella or indigenous
coliform bacteria. <p>
The agency concluded that the data submitted in support of this application
have satisfied the human food safety requirements.<p>
DENAGARD (tiamulin) PREMIXES (Type A Medicated Articles) are classified
over-the-counter because adequate directions can be written for safe and
effective use by non-veterinarians. Safe use has been demonstrated by data
submitted to the application relative to the target animal, edible products
from treated animals, and the drug's impact on the environment. The labeling
carries appropriate warning, caution, and contraindication statements to
support safe use.<p>
Effective use by non-veterinarians can be expected because the swine
producer has the ability to accurately judge the need for the control of swine
dysentery and for the need to use DENAGARD (tiamulin) PREMIX for increased rate
of weight gain from weaning to 125 pounds bodyweight. Mixing of the drug in
swine feed is clearly described in the labeling and there is reasonable
certainty that the conditions of use on the label will be followed.<p>

Forty naturally parasitized yearling cattle were used in a dose titration study
of levamisole pour-on conducted by Pitman-Moore, Inc. under the supervision of
J. Guerrero, D.V.M., PhD. The animals were randomly divided into groups of ten
cattle each and given a single treatment of levamisole pour-on at doses of
either 0 (untreated control), 7.5, 10.0 or 12.5 mg levamisole/kg body weight
applied to the unprepared skin of the dorsal mid-line. All cattle were
necropsied seven days after treatment for a determination of controlled
anthelmintic efficacy. The results are given below.<p>

<B>2. Corroborative Dose Titration Trial - Brazil</B><p>

A dose-range evaluation of levamisole 20&#37; pour on in naturally infected cattle
was conducted by Alvimar Jose da Costa, D.V.M. at the Veterinary School of
Jaboticabal, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Twenty-four crossbred calves were divided into
four groups with five calves per group and treated with levamisole pour-on
applied topically to the back of the animals at doses of 0 (untreated
control), 5.0, 7.5, 10 or 15 mg levamisole/kg body weight. The animals were

<B>3. Corroborative Titration and Comparative Trial - Scotland</B><p>

An experiment was conducted by J. Bogan and J. Armour, University of Glasgow,
Scotland, in which the efficacy of levamisole pour-on at three dose rates
against artificially infected <I>Ostertagia ostertagi</I>&#160;in calves was compared with
that of levamisole hydrochloride (NILVERM&#174;, ICI, Ltd.) injected subcutaneously.
Twenty calves were randomly divided into five groups of four calves each on the
basis of body weight and each group was infected orally with 70,000 <I>O. ostertagi</I>&#160;
third stage larvae (L3). Twenty one days after infection the animals
were treated as described below and slaughtered seven days later. Post mortem
worm counts and fecal samples taken before treatment and at slaughter were
examined for the presence of <I>O. ostergati</I>. The results are given below:<p>

<B>B. Dose Confirmation Studies</B><p>
Five controlled trials (three pivotal and two corroborative) were conducted to
confirm the effective dose of levamisole pour-on at 10 mg/kg as a topical
anthelmintic for cattle.<p>
An individual summary of each controlled trial is presented below.<p>
<B>1. Pivotal Dose Confirmation Study</B><p>
A comparative study was conducted under the supervision of J. Guerrero, D.V.M.,
Ph.D., Pitman-Moore, Inc., Washington Crossing, New Jersey. A total of 42 naturally
parasitized cattle approximately six months of age or less and weighing 142 to
381 lbs (64.5 to 173.2 kg) were randomly allocated to three groups with 14
cattle per group. Group I served as non-treated controls. Group II received
levamisole pour-on at a dose of 10 mg levamisole/kg of body weight applied
directly to one spot on the normal skin of the dorsal mid-line of the lumbar
region of the animal's back, utilizing a hypodermic syringe without a needle.
Group III was given a single injection of an approved 13.65&#37; levamisole phosphate
injectable solution at a dose of 6 mg levamisole/kg body weight administered
subcutaneously in the mid neck region. All animals were necropsied seven to
eight days after treatment. The results are given below:<p>

Since the anthelmintic efficacy was comparable with each dosage form of
levamisole, it was concluded that the levamisole pour-on is equally as
effective as the injectable form. No signs of local irritation or systemic
side effects were observed in any of the treated cattle.<p>
 
<B>2.  Pivotal Dose Confirmation Study - Cold Weather</B><p>
A controlled efficacy study of levamisole pour-on, applied during cold weather,
was conducted by J. Guerrero, D.V.M., Ph.D., at Pitman-Moore, Inc., Washington
Crossing,  New Jersey. A total of 20 naturally parasitized beef type cattle of various
breeds and breed mixtures, one year old or less, and weighing 198 to 470.8 lbs
(90 to 214 kg) were used. Ten calves received a single topical application of
levamisole pour-on at a dosage of 10 mg levamisole/kg of body weight and ten
calves served as non-treated controls. Levamisole pour-on was applied directly
on the unprepared skin on the back (lumbar region) using a hypodermic syringe
without a needle when the ambient temperature was approximately 24.8&#176;F to 44.6&#176;F 
(-4&#176;C to &#43;7&#176;C). Necropsies were performed seven to nine days after
treatment and included equal numbers of treated and control animals. The
results are shown in the summary table located at the end of this section. It
was concluded in this study that cold weather did not adversely effect the
anthelmintic efficacy of levamisole pour-on. No side effects or skin
irritation were observed at any time after treatment.<p>
<B>3. Dose Confirmation Study - Pilot Trial</B><p>
In a pilot trial, the controlled anthelmintic efficacy of levamisole pour-on in
cattle was determined by J. Guerrero, D.V.M., Ph.D., Pitman-Moore, Inc., Washington
Crossing, New Jersey. Six yearling cattle naturally parasitized and weighing 227 to
312 lbs (103.2 to 141.8 kg) were used. Three cattle were treated with
levamisole pour-on at a dose of 10 mg levamisole per kg of body weight directly
of the skin of the back utilizing a hypodermic syringe without a needle. Three
cattle were similarly given a placebo treatment of the vehicle only (controls)
at the recommended rate, 5 mL/100 kg of body weight. Necropsies were performed
seven or eight days after treatment. The results are given in the summary
table located at the end of this section. No local or systemic side effects
were observed.<p>
<B>4. Corroborative Study - Belgium</B><p>
A controlled efficacy trial of levamisole pour-on on calves artificially
infected with <I>Dictyocaulus viviparous</I>&#160;was conducted under the supervision of
D. Thienpont, D.V.M. at Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium. Twenty eight days
post infection the calves were treated with levamisole pour-on applied mid-back
at a dose of 10 mg levamisole/kg body weight (three calves) and a group of five
calves served as untreated controls. The animals were necropsied 14 days after
treatment for a determination of anthelmintic efficacy. The results are
included in the summary table located at the end of this section.<p>
<B>5. Corroborative Study - South Africa</B><p>
A controlled trial was conducted under the supervision of Dr. B. Van Der
Westhuizen, Janssen Pharmaceutica, South Africa.  Eighteen young six to ten
week old Friesian type calves were artificially infected with <I>Haemonchus placei</I>&#160;
(L3) and <I>Ostertagi ostertagi</I>, <I>Oesophagostomum radiatum</I>&#160;
(L4) and <I>Cooperia</I>&#160;spp.
Twenty eight days after the initial infection, levamisole pour-on at 10 mg
levamisole/kg body weight was applied topically to the backs of eleven calves
while seven calves served as untreated controls. Twenty one days post-treatment
the animals were sacrificed and the efficacy against each parasite was
determined.  The percent of parasite load before and after treatment with
levamisole pour-on at 10 mg/kg was <I>H. placei</I>&#160;67.8&#37;, 
<I>O. ostertagi </I>&#160;76.3&#37;, <I>Oesophagostomum radiatum </I>&#160;88.9&#37;

<B>C. Clinical Trials</B><p>

<B>1. Pivotal U.S. Clinical Trial</B><p>

Nine veterinarians in different geographic locations of the United States
participated in clinical field investigations of the use of levamisole pour-on
in beef cattle. The trial, conducted under the general supervision of Daniel
T. Ruth, V.M.D., Pitman-Moore, Inc. consisted of the following investigators:
J. Brown, D.V.M., Univ. of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois; J. Clark, D.V.M., Brawley,
California; H. Lloyd, D.V.M., Arcadia, Florida; L. Moxey, D.V.M., Sheridan, Wyoming;
R. Pedersen, D.V.M., Beatrice, Nebraska; D. Ruth, V.M.D., Washington Crossing, 
New Jersey; W. Vollmar, D.V.M., Montgomery, Minnesota; D. Waters, D.V.M., 
McMinnville, Oregon; S. White, D.V.M., Arkansas City, Kansas.<p>
Healthy beef cattle requiring routine anthelmintic treatment were selected for
this study. The cattle, representing a variety of breeds ranged in age from
one month to 13 years and in weight from 110 to 2,200 lbs (50 to 1,000 kg).
Levamisole pour-on was applied topically to the backs of 1,084 cattle at the
rate of 5 mL/100 kg (10 mg levamisole per kg body weight) while 218 cattle
served as placebo controls and received the vehicle only, topically, at an
equivalent volume. Treatments were administered by the investigators and
cattle owners under a wide variety of environmental conditions. Ambient
temperatures at the time of treatment ranged from 0  &#176;F (Minnesota,
February 1984) to 110  &#176;F (California, August 1983). A total of 410
cattle (331 drug treated and 79 placebo control) naturally infected with
parasites were selected to evaluate anthelmintic activity by fecal egg per gram
counts (EPG) determined before treatment and seven to 16 days after
treatment.<p>
Overall efficacy (calculated by averaging the percent efficacy of all cases)
was 92&#37; for levamisole pour-on versus 12&#37; for the formulation vehicle (placebo
control). There was no significant difference in efficacy between levamisole
pour-on administered under cold or warm weather conditions. Each investigator,
excluding Dr. Ruth due to vested interest or bias, rated the levamisole pour-on
treatment as good to excellent with regard to clinical acceptability.
Transient, self-limiting reactions were observed in both the drug treated and
placebo treated groups; however, none of these effects was considered by the
investigators to be clinically significant. These side effects were
predominantly flaking skin, 8&#37; and salivation, 4&#37;.<p>
<B>2. Pivotal Clinical Study - Simulated Heavy Rain</B><p>
A clinical trial was conducted by L.A. Hanrahan, D.V.M., Auburn University, 
Auburn, Alabama,
to examine the effects of simulated rain representing a worst case severe rain
condition on levamisole pour-on treatment. One hundred and forty-two cattle
were randomly divided into three groups and were treated as follows: one group
of 46 cattle received a single application of levamisole pour-on on the dry
skin of the back at a dose of 10 mg levamisole/kg body weight; a second group
of 49 cattle were likewise treated with levamisole pour-on on the dry skin of
the back and immediately exposed to six hours of non-stop simulated rain; a
third group of 47 cattle were wet down using a water hose prior to treatment
with levamisole pour-on at 10 mg levamisole/kg body weight applied to the wet
skin of the back and immediately exposed to six hours of simulated continuous
rain. Fecal material was sampled twice before treatment and seven and 14 days
after treatment for a determination of efficacy by the fecal egg per gram count
method.<p>
The results of this study indicated that the average efficacy of levamisole
pour-on, 95&#37;, is reduced when dry animals are treated and immediately exposed
to heavy rain of six hours duration (average efficacy 65&#37;) and further reduced
(to 38&#37;) if the animals are wet when treated and immediately exposed to heavy rain
for six hours.<p>
<B>3. Pivotal Clinical Study - Water Immersion</B><p>
A clinical trial was conducted by L.A. Hanrahan, D.V.M., Auburn University,
Auburn, Alabama,
in which the effects of levamisole pour-on in cattle dipped in water was
determined. One group of 48 cattle was treated with levamisole pour-on
topically along the dorsal mid line of the lumbar region at the recommended
dose of 10 mg levamisole/kg body weight and was immediately required to swim a
distance of 25 feed in water six feet deep. This treatment simulated the
dilution and agitation that could occur in a dip vat during routine feed yard
in-processing. Another group of 46 cattle were similarly treated with
levamisole pour-on at the recommended dose of (10 mg/kg) but were not dipped
and allowed to remain dry. Efficacy was determined in these 92 cattle by
comparing fecal nematode egg per gram counts sampled twice before treatment and
seven to 14 days after treatment.<p>
The results of the study indicted that the efficacy of levamisole pour-on was
reduced (72&#37; efficacy) in those animals immediately dipped in water following
treatment as compared to those animals that were not dipped (95&#37; efficacy).<p>
<B>4. Corroborative Clinical Studies</B><p>
Studies conducted in Mexico, Belgium, and Australia corroborate the high degree
of efficacy obtained in the pivotal U.S. clinical trials. No side effects were
reported in the Belgian or Australian studies while in trials conducted in
Mexico, the only side effect reported was dry hair at the treatment site in 37
of 355 treated cattle (10.4&#37;). The animals observed two months after treatment
showed no visible lesions or signs of treatment. There was no evidence of
systemic toxicity, skin irritation or discomfort in any of the treated
animals.<p>

<B>V. Target Animal Safety:</B><p>
A series of studies were conducted in the United States and abroad to identify
the toxicologic profile of levamisole pour-on in cattle.<p>
<B>A. Pivotal Toxic Syndrome Cattle</B><p>
A safety study of levamisole pour-on was conducted in cattle at Pitman-Moore,
Inc., Washington Crossing,  New Jersey, under the supervision of B.P. Seibert, V.M.D.
Twenty Hereford or Hereford/Angus cattle (10 heifers and 10 steers)
approximately one year old and weighing 393 to 611 lbs (178.7 to 277.6 kg) were
used. The cattle were allocated into five groups, two heifers and two steers
per group and given a single topical application of levamisole pour-on to the
mid-backline at doses of 0 (non-treated control), 10, 30, 50 or 100 mg/kg
corresponding to 1x, 3x, 5x, or 10x the recommended rate of 10 mg of levamisole
per kg of body weight. The cattle were observed on a blind basis for any
clinical signs of side effects continuously for eight hours after treatment and
twice the following day. The cattle were also observed on days three, seven,
ten and 14 after treatment for any signs of local reactions at the treatment
site (dorsal mid-line).<p>
No mortality occurred during the study. Side effects were not observed
throughout the evaluation period in any of the cattle in the 0, 1x (except for
one isolated occurrence of salivation) or the 3x groups. In the 5x and 10x
groups, salivation, restlessness and muscle fasciculations were the most
prevalent clinical signs occurring at three hours or more after treatment and
lasting for five or more hours. Diarrhea, tail raising, incoordination and
excitability occurred less frequently in these groups. All of the clinical
side effects subsided within 24 hours post treatment. Superficial epidermal
flakes along the dorsal midline were observed in 11 of 16 levamisole pour-on
treated cattle and also in one untreated control animal beginning seven to 14
days after treatment and lasting seven days or less.<p>
There were no signs of erythema, edema, changes in hair coat quality or
discomfort associated with this flaking, and the incidence and severity did not
appear to be dose related. It was concluded that the overdosage of levamisole
pour-on in cattle are likely to cause mild to severe signs of toxicity, similar
to those seen with other dosage forms of levamisole. These reactions are
generally dosage related, occur three hours or more after treatment, may
persist for five hours or longer, and will completely subside within 24
hours.<p>
<B>B. Pivotal Organophosphate Compatibility</B><p>
The effect of levamisole pour-on and a concomitantly applied organophosphate
insecticide on erythrocyte cholinesterase activity was determined in a study
conducted under the supervision of B.P. Seibert, V.M.D., Pitman-Moore, Inc. While
levamisole does not inhibit cholinesterase activity, the purpose of this
experiment was to determine whether the pour-on formulation would enhance the
absorption of an organophosphate resulting in a greater depression of
cholinesterase activity. Eight beef cattle weighing 370 to 552 lbs (168 to 251
kg) were divided into two groups of four cattle each. One group was treated
with WARBEX&#174; (13.2&#37; famphur, American Cyanamid), a commonly used cattle
grubicide, applied topically on the mid-back at the recommended rate (1 oz/200
lb). The second group was similarly treated with WARBEX plus levamisole pour
on at the rate of 10 mg levamisole/kg body weight, applied at the same site.
All cattle were observed at varying intervals for up to three weeks after
treatment. Whole blood samples were collected approximately one week before
treatment and 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 hours and seven days after treatment for
determination of erythrocyte cholinesterase activity using the colorimetric
method of Ellman, <I>et al, (Biochem Pharmacol</I>&#160;7:88-95, 1961).<p>
All cattle remained in good general health throughout the experiment. There
were no signs of organophosphate toxicosis or local side effects in any of the
treated cattle. No significant (P less than .05) erythrocyte cholinesterase
inhibition occurred after treatment in either group and there were no
significant (P less than 0.05) differences in cholinesterase activity between
the two treatment groups at any sampling time. It was concluded from this
study that the application of levamisole pour-on does not increase the
absorption of a topically applied organophosphate insecticide in cattle as
measured by erythrocyte cholinesterase activity.<p>
<B>C. Acute Toxicity Trials - Scotland</B><p>
Four acute toxicity trials were conducted by Robert Young &#38; Co. Ltd.,
Glasgow, Scotland, using a total of 34 cattle of different weights and breeds
(Blue-Grey, Fresian, Simmental cross, Angus, Hereford, Luing and Shorthorn).
The animals were treated topically on the back with the levamisole pour-on
formulation at doses of 60, 80, 100, 150, and 170 mg/kg body weight and were
observed for 24 hours following treatment for physical behavior and side
effects. It was concluded from these trials that levamisole pour-on has an
adequate safety margin and that the symptoms of toxicity were typical of those
associated with overdosing with levamisole.<p>
<B>D. Acute Toxicity Trials - South Africa</B><p>
An acute toxicity trial was conducted under the supervision of Dr. B. Van Der
Westhuizen, Janssen Pharmaceutica, South Africa, to determine the minimum
lethal dose and the maximum tolerated dose of levamisole pour-on in calves of
both sexes. Two calves each (one male, one female) were given levamisole pour
on at doses of 60, 70, 100, 120, 140 and 160 mg levamisole/kg body weight and
examined clinically every hour for the first 24 hours after treatment and then
three times per day for the duration of the trial. It was concluded that
levamisole pour-on has a wide margin of safety between the therapeutic dose (10
mg/kg) and the dose at which symptoms of toxicity were first observed (70
mg/kg) and a lethal dose (160 mg/kg). All symptoms of toxicity e.g., tailraising, 
salivation, diarrhea, muscle fasciculations and staggering were
typical of those associated with overdosing of other formulations of
levamisole.<p>
<B>E. Double Dose Field Trial - South Africa</B><p>
A safety trial was conducted under the general supervision of Dr. B. Van Der
Westhuizen, Janssen Pharmaceutica, South Africa, in which a total of 459 cattle
were treated with levamisole pour-on at double the recommended dose, 20 mg
levamisole/kg body weight, applied topically on the back. All animals were
observed for at least six hours post treatment for any signs of toxicity.
Thereafter, the owners were requested to observe the animals daily and record
any side effects or mortalities for at least 30 days posttreatment. The
treated animals included 158 cows, 147 calves, 6 bulls and 148 castrated males
at six different trial locations representing a variety of management
practices. No adverse reactions were noted during the 30 observation period in
any of the treated animals. Thus, it is concluded that levamisole pour-on at
double the dose was safe for all classes of cattle irrespective of age, sex or
management condition.<p>
<B>F. Skin Irritation - South Africa</B><p>
A skin irritation trial of levamisole pour-on after dermal application in
cattle was conducted under the supervision of Dr. B. Van Der Westhuizen,
Janssen Pharmaceutica, South Africa. Levamisole pour-on was administered
topically via an automatic syringe at dose rates of 10 mg levamisole/kg body
weight (169 cattle) and 20 mg/kg (264 cattle). All animals were observed at
bi-weekly intervals for up to eight weeks (56 days) after treatment. Although
five of 169 (2.9&#37;) of the animals treated showed signs of skin irritation, the
reactions were mild and of a passing nature.<p>
<B>G. Skin Irritation - Scotland</B><p>
A study was conducted by Robert Young &#38; Co., Ltd., Glasgow, Scotland, to
determine the effects of high doses of levamisole on the skin of cattle. A
total of 22 cattle were used and given levamisole pour-on administered
topically to the back at doses of 60, 80, 100, 150 or 170 mg levamisole/kg body
weight. It was concluded that at six, eight or ten times the recommended
therapeutic dose rate, only slight superficial skin reactions (dandruff) were
observed. At 15 or 17 times the recommended rate, the reaction was more
pronounced, but had nearly disappeared two weeks after treatment. No hair loss
was observed.<p>
<B>H. Semen Quality - Belgium</B><p>
The effect of levamisole pour-on on semen quality was evaluated in a study
conducted by R. Debruyne, D.V.M. and L. Desplenter, D.V.M., Janssen Pharmaceutica,
Belgium. Five bulls in good clinical health, with a proven history of normal
fertility and semen quality, were given levamisole pour-on topically at the
therapeutic dose, 10 mg levamisole/kg of body weight. Semen quality
evaluated twice before treatment and four to five times after treatment for
about two months showed no adverse effect on any of the following parameters measures: 
sperm, mass movement of sperm cells, percent of dead sperm cells, morphology 
and after deep freezing, percent motility at thawing. No local side effects 
or skin irritation were observed following treatment.<p>
<B>I. Safety to Pregnant Cattle - Belgium</B><p>
Data regarding the safety of levamisole pour-on in pregnant cattle were
compiled by L. Desplenter, D.V.M., Janssen Pharmaceutica, Belgium, from the
results of one pilot trial and three previously conducted experiments
investigating the immunomodulating activity of levamisole and its beneficial
effects on the immunomodulating activity of levamisole and its beneficial
effects on the survival and morbidity of calves during the neo and postnatal
period. In a pilot trial, ten cows were treated once per week with levamisole
pour-on at 10 mg levamisole/kg body weight topically during the last four weeks
of pregnancy. No local or general side effects were observed and delivery and
health status of the calves at birth were without complications.<p>
In three other larger experiments, levamisole in the pour-on formulation was
administered topically at 5 mg/kg, an immunomodulating dose level, to a total
of 496 cattle and compared to 556 placebo treated controls. Treatments were
given once weekly during the last four weeks of pregnancy. There was no
harmful effect as a result of levamisole pour-on treatment on pregnancy,
delivery, or the health status of the calves at birth. Further, mortality and
morbidity of the newborn calves were significantly reduced in the drug treated
as compared to the placebo treated group.<p>
<br>
<B>VI. Human Safety:</B><p>
<B>A. Data to Support Human Safety</B><p>
The underlying human safety data supporting the use of levamisole in cattle are
described in the Freedom of Information Summary under NADA 102-437, for
TRAMISOL levamisole phosphate Injectable Solution, 13.65&#37; (21 CFR 522.1244).
Results of a comparative study indicated that plasma levels of levamisole in
the pour-on formulation were bioequivalent to the injectable formulation at the
recommended therapeutic dose levels in cattle. Thus, it was concluded that the
use of levamisole pour-on will not significantly increase human exposure to
residues of the drug. Additional toxicity studies of levamisole pour-on and the
vehicle, diethylene glycol monbutyl ether (DGME), are contained in the subject
New Animal Drug Application and are summarized below.<p>
<B>Bioequivalency Study</B><p>
The blood bioequivalency of two formulations of levamisole in cattle was
determined in a cross-over trial conducted by Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse,
Belgium. Also measured in the same study was the plasma depletion of DGME.<p>
Ten cattle, divided into two groups of five, each group consisting of two
heifers, two dairy cows and one bull, were treated with either levamisole pour-on,
applied by pouring on the mid-backline of the animal at a rate of 10 mg
levamisole/kg, or the approved 13.65&#37; levamisole phosphate injectable solution
administered subcutaneously at the recommended dose of 6 mg levamisole
phosphate/kg (equivalent to 5.1 mg levamisole/kg). Plasma was sampled before
and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 32 and 48 hours after treatment. After a ten
day interval, treatments were crossed over and the study repeated. Plasma
samples were analyzed for levamisole using a gas chromatographic method. The
validated sensitivity of the method was 0.01 ppm.<p>
The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC 0-48h) values of 6.29 &#177;
1.74 &#181;g&#183;hour/mL for pour-on and 6.91 &#177; 1.20 &#181;g&#183;hour/mL for subcutaneous
administration were not significantly different (p is greater than .05). Thus, the systemic
availability was similar for either treatment, demonstrating that the two
dosage forms of levamisole were bioequivalent at the given therapeutic dose
levels.<p>
DGME was analyzed using a specific gas chromatographic procedure which was
shown to have a validated sensitivity of 0.1 ppm. Maximum plasma levels,
amounting to an average of 1.44 &#177 0.90 ppm were attained 1 to 4 hours
(2.7 &#177 1.2 hours) after application. Subsequent elimination from plasma
proceeded with an apparent half life of 1.3 to 3.9 hours (2.05 &#177 0.83 hours).
In most animals, plasma DGME levels were lower than 0.1 ppm within 24 hours
after application. No sex nor age related influences on the systemic
absorption of DGME was apparent. It was concluded in this evaluation that the
systemic availability of DGME was very limited and that its elimination from
plasma was rapid.<p>
<B>Levamisole pour-on</B><p>
<B>1. Acute Oral Toxicity - Mice</B><p>
The acute oral toxicity of 10&#37; levamisole pour-on and its vehicle DGME were
tested in male and female mice in a study conducted by Robert Young &#38; Co.,
Ltd., Glasgow, Scotland. In male mice, the maximum tolerated dose of
levamisole was 40 mg/kg. At higher dose levels mortality was observed. In
female mice, the maximum tolerated oral dose level was 80 mg/kg. At higher
dose levels, there appeared to be an individual difference in susceptibility to
the formulation.<p>
The maximum tolerated dose level of DGME corresponded with 1.89 mL/kg (1.8
g/kg). At 3.41 mL/kg (3.24 g/kg) mortality was observed. The toxic symptoms
observed before death included gasping, twitching, incoordination and
tremors.<p>
<B>2. Acute Oral Toxicity - Rats</B><p>
The acute oral toxicity of 10&#37; levamisole pour-on and DGME was tested in female
rats by Robert Young &#38; Co., Ltd., Glasgow, Scotland. Four female rats per
treatment group (average weight of 105 g) were anesthetized with ether and
treated by oral gavage with 10&#37; levamisole pour-on at the following doses:
100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mg/kg. Four rats per treatment group were
administered DGME orally by gavage at doses of 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.8 mL/kg
corresponding to 1.43, 1.9, 2.38, 2.85 and 3.61 g/kg. The rats were observed
for mortality up to four days after treatment.<p>
<B>3. Dermal Toxicity - Rats</B><p>
The acute dermal toxicity of 20&#37; levamisole pour-on and DGME were determined by
Robert Young &#38; Co., Ltd., Glasgow, Scotland. SD-01a female rats weighing
approximately 150g, were used in these tests. The maximum tolerated dose level
of levamisole in the pour-on formulation after dermal application was 267
mg/kg. At higher dose levels, marked but transient skin lesions were observed.
With DGME, no local or general side effects were observed even at the highest
dose administration 5 mL/kg (4.75 g/kg).<p>
<B>4. Ninety Day Topical Levamisole Pour-On - Dogs</B><p>
A three month subacute toxicity study of 20&#37; levamisole pour-on applied
topically to the backs of dogs was conducted by Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse,
Belgium. Twenty-four young and healthy purebred Beagle dogs weighing between
4.2 and 14.6 kg were used. The animals were divided into four groups with three
males and three females per group. Levamisole pour-on was applied topically on
the back of the dogs daily for 90 consecutive days at doses of 2.5, 10 and 40
mg/kg. One group of three males and three females served as untreated
controls. The parameters measured were mortality, behavior and appearance,
body weight, heart rate, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, hematology, serum
analysis, urinalysis, gross pathology, organ weights and histopathology.<p>
All 24 dogs survived the three month study. Behavior and appearance were
normal in all groups. Body weight was comparable between the control dogs and
those of the 2.5 and 10 mg/kg dosage groups. At 40 mg/kg, a weight loss
(p less than .05) was noted during the last three to four weeks of dosing. No adverse
effect was seen for heart rate, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, hematology
and urinalysis. All serum chemical values were within acceptable limits except
for a slight terminal increase of alkaline phosphatase and serum glutamic
pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) in the 40 mg/kg dosage group. No adverse effect
was noted in gross pathology, organ weights or histopathology. The no
observable effect level in this study was concluded to be 10 mg/kg.<p>
<B>Diethylene glycol monobutyl ether (DGME), Vehicle</B><p>
<B>1. Mutagenicity Assays</B><p>
The mutagenicity potential of DGME was evaluated in three short-term
genotoxicity assays performed for Pitman-Moore, Inc. The results of this Ames
<I>Salmonella</I>&#160;/Microsome, L5178Y Mouse Lymphoma and Unscheduled DNA Repair testing
and a corroborative study from the published literature conducted independently
by E.D. Thompson, <I>et al.</I> are summarized below:<p>
<B>Ames <I>Salmonella</I>&#160;/Microsome Test</B><p>
The mutagenic potential of DGME was examined in the Ames reverse mutation test
by NOTOX Pathobiology Research, The Netherlands. DGME, at concentrations up to
24 &#181;L per plate, did not reveal an increase in the number of revertant colonies
with the strains TA1537, TA 1538, TA98 and TA100 either in the presence or in
the absence of a metabolic activation system (S9-mix). However, in the same
study, a slight increase in the number of revertant colonies was found with a
strain TA1535 only in the absence of rat liver S9-mix, and only in two out of
four tests. As the increase in revertant colonies found with TA 1535 could not
be reproduced in all the tests, and as the more sensitive strain TA 100 did not
reveal an increase in the number of revertant colonies, the authors concluded
that DGME is not mutagenic towards <I>Salmonella typhimurium </I>.<p>
As the increase in the number of revertant colonies found with TA 1535 in some
tests was a point of concern for the Food and Drug Administration, a
supplementary Ames reverse mutation test was conducted by Janssen
Pharmaceutica, Belgium, for definite determination of mutagenic potential of
DGME towards the strain TA 1535. The supplemental Ames test was conducted with
DGME in triplicate using the standard strain TA 1535 in the presence and in the
absence of a metabolic activation system (S9-mix). Induction of rat liver
enzymes was obtained by intraperitoneal injection of 500 mg/kg Aroclor to five
male rats. Top agar, 0.1 mL of bacteria, S9-mix (20 and 50 &#181;L S9/plate) if
needed and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28 and 30 &#181;L DGME/plate
were sequentially added, shaken and poured onto agar plates. After incubation
in the dark at 37 degrees C during 48 hours, the number of revertant colonies
were counted. DGME did not induce a significant increase in the number of
revertant colonies beyond the solvent control incidence with or without a
metabolic activation system.<p>
<B>L5178Y Mouse Lymphoma Test</B><p>
DGME was screened for mutation at the thymidine kinase (TK) locus and at the
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) locus on L5178Y TK &#43;/-
mouse lymphoma cells in tests conducted by Microbiological Associates, Inc.,
Bethesda, Maryland. DGME produced a positive response at the TK locus both in the
presence and absence of Aroclor induced rat liver S-9. The increases in mutant
frequency were approximately three-fold in the absence of activation, but only
at concentrations of the test article greater than 3,000 &#181;g/mL. In the
presence of activation, increases in mutant frequency were approximately 2.7
fold and occurred only at concentrations greater than 5,000 &#181;g/mL. No
significant induction of mutation occurred at the HGPRT locus when the cultures
were treated with the test article either in the presence or absence of S-9
activation.<p>
Since the response was seen only at very high concentrations, viz 3,000 &#181;g/L
and above, it was postulated that the mutagenic activity might be due to a
contaminant in the DGME, possibly an oxidation product. Therefore, the mouse
lymphoma assay at the TK locus was repeated employing DGME containing 90 ppm
BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) as antioxidant. No increase in mutant frequency
was noted with DGME containing BHT at the same doses which produced a positive
response of DGME alone.<p>
<B>Unscheduled DNA Synthesis Assay</B><p>
The potential of DGME to induce unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in primary
cultures of rat hepatocytes was determined by Microbiological Associates, Inc.,
Bethesda, Maryland. Based on the results of a preliminary cytotoxicity test, DGME
was tested at eight dose levels ranging from 0.1 to 333 &#181;g/mL. The top five
doses were fully evaluated for unscheduled DNA synthesis. The results of the
UDS assay demonstrated that DGME did not evoke a significant increase in the
mean number of net nuclear grain counts (i.e., an increase of at least five
counts over the control) at any dose level. Therefore, DGME was considered
negative in this assay.<p>
<B>Mutagenicity Testing of DGME - Independent Study</B><p>
The nonmutagenic potential of DGME was confirmed in an independent study
reported in the scientific literature (Thompson, <I>et al, Environmental Health
Perspective</I>&#160;57:105-112, 1984). DGME was examined with a Tier I battery of <I>in
vitro</I>&#160;assays followed by a Tier II <I>in vivo</I>&#160;Drosophila sex-linked recessive
lethal assay. The <I>in vitro</I>&#160;battery consisted of:  <I>Salmonella</I>&#160;mutagenicity test,
the L5178Y mouse lymphoma test, a cytogenetics assay using Chinese hamster
ovary cells and the unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat hepatocytes.
Results of the <I>Salmonella</I>&#160;mutagenicity test, the cytogenetics test and the rat
hepatocyte assay were negative. A very weak positive response in the mouse
lymphoma test was found not to have mutagenic significance because of a clear
negative finding obtained in the <I>in vivo</I>&#160;Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal
assay. It was concluded in this battery of tests that DGME does not present
any genetic risk to humans.<p>
<B>2. Two Generation Reproductive Study - Rats</B><p>
An oral two generation reproductive study of DGME in Wistar rats was conducted
by Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium. DGME was administered daily through
the drinking water to male and female Wistar rats during 60 days prior to
mating and throughout mating, pregnancy and lactation for two successive
generations, each producing one litter. The dilutions of drinking water used
were 0.01 , 0.04 and 0.16 mL DGME (stock solution) per 50 mL providing
approximately doses of 0.04, 0.16 and 0.63 mL DGME per kg of body weight,
respectively. Control rats were given drinking water without DGME. Under the
conditions of this study, the reproductive performance in Wistar rats was not
affected at the doses used. In the parents, body weight gain, food
consumption, mortality, mating, pregnancy rate and duration of gestation were
not affected. Litter size, percentage of live fetuses, weight at birth and
during a three week lactation period and survival rate were comparable between
groups or considered to be within normal limits. No teratogenicity was seen.<p>
<B>3. Primary Eye Irritation - Rabbits</B><p>
The eye irritancy potential of DGME was investigated by B. Ballantyne, M.D.,
D.Sc., Ph.D., <I>J. Toxicol. - Cut. and Ocular Toxicol.</I> 3(1):7-15 (1984). 
A summary of these studies are as follows.<p>
Rabbit eye irritation studies, using instillation volumes of 0.1 mL, showed
that undiluted DGME causes moderately severe conjunctivitis, with mild
blepharitis and slightly detectable to mild diffuse keratitis. These effects
were most marked during the first 24 hours postinstillation, and thereafter,
spontaneously subsided with no residual tissue injury by 14 days. The lowest
concentration producing a detectable keratitis was DGME (25&#37; v/v), and that
causing minor transient conjunctivitis was 10&#37;. DGME (5&#37;) did not produce
local inflammation. Instilling 0.1 mL of solution resulted in measured peak
increases in intraocular tension at ten minutes ranging from 3&#37; (DGME, 1&#37;) to
63&#37; (DGME, 20&#37;). Varying the volume of DGME (10&#37;) caused measured peak
increases of intraocular pressure at 10 minutes ranging from 1&#37; (0.01 mL) to
33&#37; (.10 mL). Intraocular pressure returned to control values by one hour 
postinstillation.<p>
<B>4. Ninety-Day Oral DGME - Rats</B><p>
A 90 day subchronic oral toxicity study of DGME in Wistar rats was conducted by
Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium. One hundred and sixty Wistar rats,
less than six weeks of age at the start of the study, were used. The rats were
divided into four groups with 20 males and 20 females per group. DGME was
administered orally by gavage at doses of 0.04, 0.16, and 0.63 mL/kg of body
weight corresponding to 38, 152 and 598.5 mg/kg. One group of control rats (20
males and 20 females) received only water orally by gavage at the rate of 1 mL
per 100 g body weight. All treatments were administered daily for 90
consecutive days. The parameters measured were mortality, clinical
observations, food consumption, body weight, hematology, serum analysis,
urinalysis, gross pathology, organ weights and histopathology. From this study
it was concluded that repeated dosing of DGME in rats at 0.04 and 0.16 mL/kg is
without toxic effects. Dosing with 0.63 mL/kg resulted in slight toxic effects
especially in females consisting of marginal hematologic changes (decreased
HCT, Hgb and RBC), slight urinary effects (increased incidence of calcium 
oxalate crystals) and slight liver changes (more hydropic aspect in perilobular
area). Therefore, the highest no-observable effects level (NOEL) in rats
determined in this study was 0.16 mL/kg/day.<p>
<B>5. Ninety-Day Oral DGME - Dogs</B><p>
A 90 day subchronic oral toxicity study of DGME in dogs was conducted by
Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium. Thirty two purebred Beagle dogs
approximately five months of age were used. The dogs were divided into four
groups with four males and four females per group. DGME was administered to
three groups of dogs orally by gavage once daily for 90 consecutive days at
doses of 0.04, 0.16 or 0.63 mL/kg of body weight. These dose levels were
equivalent to 38, 152, and 598.5 mg/kg. One group of four males and four
females served as a control and received water only (1 mL/kg) at the same
frequency. The parameters measured were mortality, behavior and appearance,
food consumption, body weight, hematology, serum analysis, urinalysis, gross
pathology, organ weights and histopathology. From this study it was concluded
that repeated dosing of dogs with DGME at 0.04 mL/kg did not result in toxic
effects. Dosing at 0.16 mL/kg was a marginally toxic dose, whereas 0.63 mL/kg
was clearly toxic and fatal in half of the animals. The target organs for
toxicity were the kidneys, the liver and the gastrointestinal tract.
Therefore, 0.04 mL/kg was determined as the no-effect level from this study.<p>
<B>B. Safe Concentrations of Residues</B><p>
The safe concentration of total levamisole residues in edible tissues of cattle
are described in the Freedom of Information Summary and were previously
established in the currently approved NADAs for levamisole bolus (NADAs 91-826
and 39-356; 21 CFR 520.1242b), drench (NADAs 112-051 and 39-357; 21 CFR
520.1242a), injectable (NADAs 126-742 and 102-437; 21 CFR 522.1244)
and gel (NADA 126-237; 21 CFR 520.1242f) formulations. The tolerance for
negligible levamisole residues in edible tissues of cattle has been established
at 0.1 ppm (21 CFR Section 556.350).<p>
<B>C. Metabolism Studies</B><p>
Metabolism studies which were used to establish human safety of levamisole are
described in the Freedom of Information Summary under NADAs 126-742 and 102-437
(21 CFR 522.1244). Additional metabolism studies of the vehicle, DGME in rats
and cattle were conducted by Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium, and are
summarized below.<p>
<B>1. Metabolism of  14C DGME in Rats</B><p>
Male and female rats were dosed orally with  14C labelled DGME at 0.16 mL/kg/day
for seven days. The excretion of the radioactivity was extremely rapid,
amounting to about 85&#37; of the dose at eight hours after dosing, and was almost
complete at 24 hours after dosing. Urinary excretion of the radioactivity
accounted for 82 to 89&#37; of the dose, and excretion of 14CO2 in expired air for
about 11&#37;. The excretion in the feces was minimal. The main metabolic pathway
of DGME in rats was it oxidation to (2-butoxyethoxy)acetic acid, accounting
for about 60&#37; of the dose. Other major metabolic pathways were the oxidative
O-dealkylation, with further oxidative degradation, finally resulting in 14CO2,
and the glucuronidation of DGME. No unchanged DGME could be detected in
urine.<p>
After a seven day dosing, the elimination of the radioactivity from the tissues
showed an initial very rapid phase and a second slower phase. At 48 hours
after the last dose, less than 1&#37; of the total dose could be recovered in the
tissues. At that time, the contribution of unchanged DGME and of its major
urinary metabolites to the tissue radioactivity was very small, whereas at
least 30 to 40&#37; of the tissue radioactivity was incorporated in natural
compounds.<p>
<B>2. Metabolism of 14C-DGME in Cattle</B><p>
14C-labelled DGME was administered subcutaneously to two ruminating cattle (198
- 213 kg) at 4.0 mL/100 kg. They were sacrificed at six and 48 hours after
dosing, respectively. Peak plasma levels of unchanged DGME and of its
metabolites were reached at about one hour after dosing; then they decreased
with half-lives of one to two hours up to to eight hours after dosing, and
thereafter, the radioactivity was eliminated with a half-life of 63 hours.<p>
As in orally dosed rats, the radioactivity in cattle was excreted extremely
rapidly, mainly with the urine (84&#37; of the dose at six hours after dosing).
The metabolite pattern in urine was studied qualitatively by HPLC and mass
spectrometry, and quantitatively by radio-HPLC. The major metabolic pathway of
DGME in cattle were identical to those in rats:  oxidation to (2-butoxyethoxy)
acetic acid, the main metabolite which accounted for about 2/3 of the urinary
radioactivity in both species, glucuronidation of DGME, and O-dealkylation with
further degradation up to CO2. The glycine conjugate of (2-butoxyethoxy)
acetic acid accounted for about 5&#37; of the dose in urine of cattle, but could
not be detected in that of rats.<p>
Tissue radioactivity levels were already low at six hours after dosing,
amounting to 25.5 ppm in kidney, 9.0 ppm in liver, 1.2 ppm in fat and 0.91 ppm
in muscle. Just as in rats, the elimination of the radioactivity from bovine
tissues was very rapid. At 48 hours after dosing, radioactivity levels were
2.1 ppm in liver, 1.2 ppm in kidney, 0.29 ppm in fat and 0.13 ppm in muscle.
DGME and the major urinary metabolites were determined in liver, kidney, and
muscle by a radio-HPLC method. Just as in the rats, they accounted for only a
small part of the tissue radioactivity, whereas evidence could be presented for
the incorporation of a very small part of the administered radioactivity into
endogenous constituents.<p>
<B>D. Regulatory Methods</B><p>
The regulatory analytical method for the determination of residues of
levamisole in cattle tissues is described in the Food Additives Manual which is
on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Public Room (Room 12A-30, 5600
Fisher's Lane, Rockville, MD 20857). <p>
<B>E. Withdrawal Time</B><p>
Levamisole tissue residues in cattle following a single topical dose of
levamisole pour-on at 10 mg levamisole/kg body weight was determined in a study
conducted by Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium. Twenty two Belgian
White-Grey beef breed cattle, 11 steers and 11 heifers, ranging in weight from
843 to 1166 lbs (383 to 530 kg) were used. Four groups of five cattle each
were treated topically with the proposed commercial formulation of levamisole
pour-on. At 2, 6, 10 and 14 days after treatment, respectively, one group was
slaughtered and samples of muscle, liver, kidney and fat were collected from
each animal. On the day before treatment, two control animals (one steer and
one heifer) had been similarly sacrificed. Levamisole tissue levels were
determined using the official regulatory method for the detection of levamisole
residues. The detection limit of the gas chromatographic method was 0.01 &#181;g/g
(ppm).<p>
The results confirm that liver should be considered as the target tissue for
levamisole in cattle. From six days after application, all mean tissue levels
were at or below the established tolerance level of 0.1 ppm. Fourteen days
after treatment, residual levels of levamisole were undetectable (less than
0.01 ppm) in all tissues except liver in which levels averaged 0.017 ppm.
Based on these data, a withdrawal period of nine days is proposed. The results
of this withdrawal study are presented below.<p>

<B>F.  Safety to Handler</B><p>
With regard to human safety relative to possession, handling and administration
of TRAMISOL levamisole pour-on, the following statement appears on the
labeling:<p>
<B>"PRECAUTIONS:  
 Rubber gloves should be used to protect the hands of the
operator.  Avoid contact with skin, eyes or clothing.  Wash thoroughly after
use.  Wash splashes from exposed skin and eyes immediately."</B><p>
<B>VII. Agency Conclusions:</B><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of Section
512 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and with 21 CFR 514 of the implementing
regulations.  Those data
demonstrate that TRAMISOL levamisole Pour-On Topical Cattle Anthelmintic is
safe and effective when used under its labeled conditions of use.  Because of
the drug's broad spectrum anthelmintic activity, its conditions of use, and
its route of administration, the agency has concluded that the TRAMISOL Pour-On 
labeling contains adequate directions for use by the layperson and, thus,
this drug may be marketed over the counter.<p>
So far as Human Food Safety is concerned, we regard this as if it were a
Category II supplement (42 FR 64367, December 23, 1977) which did not require
the reevaluation of the levamisole data. TRAMISOL Pour-On is an additional
dosage form of the drug, and this approval is not the kind that will result in
increased human exposure to residues of the drug.<p>

<B>Date of Summary:</B> April 6, 1994<p>

<B>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</B><p>

In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (<B>55 FR 3107</B>),
following the approval of an ANADA for a generic Type A medicated article
(ANADA 200-075; generic salinomycin sodium), Hoechst-Roussel Agri Vet
Company is entitled to the approval of generic salinomycin in combination
with lincomycin. Bioequivalence studies are not required for the approval
of this generic combination (Type C medicated feed). Salinomycin sodium is
codified under <B>21 CFR paragraph 558.550.</B> Lincomycin is codified under <B>21
CFR paragraph 558.325</B>. The combination of salinomycin sodium and lincomycin
is codified under <B>21 CFR paragraph 558.550(a) and (b)(1)(xiii).</B><p>

<B>3. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</B><p>

In accordance with the Center's policy letter dated November 2, 1989, as
published in the Federal Register on January 30, 1990 (55 FR 3107), tissue
residue studies are not required for the approval of this generic
combination (Type C medicated feed).<p>

<B>a. Tolerance/Safe Concentrations for Residues</B><p>

The safe concentration established for the pioneer salinomycin sodium
product applies to the generic salinomycin sodium product. The safe
concentrations for total salinomycin residues in the uncooked edible
tissues of broiler chickens were established as 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm
in liver, and 1.2 ppm in skin/fat.<p>

Tolerances for residues of lincomycin in chickens is not required (<B>21 CFR
paragraph 556.360</B>).<p>

<B>b. Withdrawal Time</B><p>

As provided in <B>21 CFR paragraph 558.550 (b)(1)(xiii)</B>, a 0-day withdrawal
time is required for the combination of lincomycin and salinomycin.<p>

<B>c. Regulatory Method for Residues</B><p>

A regulatory method for salinomycin was not required because residue levels
in all three broiler tissues (muscle, liver, and skin/fat) were
significantly below the established safe concentration for total residues.<p>

A microbiological assay method is used to assay tissues for lincomycin
residues. The method entitled "Standard Operating Procedure for a Tissue
Residue Study in Broiler Chickens Treated with Lincomycin, U-10, 149A" is
on file at the Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug
Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855.<p>

<B>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</B><p>

This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that the combination of salinomycin sodium and lincomycin,
when used under its proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for
its labeled indications.<p>

60 pens. The desired levels of drugs being studied were added to typical
broiler and starter/finisher rations fed for the entire growing period except
monensin was withdrawn from the feed for the last five days.<P>
<b>Floor Pen Experiments Summary</b><P>
Six adequate and well controlled floor pen experiments, using approved
protocols and 23,676 broiler chickens (in five experiments equal numbers of
males and females, in one experiment all males) were conducted under conditions
simulating actual field use to determine the growth promoting effects of
bacitracin methylene disalicylate in the presence of monensin.  Although these
experiments were originally designed as titration studies, for purposes of this
submission, only the highest levels of bacitracin methylene disalicylate (50
grams per ton) in the presence of monensin (110 grams per ton) are
considered.<P>
The efficacy data were evaluated according to the combination drug guidelines
revised October 1983: Drugs approved individually at a range and codified in
the CFR are not required to be titrated in the combination.  However, each
drug's contribution to the combination must be demonstrated by data from
studies conducted with the maximum approved drug level.  For the NADA, data
from two treatment groups from each of the 6 trials are adequate to satisfy
these requirements.  Treatment one (1) monensin at 110 g/ton; Treatment two (2)
monensin 110 g/ton plus BMD at 50 g/ton.<P>
The data for each of the above two treatments from the six trials were pooled
for analysis for weight gain and feed efficiency.  The analysis for weight gain
showed no difference (p = 0.10) between the two treatments.  The analysis of the
feed to gain data showed a significant difference (p &#60; 0.01) between the two
treatments due to BMD.<P>
The data from the non-interference studies and the six floor pen studies
qualify the application for approval for the prevention of coccidiosis and for
improved feed efficiency.  The CVM policy outlined in the October 1983 revised
guidelines permits the quantity of the range for BMD codified in 21 CFR 558.75
(e)(i), which is 4 to 50 g/ton for use in combination with monensin at 110
g/ton.<P>

<b>Effectiveness - Non-Interference</b><P>
An experiment was conducted using 125 broiler chickens to determine whether
bacitracin methylene disalicylate interferes with the anti-coccidial activity
of monensin.  This study was conducted in batteries by:<P>
M.E. Callender and D.J. Donovan<br>

Greenfield, In<P>
Monensin at 0.0121% (110 gpt) was effective in controlling a mixed species
infection of <i>Eimeria acervulina, E. brunetti, E. mivati, E. necatrix</i>&#160; and <i>E.
tenella </i>.  The addition of bacitracin methylene disalicylate at 0.011% (110 gpt)
did not interfere with the anti-coccidial properties of monensin.  The
infective inoculum produced mortality rates of 96% and 100% among birds which
received no drug treatment or only bacitracin methylene disalicylate.  Four
percent (1/25) of the birds which received either monensin or monensin plus
bacitracin methylene disalicylate in combination with monensin did not
adversely affect mean weight gain, feed conversion, intestinal lesion scores or
cecal lesion scores.  A summary of the data is presented in Table 2.<P>

<b>V. ANIMAL SAFETY</b><P>
The basic animal safety data for the individual drugs may be found in the
original NADA 46-592 for bacitracin methylene disalicylate, NADA 38-878, for
monensin and its referenced INADs and MFs, including NADA 49-463.  Safety for
the combination of bacitracin methylene disalicylate and monensin was
demonstrated by the results of the non-interference study conducted by Elanco
Products Co. and the results of six floor pen studies described in Section
IV.<P>
This application is in accord with the Animal Safety Guidelines. Additional
safety studies were not required because, 1) the drugs have been approved
singularly and 2) adequate documentation has been provided to show that these
drugs are compatible in combination when used in broiler chicken feeds.
Therefore, based on the data in the original NADAs, the non-interference
studies and the drug residue elimination study, it is concluded that this
combination of drugs may be safely fed to broiler chickens.<P>
<b>VI. HUMAN SAFETY:</b><P>
It has been established in the original NADA (46-592 for bacitracin methylene
disalicylate and 38-878 for monensin) that these products are not a hazard to
human health when used according to approved labeling.  Tolerances for residues
of bacitracin methylene disalicylate are established at 0.5 ppm negligible
residue in uncooked chicken tissue (21 CFR 556.70). Safe concentrations for
total residues of monensin in chickens are 1.5 ppm in muscle, 3.0 ppm in skin
with adhering fat and 4.5 ppm in liver [FR Vol. 50, No. 155 (32394) August 12,
1985].  The tissue residue data supporting uses of bacitracin methylene
disalicylate and monensin have been presented in the original applications for
each.<P>
The drug residue depletion study as presented was conducted by Elanco Products
Co. Sexed, day-old Penobscot broiler chicks were used in a 56-day study.
Chicks were allotted to pens by grab sample from each compartment of the
shipping boxes so that each pen received 50 males or 50 females.  The floor
pens provided 0.9 square feet per bird.<P>
Each pen was bedded with clean, ground corn cobs.  Feed and water was provided
ad libitum.  Feed was provided to each pen in two hanging feeders.  The chicks
were fed typical broiler starter and finisher rations.  At 56 days the
medicated feeds were replaced with non-medicated feeds.<P>

Room temperature was maintained at 70&#176; &#177; 5&#176; F. Supplemental heat
was provided by thermostatically controlled infrared heat lamps.  Continuous
light was provided.  Ventilation was provided by 2 attic and 4 window
fans.<P>
At termination and up to 120 hours following treatment, birds of each sex were
randomly selected and sacrificed for each drug to be assayed at each sampling
interval.  Feathers were mechanically removed.  Samples of muscle, liver,
kidney and skin/fat were collected from each bird, individually bagged and
submitted for assay.<P>
The summary of the tissue residue depletion study in Table 3 establishes that
each drug in the presence of the other does not exceed its established safe
concentration or tolerances.  In addition, one drug does not interfere in the
others tissue residue assay.  In this study broiler chickens were fed a
combination of bacitracin methylene disalicylate (50 gpt) and monensin (110
gpt) for 56 days.  Edible tissues as required for each drug or combination of
drugs were assayed for presence of drug residue.<P>
Tissue assay non-interference and method validation studies for bacitracin
assay were conducted by spiking control chicken tissues with bacitracin zinc
standard and monensin and then assaying for bacitracin residue.  The results
demonstrated no interference by monensin for bacitracin (MO-B-TR-1-85).  The
recovery of bacitracin from the spiked tissues was 84 percent.<P>
The non-interference of bacitracin on the determination of monensin was
examined by the analysis of negative control chicken tissue fortified with the
equivalent of 5.0 and 0, and 5.0 and 0.05 ppm bacitracin zinc standard and
monensin, respectively (S-AAC-83-03).  No interference of bacitracin on the
recovery of monensin was observed.  Prepared extracts of tissue fortified with
the equivalent of 5.0 ppm bacitracin gave no zone of inhibition on the
bioautographic plate.  The recovery of monensin from tissue fortified with 5.0
ppm bacitracin and 0.05 ppm monensin was about 86% (0.043/0.05) which is on the
order of the expected experimental variation.<P>
Based upon the established no withdrawal times for monensin and bacitracin
methylene disalicylate, no residues were above tolerances in any tissues from
these broiler chickens.  The data support no withdrawal for the bacitracin
methylene disalicylate/monensin combination.  <P>

<b>VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that monensin (110 g/ton) plus
bacitracin MD (4-50 g/ton) are safe and effective for the claims indicated in
Section II of this FOI Summary.<P>
This original NADA is regarded as a Category II application under CVM's
supplemental policy (42 FR 64367) which did not require reevaluation of safety
and efficacy data in the parent NADAs.  The drugs are to be supplied to the
feed mill in individual premixes (Type A Article) for combining in finished
feeds (Type C Article) within the indications and dosages approved in the
parent NADAs.<P>
Residue data show monensin is well within the established safe concentration of
4.5 ppm in liver, three ppm skin/fat and 1.5 ppm muscle of the chicken at zero
withdrawal.  Residue data show bacitracin MD is well below tolerance of 0.5 ppm
in edible chicken tissues at zero withdrawal.<P>
Non-interference studies demonstrate that monensin alone prevented an outbreak
of coccidiosis and in the presence of bacitracin MD when the birds were exposed
to the six major species of <i>Eimeria </i>. The data from six well controlled floor
pen studies demonstrate the effectiveness of bacitracin (50 g/ton) in the
presence of monensin (110 g/ton).  These data qualify the application for
approval under CVM's policy outlined in the combination drug guidelines revised
October 1983.  This policy permits the granting of range approval for
bacitracin MD (4-50 g/ton) plus monensin as an aid in the prevention of
coccidiosis and for improved feed efficiency in broiler chickens, as shown in
Section 2 of this FOI Summary.<P>

<b>Trade Names:</b><p>          Bacitracin MD<br> 3-Nitro<br>Stenorol<p>
<b>Date of Summary:  </b>January 11, 1988<p>
 <b>2. Indications For Use:</b><p>
For the prevention of coccidiosis caused by <i>E. tenella, E. acervulina, E.
maxima, E. brunetti, E. necatrix</i>&#160; and <i>E. mivati </i>; For increased rate
of weight gain and for improved feed efficiency in broiler chickens.<p>
<b> 3. Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage:</b><p>
<b>Dosage Form:</b>  <p>
Bacitracin MD, roxarsone and halofuginone are marketed as separate feed
additive premixes.  The Bacitracin MD premix is sold in three concentrations:
25, 40 and 50 grams Bacitracin MD activity per pound.  Roxarsone premix is sold
in three concentrations:  10, 20 and 50&#37; medicated premix. Halofuginone premix
is sold in one concentration:  2.72 grams of halofuginone hydrobromide activity
per pound.<p>
<b>Dosage:</b>  <p> The route of administration of these three
drugs is oral via the feed.  
The recommended dosage is:</b> <uL> <p>

<li><b>Bacitracin MD 10-50 g/ton</b><p>
Bacitracin MD is mixed into finished broiler feed at concentrations ranging
from 10 to 50 g/ton for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed
efficiency.<p>  

<Li><b>Roxarsone 22.7 to 45.4 g/ton</b><p>
Roxarsone is added to finished broiler feed at a concentration of
22.7 to 45.4 g/ton for improved feed efficiency.<p> 
<li><b>Halofuginone hydrobromide 2.72 g/ton</b><p>
 Halofuginone is added to
finished broiler feed at a concentration of 2.72 g/ton for the prevention of
coccidiosis caused by <i>E. tenella, E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. brunetti, E.
necatrix</i>&#160; and <i>E. mivati </i>.  The resultant feed containing all three drugs is then
fed continuously as the sole ration.  Feeds containing roxarsone and
halofuginone must be withdrawn from broilers 5 days before slaughter.</ul><p>
 <b>4. Effectiveness:</b><p>
<b>A.   Floor Pen Studies - Body Weight &amp; Feed Efficiency:</b><p>
The New Animal Drug Application on which approval of bacitracin MD and
roxarsone in combination with halofuginone hydrobromide is based contains
adequate and well controlled studies demonstrating the effectiveness of
bacitracin MD, roxarsone and halofuginone when fed to broilers.  Six
experiments using a randomized complete block design were conducted utilizing
6,544 broilers which were fed from one day of age to market weight.  These
experiments were summarized and evaluated for significant differences in
average live bird weight and feed efficiency.<p>
In these six studies, pens were randomly assigned to treatments within blocks;
20 to 100 birds of equal sex were selected at random and assigned to each pen;
three to seven replicates were used per treatment group.<p>
The summary was done using only the combination of treatments necessary under
the revised guidelines for broiler combination efficacy studies (Guideline for
Drug Combinations for use in Animals, Center for Veterinary Medicine, October
1983).  Thus, only the following treatments from each of the six studies were
pooled and subjected to statistical analysis:<p>

<ul>
<li>Halofuginone hydrobromide 2.72 g/ton
<li>Bacitracin MD 50 g/ton &#43; halofuginone 2.72 g/ton
<li>Roxarsone 45.4 g/ton &#43; halofuginone 2.72 g/ton
<li>Halofuginone 2.72 g/ton &#43; bacitracin MD 50 g/ton &#43; roxarsone 45.4
g/ton</ul><p>
Studies were designed to simulate varying conditions such as geographical
location, differences in climate, changes in weather, differences in management
practices, and degree of disease contamination of the premises.  The chicks
were grown on old litter and diets were balanced to provide adequate levels of
all nutrients.<p>
The effect of bacitracin MD and roxarsone on average live bird weight and feed
efficiency is presented in Table I.<p>
An analysis of the combined data shows an overall significant (P&lt;.05)
increase in average live bird weight and improvement in feed efficiency due to
feeding bacitracin MD in the presence of roxarsone and halofuginone.  Further
analysis of the combined data shows that roxarsone significantly (P&lt;.05)
improved feed efficiency when combined with bacitracin MD and halofuginone.
Therefore, based on the revised Drug Combination Guidelines, these data are
adequate for the claims shown in Item 2, Indications For Use.
Bacitracin MD, roxarsone and halofuginone have all been approved singly in
three separate NADA's for addition to complete broiler feed at the above use
levels.<p>
The above data satisfy the requirements for evaluation of an application under
the CVM Policy outlined in the guidelines for combination drugs revised October
1983.  The policy provides for the granting of a range approval for production
drugs in combination when the maximum level tested for the claim(s) is
demonstrated to make a significant benefit to the combination. The range
approval according to the revised policy is from 50 g/ton to a minimum level
approved for bacitracin MD in the parent application.  A minimum use level of
10 g/ton was used in establishing the feed stability data for this combination.
Accordingly, 10 g/ton of bacitracin MD is the minimum approvable level.
Therefore, use levels approvable for this application are 10 - 50 g/ton of
bacitracin MD.<p>

<b>B.  Noninterference Battery Studies</b><p>
Fourteen and 21 day old broiler chickens were used in three adequate, well
controlled battery studies to test for the noninterference of bacitracin MD and
roxarsone on the anticoccidial efficacy of halofuginone.  Recent isolates of
coccidia were used.  Combinations of <i>E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. necatrix, E.
mivati, E. tenella</i>&#160; and <i>E. brunetti</i>&#160; were used.  This arrangement facilitated
identification of lesions.  Tables 2, 3, and 4 show the treatments used in
these battery studies along with the results for body weight, feed efficiency,
dropping scores, lesion scores, and mortality.  The broilers were randomized
and assigned to cages with ten broilers per cage.  There were four or five
replicates of each treatment group.<p>
These battery studies adequately demonstrate that there is no interference of
bacitracin MD and roxarsone on the anticoccidial efficacy of halofuginone.
Therefore, this combination is compatible.<p>

<b> 5. Animal Safety:</b><p>
The original NADA's contain complete information on the animal safety of all
three products (NADA's 046-592 - bacitracin MD, 130-951 - halofuginone, and 7-891
MF19 - roxarsone).  The above effectiveness (Section 4) studies adequately
demonstrated that there were no toxicological or pharmacological effects when
the three drugs were combined in the same feed.  No reactions were expected or
found when the three drugs were combined indicating that they are equally safe
when fed separately or when combined.<p>
This application is in accord with Animal Safety Guidelines. Further safety
studies were not required because:<ul><p>
<li>a.  The drugs have been approved singly; and<p> 
<li>b.  Sufficient documentation has been
provided to determine that these compounds are compatible in combination when
used in poultry.</ul><p>
Based on the data in the parent NADA's, the compatibility battery studies, the
drug residue elimination study, and the floor pen efficacy studies, we conclude
that the combination of these three drugs is safe to be fed to broiler chickens
as indicated by the label.<p>

The data provide evidence for the combination of halofuginone, bacitracin MD
and roxarsone in the feed of broiler chickens and these data are consistent
with and fulfill all the requirements for a fixed combination drug for animals
as follows:<ul><p>
<li>a.  Each drug component makes a contribution to the claimed effects.<p>
<li>b.  The dosages of each drug component are such that the combination is safe and
effective.  <p>
<li>c.  This combination demonstrates significant control of a specific disease
condition for a large patient animal population. Specifically,<i>Eimeria tenella</i>&#160;
is a major widespread organism of coccidiosis and the most pathogenic <i>Eimeria</i>&#160;
species and, as such, possesses the potential of causing extensive economic
losses to broiler producers.<p>
<li>d.  The label claims are not antagonistic.</ul><p>
<b> 6. Human Safety:</b><p>
The original NADA's for each drug (046-592, 130-951 and 7-891) demonstrate
that these products do not cause a hazard to human health when used according
to label directions.<p>
Tolerances of arsenic (from roxarsone) in the edible tissue of chickens are
established at 0.5 ppm in muscle and 2 ppm in edible by products (21 CFR
556.60) with liver as the target tissue. Halofuginone hydrobromide has an
established tolerance in broilers of 0.1 ppm for parent halofuginone (marker
residue) in liver (the target tissue).  A marker residue concentration of 0.1
ppm in liver corresponds to a concentration for total residues of halofuginone
of 0.3 ppm in the liver.  The safe concentration for total residues of
halofuginone in the uncooked edible tissues of broilers are 0.1 ppm in muscle,
0.3 ppm in liver and 0.2 ppm in skin with adhering fat (Federal Register, Vol.
50, No. 162, page 33718, August 21, 1985).  Tolerances for residues of
bacitracin methylene disalicylate are established at 0.5 ppm, negligible
residue, un uncooked edible tissues of chickens (21CFR556.70) with muscle as
the target tissue.<p>
The residue data supporting the approved individual uses of halofuginone,
bacitracin MD and roxarsone and their respective withdrawal times of four, zero
and five days have been submitted in their respective original applications.
The summary of the study presented in Table 6 establishes that each drug in the
presence of the other does not exceed its established safe concentration or
tolerances and they do not interfere in each other's tissue residue assay.
Table 6 summarizes the data obtained from a study in which broilers were fed
the combination of halofuginone (2.72 g/ton), bacitracin MD (100 g/ton) and
roxarsone (45.4 g/ton) for 29 days prior to the withdrawal period. Edible
tissues, including liver and muscle were assayed for drug residues.  The edible
tissues were collected on the withdrawal dates indicated in Table VI.<p>

Along with the residue depletion results in Table VI, a noninterference study
for the bacitracin MD tissue assay was conducted by spiking samples with
bacitracin, halofuginone and roxarsone and conducting assay for bacitracin
residues.  The results demonstrated no interference by halofuginone and
roxarsone on the assay for bacitracin.<p>

A noninterference study for halofuginone was conducted by spiking control
tissue samples with halofuginone, bacitracin and roxarsone and then assaying
these tissues for halofuginone content.  The results demonstrated no
interference by bacitracin and roxarsone on the tissue assay for
halofuginone.<p>
A noninterference study for roxarsone is not required because the assay method
for roxarsone is done by ashing the tissue prior to determination of roxarsone
residues.<p>
A 5-day withdrawal period was established for this combination based on a
99&#37; statistical tolerance limit with 95&#37; confidence. These data support a 5-day 
withdrawal for the halofuginone/roxarsone/bacitracin MD combination.<p>
<b> 7. Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that halofuginone (2.72 g/ton) plus
bacitracin MD (10 to 50 g/ton) plus roxarsone 22.7 to 45.4 g/ton) are safe and
effective to be fed to broiler chickens at the dosage level indicated.<p>
Under the Center's supplemental policy (42 FR 64367) this original application
is regarded as a Category II supplemental NADA which did not require a
revaluation of safety and efficacy data in the parent NADAs.  The drugs are to
be fed in Type C medicated feeds in agreement with the labeling as approved in
the parent NADAs.<p>
Residue depletion studies summarized in this application demonstrate that
halofuginone depletes to safe concentration within five days withdrawal to no
more than 0.1 ppm in muscle, 0.3 ppm in liver and 0.2 ppm in skin/fat, (CFR
556.70); bacitracin MD is below the tolerance of 0.5 ppm at zero withdrawal,
(CFR 556.70); and arsenic from roxarsone has a tolerance of 0.5 ppm in muscle,
2.0 ppm in liver and kidney with a 5-day withdrawal, (CFR 556.60).  Adequate
information was submitted to demonstrate noninterference between the assays for
each drug.  The approval of this application will not significantly increase
exposure of humans to residues of the drugs.<p>
The data from six well controlled trials demonstrate the effectiveness of
bacitracin MD and roxarsone for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed
efficiency in the presence of halofuginone when mixed in broiler chicken feeds.
The data from noninterference battery studies demonstrated the effectiveness of
halofuginone in preventing coccidiosis in the presence of bacitracin MD and
roxarsone.  The CVM policy outlined in the combination drug efficacy guidelines
revised October, 1983 permits the granting of range approval for bacitracin and
roxarsone as shown in Section 2 of this document.  A five (5) day withdrawal period
is required before the broiler chickens are to be slaughtered for human
food.<p>

Information Summary</b><p>






  
<b>1. General Information:</b> <p> 
<b>NADA Number:</b>         140-879
<p> 
<b>Sponsor:</b><p>             Norden Laboratories <br>
                    601 West Cornhusker Highway <br>
                    Lincoln, Nebraska  68521 <p> 
<b>Generic Name:</b><p>        Nystatin -Neomycin Sulfate - Thiostrepton -  
                    Triamcinolone - Acetonide Topical Ointment<p> 
<b>Trade Name:</b>       DERMA 4 Ointment <p> 
<b>Marketing Status:  </b>    Prescription (Rx)<p>
<b>Date of Summary:  </b>August 2, 1989<p> 
<b>2. Indications for Use:</b> <p> 
DERMA 4 Ointment is particularly useful in the treatment of:  (1) acute and
chronic otitis of varied etiologies; (2) interdigital cysts in dogs and cat;
(3) anal gland infections in dogs; (4) dermatologic disorders characterized by
inflammation and dry or exudative dermatitis, particularly those caused,
complicated, or threatened by bacterial or candidal (<i>Candida albicans </i>)
infection; and (5) eczematous, contact and seborrheic dermatitis. Additionally,
DERMA 4 Ointment may be used as an adjunct in the treatment of dermatitis due
to parasitic infestation.  
 <p> 
<b>3. Dosage and Administration:</b> <p> 
The frequency of DERMA 4 Ointment administration is dependent on the severity
of the condition.  Application may range from once daily to once weekly for
mild inflammation, or two to three times daily for severe conditions.
Frequency of treatment may be decreased as improvement occurs. <p> 
Recommended treatment dosages are as follows: <p> 

<b>Otitis: </b><p> The impacted cerumen of the ear canal must be cleaned,  
including removal of any foreign bodies such as grass awns, ticks, etc.
Administer three to five drops of DERMA 4 Ointment.  Preliminary use of a local
anesthetic may be advisable. <p> 

<b>Infected Anal Glands, Cystic Areas, etc.:</b><p>  The gland or cyst is drained and
then filled with DERMA 4 Ointment. <p> 

<b>Other Dermatologic Disorders:</b><p>  The affected areas are cleaned and any encrusted
discharge or exudate is removed.   DERMA 4 Ointment is applied sparingly in a
thin film. <p> 
<b>4. Effectiveness: </b><p> 
DERMA 4 Ointment (nystatin, neomycin sulfate, thiostrepton,  
triamcinolone acetonide) is chemically identical to Panalog Ointment (NADA 12-258,
Solvay Veterinary, Inc., formerly E.R. Squibb &amp; Sons, Inc.) which was the
subject of a review by the National Academy of Science/National Research
Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group. NAS/NRC determined Panalog
Ointment to be "probably effective" and recommended labeling changes.
Subsequently, the product was determined to be "effective" by the Center for
Veterinary Medicine (CVM) when the application was supplemented by providing
the required label revisions. This was published in a Federal Register Notice,
Volume 35, No. 166, Wednesday, August 26, 1970.  It was also codified in 21 CFR
524.1600a. <p> 
The DERMA 4 Ointment labeling contains the same claims as those  
contained on the labeling for Panalog Ointment, the pioneer product.  In
addition, the DERMA 4 Ointment labeling includes the safety information
required by CVM in the Federal Register announcement of December 13, 1984
covering drug products containing a steroid. <p> 
Under the policy of the Center for Veterinary Medicine, the principles of 21
CFR 320.22, providing for a waiver of the requirement for submission of
evidence of <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioavailability/bioequivalence,are applicable to NAS/NRC
reviewed topically applied veterinary new animal drug preparations intended for
local therapeutic effect.  Since DERMA 4 Ointment is chemically identical to
the NAS/NRC reviewed Panalog Ointment, the waiver applies to this product. <p> 
The effectiveness of this combination has been proven in over 25 years of
continuous veterinary use.  
 <p> 
<b>5. Animal Safety: </b><p> 
Reference is again made to the NAS/NRC review of Panalog Ointment. The Council
determined the product was safe and "probably effective" with labeling changes.
The safety of the product was increased by changing its marketing status from
over the counter (OTC)to prescription (Rx). In addition, the DERMA 4 Ointment
labeling includes the safety information required by CVM in the Federal
Register announcement of December 13, 1984 covering drug products containing a
steroid. Likewise, the safety of this combination has been proven in over 25
years of continuous veterinary use. <br>
 <p> 
<b>6. Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:</b> <p> 
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required of reapproval of this NADA.  The product is labeled as a
prescription drug for use only on dogs and cats; which are non-food animals.
<p> 
<b>Human Safety Considerations Other Than Food Safety:</b> <p> 
In regard to possession, handling and administration, adequate information is
provided under the headings "warning", "precautions", and "side effects" on the
package insert for the safe use of the product by veterinarians and to instruct
their clients on its proper and safe use.  
 <p> 
<b>7. Agency Conclusions:</b> <p> 
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the conclusions of the
NAS/NRC review, as concurred with by FDA, and with CVM's policy concerning
topical drugs.  The data demonstrated that DERMA 4 Ointment, when used under
its approved conditions of use, is safe and effective for the treatment of
acute and chronic otitis of varied etiologies, for interdigital cysts in cats
and dogs, for anal gland infections in dogs, for management of moist or dry
dermatologic disorders characterized by inflammation: bacterial, candidal
(<i>Candida albicans </i>), contact, eczematous, seborrheic, and parasitic (ear mites).
<p> 
The labeling for this product contains the veterinary prescription legend
because the expertise of a veterinarian is necessary for diagnoses of the
etiologies of the conditions for which the product is indicated, for proper
preparation of the animals for drug administration (otitis &amp; anal glands),
for  the administration of the drug (anal glands), and for supervision of the
progress of the animals to reduce the potential of adverse side effects such
as: SAP and SGPT (ALT) enzyme elevations,  
polydipsia/polyuria, vomiting, diarrhea (occasionally bloody), Cushings
syndrome, and deafness. <p>

<b>FREEDOM OF INFORMATION SUMMARY</b><P>
<b>1. General Information</b><P>
<b>New animal drug application number:</b>  140-901<P>
<b>Sponsor:</b>  <P>
Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, Inc.<br>
One Luitpold Drive<br>
Shirley, New York 11967<P>
<b>Generic name of drug:</b>  Polysulfated Glycosaminoglycan (PSGAG)<P>
<b>Trade name:</b>  Adequan&#174; i.m.<P>
<b>Marketing Status:</b>  Rx<P>
<b>Date of Summary:</b> November 11, 1989<P>
<b>2.  Indication for Use</b><P>Adequan&#174; i.m. is recommended for the intramuscular treatment of
noninfectious degenerative and/or traumatic joint dysfunction and associated
lameness of the carpal joint in horses.<P>
<b>3.  Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended Dosage</b><P>
The recommended dose of Adequan&#174; i.m. in horses is 500 mg every 4 days
for 28 days intramuscularly.  The injection site must be thoroughly cleansed
prior to injection.  Do not mix Adequan&#174; i.m. with other drugs or
solvents.<P>
<b>4.  Effectiveness:  Pivotal Studies</b><P>
Adequan&#174; i.m. for the treatment of lameness in horses, has been
evaluated in both a dose titration study and in field trials. These two pivotal
studies were adequate and well controlled. There were 36 horses studied in the
dose titration investigation and 43 horses in the field trials.<P>
<b>Pivotal Study 1.</b><P>
<b>Dose Titration Investigation</b><P>
The dose titration investigation was performed by Drs. Doyne Hamm and Gary
White of Fayetteville, AR.  72701.  Dr. E. Wynn Jones of Mississippi State
University served as the quality control director of this study.  This study
was conducted on a blinded basis, i.e. the veterinarian who administered the
drug did not know what the dosage was and the quality control director who
evaluated the response to the drug did not know which treatment each animal
received.<P>
An induced adjuvant carpitis in the horse was used to assess the dose and
efficacy of the intramuscular administration of Adequan&#174; i.m.  The
model used produces:<P>
1.  A syndrome which is pathologically compatible with the use of
Adequan&#174; i.m.<P>
2.  A sufficiently uniform syndrome which permits practical group sizes for
statistical analysis.<P>
3.  Response parameters (joint circumference, stride length, joint position at
rest, etc.) which permit quantitative assessment.<P>
4.  Characteristics which provide for confirmation of the syndrome (e.g. joint
fluid and necropsy parameters).<P>
Healthy, mature animal of quarter horse or thoroughbred type served as
experimental animals.  These animals were acclimated to the environment,
maintained in covered stalls and fed a routine weight maintenance ration with
hay and water ad libitum.<P>
The adjuvant induced arthritis was produced with a single intraarticular
injection of 0.5 mL of Freunds adjuvant using standard aseptic techniques and
precautions.  This model is characterized by inflammatory exudation into the
joint cavity, inflammation of the synovial membrane, periarthritis, limping and
osteitis.<P>
The various treatments comprises sterile saline solution as a placebo control,
and 50 mg, 125 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1,000 mg of the active drug substance
Adequan&#174; i.m. dissolved in sterile water.  Injections were given once
every 4 days for a total of 7 injections.  Treatment followed a 10 day
acclimation period, and a five day model induction period. The study was
conducted in replicates of six in which all treatment groups were represented.
There were six horses per group for a total of 36 horses.<P>
Observations consisted of the following:<P>
1.  clinical - temperature, pulse and respiration<P>
2.  lameness (once weekly) prior to treatment<br>
a)  angle of carpal flexion<br>
b)  maximum angle of carpal flexion permitted<br>
c)  length of stride (lame limb)<P>
3.  limb circumference<P>
4.  joint fluid - total protein at time of each treatment<P>
5.  radiograph - pretreatment and at study conclusion<P>
6.  hemogram - red and white blood cell count/hematocrit/hemoglobin, once
weekly<P>
7.  necropsy - gross and histological observations.<P>
The data collected for this study comprises two categories:<P>
a)  daily-weekly observations and<P>
b)  measurements for carpal volume calculations.<P>
The mean response for each of the variables, temperature, pulse, respiration,
flexion at rest, maximum flexion allowed, stride at rest, stride after
exercise, limb circumference, joint fluid total protein, white blood cell
count, red blood cell count, hematocrit, and hemoglobin was calculated for each
of the five dose groups.<P>
Analysis of variance was performed to test for dose effect. Duncan's multiple
range test was performed for those variables showing a significance level of
0.05 or less.<P>
The parameter abbreviations used in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4, the manner of
grouping similar and different groups, and the designations for the various
groups are specified as follows.<P>
DFL-MAX  = Maximum carpal flexion permitted in degrees<P>
DSTD-RST = Stride length (lame leg) after rest in inches<P>
DSTD-EXR = Stride length (lame leg) after standard exercise in inches<P>
D-CIRCUM  = Circumference of affected joint in centimeters<P>
D-PRTN   =  Synovial fluid protein level in mg/mL (affected joint)<P>
The doses represent:<P>
0 = placebo control<br>
1 =    50 mg Adequan&#174;<br>
2 =   125 mg Adequan&#174;<br>
3 =   250 mg Adequan&#174;<br>
4 =   500 mg Adequan&#174;<br>
5 = 1,000 mg Adequan&#174;<P>
The values within the same brackets are not statistically different at the .05
level.  That means 5 chances or less in 100 that these differences are the
result of chance.<P>

Statistically the dosages of 500 mg and 1,000 mg are not different.  The other
dosages (placebo, 50 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg) have been demonstrated to be
statistically different from the 500 and 1,000 mg groups but the same as each
other.  These conclusions were highly statistically significant.<P>

An examination of Tables 2, 3  and 4 reveals that, with time, the various
treatment levels (dosages) become grouped.  The groupings by treatment day 6
(7th injection) invariably reveal that the 500 mg and 1,000 mg doses have the
same response which is superior to other, lower doses.  The statistical
significance of these findings range from 4 chances in 1,000 (D-PRTN) to 1
chance in 10,000 (DFL-MAX, DSTD-EXR).<P>
As a means of confirming the results stated above an analysis of variance, LSD
pair-wise comparisons and linear-plateau and polynomial regression model
fitting were done on the variables maximum flexion, stride at rest, stride
after exercise, circumference, protein, carpal volume change and percent volume
change at the final measurement minus the
base line measurement. A blocking term and a block by treatment interaction
term were included in the analysis of variance model since the study was done
in three replicates of 12 animals per replicate.<P>
The overall analysis of variance showed that the treatment means were
significantly different and pair-wise comparisons showed that there was no
significant difference (p&gt; .05) between the means of the two highest
doses----500 mg &amp; 1,000 mg---but that there were significant differences
(p&lt; .05) between the means of the two highest doses and the three lowest
doses and the placebo (p&lt; .05 means less than a 5 out of 100 probability
these findings are due to chance).  For all the variables, except stride at
rest, this was a reasonable fitting model. This model is a plateau between the
placebo and the three lowest doses (50 mg, 125 mg, 250 mg), and a straight line
between the 250 mg dose and the 500 mg dose and a plateau from the 500 mg dose
through the highest dose (1,000 mg).<P>
The conclusion that can be drawn from this dose titration study is that for the
parameters associated with lameness i.e. flexion, stride length, joint
circumference and synovial fluid protein levels, 500 mg of Adequan&#174;
i.m. is the optimal dosage.  The possibility that this finding is a product of
chance is about one in ten thousand.  At this dosage one would not expect to
find any harmful effects on the bone or cartilage or systemically.<P>

The participating veterinarians are suitably qualified by their training and
experience to investigate the effectiveness of drugs used to treat lameness in
horses.<P>
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that Adequan&#174; i.m., when
used under field conditions, had the same beneficial characteristics as were
shown during the dose titration study and to compare these effects to the
already marketed Adequan intraarticular.  Thus, Adequan intraarticular was the
active treatment control.  We refer here to the safety and efficacy data from
the approved NADA 136-383 for Adequan intraarticular (49 FR47829; Dec. 7,
1984).<P>
Diagnosis of carpal joint lameness was based on expert objective evaluation
and, where possible, confirmed by radiography. Synovial fluid analysis had to
show either elevated protein levels or decreased viscosity levels for the
animal to qualify.<P>
Twenty four horses received intraarticular injections (250 mg Adequan&#174;
each, once a week for 5 weeks) and 19 horses received intramuscular injections
(500 mg Adequan&#174; each once every four days for 28 days).<P>
The following parameters were evaluated:<P>
1.  lameness at a walk (graded 0-3)<br>
2.  lameness at a jog (graded 0-3)<br>
3.  pain on palpation of the articular margin (graded 0-3)<br>
4.  maximum flexion permitted (0 = &lt;= 30&#176;, 1 = 31-60&#176;, 2 =
61-90&#176;, 3 =  &gt;90&#176;)<br>

The purpose of the study was to gain additional support for the safety and
efficacy of Adequan&#174; i.m. when used under field (racetrack)
conditions.<P>
The diagnosis of carpal joint lameness was based on expert objective evaluation
and where possible confirmed by radiography.<br>
Adequan&#174; i.m. injections (500 mg) were administered intramuscularly
every 4 days for 28 days.  Parameters evaluated were the same as for the
pivotal field trial except synovial fluid protein and viscosity were excluded
(see page 9) .  Forty two cases were treated in the study.  The overall
evaluation as judged by the investigators revealed the following responses:<P>
Excellent  40.5%<br>
Good       40.5%<br>
Fair        9.5%<br>
Poor        9.5%<P>
The results of the overall evaluation in this study are comparable to the
results achieved in the controlled field trials.  No adverse reactions were
reported.  Thus this study yielded further support for the safety and efficacy
of Adequan&#174; i.m. under the proposed conditions of use.<P>
<b>5.  Animal Safety</b><P>
Adequan&#174; i.m. for the treatment of non-infectious degenerative and/or
traumatic joint dysfunction and associated lameness of the equine carpal joint
has been evaluated in a pivotal subacute toxicity study in horses. In addition
10 preclinical studies by Hazelton Laboratories of Vienna, VA  22180, and a
controlled field study involving 3 investigators provided corroborative
evidence of safety.<P>
There was no meaningful evidence from any of these studies that indicated that
the active ingredient in Adequan&#174; i.m. (PSGAG) has clinically relevant
toxic properties.<P>
<b>Pivotal Study</b><P>
A subacute toxicity study was done on horses.  This study was performed by
Research for
Animal Health, of Fayetteville, Arkansas.  Dr.  Doyne Hamm is President of this
organization and personally supervised this study.<P>
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the intramuscular treatment with
PSGAG at dose levels of 1, 3 and 5 times the intended dosage of 500 mg for a
period of 3 times the recommended duration.  Intramuscular injections of PSGAG
in sterile water were administered to three groups of horses every 4 days at
500 mg, 1,500 mg and 2,500 mg per horse respectively for 12 weeks. There were
twenty-four horses in this study (14 females 9 geldings and 1 male).  Their
weights ranged from 600 to 972 lbs. and their ages from 2 to 10 years.<P>
At the time these horses were received, they were given a routine physical
examination including clinical examination of the respiratory and
cardiovascular systems and determination of vital signs.  All animals were
further examined for the following measurements:<P>
1. Fecal examination for parasites<br>
2. Hematologic examination<br>
3. Temperature, pulse, respiration<br>
4. Appetite<br>
5. Stool characteristics (physical)<br>
6. Presence or absence of nasal discharge or cough.<P>
Following clinical health screening, horses received encephalitis and
rhinopneumonitis vaccines and were treated for parasitism. All vaccines were
administered by the study director.  Horses were kept in clean stalls.  They
were well fed with grain and hay and had fresh water available at all times.
Healthy animals were kept for a period of at least 10 days prior to being
included in the study.  After confirmation of their health and acclimation,
these animals were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups of 6
horses each.<P>
The following parameters were measured over the course of the study:<br>

No clinically significant changes occurred in any of the laboratory parameters
or the clinical signs.  At the onset of the study the mean body weight was 736
&#177; 94 lbs.  At day 43 the mean body weight was 790 &#177; 78 lbs.
At day 83 the mean body weight was 836&#177; 69 lbs. The weight gain was
also reflected in an appearance of good general body condition.<P>

The significant group differences detected for white blood cell counts,
polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes do not appear to be dose related as
reflected by the Duncan's groupings.<P>
No adverse reactions to the injections were noted.  This study shows that at
the recommended dosage of 500 mg no sign of toxicity will be seen.  At much
higher doses for extended periods of time there are no signs of toxicity.<P>

<b>Summaries of these studies follow:</b><P>
<b>PSGAG (POLYSULFATED GLYCOSAMINOGLYCAN PRECLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS) Project
No.  2144-100:  Acute Intravenous Toxicity Study in Rats</b><P>
The acute intravenous toxicity in male rats was calculated to be
2,077mg/kg of body weight and in female rats to be 4,576mg/kg of body weight.
The combined toxicity in males and females was calculated to be 3,848mg/kg of
body weight.<P>
<b>Project No.  2144-101:  Thirteen-Week Toxicity Study in Rats</b><P>
The subchronic toxicity following daily administration by intramuscular
injection for four or thirteen weeks in male and female rats at dose levels of
2, 10 and 25mg/kg of body weight was determined.  One high dose (25mg/kg)
female died at week thirteen.  Survival was comparable among all treated and
control groups.  Growth rates, food consumption and mean body weights were
generally comparable among all groups. Hematology, clinical chemistry and
urinalysis from weeks four and thirteen were unremarkable for all groups.
Statistical evaluation of mean organ weights at week thirteen revealed several
significant differences between control and treated groups.  At week thirteen,
myositis, hemorrhage and resolving hematocyst were observed in muscles from
high-dose males and females.  This finding suggests that PSGAG is more
irritating than control on injection.  Histiocytosis was observed in mesenteric
lymph nodes from high-dose males and females sacrificed at week thirteen.  No
neoplastic lesions were observed in any animals any time.<P>
<b>Project No.  2144-102:  Acute Intravenous Toxicity Study in Beagle
Dogs</b><P>
The acute intravenous toxicity of PSGAG in male and female beagle dogs was
evaluated at dose levels of 0.25, 0.50, 1.0 and 2.0g/kg of body weight.  The
2.0g/kg male died one day post-dose. Observations at all other levels were not
remarkable.<P>
<b>Project No.  2144-103:  Thirteen-Week Intra-articular Toxicity Study in
Beagle Dogs</b><P>
Three groups of beagle dogs (6/sex/group) received PSGAG at dose levels of 2.0,
5.0 and 10.0mg/kg of body weight by intraarticular injection three times a week
for thirteen weeks.  One high-dose male died but no significant differences in
survival were noted between control and treated groups.  Necropsy indicated
compound-related gross pathology at the knee joints and injection sites  of the
treated groups.  Compound related histopathological alterations were observed.
All lesions showed a reduction in severity and/or frequency with reduced
dosage.<P>
<b>Project No.  2144-104:  Fertility Study in Female Rats</b><P>
Three groups of twenty-four female rats received PSGAG by daily intramuscular
injection at dosages of 2.0, 8.0 or 32.0mg/kg of body weight.  The animals were
observed for two weeks and then mated. Pregnancy rate and mean maternal body
weights on Day 21 of lactation were decreased slightly in the treated groups
relative to controls. Other maternal data were unremarkable.  Dose-related
trends significant in the high-dose groups were noted in the cesarean delivered
litters. Mean body weights in the high-dose group of naturally delivered
offspring of both sexes on Day 2 were significantly lower than control.<P>
<b>Project No.  2144-105:  Teratogenic Study in Rabbits</b><P>
The embryo toxic and teratogenic effects of PSGAG were evaluated after
intramuscular injection to pregnant rabbits at dosage levels at 2.0, 8.0 and
32.0mg/kg of body weight.  No significant effects were noted in pregnancy
rates, corpora lutea, implantation, and visceral or skeletal anomalies and
variants. The compound was found not to be teratogenic at levels up to 32mg/kg
during major organogenesis.  At this level the compound was embryo toxic.<P>
<b>Project No.  2144-106:  Salmonella Typhimurium Mammalian Microsome Plate
Incorporation Assay</b><P>
Under the conditions of this study, PSGAG at levels up to 100,000&#181;g/plate was
found not to be a mutagen.<P>
<b>Project No.  2144-107:  L5178Y Mouse Lymphoma Forward Mutation Assay</b><P>
Under the conditions of this study, PSGAG at dosage levels ranging from
100,000 to 1,000&#181;g/mL produced a dose-related toxic effect.  No significant
mutagenic activity was detected without activation.  With the presence of an
exogenous activation system, significant  increases in mutation frequency were
observed at three of the five dose levels.<P>
<b>Project No.  2144-108:  In-Vivo Cytogenetics Assay in Rats</b><P>
PSGAG was evaluated for its potential to induce structural aberrations in rat
bone marrow cells.  No significant increase in structural mutations in rat bone
marrow cells was observed.<P>
<b>Project No.  2144-109:  Fertility Study in Male Rats</b><P>
Three groups of twelve male rats received PSGAG by daily intramuscular
injection at dosage levels of 2.0, 10.0 and 25.0mg/kg of body weight. the
animals were treated for at least 60 days prior to and throughout the mating
phase of the study. No significant differences between treated and control
groups were observed.<P>

Adequan&#174; i.m.  (polysulfated glycosaminoglycan)<P>
 This NADA is supported by data that satisfy with the requirements set forth in
Section 512 of the Act and 21 CFR 514.111 of the regulations. Those data reveal
that when Adequan&#174; i.m. is used according to the conditions set forth
in the labeling, it is a safe and effective medicament.<P>
In order to use Adequan&#174; i.m. properly, the diagnosis of degenerative
or traumatic joint dysfunction  and associated lameness must be made.  Only a
veterinarian, suitably qualified by training and experience can make such a
diagnosis.  Therefore the drug product is classified as a prescription drug.<P>

<b> TELMIN(TM) B Paste Equine Wormer </b><p> 
<b> I.      General Information </b><p> 
 <b>NADA Number:</b>        138-954 <p> 
    <b>Sponsor:</b><p>  Pitman-Moore, Inc.<br>       Washington Crossing, New Jersey
08560 <p> 
 <b>Generic name: </b>      mebendazole and trichlorfon <p> 
<b> Trade name: </b>          TELMIN(TM) B Paste Equine Wormer <p> 
 <b>Marketing Status:</b>  OTC <p> 
    <b>Purpose:</b><p>   This New Animal Drug Application (NADA) provides for 
a paste formulation of mebendazole and trichlorfon           for use as an equine
anthelmintic.  A powder formulation of mebendazole and trichlorfon,
TELMIN(TM) B             Equine Wormer (NADA 100-402), is currently approved         by
the Food and Drug Administration for use in          horses. <p>

<b>Date of Summary:</b>  April 18, 1986<p> 
 <b>II.     Indications for Use</b>   <p> 
 TELMIN B Paste is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by bots
(<i>Gastrophilus intestinalis</i>&#160; and <i>G. nasalis </i>), large roundworms
(<i>Parascaris equorum </i>), large strongyles (<i>Strongylus edentatus, S.
equinus, S. vulgaris </i>), small strongyles and pinworms (<i>Oxyuris
equi </i>). <p> 
 <b>III.    Dosage Form, Route of Administration and Recommended
Dosage</b> <p> 
 TELMIN B Paste, a paste formulation containing mebendazole and trichlorfon
as the active ingredients, is available in an oral dose syringe.  Each syringe
contains 40 g of paste sufficient to treat up to 1,000 pounds of body weight at
the recommended dose of mebendazole (8.8 mg/kg) and trichlorfon (40.0 mg/kg).
The syringe, calibrated in 250 pound weight increments, provides this dosage by
delivering 10 g of paste for each 250 pounds of body weight. <p> 
 
 <b>IV.     Effectiveness</b> <p> 
 Substantial evidence of the efficacy of the combination of mebendazole and
trichlorfon against infections caused by bots (<i>Gastrophilus intestinalis</i>&#160;
and <i>Gastrophilus nasalis </i>) large roundworms (<i>Parascaris equorum </i>),
large strongyles (<i>Strongylus edentatus, S. equinus, S. vulgaris </i>), small
strongyles and pinworms (<i>Oxyuris equi </i>) has already been provided in the
New Animal Drug Application (NADA 100-402) for the powder dosage form, TELMIN(TM)
B Equine Wormer.   TELMIN(TM) B Paste is recommended for the same indications and
at the same dosage level as TELMIN B Equine Wormer.  A bioequivalency study was
conducted in which the critical efficacy of TELMIN B Paste was compared with
that of TELMIN B Equine Wormer.  Additionally, clinical field investigations
were performed in five different geographic locations to evaluate the efficacy
of TELMIN B Paste under practical conditions of use.   A summary of the studies
conducted is presented below. <p> 
 <b>1.  Bioequivalency Study - Pivotal Study</b> <p> 
 The anthelmintic activity of TELMIN B Paste Equine Wormer was compared to
that of an active treatment control, TELMIN B Powder, in 24 naturally
parasitized horses and ponies in a study (Trial No. MEB-99) conducted by B.
Seibert, V.M.D., at Pitman-Moore, Inc.  Each horse or pony received a single
oral treatment of TELMIN B Paste (12 animals) via syringe or TELMIN B Powder
(12 animals) mixed in the feed at the recommended rate (8.8 mg mebendazole + 40
mg trichlorfon/kg of body weight).  All fecal material was collected for five
days after treatment.  Five or six days post treatment, the animals were
necropsied and the parasites in the gastrointestinal tract were collected,
identified and counted.  Percent critical efficacy was calculated using the
following formula: <br>
<pre>

                           Mean No. Parasites Passed 
% Critical Efficacy  = ----------------------------------   x  100
                         Mean No. Parasites Passed plus     
                          Mean No. Parasites Retained

</pre>
 The
mean percent efficacy of both formulations against each parasite is presented
in Table 1.   In summary, the efficacy of TELMIN B Paste was statistically
equivalent to that of TELMIN B Powder against natural infections of parasites
claimed in horses and ponies.  Clinical signs were limited to two horses
treated with TELMIN B Paste and consisted of transient loose feces and mild
colic in one horse and rapid breathing and restlessness in the second horse.
Each horse recovered uneventfully within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms
without the need of symptomatic treatment. <p> 
 <b>2.  Critical Test - Corroborative Studies</b> <p> 
 Two critical efficacy tests were conducted early in the developmental
program using paste formulations of TELMIN(TM) B that differed slightly from the
final proposed commercial formula.  The mg/kg dosage levels delivered by each
prototype formulation was identical to the final product, namely, 8.8 mg
mebendazole and 40 mg trichlorfon per kg of body weight.<ul> <p> 
<li><b> a.  Trial No. MEB-93</b> was conducted by J. Guerrero, D.V.M., Ph.D., at
Pitman-Moore, Inc. using 12 adult horses.  The animals were divided into two
treatment groups with six horses per group. One group of horses was
administered a single oral dose of TELMIN(TM) B Paste and the second group
received the powder form, TELMIN(TM) B Equine Wormer, as an active treatment
control mixed in the feed.  Each drug treatment was administered at the
recommended rate of 8.8 mg mebendazole and 40 mg trichlorfon per kg of body
weight.  Total fecal material was collected from the day of treatment and
continuing for five days after treatment.  On the seventh day, the animals were
sacrificed and at necropsy the parasites in the entire gastrointestinal tract
were recovered. Percent critical efficacies for the paste and powder
formulations are shown in Table 1.  Statistical analysis of the results
indicated that there was no statistical difference (P less than 0.1) in
efficacy between the paste formulation and the currently approved powder
formulation of TELMIN B Equine Wormer.  The only side effects elicited were a
transitory softening of the feces in two horses treated with TELMIN B Paste,
one of which also exhibited sweating and mild colic one day after treatment.
The consistency of the feces of these two horses returned to normal three days
after the day of treatment.  The sweating and mild colic disappeared within 24
hours of observation. <p> 
 <li><b>b.  Trial No. MEB-77A</b> was conducted by J. Guerrero, D.V.M., Ph.D., at
Pitman-Moore, Inc., using 12 adult horses.  Six horses received TELMIN B Paste
orally via syringe at the recommended dose, while six other horses were treated
orally with the recommended dose of TELMIN B Powder (active treatment control),
mixed in the feed.  Total fecal material was collected from the day of
treatment and continuing for five days after treatment.   Seven days after
treatment, the animals were sacrificed and necropsied for parasite recovery.
The critical anthelmintic efficacy of each TELMIN(TM) B formulation 
 is given in Table 1.  The results of this study were that the paste
formulation was equivalent in efficacy to the currently approved powder
formulation of TELMIN B.   There was no statistical difference (P less than
0.1) in efficacy between the two formulations.  Side effects consisted of soft
feces in three paste treated horses and in three powder treated horses.  The
consistency of the feces in each of these horses returned to normal by three
days post treatment.  One of aforementioned paste treated horses also appeared
to be depressed the morning after treatment, but returned to normal by
mid-day. </ul><p> 
 <b>3.  Clinical Field Investigations</b> <p> 
 Clinical field investigations were conducted under the direction of Daniel
Ruth, V.M.D., in five veterinary practice locations.  The clinical
investigators were Michael J. Betley, D.V.M., Carol Stream, Illinois; Thomas E.
Goetz, D.V.M., Columbia, Missouri; Joseph G. Merriam, D.V.M., Uxbridge,
Massachusetts; Garry L. Stewart, D.V.M.,  
    Sulfur, Louisiana; and David L. Varra, D.V.M., Boulder, Colorado.   A 
total of 221 horses and eight ponies of both sexes and of various    ages and
breeds were included in the trial.   Quantitative fecal  examinations were
performed on all horses five days prior to treatment and repeated five to
ten days after treatment.  One hundred   eighty-one horses were treated with
TELMIN(TM) B Paste by delivering     the recommended dose of 8.8 mg/kg mebendazole
and 40.0 mg/kg trichlorfon of body weight directly onto the horse's
tongue via the   syringe, while 48 animals were used as untreated controls.
Percent  efficacy in reduction of eggs per gram (EPG) was calculated in
175  treated and 47 control cases which had pretreatment positive EPG 
counts. <p> 
 The average efficacy ranged from 86% to 95% in the treated horses, compared
to 0% to 60% for untreated control animals.  The overall efficacy of TELMIN B
Paste against nematodes was 91% for treated horses and 32% for untreated
controls, as determined by reduction in fecal EPG counts after treatment.  Of
the 117 treated horses and 33 control animals selected for bot observations,
33% of treated horses and 0% of controls showed bot removal.  Five horses
developed side effects after treatment.   In three cases the clinical signs
were self-limiting:  excessive salivation in a Quarter horse mare which
disappeared in 1.5 hours, low-spiritedness in a mare which returned to normal
in 24 hours and abstinence from food and water for 24  
 hours and from food for six days in a Shetland pony.  In the other two
cases, anorexia and scant feces were observed in a stallion and acute gastritis
was observed in a grade mare, which developed diarrhea persisting for six days.
 In each case, conservative medical treatment was administered with prompt and
complete resolution of clinical signs. <p> 
 <b>4.  Special Issues:  Combination Drugs</b> <p> 
 Data demonstrating the effectiveness of each of the active ingredients,
mebendazole and trichlorfon, is contained in the Freedom of Information Summary
for TELMIN(TM) B Equine Wormer (NADA 100-402) shown in Attachment 1.  The efficacy
of the two active ingredients, mebendazole and trichlorfon, is retained when
the combination is used as demonstrated by the critical and clinical studies.
Thus, the anthelmintic spectrum of the mebendazole/trichlorfon combination
paste is greater than that obtained by the use of each active ingredient
alone. <p> 
 This NADA complies with the combination drug policy stated in 21 CFR
514.1(b)(8)(v).  Studies which support the selection of the recommended dosages
for mebendazole and trichlorfon are contained in NADA 100-402.  Dose titration
studies were not required for the combination formulation due to the different
spectra of anthelmintic activity for each of the components. <p>

 <b>V.     Target Animal Safety</b> <p> 
 One safety study was conducted by B. Seibert, V.M.D., at Pitman-Moore, Inc.
in which the effects of TELMIN(TM) B Paste administered orally at 2.2 times the
recommended dose were determined in horses.  This study is summarized below.
The toxicity of the combination of mebendazole and trichlorfon in horses has
already been proven in the currently approved New Animal Drug Application (NADA
100-402) for the powder formulation of TELMIN(TM) B Equine Wormer, dated March 6,
1975, and approved February 19, 1980.  These studies have been summarized in
the Freedom of Information Summary for NADA 100-402 included in Attachment
1. <p> 
 <b>1.  Safety Study of TELMIN B Paste Equine Wormer</b> <p> 
 A total of 12 horses, including eight mares and four geldings, representing
various breeds or breed mixtures and ranging in age from approximately two to
11 years, were used in the study.  The horses were allocated to two groups with
each group consisting of two geldings and four mares.  To one group of six
horses, TELMIN B Paste was administered in a single oral dose via syringe at
the rate of 22 g/250 lb representing 2.2 times the recommended dose of 10 g/250
lb or 8.8 mg of mebendazole and 40 mg of trichlorfon/kg of body weight.  The
remaining six horses each received a placebo paste, formulated without
mebendazole or trichlorfon, administered orally via syringe at the rate of 22
g/250 lb.  Parameters examined in this study were clinical observations,
hematology, serum chemistry, sulfobromophthalein clearance (a liver function
test), and red blood cell cholinesterase activity. <p> 
 Results from the hematological, serum chemical and sulfobromophthalein
clearance tests did not reveal any drug-related changes. Diarrhea was the most
prevalent clinical sign observed in the 
 TELMIN B Paste treated horses.  Other side effects that occurred
infrequently and in mild form in this group included incoordination,
salivation, restlessness and pawing.  A brief period of quiet recumbency was
also observed in one treated horse.  Clinical signs were absent by eight hours
post treatment.  There were no side effects in the placebo-treated horses
except for mild diarrhea observed in one horse four hours after
treatment. <p> 
 Erythrocyte (RBC) cholinesterase determinations were made on blood samples
collected twice before treatment and at four hours, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32
days following treatment.   In the TELMIN B Paste treated group, depression of
cholinesterase activity was evident at the one hour post treatment sampling
time (23%) and the maximum depression (56%) was observed one day after
treatment.  Mean values 
  
 were 36% less than pretreatment levels at the final 32 day sampling time.
In this study, TELMIN B Paste significantly reduced (P less than 0.01)
cholinesterase activity when compared to the placebotreated control horses.
This finding was comparable to the results of a previous safety trial in which
the powder formulation of TELMIN B, when administered at 2.2 times the
recommended dose, also significantly reduced cholinesterase levels (P less than
0.01) in horses when compared to placebo control group.  Cholinesterase
depression is an expected pharmacological response following the administration
of a cholinergic drug such as trichlorfon. <p> 
 It was concluded in this study that the side effects observed were mild and
self-limiting and that cholinesterase depression is not unexpected following a
double dose of trichlorfon.  These reactions were comparable to that of the
powder formulation of TELMIN B when administered at 2.2 times the recommended
dose. <p> 
 <b>2.  Clinical Field Trial Safety</b> <p> 
 The safety of TELMIN B Paste was further confirmed in the clinical field
trial of TELMIN B Paste in which a total of 181 horses and ponies of both sexes
and of various ages and breeds were treated with TELMIN B Paste.   Side effects
were elicited in five horses (3%).  Excessive salivation was observed in a
Quarter horse mare, but this reaction disappeared 1.5 hours later.  An aged
mare was low in spirit, but was clinically normal within 24 hours.  A Shetland
pony refused food and water for 24 hours and was off feed for six days before
returning to normal.   No medication was administered to any of these horses
and recovery was complete.  Anorexia and scant feces were observed in a
10-month old Lipizzaner stallion and colic, loss of spirit and appetite and
diarrhea were observed in an aged mare.  Conservative medical treatment was
administered.  In both these cases, the clinical signs were regarded to have
been a result of effective worm treatment in the presence of heavy
parasitism. <p> 
 <b>3.  Reproductive Safety</b> <p> 
 Information to support the safe use of TELMIN B Paste in stallions and
pregnant mares up to the last month of pregnancy is based on the fact that the
active ingredients in the combination product, mebendazole and trichlorfon, are
individually approved for such use.  
 These products are currently on the market with approved New Animal Drug
Applications, i.e., TELMIN(TM) (mebendazole) Equine Wormer, NADA 91-736, approved
March 7, 1973, and ANTHON&#174; (trichlorfon) Horse Wormer,
Bayvet Division of Cutter Laboratories, Inc., NADA 15-161, approved May 13,
1964.  Further evidence was provided by B.M. Cooley, D.V.M., Lafayette,
Louisiana, who participated in a clinical trial in which the commercial
formulations of mebendazole (TELMIN) and trichlorfon (ANTHON) were administered
concurrently to 30 pregnant mares beyond the mid-point of pregnancy.   The
drugs were either mixed in the feed or given as a top dressing on the feed at
the label recommended doses for mebendazole (8.8 mg/kg) and trichlorfon (40
mg/kg).  There were no adverse effects in any of the pregnant mares and all
deliveries reported were uneventful.<p> 
 <b>VI.    Human Safety</b>   <p> 
 Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in
food, were not required for approval of this New Animal Drug Application.  This
drug is approved for use only in horses that are not to be used for food and is
to be labeled: <p> 
 WARNING:  Not for use in horses intended for food. <p> 
 With regard to human safety relative to possession, handling and
administration, there is a very slight risk of dermal absorption from handling
this drug and an appropriate warning appears on the label to wash hands after
use.  The label further states:   If swallowed by a human, immediately call
physician, poison control center or hospital emergency room. Additional
emergency medical advice for induction of vomition is provided. <p>

 <b>VIII.     Agency Conclusions</b> <p>
 <b></b>The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the
requirements of Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing
regulations.  It demonstrates that mebendazole/ trichlorfon oral paste
combination when used as labeled is safe and effective. <p>
 This product has an adequate margin of safety for use by the layman and the
possible adverse reactions that may occur are usually mild and reversible.  The
label carries the description of side effects that may be encountered so that
the laymen can distinguish them from other signs of unrelated pathology.  The
drug poses no problem with disease organisms, immunosuppression by steriod
agents or change in intestinal flora.  The label warns that trichlorfon, one of
the active ingredients, is a cholinesterase inhibitor and should not be used
simultaneously or within a few days before or after treatment with other
cholinesterase inhibiting drugs, pesticides or chemicals.  Other drugs that
this product may have interaction with are prescription items and should pose
no problem for the layman who does not have access to them.  No special
handling is necessary to ensure humane treatment of the animal. <p>
 All horses carry a parasite burden and this is generally recognized by the
professional horseman and lay public, interested in horses. This product is a
broad spectrum anthelmintic which is effective against the major parasites of
horses.  Therefore, the layman will not be required to make a specific
diagnosis to use this product. However, if the layman has a serious problem
with parasitism in horses, the label bares the statement:  "Consult your
veterinarian for assistance in the diagnosis, treatment and control of
parasitism." <p> 
 The product is for oral administration to horses with adequate directions
for use which, in our judgement, the layman can reasonably be expected to
follow for the conditions of use, prescribed, recommended or suggested in the
approved labeling and will be followed in practice.  Accordingly, we have
concluded that the product be categorized as an over-the-counter product
(OTC). <p>

<b>Date Stamped:  </b>March 11, 1993<p>
<b>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by
the 
Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR 50460, December
15, 
1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new animal drug application
(ANADA) 
may be submitted for a generic version of an approved new animal drug (pioneer
product). 
New target animal safety data and drug effectiveness data were not required for
approval 
of this ANADA. This ANADA relies on the target animal safety and drug
effectiveness data 
in the pioneer's new animal drug application. Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor
shows that 
the generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer. Bioequivalence is usually
demonstrated 
through a clinical end-point study.<p>
For certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160; 
bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter; 
Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990). Based upon the formulation
characteristics of the 
generic product, Abbott Laboratories was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in
vivo</i>&#160; 
bioequivalence study for IsoFlo(TM).  The generic and
pioneer 
products are liquid anesthetics with the same active and inactive ingredients.
The generic 
and pioneer products also contain the same concentration of active ingredient.
This 
ANADA was granted a waiver October 5, 1992 (see section 5).<p>
<b>3. HUMAN SAFETY:</b><p>
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not 
required for approval of this ANADA. The drug is to be labeled for use in dogs,
which are 
non-food animals, and only for use in horses that are not to be used for food,
and is to be 
labeled: "Warning: Not for use in horses intended for food."<p>
<b>Human safety relative to possession, handling and administration:</b><p> A cautionary
statement 
which pertains to the safety of this drug product for humans is included in the
labeling of 
the drug product, as follows: "Caution: Operating rooms should be provided with
adequate 
ventilation to prevent the accumulation of anesthetic vapors."<p>
<b>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that 
IsoFlo (isoflurane, USP), when used under its proposed conditions of use, is
safe and 
effective for labeled indications.<p>

FREEDOM
OF INFORMATION SUMMARY FOR PYRANTEL PAMOATE TABLETS FOR DOGS<P>
<B> I.	IDENTIFICATION:</B><p>
 NADA Number:  NADA 101-331<P>
Sponsor Name/Address:<p>
 Ralston Purina Co. <br>
Checkerboard Square <br>
St. Louis, MO  63188<p>
Generic Name:  Pyrantel pamoate <P>
Trade Name:  Dog Wormer Tablets<P>
<B> II. INDICATIONS FOR USE:</B><P>
For the removal of large roundworms (ascarids), <i>Toxocara canis
</i>and <i>Toxascaris leonina </i>and hookworms, <i>Anyclostoma caninum</i> and
<i>Uncinaria stenocephala </i>in dogs.  The presence of these parasites should
be confirmed by laboratory fecal examination.  Consult your veterinarian for
assistance in the diagnosis, treatment and control of parasitism.<P>
<b>III.  DOSAGE FORM, ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION, AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE:</b><P>
<b>Dosage Form:  </b>Purina Dog Wormer Tablets are formulated in three sizes of
oral tablets at concentrations of 22.7 mg., 45.4 mg. and 113.5 mg. pyrantel
base as pyrantel pamoate per tablet.<P>
<b>Route of Administration:  </b>Pyrantel pamoate oral tablets are administered
orally by placing the tablet in a small amount of meat to be hand fed to the
dog or by placing the tablets directly into the back of the dog's mouth.<P>
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><br>
22.7 mg pyrantel base as pyrantel pamoate tablet 1 tablet per each 10
lbs of dog body weight.<P>
45.4 mg pyrantel base as pyrantel pamoate tablet 1 tablet per 20 lbs of dog
body weight.  Tablet may be broken in half to provide 1/2 tablet for 10 lbs
body weight.<P>
113.5 mg pyrantel base as pyrantel pamoate tablet 1 tablet per 50 lbs of dog
body weight.  Tablet may be broken in half to provide 1/2 tablet for 25 lbs of
body weight.<P>
Label directions are designed to provide a minimum of 2.27 mg pyrantel base per
pound body weight for dogs weighing more than 5 pounds body weight, and 4.54 mg
pyrantel base per pound body weight for dogs weighing 5 lbs or less.<P>
Tablets are scored to facilitate breaking of tablet for more accurate
dosage.<P>
<b>EFFECTIVENESS:</b><P>
<b>A.	Dosage Titration </b> <P>
It has been established in critical efficacy evaluations, control critical
efficacy evaluations, and clinical nematode egg count studies that pyrantel
pamoate at 2.27 mg pyrantel base/lb of body weight for dogs weighing more than
5 lbs body weight and 4.54 mg pyrantel base/ lb of body weight for dogs
weighing less than 5 lbs body weight, administered orally to dogs, is safe and
effective for the removal of large roundworms (ascarids) and hookworms as cited
above.<P>
The basic titration data supporting the dosage of 2.27 mg/lb (5 mg/kg) is
contained by cross reference in Pfizer Inc's. approved NADA 100-237, Pyrantel
Pamoate oral suspension.  A letter of authorization dated May 20, 1975 from
Pfizer is contained in NADA 101-331 for Ralston Purina to refer to NADA 100-237
for data supporting safety and efficacy of pyrantel pamoate.<P>
Newer information gathered from specific studies with Pyrantel pamoate tablets
indicated a somewhat higher dosage (4.54 mg/lb) is required in dogs weighing
less than 5 pounds.  Since no greater risk of toxicity would be present from
this increased level, it was decided to provide in the labeling for the
administration of one full 22.7 milligram tablet to dogs 10 pounds and under in
order to insure satisfactory efficacy in the smaller animals.<P>
<b>B.	Critical Laboratory Studies </b> <P>
In compliance with 21 CFR 514.111(a)(5)(vi) for controlled studies, the
following adequate and well-controlled critical evaluations were conducted with
the market product:<P>
<b>1.	Trial: </b><p>
R.P. Experiment #26 - University of Wisconsin<P>
<b>Investigator:  </b>A.C. Todd, Ph.D.<P>
<b>Institution</b><P>

Madison, Wisconsin<P>
<b>Type of Investigation:  </b>Control Critical Efficacy Evaluation<P>
<b>Design of Investigation:  </b>Ten dogs infected with <i>T. canis
</i>were<br>individually penned and treated with pyrantel pamoate oral tablets
at the target dose level of 5 mg pyrantel base/kg of body weight.<P>
Ten dogs were held as sham dosed controls.<P>
All worms passed for 96 hours after treatment were recovered for identification
and enumeration.  The dogs were euthanized and the worms remaining in the
intestinal tract recovered for identification and counted.<P>
Criteria for pyrantel pamoate effectiveness was determined by comparing the
number of worms eliminated in the feces versus the total number of worms
eliminated in the feces plus those remaining in the gastrointestinal tract at
necropsy.<P>
<b>Findings:  </b>An average percent reduction of 81% was obtained in the ten
treated dogs.  Four-tenths percent reduction in the worm burden of the 10
control dogs occurred at the same time.<P>
<b>2.	Trial: </b><p>
R.P. Experiment<P>
<b>Investigator:  </b>C.W. Dickerson, M.S.<P>
<b>Institution:	</b><p>
Ralston Purina Co. Research Farm<br<
 Gray Summit, MO<P>
<b>Type of Investigation:  </b>Control Critical Efficacy Evaluation.<P>
<b>Design of Investigation:  </b>Ten dogs infected with <i>Uncinaria
Stenocephala </i>were individually penned and treated with pyrantel pamoate
oral tablets at the target dose of 5 mg pyrantel base/kg of body weight (2.27
mg/lb).<P>
Ten dogs were held as sham dosed controls.<P>
All worms passed for 96 hours after treatment were recovered for identification
and enumeration.  The dogs were euthanized and the worms remaining in the
intestinal tract recovered for identification and counted.<P>
Criteria for pyrantel pamoate effectiveness was determined by comparing the
number of worms eliminated in the feces versus the total number of worms
eliminated in the feces plus those remaining in the gastrointestinal tract at
necropsy.<P>
<b>Findings:  </b>An average percent reduction of 88.6% was obtained in the ten
treated dogs.  0.5% reduction in the worm burden of the 10 control dogs was
observed concurrently.  When worm burdens from treated dogs was compared to
worm burdens of control dogs at necropsy an efficacy of greater than 95% was
calculated for the drug.<P>
The following partially-controlled critical laboratory studies were conducted
in addition to the above two well-controlled evaluations:<P>
<b>3.	Trial:  </b><p>
R.P. Experiments &#35;  1 through &#35;  11<P>
<b>Investigator:  </b>C.W. Dickerson, M.S.<P>
<b>Institution:</b>	<p

<b>Type of Investigation:  </b>Critical Efficacy Evaluations<P>
<b>Design of Investigation:  </b>A total one-hundred and thirteen dogs infected
with varying combinations of ascarids and hookworms were individually penned
and treated with pyrantel pamoate oral tablets at the target dose level of 2.27
mg pyrantel base/lb of body weight.  A total of sixteen dogs were retained as
unmedicated controls.<P>
All worms passed for 96 hours after treatment were recovered for identification
and enumeration.  The dogs were euthanized and the worms remaining in the
intestinal tract recovered for identification and counted.<P>
Criteria for pyrantel pamoate effectiveness was determined by comparing the
number of worms eliminated in the feces versus the total number of worms
eliminated in the feces plus those remaining in the gastrointestinal tract at
necropsy.<P>
<b>Findings:  </b>Pyrantel pamoate was highly efficacious at the target dose of
2.27 mg pyrantel base/lb against <i>T. canis </i>(95%), <i>T. leonina
</i>(98%), <i>A. caninum </i>(96%), and <i>U. stenocephala </i>(92%7.<P>

day 4.<P>
Criteria for pyrantel pamoate effectiveness was determined by monitoring
nematode egg count data pre and post-medication.<P>
<b>Findings:  </b>Pyrantel pamoate was highly efficacious (97%) against
hookworm infections.<P>
2. Three (3) clinical trials were conducted with Purina Dog Wormer Tablets
which included 33 treated dogs.  No signs of toxicity or other related side
effects were noted.<P>
<br>
a.  William A. Krumrey, D.V.M. <br>
Yorkshire Animal Hospital <br>
8088 Watson Road<br>
St. Louis, Missouri  63119<P>
Treated twelve (12) dogs between August 21, 1974, to October 1, 1974.  All were
totally cleared of Ascarids and/or hookworm eggs following treatment.<P>
b.  John C. Eckert, D.V.M. <br>
Concord Animal Hospital <br>
11705 Concord Village Avenue <br>
St. Louis, Missouri  63128<P>
Treated twelve (12) dogs between August 29, 1974, to October 28, 1974.  Five
(5) of seven (7) dogs treated were totally cleared of Ascarids and for
hookworms eggs following treatment.  Five (5) dogs were either not infected or
no post treatment fecal sample was obtained.<P>
c.  Suzanne Saueressig, D.V.M. <br>
Humane Society of Missouri <br>
1210 Macklind Avenue<br>
St. Louis, Missouri  63110<P>
Treated nine (9) dogs between August 26, 1974 and November 16, 1974   Of the
two (2) dogs trested in which post-treatment examinations were made, one
roundworm and two hookworm infections were controlled.<P>
The field studies described above were open evaluations and not in direct
compliance with 21 CFR 514.111(a)(5)(vi) for controlled comparisons.
Accordingly, the requirement for controlled field evaluations was waived by the
agency.  The basis for waiver is that the results of the critical laboratory
trials are considered to be adequate to establish the effectiveness of the
product.<br>
At the time of conduct of these trials, several years ago, controlled field
studies were not a recommended or required procedure.<P>
As a result, in addition to the limited trials outlined above, several hundred
other animals were dosed with either pyrantel pamoate tablets or suspension in
individual field evaluations. These studies were primarily designed to assess
the clinical safety of the formulations and not so much the actual efficacy of
the drug.  As stated previously, critical anthelmintic measurements provide
more substantial and objective evidence on the effectiveness of a compound,
than do non-critical observations.<P>
<b>D.  Supportive Data:</b><P>
In addition to the above studies, critical efficacy evaluations were conducted
with a susupension formulation of pyrantel pamoate, covered by NADA 100-237.  A
total of 5 additional studies involving 90 critical efficacy observations with
the suspension were submitted to support the effectivemess of the tablet
formulation of pyrantel pamoate for dogs.  The results of these related
efficacy studies with the suspension formulation are summarized in Table 1 and
compared to the efficacy results obtained for the tablets which were reported
induvidually above.  Foreign critical and clinical trials are contained in the
cross-referenced NADA 100-237 as supportive information.<P>
The names and addresses of investigators conducting the related safety and
efficacy studies are presented Table 2.<P>
<b>V. Animal Safety</b><P>
Animal safety of pyrantel pamoate oral dosage forms has been adequately
demonstrated per Pfizer, Inc. approved NADA 100-237.  Pfizer, Inc. provided
authorization to Ralston Purina Company on May 20, 1975 to refer to safety data
contained in Pfizer, Inc. NADA's 091-739, 100-237 and 016-883  in support of
NADA 101-331 on page 00035. <P>
 <b>Human Safety</b><P>
Pyrantel pamoate oral tablets are indicated for use only in non-food  
 producing animals.  The risk of toxicity from accidental human exposure
is considered low since it is intended for limited dosing.  The drug is approved for use in humans and is considered to have a wide margin of
safety.<P>
<b>Agency Conclusion</b><P>
The data submitted in support of this NADA complies with the requirements of 512 of the Act 
and demonstrate that Purina Dog Wormer Tablets when used under its proposed conditions of use
 is safe and effective for the treatment of roundworm and hookworm infection in dogs.

Summary</b><p>




<b>I.  General Information:<p>
 		NADA Number:</b>		140-820<p>
 		<b>Sponsor:</b><p>			Furst-McNess Company<br>
						Freeport, Illinois  61032<p>
 	<b>Generic Name:</b>		Tylosin (as tylosin phosphate) combined 
						with Sulfamethazine<p>
 		<b>Trade Name:</b>		Tylan 5, 10, 20 &amp; 40 Sulfa-G Premixes<p>
 	<b>Date of Summary: </b> January 9, 1987<p>
 <b>II.  Indications for Use:</b><p>
For maintaining weight gains and feed efficiency in the presence of
atrophic rhinitis; lowering the incidence and severity of <i>Bordetella
bronchiseptica</i>&#160; rhinitis; prevention of swine dysentery (vibrionic); control of
swine pneumonias caused by bacterial pathogens (<i>Pasteurella multocida</i>&#160; and/or
<i>Corynebecterium pyogenes</i> ).<p>
Feeds containing Tylosin and Sulfamethazine must be withdrawn 15 days
before swine are slaughtered.<p>
 <b>III.  Dosage Form :</b> Medicated Premix:<p>
The premix is to be added to the feed such that the complete feed contains
100 grams of tylosin and 100 grams of sulfamethazine per ton.<p>
 <b>IV.  Summary of Safety and Efficacy:</b><p>
The safety and efficacy data upon which this application was approved are
found in NADAs 12-491 and 41-275 for Elanco Products Company, and are
summarized in an FOI Summary field with the Dockets Management Branch under the
generic name of the drugs.<p>
 <b>V.  Agency Conclusion:</b><p>
Approval of this application is based on safety and effectiveness data
contained in Elanco Products Company's approved NADAs 12-491 and 41-275.  Use
of the data in NADAs 12-491 and 41-275 to support this application has been
authorized by Elanco.  This approval does not change the approved use of the
drug.  Consequently, approval of this NADA poses no increased human risk from
exposure to residues of the animal drug, nor does it change the conditions of
the drug's safe use in the target animal species.  Accordingly, under the
Center for Veterinary Medicine's supplemental approval policy (42 FR 64367),
this is equivalent to a Category II supplemental approval, which does not
require reevaluation of the safety and effectiveness data in the original

<b>4.  Safety and Efficacy: </b><p>
Pyrilamine   Maleate   Injection   (Histosol,   NADA    7-404)   was the subject
of a review by the National Academy of   Sciences/National Research Council
(NAS/NRC),  Drug Efficacy Study Group,  the results 
of which were  published  in  the FEDERAL REGISTER of  July   22, 1970    (35   FR
11713).    NAS/NRC concluded,   and FDA concurred  that the product   was
"probably effective"  for use in   cattle,   horses and  
dogs  in conditions where antihistaminic  therapy may be expected to lead
to   alleviation of some signs  of disease.    The product was  
raised  to "effective"  after deletion of claims  in cattle and dogs  as
there   was   inadequate safety data   for   these   species.  FDA 
concluded   that   the use of pyrilamine maleate  injection   must be 
limited  to  horses  (not for  food  use).     A regulation was  published 
as   Section    522.2063.  The FEDERAL   REGISTER   publication date December
2,  1977   on    Pyrilamine Maleate Injection   states  that applications
providing   for   the   effective   conditions   of use  
identified in  
the regulation need not include data   required establish  the effectiveness
of  the drug  for  these uses.<p>
Under Center for Veterinary Medicine policy,   the principles  of 
CFR    320.22   providing   for a   waiver   of   the   requirement
for submission    of    evidence of    <i>in vivo</i>&#160;    bioavailability
and 
bioequivalence   are   applied  to NAS/NRC-reviewed true   solutions 
administered IV  that were found  to be  effective. Therefore   such data
were neither required nor submitted.<p>
 
<b>5.   Human Safety:</b><p>
Data   on human safety,   pertaining  to  consumption of  drug  residues in
food, were not required for approval of  this NADA.   The drug is approved
for use only  in horses  that are not to be used for   food and is to be
labeled:  Not  to be used  in horses intended for food.<p>
<b>Human safety relative  to possession,  handling and administration:</b><p>
 No specific caution statement required.<p>
<b>6.  Agency Conclusions:</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this New Animal Drug Application comply with
the requirements of Section 512 of the Act and 514.111 of the implementing
regulations.  It demonstrates that Pyrilamine Maleate Injection, when used
under its labeled conditions of use, is safe and effective.<p>
For the safe and effective intravenous use of Pyrilamine Maleate Injection in
horses, it is necessary to provide a differential diagnosis of the disease
causing pathology which only a trained professional can accomplish.  Thus, the
expertise of a veterinarian is necessary for safe and effective administration.
Accordingly, labeling must bear the veterinary prescription legend.<p>

The
tablet formulation and dosage table were designed to provide the current
approved dosage of praziquantel (Droncit&#174;; Miles NADA No. 111-798) for 100&#37;
elimination of tapeworms and at least 20 mg/kg (9.09 mg/lb) pyrantel base for
removal of hookworms and large roundworms.<p>
<b>4.   Effectiveness</b><p>
<b>a.   Reference  to  Droncit&#174;  (praziquantel)  NADA</b><p>
Praziquantel tablets are currently approved for use in cats for the removal of
tapeworm infections (NADA No. 111-798).  Data contained in the Droncit&#174; NADA
are referenced to establish the efficacy of the praziquantel component in
praziquantel/pyrantel  tablets.<p>
<b>b.   Pivotal  Well-Controlled  Laboratory  Efficacy  Studies.</b><p>
Pyrantel pamoate administered at a dosage of at least 20 mg/kg (9.09 mg/lb)
base was selected to provide efficacious removal of hookworms and large
roundworms of 
cats.   Two adequate and well-controlled laboratory studies were conducted
to demonstrate   that pyrantel does not interfere with the cestocidal activity
of praziquantel  for removal of tapeworms, to confirm that pyrantel is
efficacious for the removal  of hookworms and large roundworms of cats, and
to demonstrate the 
combined  formulation of praziquantel plus pyrantel  provides  efficacious
removal of the parasites listed on the label.<p>
A separate dose titration study to determine an optimal pyrantel pamoate dosage
in cats was not necessary, as the sponsor documented efficacy of Drontal
tablets of at least 90&#37; for each parasite to be included in the labeling.<p>
The following formulations were evaluated in the laboratory studies: Drontal
Tablets was the formulation intended for the market.<p>

These studies were conducted in accordance with the FDA Canine/Feline
Anthelmintic Guidelines.   Parasite infections were diagnosed by fecal
examinations prior to including the animals in each study. Each cat was then
treated with the designated tablet formulation.   Control cats in each study
were treated with placebo (blank) tablets. The studies were blinded in that the
investigators were not aware of the content of the tablet formulations until
the studies were concluded.   Seven days after treatment the cats were
euthanitized and the gastrointestinal tracts were removed and examined for all
remaining parasites.<p>
Percent efficacy was calculated for each parasite species from the number of
parasites recovered at necropsy using the following formula:<p>


<pre>

Mean No. of Parasites         Mean No. of Parasites

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of pyrantel pamoate
alone and in combination with praziquantel for the removal of hookworms and
large roundworms of cats.  A total of 65 mixed-breed cats (23 males and 42
females), ranging in age from young cats to adults, ranging in weight from
1.1-4.6 kg with naturally acquired infections of <i>Ancylostoma tubaeforme
</i>&#160;and <i>Toxocara cati</i>&#160;   were included in the study.  The cats were
randomized into 3 groups. The cats received treatment with either pyrantel
tablets, Drontal Tablets or placebo tablets (control). The number of parasites
recovered from each group at necropsy and efficacy data are given in Table

<b>Conclusions:  </b><p>
 There were no significant differences between pyrantel and Drontal
Tablets for removal of <i>A. tubaeforme </i>&#160;(P&#61; 0.0906) or <i>T. cati </i>&#160;(P&#61;
0.6151). 
The results of the study demonstrated the efficacy of Drontal Tablets against
hookworms  <i>(Ancylostoma  tubaeforme) </i>&#160;and roundworms (<i>Toxocara  cati </i>).
Praziquantel did not interfere with the activity of pyrantel for removal of
either parasite, as the efficacies for both parasites were high, 99.53&#37; for
<i>Ancylostoma tubaeforme </i>&#160;and 89&#37; for <i>Toxocara  cati  </i>).  The 89&#37;
(slightly less than the acceptable standard of 90&#37; for anthelmintics) can be
explained by biological variation, as laboratory study &#35;2 (see below) showed
efficacy of Drontal tablets against <i>T. cati </i>&#160;of 99.28&#37;.<p>

<b>2)   Laboratory Study No.  2:   Dr.  D.  Bowman,  Stanwood,  MI </b><p>
The purpose of this study was to confirm that pyrantel pamoate does not
interfere with the activity of praziquantel for tapeworm removal and to
demonstrate the efficacy of the combined formulation of praziquantel plus
pyrantel for treatment of tapeworm, hookworm and large roundworm infections of
cats.  A total of 28 mixed-breed cats (13 males and 15 females) of various
sizes and aged young to adults with naturally acquired infections of <i>Taenia
taeniaeformis </i>,  <i>Ancylostoma tubaeforme </i>&#160;and <i>Toxocara cati
</i>&#160;were included in the study. The cats were randomized into 2 groups. One
group was treated with Drontal Tablets and the other group received placebo
tablets (control).   The number of parasites recovered from the two groups at
necropsy and efficacy data are given in Table 2.<p>

<b>c.   Pivotal  Clinical  Trial</b><p>
A clinical trial was conducted with a common protocol by investigators at 6
geographic locations in the United States to provide additional information
regarding the performance of Drontal Tablets. The investigators are listed

The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Drontal
Tablets for treatment of cats naturally infected with tapeworms plus hookworms
or large roundworms under practical conditions.   Pretreatment fecal samples
from each cat were examined microscopically for diagnosis of the parasite
infections.   Each animal served as its own control.<p>
The investigators were provided with Drontal Tablets containing 18.2 mg
praziquantel and 72.6 pyrantel base as pyrantel pamoate per tablet (the
formulation to be marketed).<p>
Each cat was weighed prior to treatment and the following schedule was then
utilized to determine the number of whole or one-half tablets for each cat
based on body weight.<p>


<b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 2 columns.)</b><P>

 9 - 12           1 1/2
13 - 16             2


</pre>
 
This schedule provided a dosage range of 5-10 mg/kg (2.27 - 4.54mg/lb)
praziquantel  plus  20-40  mg/kg  (9.09 - 18.18 mg/lb)  pyrantel  base.<p>
The tablets were given directly by mouth as a single treatment.<p>
A post-treatment fecal sample was collected from each cat 7 - 10 days following
treatment and examined for nematode eggs using the same flotation procedure
used for pretreatment.   Percent reduction of the fecal egg count was
recorded.<p>
In addition, feces from each cat were examined closely on Days 5, 6 and 7 after
treatment for the presence of tapeworm proglottids.   Any proglottids observed
at this time were to be identified by the investigator.<p>
A total of 85 cats (44 males and 41 females) were treated with Drontal Tablets.
The cats ranged from the age of one month to 14 years with a weight range of
one to sixteen pounds.  The cases included a variety of breeds while domestic
short hair, domestic, or mixed-breed were the most common, 94.4&#37;.   Efficacy
evaluation was based upon 84 fully completed cases (post-treatment efficacy
evaluation was not available for one of the cats).  The number of parasite
infections treated and the post-treatment reduction of the mean egg counts are
given in Table 3.<p>
Other animal health products were administered concurrently to 33 of the cats
with no apparent incompatibility.   These products were primarily antibiotics,
insecticides,  and  immunizations.<p>

<b>Conclusion:  </b>   <p>
  Drontal Tablets were efficacious for the removal of tapeworms, hookworms
and large roundworms of cats.<p>
<b>Summary  of  the  Clinical  Trial  Results</b><p>
The results of the pivotal clinical trial confirmed the data collected during
the two pivotal laboratory efficacy studies.   The recommended treatment dosage
of Drontal Tablets was found to be safe and efficacious for the parasite
species indicated on the label under conditions of practical use.<p>
<b>d.   Corroborative   Efficacy   Studies</b><p>
<b>1)   Drs.  C.R.  Reinemeyer  and  R.C.  DeNovo,  Knoxville,  TN</b><p>
Twenty-four cats were included in a controlled study to evaluate the efficacy
of pyrantel pamoate for removal of naturally acquired <i>A.  tubaeforme</i>&#160;  and
<i>T. cati</i>&#160; infections.   Eight cats each received either pyrantel pamoate paste or
granules at a dosage of 20 mg/kg.  Eight cats did not receive medication and
served as controls. The cats were euthanitized 7 days after treatment and
examined for all remaining gastrointestinal nematodes.   The paste formulation
was 100&#37; efficacious for the removal of <i>A. tubaeforme</i>&#160; and 93.5&#37; efficacious for
the removal of <i>T.  cati </i>.  Pyrantel 
pamoate granules removed 100&#37; of the <i>A. tubaeforme </i>&#160; and 88.9&#37; of the
<i>T. cati </i>.    The control cats at necropsy harbored means of 29.5 and
19.1 <i>A. tubaeforme </i>&#160;and <i>T. cati </i>&#160;per cat,  respectively.<p>

<b>2)   Drs.  P.  Hedeman  and  T.  Hopkins,  Bahrs  Hill,  Australia</b><p>
Nine kittens 3-4 months of age were included in a critical anthelmintic study
to evaluate efficacy of praziquantel &#43; pyrantel tablets against experimental
<i>A. tubaeforme</i>&#160; infections.   The kittens were each experimentally
infected with 200 infective<i> A. tubaeforme </i>&#160;larvae.   Twenty-four days
after the experimental infections the kittens were given praziquantel &#43;
pyrantel tablets to provide 5 mg/kg praziquantel &#43; 20 mg/kg pyrantel base.
All feces were collected from each kitten and examined for eliminated worms for
4 days after treatment.  The kittens were then euthanitized and examined for
all worms remaining in the gastrointestinal tract. The praziquantel &#43; pyrantel
treatments were 94.4&#37; efficacious for removal of <i>A. tubaeforme </i>.<p>
<b>e.   Overall   Efficacy   Summary</b><p>
A total of 93 cats with naturally acquired parasite infections were included in
two well-controlled laboratory studies to establish the efficacy of Drontal
Tablets.   In addition, 85 cats and kittens of various sizes, ages and breeds
were included in clinical field studies conducted at six veterinary clinics at
different geographic locations throughout the United States.   Data indicate
most cats are cleared of their parasite infections within 7 days of treatment.
These studies demonstrated Drontal Tablets are safe and efficacious for the
removal of the parasite species indicated on the label when used as
directed.<p>
<b>5.   Animal  Safety</b><p>
<b>a.   Pivotal   Studies</b><p>
Two preclinical safety studies were conducted in cats with the
praziquantel/pyrantel  pamoate tablet formulation  in  accordance  with  Good
Laboratory  Practice  Regulations.<p>
<b>1)   Drug  Tolerance  Test  (Drug  Tolerance  Test  for  the  use  of
Praziquantel/Pyrantel   Tablets   in   Cats)</b><p>
M. Kohlenberg of Shawnee Mission, Kansas conducted a drug tolerance evaluation
in 3 adult cats (one male gray tabby and two females, a domestic longhair and a
gray tabby) with the  18.2mg praziquantel/72.6mg pyrantel pamoate tablet.
This evaluation determined the effects of administering 
10 times the highest use rate of the tablet formulation in a single day.  One
male and one female cat received the treatment and the female control received
an equivalent number of placebo tablets.   The study was blinded because the
individuals making clinical observations were not aware of the respective
treatments.   Further, the laboratories conducting the clinical
chemistry/hematology  evaluations  and  histological  readings  were  not
informed of the treatments.   Parameters of the study included clinical signs,
body weights, clinical chemistries, hematology, gross pathology and
histopathology.   The study concluded 7 days post-treatment.   Vomition and
salivation were the only clinical signs observed.   Body weights remained
stable.   The post-treatment serum 
chemistry and hematology values were all within the normal ranges.   The
lesions (reddened or thickened urinary bladders, fallopian tube cyst, moderate
redness of the lungs, hairballs, and kidneys firm to the cut) were observed at
necropsy.   None of these lesions were associated with administration of
Drontal 
tablets.   All tissues  were within normal limits histologically.   Statistical
analyses were unnecessary to the conclusions.  It was concluded from this
study that a single treatment of    cats with this praziquantel/pyrantel pamoate
formulation at 10 times the highest label use rate can induce vomition and
salivation without 
other adverse effects.  The results are summarized in Table 4.<P>

M. Kohlenberg also conducted a general safety study in 16 adult cats of various
breeds using the 18.2/72.6 mg tablet.  Four of the cats, Group I, were nontreated
controls. Groups II, III and IV (4 animals/group) received 1, 3 and 5 times the
recommended use rate, respectively, for 3 consecutive days (3 times the labeled
duration of treatment). Parameters evaluated were clinical signs, body weights,
hematology, clinical chemistries, necropsy observations and histological
readings.  The study was completely blinded for the clinical sign observations,
clinical laboratory procedures and histological readings.  Body weights were
stable during the study.  One incident of vomition and one of nonformed stool
were obvserved in the nontreated control animals. No clinical signs were observed
in the cats receiving use rate reeatments for the 3 days.  Two of the 4 cats
receiving 3X treatments had signs of vomition and an additional animal had
diarrhea on one occasion.  All 4 cats treated at the 5X rate showed vomition.<p>

Cat #720 from Group III had an elevated glucose value of 236 mg/dl (normal range
of 60-125 mg/dl) 5 days post-treatment.  Cat # 690 from Group III had an elevated
CPK value of 1442 U/L (normal range of 45-890 U/L) 5 days post-treatment.  These
elevated values were not directly asociated with test aritcle administration, as
other cats in this dosage group were not affected and the 5X group did not have
elevated values (no post-treatment clinically significant trends).   The group
mean values for the hematology  and clinical chemistry parameters when compared
to the pretreatment values or to those of the nontreated controls were not
elevated.  None of the findings at necropsy (see below) or upon histological
examination were judged to be directly related to administration of Drontal
tablets.   Statistical analyses, therefore, were unnecessary to the conclusions. 
It was concluded from this study that an adequate safety margin exists for the
treatment of cats with a combination praziquantel/pyrantel tablet based upon
these treatments of use rate, 3 times use and 5 times use rate for 3 times the
labeled duration. The data are summarized in Table 5.<p>
<b>Gross   Pathology   Findings</b><p>
 
<ul>
<li>Redness of the lungs and urinary bladder mucosa was noted in 14 of the 16
cats, including the  control  group.<p>
 
<li>Cat # 682 (5X) had a dark, firm area in the lung measuring 1/4 inches by
1/8 inches. The cat also showed slight mucosal redness to the urinary bladder
and slight redness of the cortex of the kidney.<p>
 
<li>Cat # 690 (3X) showed a growth approximately 5 millimeters thick which
covered the entire mucosal surface of the bladder.  There was also mild to
marked redness of the mucosal  surface.<p>
 
<li>Cat # 691 (3X) showed a reddened cortex and medulla of the kidney.<p>
 
<li>Cat # 698 (5X) had a slightly reddened kidney cortex.<p>
 
<li>Cat # 720 (3X) had slightly bloody urine at necropsy.  No lesions were seen
in the bladder itself.</ul><p>
<b>Histopathology</b><p>
The consulting veterinary pathologist stated that there were no histopathologic
changes found in any of the cats that would be interpreted to be treatment
related.<p>

<b>3)   Confirmation  of  Safety  in  Clinical  Field  Trials</b><p>
Confirmation of safety for the use of Drontal Tablets (praziquantel/pyrantel
pamoate) for cats was achieved in clinical field trials.   Six veterinary
clinics in various geographical locations completed safety evaluations for 85
case reports. The cats were in an age range of one month to 14 years with a
weight range of one to 16pounds.  Both males (44) and females (41) were
included and the cases included a variety of breeds while domestic short hair,
domestic, or mixed-breed were the most common, 94.4&#37;.   Other animal health
products were administered concurrently to 33 of the cats with no
incompatibility.   These products were primarily  antibiotics,  insecticides
and  immunizations.   The clinical  veterinarians rated overall safety as
excellent for 83 of the cases (97.6&#37;) with 2 of the cases 
(2.4&#37;) rated good.  No cases were rated as fair or poor.  Of the 2 cases rated
good, one owner observed loose stools from the cat 6 - 7 days following
treatment and another owner indicated the cat had loss of appetite after
treatment.   In conclusion, the clinical field trial safety evaluations
substantiated an adequate safety margin for the treatment of cats with Drontal
Broad Spectrum Wormer Tablets.<p>
<b>b.   Corroborative   Safety   Studies</b><p>
Reference is made to an NADA containing one of the components.  Additionally,
clinical field trial safety studies were conducted at veterinary clinics in
various geographical areas of the United States.<p>
<b>1)  Reference  to  NADA 111-798</b><p>
Safety for the treatment of cats with a tablet formulation of praziquantel was
evaluated and presented in NADA 111-798.  This NADA concerned Droncit&#174; Feline
Cestocide Tablets and contained 5 preclinical safety studies conducted by GLP
regulations.   It further presented clinical field trial data for the treatment
of 
135 cats.<p>
<b>2)   Drs.  C.R.  Reinemeyer  and  R.C.  DeNovo,  Knoxville,  TN</b><p>
Thirty kittens between 4 and 6 weeks of age were included in a controlled study
to evaluate the safety of pyrantel pamoate.   Ten kittens received 100 mg/kg
pyrantel pamoate paste for 3 consecutive days and 10 kittens received the same
dosage of pyrantel pamoate granules for 3 days.  Ten kittens were untreated and
served as controls.   Kittens were weighed and complete physical examinations
were performed 7 days before and 4 and 10 days after the initial treatment.  No
abnormal physical or clinical observations were noticed following 3 treatments
with 5 times the recommended dose of pyrantel pamoate.<p>
<b>c.   Overall  Safety  Summary</b><p>
Cats treated with 10 times the highest recommended Drontal Tablet dosage during
safety studies showed signs of vomition and salivation without other adverse
effects.  Eighty-three of 85 cats treated with the recommended dosages of
Drontal Tablets in a clinical field study did not exhibit any drug related side
effects.  A temporary loss of appetite was reported for one cat and transient
loose stools were observed in a second cat.<p>

<b>7.   Agency   Conclusions</b><p>
<b>GUIDELINE FOR DRUG COMBINATIONS FOR USE IN ANIMALS</b><p>
Both of the drugs in this combination are approved individually, praziquantel
for dogs and cats, and pyrantel pamoate for dogs.  Safety and efficacy
information is available on both components of this combination.   There are no
known safety or efficacy issues pending with regard to either pyrantel pamoate
or praziquantel. Miles, Inc. owns the safety data for praziquantel and the
combination praziquantel and pyrantel pamoate.  It does not own the safety
information for pyrantel alone.  It does own efficacy data for both component
drugs.<p>
The Guideline for Drug Combinations is generally applied to new
drug formulations.   The Guideline states that a 2-way combination   must be
better than either drug used alone.  In this application, the firm did not
utilize a praziquantel alone treatment group, however 100&#37; efficacy was
achieved    against tapeworms and 
reference was made to the firm's approved NADA 111-798 for this drug.<p>
Praziquantel is not effective alone against roundworms or hookworms  [reference
to NADA 133-953 (sponsored by Miles, Inc.) for dogs in which 2.4&#37; efficacy was
achieved against <i>Ancylostoma  caninum </i>&#160;(hookworm) and 0&#37; efficacy against
<i>Toxocara  canis </i>(roundworm)] .  Pyrantel pamoate is not effective alone
against cestodes as documented in the following references:  1)  Howes, H.L. and
Lynch, J.E. Anthelmintic Studies with Pyrantel.   I. Therapeutic   and
Prophylactic Efficacy  Against the Enteral Stages of Helminths in Mice and Dogs,

Press, Ames Iowa, 1982, p. 828.<p>
The dosage of pyrantel was determined from the approved products containing
pyrantel pamoate and the sponsor confirmed this dosage against roundworms and
hookworms at a minimum of 90&#37; efficacy.<p>
The sponsor provided evidence that each ingredient designated as active in the
combination made a contribution to the effect in the manner claimed or
suggested in the labeling.  There is no evidence to suggest the possible
interference of praziquantel with the effects of pyrantel pamoate, or the
interference of pyrantel pamoate with the effects of praziquantel.<p>
The benefits of this drug combination are that multiple parasite species are
treated with an easily administered tablet, which is safe and effective enough
to be marketed OTC.<p>
In conclusion, the 2-way combination of praziquantel and pyrantel pamoate is
better than either drug used alone for the parasites in which efficacy has been
demonstrated.   Therefore, the 2-way combination meets our requirements for
approval.<p>
<b>FINAL CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA complies with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and Section 514.111 of
the implementing regulations.   The data demonstrate that Drontal
(praziquantel &#43; pyrantel pamoate) Tablets are safe and efficacious when used as
directed.<p>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for non-food producing animals qualifies for THREE years of
marketing exclusivity beginning on the date of approval because the application
contains reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than
bioequivalence studies) essential to the approval of the application and
conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>
Parasitological surveys indicate cats and kittens are commonly infected with
tapeworms plus intestinal nematodes.   Tapeworms shed many proglottids in the
feces which the general public can adequately diagnose.   Praziquantel has been
marketed for more than 10 years for the treatment of tapeworm infections in
dogs and cats and currently has approval for marketing over-the-counter (OTC).
There are no known contraindications to the use of praziquantel in cats.
Pyrantel pamoate has been shown to be safe and efficacious for the removal of
hookworm and large roundworm infections in cats at a dosage of 20 mg/kg.
Drontal has an acceptable safety margin for cats since vomiting and salivation
were the only significant side effects noted in animals treated with 10 times
the labeled dosage rate.<p>
The labeling contains adequate directions for use which were written for the
layman.   It is reasonably certain that the conditions of use prescribed,
recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling will be followed in
practice. The effective use of Drontal tablets assumes that an accurate
diagnosis can be made with a reasonable degree of certainty, including the
diagnosis of tapeworm infections, how cats acquire hookworm and large roundworm
infections, the proper administration of Drontal Tablets, and methods to
prevent reinfection with parasites.   The label contains directions for the lay
person to consult their veterinarian before administration to a sick or
pregnant animal and for assistance in the precise diagnosis, treatment, and
control of parasites.   The drug is therefore approved for OTC distribution.<p>

The tablet formulations and dosage tables were designed to provide the
current approved dosage (5-10 mg/kg) of praziquantel (Droncit &#174;; MOBAY
NADA No. 111-798) for 100% elimination of tapeworms; 5 - 10 mg/kg (2.27 -
4.54 mg/lb) pyrantel base for dogs under 5 lbs for removal of hookworms and
ascarids; and at least 25 mg/kg (11.35 mg/lb) febantel for removal of
whipworms.<P>

<B>IV.	Effectiveness:</B><p>

In the following discussion, laboratory and/or clinical field studies were
conducted to demonstrate efficacy against each parasite species claimed in
the labeling, except <I>Echinococcus granulosus</I>. It was not necessary
for the sponsor to conduct any additional studies for this parasite, since
definitive diagnosis is very difficult and natural infections are rare.
Please refer to the Freedom of Information summary for NADA 111-798, in
which the sponsor previously demonstrated effectiveness against
<I>Echinococcus granulosus</I> in dogs experimentally infected in a
laboratory study.<p>

A.	Pivotal Well-Controlled Laboratory Efficacy Studies.<p>

Four adequate and well-controlled laboratory efficacy studies utilizing 176
dogs infected with various parasite species were pivotal in demonstrating
the efficacy of Drontal Plus Tablets for removal of the parasites indicated
on the label. Parasite infections were diagnosed by fecal examinations
prior to including dogs in each study.<p>

The following tablet formulations were included in the four controlled
efficacy laboratory studies.<p>

<pre>

Formulation and Dosage                          Study Numbers

Pyrantel Tablets: 5 mg/kg (2.27 mg/lb)          1, 2, 3

Praziquantel + Pyrantel Tablets:                1, 2, 3, 4 5 
mg/kg (2.27 mg/lb) of each active

Drontal Plus Tablets: 5 mg/kg (2.27 mg/lb)      1, 2, 3, 4 each
of praziquantel and pyrantel base + 
25 mg/kg (11.35 mg/lb) febantel 
(The formulation to be marketed)

Febantel Tablets: 25 mg/kg (11.35 mg/lb)        4

Placebo Tablets                                 1, 2, 3, 4
</pre>

Data regarding the efficacy of the tablets for removal of whipworms (<I>Trichuris</I> <I>vulpis</I>)
from Laboratory Study Nos. 1 and 4 were combined for statistical analysis
as a separate report.<p>

These studies were conducted in accordance with the FDA Canine/Feline
Anthelmintic Guidelines. Each dog was treated with the designated tablet
formulation. Control dogs in each study were treated with placebo (blank)
tablets. The studies were blinded in that the investigators were not aware
of the content of the tablet formulations until the studies were concluded.
Seven days after treatment the dogs were euthanatized and the gastrointestinal
tract was removed and examined for all remaining parasites. Percent efficacy 
was calculated for each parasite species from the number of parasites recovered 
at necropsy using the following formula:<p>
<pre>

MN in the Controls Animals - MN in the Treated Animals
______________________________________________________      X 100 = % Efficacy

              MN in the Control Animals
                    
MN = Mean Number of Parasites                    
</pre>

Worm recovery data were analyzed statistically using nonparametric
methodology.<p>

The studies demonstrated the following: (1) neither pyrantel nor febantel
interfere with the activity of praziquantel against tapeworms, (2) neither
praziquantel nor febantel interfere with the activity of pyrantel against
hookworms or ascarids, (3) the combination of pyrantel with febantel
provides effective removal of whipworms.<p>

(1) Laboratory Study No. 1: Dr. D. Bowman, Stanwood, Michigan<p>

A total of 48 mixed-breed dogs (25 males and 23 females) with naturally
acquired infections of <I>Ancylostoma</I> <I>caninum</I> and
<I>Toxocara</I> <I>canis</I> were included in the study. Twenty-five of the
dogs were also infected with <I>Trichuris</I> <I>vulpis</I>. The 48 dogs
were randomized into 4 groups (of 12 dogs each). Each group was treated
with pyrantel tablets, praziquantel + pyrantel tablets, Drontal Plus
Tablets or placebo tablets (control). No side effects were observed after
treatment. Treatments, recovery of parasites at necropsy, and efficacy
information are given in Table 1.<p>

<B>Conclusions</B>:
There were no significant differences between the 3
tablet formulations for removal of <I>A</I>. <I>caninum</I> or <I>T</I>.
<I>canis</I> (P > 0.0688). The results of the study demonstrated the
efficacy of pyrantel tablets alone for the removal of hookworms (<I>A</I>.
<I>caninum</I>) and ascarids (<I>T</I>. <I>canis</I>). Praziquantel did not
interfere with the activity of pyrantel for removal of either parasite.
Pyrantel tablets alone and praziquantel + pyrantel tablets were not
efficacious for the removal of whipworms (<I>T</I>. <I>vulpis</I>). Drontal
Plus (praziquantel + pyrantel + febantel) Tablets were efficacious for the
removal of <I>A</I>. <I>caninum</I>, <I>T</I>. <I>canis</I> and <I>T</I>.
<I>vulpis</I>.<p>

</pre>
<B>Conclusions</B>:
 The results of the study demonstrated the efficacy of
pyrantel tablets alone for the removal of both hookworm species. The
efficacy of praziquantel + pyrantel tablets for both species was less than
that observed with pyrantel tablets although the difference was not
statistically significant (P greater than or equal to 0.3110). The combined
nematocidal activity of febantel with pyrantel in Drontal Plus Tablets
resulted in a significant increase in the efficacy of removal of both
hookworm species (P less than or equal to 0.0483). Drontal Plus
(praziquantel + pyrantel + febantel) Tablets were efficacious for the
removal of <I>A</I>. <I>caninum</I> and <I>I</I>. <I>stenocephala</I>.

(3) Laboratory Study No. 3: Dr. L. Cruthers, Corapeake, N.C.<p>

A total of 48 beagles (20 males and 28 females) were given 275 embryonated
<I>Toxascaris</I> <I>leonina</I> eggs to establish infections
experimentally. Fifteen weeks later (i.e. when the parasites were mature)
the dogs were randomized into 4 groups (of 12 dogs each). Each group was
treated with pyrantel tablets, praziquantel + pyrantel tablets, Drontal
Plus Tablets or placebo tablets (control). No side effects were observed
after treatment. Treatments, recovery of parasites at necropsy, and
efficacy information are given in Table 3.<p>

praziquantel + pyrantel and Drontal Plus Tablets were efficacious for
removal of <U>T</U>. <U>leonina</U>. Neither the presence of praziquantel
nor febantel interfered with the nematocidal activity of pyrantel.

(4) Laboratory Study No. 4: Dr. D. Bowman, Stanwwod, Michigan

A total of 40 mixed-breed dogs (25 males and 15 females) were included in
the study. All of the dogs were naturally infected with <U>Taenia</U>
<U>pisiformis</U>. Many of the dogs were also infected with
<U>Trichuris</U> <U>vulpis</U>, <U>Toxocara</U> <U>canis</U> and
<U>Ancylostoma</U> <U>caninum</U>. The dogs were randomized into 4 groups
(of 10 dogs each). Each group was treated with febantel tablets,
praziquantel + pyrantel tablets, Frontal Plus Tablets or placebo tablets
(control). No side effects were observed after treatment. Treatments,

</pre>

<B>Conclusions</B>: No significant differences were observed among the treated
groups for removal of <I>T</I>. <I>pisiformis</I> (P greater than or equal to 0.0631).
The results of this study demonstrated that praziquantel + pyrantel and
Drontal Plus Tablets are effective against <I>T</I>. <I>pisiformis</I>. Neither febantel
nor pyrantel interfered with the efficacy of praziquantel for removal of
tapeworms. These two formulations were also effective for removal of <I>T</I>.
<I>canis</I> and <I>A</I>. <I>caninum</I>.<p>

Praziquantel + pyrantel tablets were not effective for removal of <I>T</I>.
<I>vulpis</I>. Febantel tablets alone provided reduction of <I>T</I>. <I>vulpis</I>. The
combined nematocidal activity of pyrantel + febantel in Drontal Plus
Tablets provided 91.31% removal <I>T</I>. <I>vulpis</I>.<p>

(5) Statistical Evaluation of Laboratory Study Nos. 1 and 4.<p>

Data pertaining to the efficacy of praziquantel + pyrantel and Drontal Plus
tablets for removal of <I>T</I>. <I>vulpis</I> infections in dogs from Laboratory Studies
No. 1 and 4 were combined for statistical analysis. The two studies were
conducted by the same investigator at the same location using similar
protocols. Forty dogs were naturally infected with <I>T</I>. <I>vulpis</I> in the two
studies. Twelve dogs were treated with Drontal Plus (praziquantel +
pyrantel pamoate + febantel) Tablets. Thirteen dogs were treated with
praziquantel + pyrantel tablets. Fifteen additional dogs received placebo
tablets (controls). The dogs were euthanatized 7 days after treatment and
examined for remaining <I>T</I>. <I>vulpis</I>. The results are summarized in Table 5.<p>

</pre>
The hypothesis that no differences exist among the treatment groups was
tested using an analysis of variance procedure on the ranked <I>T</I>. <I>vulpis</I>
counts from worms recovered at necropsy. A significantly different and
greater <I>T</I>. <I>vulpis</I> count was observed for the control group compared to the
Drontal Plus Tablet group (P = 0.0010). No significant difference was
detected between the control group and praziquantel + pyrantel tablet
treatment group (P = 0.9288). A significantly different and greater <I>T</I>.
<I>vulpis</I> count was detected for praziquantel + pyrantel treatment group as
compared to the Drontal Plus Tablet treatment group (P = 0.0009).<p>

Conclusion: Drontal Plus Tablets provided 94% removal of <I>T</I>. <I>vulpis</I> while
praziquantel + pyrantel tablets were not efficacious against this parasite.
This demonstrated that febantel is necessary in the combination for
efficacy against <I>T</I>. <I>vulpis</I> (whipworms).<p>

For dogs infected with tapeworms pretreatment, the feces of each dog was examined on Days 5,
6 and 7 after treatment to determine if the tapeworm infections were
eliminated. Fecal samples were collected 7 - 10 days post-treatment to
calculate the nematode egg count reduction.<p>

The investigators treated a total of 103 purebred and mixed-breed dogs (48
males and 55 females) with Drontal Plus Tablets. No side effects following
treatment (excellent rating) were reported for any of the 103 cases. The

<B>Conclusion</B>: Drontal Plus Tablets were efficacious for the removal of whipworm, tapeworm,
hookworm and ascarid infections of dogs.<p>

<B>Summary of the Laboratory and Clinical Trial Results</B>: The results of the
pivotal clinical trial supported data collected during the four pivotal
laboratory efficacy studies. Both praziquantel + pyrantel tablets and
Drontal Plus (praziquantel + pyrantel + febantel) Tablets were efficacious
against tapeworm infections. Neither pyrantel nor febantel interfered with
the cestocidal activity of praziquantel against tapeworms. Praziquantel +
pyrantel tablets and Drontal Plus Tablets were both efficacious against
hookworms and ascarids. Praziquantel did not interfere with the nematocidal
activity of pyrantel nor febantel. Praziquantel + pyrantel tablets were not
efficacious for the removal of whipworms. The combined nematocidal activity
of pyrantel and febantel, however, resulted in efficacious removal of
whipworms. The recommended treatment of Drontal Plus Tablets was found to
be safe and effective for the removal of the parasite species indicated on
the label under conditions of practical use.<p>

C. Corroborative Efficacy Studies<p>

1) Drs. B. Bosch and J. Schroder, Kyalami, South Africa<p>

Twenty dogs were experimentally infected with approximately 700 infective
<I>Ancylostoma</I> <I>caninum</I> larvae. Seven days following the experimental
infections 10 dogs were treated with praziquantel/pyrantel/febantel tablets
to provide 5 mg/kg praziquantel + 5 mg/kg pyrantel base + 15 mg/kg
febantel. Ten dogs were untreated controls. All of the dogs were
euthanatized 21 days after treatment and examined for all remaining worms.
The praziquantel/pyrantel/febantel treatment was 92.23% efficacious for
removal of 7-day old <I>A</I>. <I>caninum</I> infections.<p>

2) Praziquantel/Pyrantel Tablet Clinical Trial<p>

A clinical trial was conducted with a common protocol by investigators at
five geographic locations to provide additional information regarding
performance of praziquantel + pyrantel tablets. The investigators are
listed below:<p>

The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of praziquantel + pyrantel tablets for treatment of dogs
naturally infected with tapeworms plus intestinal nematodes under 
practical conditions. Pretreatment fecal samples from each dog 
were examined microscopically for diagnosis of tapeworm and 
nematode infections. Each animalserved as its own control. Two
sizes of praziquantel + pyrantel tablets with separate dosage 
schedules were provided to the investigators:<p>

The feces of each dog was examined on Days 5, 6 and 7 after treatment to 
determine if the tapeworm infections were eliminated. Fecal samples were
collected 7 - 10 days post-treatment to calculate the nematode egg count
reduction.<p>

The investigators treated a total of 67 purebred and mixed-breed dogs (36
males and 31 females) with praziquantal + pyrantel tablets. Six dogs were not 
treated as specified in the protocol and data from those dogs were
excluded for efficacy evaluation. One puppy weighing 1.2 lbs was given 1/2 of
a 22.7 mg tablet (resulting in dosage levels of 21.0 mg/kg each of 
praziquantel and pyrantel) and died one day after treatment. The investigator
concluded the death of this animal was a sequela to a severe parasite
infection and was not caused by the experimental treatment.<p>

Fifty-seven of the cases (93.4%) were rated excellent (no side effects 
observed) and 4 cases (6.6%) were rated good (single observance of a slight, 
self-limiting effect, i.e. vomition or loss of appetite).  The number of parasite 
infections treated and the post-treatment results are given in Table 8.<p>

<B>Conclusion</B>: Praziquantel + pyrantel tablets were efficacious for the
removal of tapeworms, hookworms and ascarids of dogs. The tablets were not
efficacious for removal of whipworms.<p>

D. Overall Efficacy Summary<p>

A total of 176 dogs and puppies with naturally acquired or experimental
parasite infections were included in 4 well-controlled laboratory studies
to establish the efficacy of Drontal (TM) Plus Tablets. In addition, 103 dogs
and puppies were included in clinical field studies conducted in 9
veterinary clinics at different geographical locations throughout the
United States to further evaluate safety and efficacy. These studies
included dogs of various sizes, ages, and breeds. These studies
demonstrated Drontal (TM) Plus Tablets are safe and efficacious for the
removal of the parasite species indicated on the label when used as
directed.<p>

Results obtained in the laboratory and clinical studies indicate small
numbers of hookworm and roundworm eggs may be passed in the feces for up to
7 days after treatment although the worms themselves were eliminated. A
follow-up fecal examination should be conducted 2-4 weeks after treatment
to determine the need for retreatment.<p>

<B>V. Animal Safety</B><p>

A. Pivotal Studies<p>

Two preclinical safety studies were conducted in dogs by MILES Corporation,
Animal Health Division with the praziquantel/pyrantel pamoate/febantel
tablet formulation in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice
Regulations.<p>

1) Drug Tolerance Test (Drug Tolerance Test for the Use of
Praziquantel/Pyrantel/Febantel Tablets in Dogs)<p>

M. Kohlenberg of Shawnee Mission, Kansas, conducted a drug tolerance
evaluation in 3 dogs using both the 22.7 mg praziquantel/22.7 mg
pyrantel/113.4 mg febantel and the 68.0/68.0/340.2 mg tablets. This
evaluation determined the effects of administering 10 times the anticipated label use rate of the tablet
formulation in a single day. One female and one male dog received the
treatment and the control received an equivalent number of placebo tablets.
The study was blinded with the individual making clinical observations not
being aware of the respective treatments. Furthermore, the laboratories
conducting the clinical chemistry/hematology evaluations and histological
readings were not informed of the treatments. Parameters of the study
included clinical signs, body weights, clinical chemistries, hematology,
gross pathology and histopathology. The study concluded 7 days
post-treatment. Vomition was the only clinical sign observed. Slight weight
gains were achieved during the study. No trends were seen in the
post-treatment serum chemistry or hematology analyses with the exception of
one dog with an elevated SGPT reading at 24 hours post-treatment, but this
parameter had returned to normal at the 7 day sampling. The gross lesions
(mesenteric lymph node redness and small intestinal mucosal redness in the
two treated dogs) seen at necropsy could not be documented
histopathologically and were not due to treatment with Drontal Plus.  No
microscopic changes were found in any of the tissues examined. It was
concluded from this study that a single treatment of dogs with this
praziquantel/pyrantel/febantel formulation at 10 times the label use rate
can induce vomition without other adverse clinical effects.  The results
are summarized in Table 9.<p>

</pre>

2) General Safety Evaluation (General Safety Evaluation for the Use of
Praziquantel/Pyrantel/Febantel Tablets in Dogs)<p>

M. Kohlenberg also conducted a general safety study in 14 dogs using the
68.0/68.0/340.2 mg tablet. Two of the dogs, Group 1, were nontreated
controls. Groups II, III and IV (4 animals/group) received 1, 3 and 5 times
the recommend use rate, respectively, for 3 consecutive days (3 times the
duration of treatment). Parameters evaluated were clinical signs, body
weights, hematology, clinical chemistries, necropsy observations and
histological readings. The study was completely blinded for the clinical
sign observations, clinical laboratory procedures and histological
readings. Body weights were stable during the study. Clinical signs were
dose related and consisted of vomition and non-formed stools. No
post-treatment trends were seen for the group mean values for the
hematology and clinical chemistry parameters when compared to the
pretreatment values or to those of nontreated controls with the exception
of one dog in Group III which had elevated SGPT (549), SGOT (239), GGT (15)
and CPK (285) readings at 6 days post-treatment. None of the findings at
necropsy or upon histological examination were judged to be treatment
related. It was concluded from this study that an adequate safety margin
exists for the treatment of dogs with a combination
praziquantel/pyrantel/febantel tablet based upon these treatments of use
rate, 3 times use rate and 5 times use rate for 3 times the labeled
duration. The data are summarized in Table 10.<p>

</pre>
B. Corroborative Studies<p>

Corroborative safety studies were conducted by Miles Inc, Agriculture
Division, Animal Health Products in accordance with Good Laboratory
Practice Regulations. Well controlled Corroborative Safety studies were
also conducted by subsidiaries of Bayer AG, parent company of Miles Inc.
Reference is also made to 3 NADA's containing one or more of the 3
components. Additionally, clinical field trial safety studies were
conducted at veterinary clinics in various geographical areas of the United
States.<p>

1) Drug Tolerance Test (Drug Tolerance Test for the Use of
Praziquantel/Pyrantel Tablets in Dogs)<p>

M. Kohlenberg of Shawnee Mission, Kansas, conducted a drug tolerance
evaluation in 3 dogs using a single massive overdose with this 68 mg/68
mg/praziquantel/pyrantel tablet formulation. A female and a male received a
single treatment at 10 times the highest potential mg/kg treatment rate for
the praziquantel/pyrantel tablets. The control animal received an
equivalent number of placebo tablets. Parameters evaluated included
clinical signs, body weights, clinical chemistries, hematology, gross
pathology and histopathology. Post-treatment vomition was the only clinical
sign observed for the treated dogs. Weights remained stable during the
study. No post-treatment trends were observed for hematology and clinical
chemistry parameters when compared to the pre-treatment values with the
exception of one dog which had an elevated SGPT at 24 hours post-treatment.
All tissues examined from all three dogs were within normal limits. It was
concluded from this study that a single treatment of dogs with this
praziquantel/pyrantel 68 mg/68 mg tablet at 10 times the highest possible
mg/kg use rate induces vomition without other effects. The results are
displayed in Table 11.<p>

</pre>

2) General Safety Evaluation (General Safety Evaluation for the Use of
Praziquantel/Pyrantel Tablets in Dogs)<p>

M. Kohlenberg also evaluated the general safety of the 68 mg pyrantel/68 mg
praziquantel tablets in 16 dogs. Parameters evaluated included clinical
signs, body weights, clinical chemistries, hematology, gross pathology and
histopathology. Four of the dogs, Group 1, were nontreated controls. Groups
II, III and IV (4 animals/group) received, 1, 3 and 5 times the recommended
dosage rate, respectively, for 3 consecutive days (3 X duration of
treatment). No clinically significant signs were observed. Body weights
were stable during the study. No trends were seen in the serum chemistry or
hematology values at post-treatment intervals. The gross lesions (redness
of the lung) seen at necropsy were not due to treatment with
pyrantel/praziquantel. The histopathological lesions (interstitial
pneumonia, vascular congestion) were not due to treatment with
praziquantel/pyrantel. It was concluded from this study that treatment of
dogs with this praziquantel/pyrantel formulation at 5 times the label use
rate for 3 times the recommended duration of treatments without adverse
effects. The results are displayed in Table 12.<p>

</pre>

3) Dosage Tolerance Study, Drs. B. Bosch and J. Schroder, Kyualami, South
Africa<p>

Twenty-seven puppies between 9 and 13 weeks of age were divided into 3
groups. Ten puppies were treated orally with praziquantel/pyrantel tablets
to provide 15 mg/kg praziquantel + 15 mg/kg pyrantel base, 10 puppies
received praziquantel/pyrantel/febantel tablets to provide 15 mg/kg
praziquantel/43.2 mg/kg pyrantel base + 45 mg/kg febantel. Seven puppies
remained as untreated controls. All puppies were observed daily for 7 days
after treatment.<p>

One puppy treated with praziquantel/pyrantel tablets had loose feces for 48
hours after treatment. One puppy treated with
praziquantel/pyrantel/febantel tablets had loose feces on the day of
treatment and for 48 hours after treatment.<p>

The praziquantel/pyrantel and praziquantel/pyrantel febantel tablets were
concluded to be safe for puppies at approximately 3 times the recommended
dosage rate.<p>

4) Dosage Tolerance Study, Drs. T. Hopkins and P. Gyre, Bahrs Hill,
Australia<p>

Two puppies 17 days old were treated with praziquantel/pyrantel/febantel
tablets to provide approximately  17 mg/kg praziquantel + 48 mg/kg pyrantel
base + 83.3 mg/kg febantel. Two additional puppies served as untreated
controls. The puppies were observed for 4 hours after treatment. No adverse
reactions were observed and the treatments were concluded to be safe at
3-5X the recommended dosages.<p>

5) Dosage Tolerance Study, Drs. T. Hopkins, L. Griffin, P. Gyre and P.
Hedemann, Bahrs Hill, Australia<p>

Two litters of puppies with 6 males in each were randomly allocated to 2
groups of 3 within each litter. One group (6 puppies) received
praziquantel/pyrantel/febantel oral dosage rates of approximately 20 mg/kg
praziquantel + 20 mg/kg pyrantel base + 60 mg/kg febantel at 2, 4, 6, 8,
10, 12, 25 or 26 and 40 or 41 weeks of age (a total of 8 treatments). The
other group of 6 puppies served as untreated controls. The puppies were
observed for any clinical abnormalities from 2 to 49 weeks of age. Semen
collections were made when the dogs were 294-334 days old. At 49-50 weeks
of age the dogs were euthanatized and necropsied.<p>

Clinical abnormalities (alkaline phosphatase level higher in the treated
group compared to the control group, lactic dehydrogenase levels also
higher in the treated group at one test interval) were not related to
treatment with the test article and it was concluded that the multiple
dosages of approximately 2-4X the recommended dosages of
praziquantel/pyrantel/febantel tablets had no significant effect on the
health or semen production of the animals.<p>

6) Oral Tolerance and Safety Study, Drs. T. Hopkins and P. Gyre, Bahrs
Hill, Australia.<p>

Six 2 week old puppies were treated orally with
praziquantel/pyrantel/febantel tablets to provide dosage ranges of 20-40
mg/kg praziquantel (4X), 57-115 mg/kg pyrantel base (6-12X) and 208.3-
337.8 mg/kg febantel (8-13X). One week later 4 of the puppies were treated
with dosage ranges of 20.8-33.8 mg/kg praziquantel (5-7X) + 20.8-33.8 mg/kg
pyrantel base (4-7X) + 104.1-168.9 mg/kg febantel (3-5X) and 2 of the
puppies were treated with placebo tablets. The puppies were observed for 4
hours after each treatment and the animals were necropsied 24 hours after
the second treatment. Multiple vomiting was observed in all puppies treated
with praziquantel/pyrantel/febantel tablets from 30 minutes to 4 hours
after treatment. No abnormalities were observed in puppies treated with
placebo tablets. No microscopic lesions were noted at necropsy.<p>

7) Confirmation of Safety in Clinical Field Trials (Praziquantel/Pyrantel
Pamoate)<p>

Confirmation of safety for the use of praziquantel/pyrantel pamoate tablets
in dogs was achieved in clinical field trials. Five veterinary clinics in
various geographical locations treated a total of 61 dogs as per the label
dosage schedule. The 61 dogs treated were in an age range of 2 months to 14
years with a weight range of 1.2 to 110 pounds. Both males and females were
included and breeds were representative. The clinical veterinarians rated
overall safety as excellent for 57 (93.4%) and good for 4 (6.6%) of the
dogs treated. One of the 4 dogs had diarrhea once the day following
treatment, another had a loose stool with tapeworm segments for 2 days
after treatment and a third vomited once 2 days after treatment. The fourth
dog vomited 6 days after treatment, but the investigator noted the dog had
consumed a foreign material before this occurred.<p>

Numerous types of other animal health products were administered to 19 of
the dogs concurrently or within 48 hours of the praziquantel/pyrantel
pamoate treatments. These products include sedatives, anesthetics,
antibiotics, corticosteroids and vaccinations with no incompatibility
observed. in conclusion, the clinical field trial safety evaluations
substantiated an adequate safety margin and confirmed findings of the
preclinical target animal safety studies.<p>

8) Confirmation of Safety in Clinical Field Trials (Praziquantel/Pyrantel
Pamoate/Febantel)<p>

Confirmation of safety for the use of Drontal Plus Anthelmintic Tablets
(praziquantel/pyrantel pamoate/febantel) in dogs was achieved in clinical
field trials. Five veterinary clinics in various geographical locations
treated a total of 103 dogs as per the label dosage schedule. The dogs were
in an age range of 2 months to 16 years with a weight range of 5 to 110
pounds. Both males and females were included and breeds were
representative. The clinical veterinarians rated overall safety as
excellent (no side effects observed) for all of the treatments (100%).
Other animal health products were administered concurrently within 48 hours
to 16 of the dogs with no incompatibility. These products were primarily
antibiotics and vaccinations. In conclusion, the clinical field trial
safety evaluations substantiated an adequate safety margin for the
treatment of dogs with Drontal Plus.<p>

9) Reference to NADA 111-798<p>

Safety for the treatment of dogs with a tablet formulation of praziquantel
was evaluated and presented in NADA 111-798. This NADA concerned Droncit
Canine Cestocide Tablets and contained 9 preclinical safety studies
conducted under GLP regulations. These studies demonstrated the safety of
Droncit Cestocide Tablets in the treatment of tapeworms in dogs.<p>

10) Reference to NADA 133-953<p>

Safety for the treatment of dogs with febantel alone or febantel combined
with praziquantel was evaluated in well controlled preclinical studies and
clinical field trials as previously presented in NADA 133-953. This NADA
concerned Vercom Broad Spectrum Anthelmintic Paste containing 3.4% febantel
and 0.34% praziquantel. NADA 133-953 contained 7 preclinical safety studies
conducted in dogs with febantel as a single component and 7 evaluations
with febantel in combination with praziquantel. All studies were conducted
under GLP regulations. These studies demonstrate the safety of Vercom
Paste &#174; when used to remove nematode and cestode parasites from dogs and
puppies.<p>

11) Reference to NADA 140-912<p>

Safety for the treatment of dogs and puppies with febantel was further
evaluated in well controlled preclinical studies and clinical field trials
as earlier presented in NADA 140-912. This NADA concerned Rintal Tabs
containing either 27.2 or 163.3 mg febantel. NADA 140-912 contained 2
preclinical safety studies conducted in dogs with febantel as per GLP
regulations. These studies demonstrated the safety of Rintal Tabs in the
treatment of nematode in dogs.<p>

<B>VI. Human Safety</B><p>

A. Human Food Safety<p>

Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food,
were not required for approval of this NADA. The formulation is labeled for
use in dogs only.<p>

B. Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration<p>

The label contains an adequate warning statement: "Warning: Keep Out of
Reach of Children"<p>

<B>VII.Agency Conclusions</B><p>

The data in support of this original NADA complies with the requirements of
Section 512 of the Act and Section 514.111 of the implementing regulations.
It demonstrates that Drontal Plus &#174; (praziquantel + febantel + pyrantel
pamoate) tablets when used under the labeled conditions of use are safe and
effective.<p>

Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for non- food producing animals qualifies for THREE years of
marketing exclusivity beginning on the date of approval because the
application contains reports of new clinical or field investigations (other
than bioequivalence studies) essential to the approval of the application
and conducted or sponsored by the applicant.<p>

The drug is restricted to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian
because professional expertise is required to determine the existence of
whipworm and hookworm infections and to differentiate the type of tapeworm
infection. The differentiation of the type of tapeworm infection is
necessary for proper preventative control procedures to be initiated or
reinforced.<p>

All three of the drug components in this combination are approved
individually. Pyrantel pamoate is approved for <I>Toxocara canis, Toxascaris
leonina, Uncinaria stenocephala</I>, and <I>Ancylostoma caninum</I>. Praziquantel is
approved for <I>Taenia pisiformis, Echinococcus. granulosus</I>, and <I>Dipylidium
caninum</I>. Febantel is approved for <I>Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina,
Uncinaria stenocephala, Ancylostoma caninum</I>, and <I>Trichuris vulpis</I>. A
two-way combination consists of praziquantel + febantel (Vercom &#174; paste)
and is approved for <I>Taenia pisiformis, Dipylidium caninum, Toxocara canis,
Toxascaris leonina, Uncinaria stenocephala, Ancylostoma caninum</I>, and
<I>Trichuris vulpis</I>. Safety and efficacy information is available on all three
components of this combination.<p>

The Guideline for Drug Combinations is generally applied to new drug
formulations. The Guideline states that a 3-way combination must be better
than all possible 2-way combinations of the same three drugs. All possible
two-way combinations were not studied, but it was established that the
three-way combination is superior to the two-way combination (praziquantel
+ febantel) and to pyrantel alone. It was also demonstrated that each of
the components did not interfere with the effectiveness of the others.
Hence, although the Guideline was not strictly met, the combination of
praziquantel + pyrantel pamoate + febantel is approvable based on the
following justification:<p>

1. Evidence was provided to show that each ingredient designated as active
in the combination made a contribution to the effect in the manner claimed
or suggested in the labeling. Each component drug contributes to the
efficacy of the product which cannot be achieved with any two-way
combination which was studied.<p>

2. Pyrantel pamoate and febantel provide synergistic nematocidal activity.
Febantel is the only drug in the combination effective against whipworms
(<I>T. vulpis</I>). The combination of pyrantel pamoate and febantel in the 3-way
combination provides enhanced efficacy against whipworms (94% and 91.31%),
whereas febantel alone only provided 42.30% efficacy. The pyrantel pamoate
component alone provides higher efficacy against the nematodes than
febantel, except for whipworms, demonstrating the need for pyrantel pamoate
in the combination.<p>

3. Although febantel demonstrated some efficacy against the tapeworm <I>Taenia
pisiformis</I>, praziquantel is necessary in the combination for 100% efficacy
against <I>E. granulosus</I> (febantel has no efficacy against this parasite) and
for 100% removal of <I>T. pisiformis</I> and <I>D. caninum</I> (refer to NADA 133-953,
Vercom &#174; paste and NADA 111-798, Droncit &#174;). The sponsor provided documentation that febantel demonstrates
weak and erratic efficacy against <I>D. caninum</I> and <I>T. pisiformis</I>.<p>

4. Each drug in the combination provides a different mechanism of
parasiticidal action, as described in the labeling. This is important as
parasites may develop resistance to some anthelmintics over time.<p>

5. The convenience of a single tablet formulation (as opposed to a paste or
liquid formulation) which is effective against a broad range of parasites
is important to veterinary clients, for ease and compliance with
administration of the correct dosage.<p>

There are no known safety or efficacy issues pending with regard to either
pyrantel pamoate, praziquantel, or febantel.<p>

It was not necessary to titrate a dose for pyrantel for this NADA package,
since the sponsor demonstrated efficacy against all four species of
parasites (<I>Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Uncinaria stenocephala</I>, and
<I>Ancylostoma caninum</I>), claimed on the label. Efficacy of greater than 90%
was achieved in the laboratory dose confirmation/efficacy studies, except
for <I>Uncinaria stenocephala</I> (85.3% efficacy). However, the literature
documents inconsistent efficacy with pyrantel pamoate and the 3-way
combination achieved 99.8% efficacy against this parasite.<p>

In conclusion, the 3-way combination of praziquantel, pyrantel pamoate, and
febantel provides an effective, convenient tablet for use against a broad
range of parasites. Each component of the combination is justified.<p>

<B>4.    EFFECTIVENESS</B><p>
Procaine penicillin G in aqueous suspension was the subject of a final rule, 
and was published in the <B>FEDERAL REGISTER</B> of August 25, 1970 (<B>35 FR 13544 -
13545</B>). The final rule amended the animal drug regulations (1) to indicate 
those portions which reflect the National Academy of Science-National Research 
Council, Drug Efficacy Study Group (/NAS/NRC) evaluation of the product and 
(2) to specify the conditions of use for which approval of similar products 
need not include certain types of efficacy data, but may require submission of 
bioequivalence or similar data.<p>

The Anthony Product has been shown to be bioequivalent to the pioneer product, 
Crysticillin &#174  (NADA 65-174) made by E.R. Squibb and Sons, which was approved 
April 6, 1979 as safe and effective. The name and address of the investigator 
is:<p>

Diane Fagerberg<br>
Colorado Animal Research Enterprises, Inc.<br>
6200 East County Road 56<br>
Fort Collins, Colorado 80524<br>

Bioequivalence study<p>

The bioequivalence study was designed as a 20-animal crossover trial in steer 
beef cattle. The 20 test animals were randomized to the two treatment groups 
after stratification for body weight. Single, equivalent doses (300,000 IU/100 
lbs. body weight) of either the test or the reference product were 
administered intramuscularly to individuals in 10-animal groups at each of two 
periods that were separated by a 14-day washout period. No adverse reactions 
were observed during the study.<p>

Blood samples were collected from each animal during each of the two periods 
prior to drug administration and 13 times post-dosing: at 20 min.; 40 min.; 60 
min.; 80 min.; 100 min.; 120 min.; 4 hr; 6 hr; 12 hr; 18 hr; 24 hr; 48 hr; and 
72 hr. Serum was analyzed for penicillin G concentration by a cylinder-plate 
microbiological method using Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 9341 a), with a limit of 
detection <= 0.025 IU/ml.<p>

The method used is based on the method described in the publication: 
"Antibiotic Residues in Milk, Dairy Products, and Animal Tissues: Methods, 
Reports and Protocols," National Center for Antibiotic and Insulin Analysis, 
Food and Drug Administration, Department of Human Health Service, Washington 
20204.<p>

This method was validated using penicillin-free serum samples which were 
spiked with penicillin to determine recoverability of penicillin from test 
animal sera. Spiked concentrations were prepared using standard USP Penicillin 
G, Potassium and the average percentage of penicillin recovery from the spiked 
samples was determined and compared closely with actual test animal sample 
recovery. In addition, as further validation, Precision and Accuracy controls 
were run with each day's samples with good correlation. Bovine serum 
penicillin levels in response to both products during both periods of the 
trial were statistically analyzed.<p>

No statistically significant differences were noted between the two drugs. 
Values for serum levels over time, Ka, Tmax, Cmax, Ke, T1/2, Tp and AUC were 
very similar between the two products. Therefore, it is concluded that 
Crysticillin &#174  and Anthony's product, Microcillin-AG &#174, are bioequivalent and 
will be similarly effective when used in cattle, sheep, swine, and horses.<p>

<B>5.	TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY</B><p>
The pioneer product, Squibb's Crysticillin, NADA 65-174, was approved as safe 
and effective for use as labeled on April 6, 1979 (<B>44 Fed. Reg. 20673</B>). The 
demonstration of bioequivalence to that product established that no additional 
target animal safety studies were required for Microcillin-AG &#174<p>

<B>6.    HUMAN FOOD SAFETY</B><p>
The bioequivalence study in cattle as previously described, demonstrates that 
the Anthony Products penicillin G procaine preparation is bioequivalent to the 
Squibb pioneer product (NAS/NRC approved and codified 4/6/79), as determined 
by CVM's current bioequivalency guidelines. Residue depletion data with other 
equivalent, approved products have demonstrated that pre-slaughter withdrawal 
periods of 4 days for cattle,  7 days for non ruminating cattle (calves) 8 days 
for sheep, 6 days for swine, and a milk discard period of 48 hours (4 
milkings) for lactating cattle are adequate to ensure that penicillin residues 
do not exceed 0.05 ppm in edible tissues of cattle or zero in the edible 
tissues of sheep and swine or in milk of treated animals. The Anthony generic 
penicillin G procaine product will have these same pre slaughter withdrawal 
periods on the label. Therefore in this instance, the data from the 
bioequivalence study in cattle are also sufficient to support approval of this 
product for cattle, sheep, and swine.<p>

<B>7.    AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</B><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of section 
512 of the Act and demonstrate that Anthony's product, Microcillin-AG &#174,  when 
used under its proposed conditions of use is safe and effective in cattle, 
sheep,swine, and horses.<p>

The sponsor submitted bioequivalency data for cattle which demonstrated
biological equivalence to the approved pioneer product. This bioequivalency 
blood	level study was accepted in lieu of tissue depletion. Therefore, for 
human food safety considerations, when bioequivalence is demonstrated through 
blood level studies, the DESI "Me-Too" product is assigned the same withdrawal 
period as the reference product. The withdrawal period for cattle is 4 days, 
for non ruminating cattle (calves) is 7 days, for sheep is 8 days, for swine 
is 6 days, and a milk discard period of 48 hours (4 milkings) for lactating 
cattle. The tolerance for penicillin is established at 0.05 parts per million 
(negligible residue) in the uncooked edible tissue of cattle and zero in the 
uncooked edible tissue of sheep and swine or in milk (<B>21 CFR 556.510</B>).<p>

Penicillin G Procaine in Aqueous Suspension is an injectable over-the-counter 
product. Over-the-counter injectable procaine penicillin products are 
currently on the market for use in food animals. Adequate directions for use 
have been written for the layman, and the conditions for use prescribed on 
labeling are likely to be followed in practice. Therefore, the Center for 
Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has concluded that this productbe granted over-the-
counter marketing status.<p>

This approval does not qualify for an exclusivity period under any of the 
provisions of section 512 (c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term 
Restoration Act of 1988.<p>

<b>Generic Names:</b> Salinomycin and Lincomycin<P> <b>Trade Names:</b> Bio-Cox
and Lincomix&#174;<P> <b>Pharmaceutical Classifications:</b> Anticoccidial and
Growth Promotant<P> Note: This application provides for the combined use of two
currently approved Type A medicated articles in the manufacture of Type C
medicated feeds for broiler chickens.<P>
<b>Date Approved:</b> May 22, 1989<P>
<b>Marketing Status:</b> Bio-Cox and Lincomix&#174; are OTC products<P> 
<b>II. Indications for use:</b>
<P>For the prevention of coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria acervulina, E.
brunetti, E. maxima, E. mivati, E. necatrix</i>&#160; and <i>E. tenella</i>, and for improved
feed efficiency in broiler chickens.<P>

<b>III. Dosage Form:</b><P>
Type C medicated feed manufactured from: Bio-Cox supplied as a Type A medicated article
in 50 pound bags.  Each pound of Bio-Cox contains 30 g of salinomycin sodium
activity. Lincomix&#174; supplied in 50 pound bags as Type A medicated article in
three different concentrations: 4 g of lincomycin activity per pound, 20 g of
lincomycin activity per pound and 50 g of lincomycin activity per pound.<P>
<b>Route of Administration:</b> Oral administration via the feed.<P>
<b>Recommended Dosage:</b><br>
<br>
Salinomycin at concentrations ranging from 40 to 60 g/ton (0.0044 to 0.0066%),
plus lincomycin at concentrations ranging from 2 to 4 g/ton, in Type C medicated
feeds for broiler chickens.<P>

<b>IV. Effectiveness:</b><P>The parent NADA for salinomycin is 128-686 approved
July 5, 1983 (48 FR 56208) at a range of 40 to 60 g/ton for the prevention of
coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria acervulina, E. brunetti, E. maxima, E. mivati,
E. necatrix</i>&#160; and <i>E. tenella</i>&#160; in broiler chickens. Lincomycin is approved in
NADA 34-085, May 9, 1970 (35 FR 7300), and in NADA 97-505 approved February 6,
1979 (44 FR 7132) for use in broiler chickens for increased rate of weight gain
and improved feed efficiency.  Data submitted to NADA 137-537 demonstrate that
the two drugs in combination are effective for prevention of coccidiosis and for
improved feed efficiency.<P><b>A. Noninterference Battery Studies</b><P>Two week
old, Hubbard x Hubbard, broiler chickens were used in adequate, well-controlled,
two-week battery studies with approved protocols and were conducted in a uniform
environment with continuous artificial light to test for noninterference of
lincomycin with the effectiveness of salinomycin.  Recent field strain isolates
collected from various broiler producing regions of the United States were used. 
For each study, combinations of <i>Eimeria mivati, E. brunetti</i>&#160; and <i>E. necatrix</i>&#160; or
<i>E. acervulina, E. maxima</i>&#160; and <i>E. tenella</i>&#160; were used. This arrangement
facilitated identification of which <i>Eimeria</i>&#160; species caused the lesions.<P>These
studies (Tables 1 and 2) were conducted by using the lowest approved level of
salinomycin (40 g/ton).  The experimental treatment groups included uninfected
unmedicated controls, infected unmedicated controls, infected groups receiving 40
g/ton of salinomycin with and without 4 g/ton lincomycin, and 4 g/ton lincomycin.
 The protocols were designed to show "noninterference" of each component with the
others for the salinomycin-lincomycin combination.<P>In each of these studies,
all pens were preselected, birds were randomized by weight and assigned to cages
with ten birds/cage, and four replicates were used per treatment group.  Groups
were medicated two days before infection was administered.  Evaluations were by
lesion scores (analysis was performed on preselected birds from each pen),
dropping scores, weight gains and feed conversions.<P>These studies demonstrate
that there is "noninterference" of lincomycin with the effectiveness of
salinomycin.  The combinations were compatible.<P>

<b>B. Floor Pen Studies</b><P> Six adequate and well controlled floor pen
studies, utilizing approved protocols and 4080 broiler chickens (equal numbers of
male and female), were conducted under conditions of simulated actual use to
determine the growth promoting and feed efficiency effects of lincomycin in the
presence of salinomycin.  The same general experimental design was used in each
study.  All chickens were maintained from one day of age to market weight.  The
studies were conducted in six geographical areas.<P>The chicks were grown on old
litter top dressed with new litter. The diets were balanced to provide adequate
levels of nutrient (protein, energy, minerals, vitamins and fatty acids).  The
level of salinomycin and lincomycin was continued for seven weeks.<P>In these
studies, pens were assigned to treatments utilizing a randomized block design. 
Either 50 or 60 birds (half male, half female) were selected at random and
assigned to pens; four or 12 replicates were used per treatment group. 
Salinomycin at 60 g/ton and lincomycin at 0 and 4 g/ton were used. Studies were
designed to simulate varying conditions, such as geographical location,
differences in climate, changes in weather, differences in management practices,
and degree of disease contamination of the premises.<P>Data collected were for
the evaluation of lincomycin for increase rate of weight gain and improved feed
efficiency in the presence of the highest recommended level of the anticoccidial
drug (salinomycin 0.0066%).  The birds were protected from the disease organisms
carried in the old built up litter. Parameters of evaluation included body
weights, mortality and feed to body weight gain ratio.<P>Lincomycin 4 g/ton in
combination with 60 g/ton salinomycin was safe as evidenced by normal health, no
signs of drug toxicity, as indicated by good weight gains, and excellent feed
conversion.<P>The data from two treatment groups of six trials were evaluated to
determine the effectiveness of this combination drug: treatment one contained
salinomycin (60 g/ton) and treatment two contained salinomycin (60 g/ton) plus
lincomycin (4 g/ton).  The trials were conducted for seven weeks.  The weighted
combined analysis of variance shows that lincomycin significantly (p&lt;0.05)
improved feed efficiency over the treatment containing salinomycin.<P>These data
satisfy the criteria for range approval as outlined in CVM's Guidelines for
Combination Drugs, (revised October, 1983). The data are adequate for the
approval of salinomycin at 40 to 60 g/ton in combination with lincomycin at 2 to
4 g/ton; for the prevention of coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria acervulina, E.
brunetti, E. maxima, E. mivati, E. necatrix</i>&#160; and <i>E. tenella</i>&#160; and for improved
feed efficiency in broiler chickens.<P>The data provide evidence for fulfilling
all the requirements for a combination drug for animals used for human food as
follows:<P> A. Each drug component makes a contribution to the claimed
effect.<br> B. The dosage of each drug is such that the combination is safe.<br>
C. The label claims are not antagonistic or misleading.<P>

<b>V. Animal Safety:</b><P>The parent NADA for salinomycin is 128-686 approved
July 5, 1983 (48 FR 56208) at a range of 40 to 60 g/ton for the prevention of
coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria acervulina, E. brunetti, E. maxima, E. mivati,
E. necatrix</i>&#160; and <i>E. tenella</i>&#160; in broiler chickens. Lincomycin is approved in
NADA 34-085, May 9, 1970 (35 FR 7300), and NADA 97-505 approved February 6, 1979
(44 FR 7132 for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency in
broiler chickens.<P>
The safety of the two drugs in combination is demonstrated
in the six floor pen trials and the noninterference battery trials.  The treated
birds appeared to be in good health and their growth rate and feed conversion was
equal to, or better than, the control birds.  Birds that were sacrificed to
obtain tissue samples for residue determination showed no signs of lesions or
toxicity.<P>Mortality in each study was within an acceptable range for each
facility and there was no evidence that drug was the cause of any of the deaths. 
The combination of salinomycin plus lincomycin is safe to be fed to broiler
chickens as described above.<P>The sponsor completed two residue studies in
support of this application. The first study was completed under Protocol 84-132
at the A.H. Robins Farm in Ashland, VA.  A total of 52 birds served as controls
(no drug fed), and 52 broilers received the combination of 0.0083% salinomycin
plus 0.00044% lincomycin from day zero to 41.  An equal number of males and
female birds were used in each group.  Six birds (three male and three female)
were sacrificed six hours after the feed was removed from the pens. Edible
tissues including liver, kidney, skin/fat, muscle were analyzed for lincomycin. 
Another group of six birds (three male and three female) were sacrificed six
hours after feed was withdrawn and samples of skin/fat were assayed for
salinomycin.<P> The data from this study are summarized in the following
Table:<P> <b>(Eds. note: The following table consists of 5 columns.)</b><P> <pre>

</pre>
In a second study (86-059) conducted at A.H. Robins, a group of ten chicks
received the combination of 0.0083% salinomycin plus 0.00044% lincomycin from
day 12 to 32.  From day 32 to day 36 the chicks received lincomycin at the
above level in the feed and were dosed with salinomycin 14-C equivalent to
0.0083%.  The birds were sacrificed at six hours after the last dose. Salinomycin
assayed at 190 ppb in skin/fat, which is below the permitted upper limit of 200
ppb.<P>These data support a zero day withdrawal time for the salinomycin and
lincomycin combination.<P>A regulatory analytical methodology for salinomycin is
not required.  A practical analytical method for the determination of lincomycin
in tissue is available in the Food Additives Analytical Manual on display at FDA,
5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD, Freedom of Information Room 12A-30.<P> <b>VI.
Agency Conclusions:</b><P>The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the
requirements of Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that the combination
salinomycin (40-60 g/ton) plus lincomycin (2-4 g/ton) is safe and effective for
the claims indicated in Section II of this FOI Summary.<P>This original NADA is
regarded as a Category 2 application under CVM's supplemental policy (42 FR
64367) which did not require reevaluation of safety and efficacy data in the
parent NADAs.  The approval of this application will not significantly increase
exposure to humans of residues of the two drugs. The drugs are to be fed in Type
C medicated feeds, in accordance with the labeling as approved in the parent
NADAs.<P>Toxicological studies reported in NADA 128-686 demonstrate that total
residues of salinomycin are at safe concentrations of 0.6 ppm in muscle; 1.8 ppm
in liver and 1.2 ppm in skin/fat.  An upper limit of parent salinomycin in
skin/fat (target tissue) of 0.2 ppm has been established.  Residues of lincomycin
in edible tissue are below the tolerance established in Title 21 CFR 556.360, of
0.1 ppm.  Adequate information was submitted to demonstrate noninterference
between the assays for each drug.<P>Noninterference studies demonstrate that
salinomycin with and without lincomycin prevented an outbreak of coccidiosis when
the birds were exposed to the six major species of <i>Eimeria.</i>  &#160;The data from
 six well controlled floor pen studies demonstrate the effectiveness of
lincomycin for improved feed efficiency in broiler chickens in the presence of
salinomycin.  CVM's guideline for drug combinations revised October, 1983 for use
in animals provides for the granting of range approvals, (notice of availability
published November 9, 1983 [48 FR 51537]).  Under these guidelines range approval
is granted for salinomycin (40-60 g/ton) for the prevention of coccidiosis caused
by the 6 major species of <i>Eimeria;</i>&#160; and for lincomycin (2-4 g/ton) for
improved feed efficiency in broiler chickens.<P>The marketing status for
salinomycin and lincomycin is OTC, therefore, the drugs in combination are
marketed as a OTC product.<P>

<b>1. General Information:</b><p> 
<b>a.  NADA NUMBER:</b>     140-881<p> 
<b>b.  NAME AND ADDRESS OF SPONSOR: </b><p>        Biomed Laboratories<br>
                    438 W. Arrow Highway, Unit 30<br>
                    San Dimas, CA 91773<p> 
<b>c.  The generic name of the drug:</b>        Nitrofurazone Soluble Dressing<p> 
<b>d.  Trade name of the drug:</b>           Nitrofurazone Soluble Dressing<p> 
<b>e.  Marketing Status of the drug: </b>   OTC<p>
<b>f.  Date of Summary:  </b>May 11, 1990<p> 
<b>2. INDICATIONS FOR USE:</b><p> 
For the prevention or treatment of surface bacterial infections of wounds,
burns and cutaneous ulcers of dogs, cats and horses (not for food use).<p> 
 
<b>3. DOSAGE FORM, ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION, AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE:</b><p> 
Soluble ointment for topical application.<p>  Apply directly on the lesion
with a spatula or first place on a piece of gauze. Use of a bandage is
optional.  The preparation should remain on the lesion for at least 24 hours.
The dressing may be changed several times daily or left on the lesion for a
longer period.<p> 
  
<b >4. ANIMAL EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY:</b><p> 
Nitrofurazone Ointment (Furacin Dressing Veterinary, NADA 6-475) was the
subject of a review by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research
Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group, the results of which were
published in the <i>Federal Register</i>&#160; on January 19, 1979 (44 FR 4014).  NAS/NRC
concluded, and FDA concurred, that the product was "effective" for the
prevention or treatment of surface bacterial infections of wounds, burns, and
cutaneous ulcers.  Due to concern for the safety of residues from food
producing animals, FDA concluded that use of this and other NAS/NRC reviewed
nitrofurazone topical products must be limited to dogs, cats, and horses (not
intended for food use).  The Federal Register publication, dated January 19,
1979 on Nitrofurazone Topical Preparations for use in non-food animals, states
that applications providing for the effective conditions of use identified in
that notice need not include data required by 21 CFR 514.111 to establish
effectiveness of the drug for these uses.<p> 
Under Center for Veterinary Medicine policy, the principles of 21 CFR 320.22,
providing for a waiver of the requirements for submission of evidence of <i>in
vivo</i>&#160; bioavailability and bioequivalence, are applied to NAS/NRC topicals which
have been found to be effective.  Therefore, such data were neither required
nor submitted.<p> 
  
<b >5. HUMAN SAFETY:</b><p> 
Data on human safety, pertaining to consumption of drug residues in food, were
not required for approval of this NADA.  The drug is approved for use only on
dogs, cats and horses (not intended for food use) and is labeled: WARNING: Not
for use in horses intended for food.<p> 
<b >Human safety relative to possession, handling and administration:</b ><p> 
HUMAN WARNINGS:<p> Carcinogenesis: Nitrofurazone has been shown to produce mammary
tumors in rats and ovarian tumors in mice.  Some people may be hypersensitive
to this product.<p>  Either wear gloves when applying or wash hands afterwards.<p>
KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN<P>
  
<b >6. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p> 
The data submitted in support of this NADA comply with the conclusions of
NAS/NRC review as concurred in by FDA and with CVM's policy concerning
bioequivalence of topical drugs and demonstrate that Nitrofurazone Soluble
Dressing (0.2% nitrofurazone ointment), when used under its approved conditions
of use is safe and effective for the prevention or treatment of bacterial
infections of wounds, burns and cutaneous ulcers on dogs, cats and horses (not
for food use).<p> 
The drug is labeled for over the counter use for the following reasons:<p> 
a. It is a generic topical antibacterial preparation with a long OTC marketing
history of safe and effective use for the above indications.<p> 
b. A diagnosis by a veterinarian is not necessary, as the labeled use
conditions are easily recognized by the layman.<p> 
In view of the above, it is approved for over the counter marketing because
adequate directions for use by the layman can be written.<p>

<b>2.	TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS: </b><p>
Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by
the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (53 FR 50460, December
15, 1988; first GADPTRA Policy Letter), an Abbreviated New Animal Drug
Application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an approved new
animal drug (pioneer product). For certain dosage forms, the Agency grants a
waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i> bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 
18, 1990; fifth GADPTRA Policy Letter). In lieu of bioequivalence testing, the
safety and efficacy of the generic product are based on the demonstrated
chemical equivalence to the pioneer product.<p>
Based on the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Inhalon
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was granted a waiver on April 4, 1994 (photocopy
attached) from conducting an <i>in vivo</i> bioequivalence study with Isoflurane, USP.
The generic and pioneer products are liquid anesthetics with the same inactive
ingredients and the same concentrations of the active ingredient.<p>
<b>3.	HUMAN SAFETY:</b><p>
Human Safety Relative to Food Consumption:<p>
Regarding consumption of drug residues in food, human safety data were not
required for approval of this ANADA. This drug is for use in dogs, which are
non-food animals, and for horses that are not to be used for food, and is
labeled: "Warning: Not for use in horses intended for food."<p>
Human Safety Relative to Possession, Handling and Administration:<p>
A cautionary statement which pertains to the safety of this drug product for
humans is included in the labeling of the drug product, as follows: "Caution:
Operating rooms should be provided with adequate ventilation to prevent the
accumulation of anesthetic vapors."<p>
<b>4.	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
This is an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) filed under Section
512(b)(2) of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&#38 C) Act.<p>
Safety and effectiveness for this generic animal drug, Isoflurane, USP, were
established by demonstration of chemical equivalence to the pioneer product,
Anaquest, Inc.'s AErrane &#174 (Isoflurane, USP, NADA 135-773).<br>
 <br>
This generic product and the pioneer product have identical labeling
indications for use. The route and method of administration of the two drugs
are identical. Both drugs are administered by inhalation. The generic and
pioneer products are both liquid anesthetics that contain the same active and
inactive ingredients in the same concentrations. Therefore, in compliance with
FDA policy promulgated to implement Section 512(b)(2) of the FFD&#38 C Act, no
additional safety, efficacy, or <I>in vivo</I> bioequivalency studies were necessary
or required.<p>
This ANADA satisfies the requirements of section 512 of the Act and
demonstrates that Isoflurane, USP is safe and effective for its labeled
indications when used under its proposed conditions of use.<p>

The efficacy of the Norden sulfamethazine bolus was established by meeting the
requirements set forth in a notice published in the <i>Federal Register</i>&#160; 
of July 5,
1984 (49 FR 27543). In that notice, the sulfonamide requirements for blood
levels were established at 8 milligrams percent or more.<p>
  
A bioavailability study was conducted.  The data from this study and the blood
level data from a residue depletion study were used to satisfy the requirements
set out ln the July 5, 1984 <i>Federal Register</i>&#160; notice (49 FR27543).  These
studies were conducted by John Murphy, Norden Laboratories, Inc., 601 W.
Cornhusker Hwy., Lincoln, NE.<p>
<b>Bioavailability Study</b><p>
A bioavailability study was conducted in which ten young Holstein calves,
ranging in weight from 130 to 235 pounds, were administered sulfamethazine
boluses.  Each calf received an initial oral "loading" dose of 100 mg per pound
body weight.  This initial dose was followed with a supporting oral dose of 50
mg per pound body weight every 24 hours for the next four consecutive days.
This dosing procedure was in accordance with the proposed product labeling.
Plasma samples were obtained at 0, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120
hours post treatment (i.e., after the initial "loading" dose)  Additional
samples were taken at 124, 128, 132, 144, 150 and 168 hours for the purposes of
collecting depletion data for a future residue study.<p>
Additional blood level data were gathered from a residue depletion study in
which 24 Holstein calves, ranging in weight from 100 to 300 lbs., were
administered sulfamethazine boluses at the same dosage regime as described
above.  Plasma samples were obtained at 0, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96,
and 120 hours post treatment (i.e., after the initial "loading" dose).<p>
The plasma free sulfamethazine levels for 33 out of the 34 calves from both
studies were greater than 8 mg percent by 6 hours post-treatment.  The
therapeutic blood level for sulfamethazine was maintained throughout the five
day treatment period in each study. Please refer to Table 1 for the mean
sulfamethazine plasma levels at critical sampling periods.  There were no
adverse effects observed in either of the studies.<p>

<b>SUMMARY</b><p>
The bioavailability data obtained in these studies demonstrate sulfamethazine
Plasma levels  &gt; or =  8 mg percent.  The results of these studies show that
Norden's sulfamethazine bolus is bioequivalent to the DESI reviewed drug based
on the bioavailability data.  The therapeutic blood levels of sulfamethazine in
this species are well established and documented in published scientific
literature as cited in the July 5, 1984 <i>Federal Register</i>&#160; notice (49 FR
27543). 
<p>
<b>5. Animal Safety</b><p>
No animal safety studies are required for the approval of NADAs for sulfonamide
products within the scope of the DESI program. However, no adverse effects were
observed in either the bioavailability study or the residue depletion study.<p>
<b>6. Human Safety</b><p>
Three month oral toxicity studies of sulfamethazine in rats and Beagle dogs
were submitted on February 15, 1974, in compliance with FDA's regulations (21
CFR 510.450).<p>
Additionally, a tissue residue study was conducted in cattle to determine the
withdrawal period necessary to achieve the established tolerance of 0.1 ppm for
negligible residue of sulfamethazine in uncooked edible tissues of cattle (21
CFR 556.670).<p>
Twenty-four young 105 to 255 pound dairy heifer and bull calves were
administered sulfamethazine boluses with a calf size balling gun.  Four
additional calves (2 male, 2 female) served as non-medicated controls.  The
initial oral "loading" dose of 100 mg sulfamethazine per pound body weight was
followed by supporting doses of 50 mg sulfamethazine per pound body weight
every twenty-four hours for four additional consecutive days.  This procedure
was in accordance with the proposed product labeling.<p>

The twenty-four medicated and 4 non medicated calves were 
appropriately divided into 7 groups of 2 male and 2 female each.<p>
Upon sacrifice at 0, +2, +3, +4, +5, +6 and +8 days after final dosing,
muscle, liver, kidney and fat tissue from both treated and untreated (control)
calves were harvested.  All tissue, except fat, was then analyzed for
sulfamethazine residues using the Tishler/Bratton-Marshall Method A.<p>
The data were reviewed and analyzed according to the Center for Veterinary
Medicine's Guideline for Establishing a Withdrawal Period (1985).  The
withdrawal period was determined from the tolerance limit on a residue
concentration which was below the permitted residue marker (Rm) of 0.1 parts
per million (ppm).  This tolerance limit provided an interval within the 99th
percentile of the population, with a 95% confidence level that the interval
does contain that percentile of the population.<p>

An analysis of the data for a tolerance of 0.1 ppm resulted in a 99%
statistical tolerance limit (95% confidence) of 0.07 ppm at 11 days withdrawal.
Day 2 data were omitted because the data did not fall on the linear portion
of the depletion curve.  Day 8 data were omitted because they were below
the validated portion of the assay.  Thus, based on the analysis of the data
for a tolerance of 0.1 ppm, a withdrawal period of 11 days has been assigned
for the product.<p>
The following table summarizes the mean and standard deviation values for
sulfamethazine levels in kidney, liver, and muscle tissue at the different
sacrifice periods.<p>

<b>7.   Agency Conclusions</b><p>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of 512 of
the Act and demonstrate that Sulka-S(TM) Bolus, when used under its
proposed conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled
indications.<p>
The bioavailability study demonstrates that, when used as directed,
sulfamethazine will achieve a blood level of at least 80 ppm (8 mg percent) and
will maintain this level for 24 hours.  The agency has determined that a blood
level of not less than 8 mg percent is an effective level of sulfamethazine for
the treatment of the indicated disease conditions.  The tissue residue
depletion study was conducted in cattle and supports a withdrawal period of 11
days.  These two studies satisfied the requirements set forth in the <i>Federal 
Register</i>&#160; notice of July 5, 1984 (49 FR 27543).<p>
Sulfamethazine products for use in food producing animals are generally over
the counter (OTC) products.  Accurate diagnosis can be made with a reasonable
degree of certainty by the layman. Adequate directions for use have been
written for the layman and the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling are
likely to be followed in practice.  Therefore, the agency has concluded that
this sulfamethazine product be granted the over-the-counter marketing
status.<p>
Approval of this new animal drug application poses no increased human risk from
exposure to residues of sulfamethazine because there are already a number of
approved sulfamethazine calf boluses on the market and the number of food
producing animals receiving such medication will not significantly increase as
a result of approval of this NADA.  In its approval decision, CVM did not take
into account the preliminary results of chronic bioassays of sulfamethazine in
mice and rats conducted by the National Center for Toxicological Research, see
53 FR 15886 (May 4, 1988) and 53 FR 17850 (May 18, 1988).  The final results of
the bioassays are expected to be available later this year.  CVM will review
those results and determine whether additional action with respect to the NADA
for Sulka S<sup>TM</sup> Bolus and the NADA's and supplemental NADA's for other
sulfamethazine containing new animal drug products is necessary or
appropriate.<p>

<b>2.	INDICATIONS </b><p>

Maxim 200 is intended for use in the treatment of the following diseases in
beef cattle, nonlactating dairy cattle and swine when due to oxytetracycline
susceptible organisms.<p>
<b>CATTLE</b><p>
Maxim 200 is indicated in the treatment of pneumonia and shipping fever complex
associated with <i>Pasteurella</i> spp. and <i>Hemophilus</i> spp.; infectious
bovine keratoconjunctivitis (pinkeye) caused by <i>Moraxella bovis</i>; foot
rot and diphtheria caused by <i>Fusobacterium necrophorum;</i> bacterial
enteritis (scours) caused by <i>Escherichia coli</i>; wooden tongue caused by
<i>Actinobacillus lignieresi</i>; leptospirosis caused by <i>Leptospira
pomona</i>; and wound infections and acute metritis caused by strains of
staphylococci and streptococci organisms sensitive to oxytetracycline.
<p>
<b>SWINE</b><p>
In swine, Maxim 200 is indicated in the treatment of bacterial enteritis
(scours, colibacillosis) caused by <i>Escherichia coli</i>; pneumonia caused by
<i>Pasteurella multocida</i>; and leptospirosis caused by <i>Leptospira
pomona</i>.  <p>
In sows, Maxim 200 is indicated as an aid in the control of infectious
enteritis (baby pig scours, colibacillosis) in suckling pigs caused by
<i>Escherichia coli.</i> <p>		
<b>3.	DOSAGE	</b><p>
<b>CATTLE</b>
<p>
Maxim 200 is to be administered by intramuscular or intravenous injection to
beef cattle and nonlactating dairy cattle.

A single dose of 9 mg of Maxim 200 per pound of body weight administered
intramuscularly is recommended in the treatment of the following conditions:
1) bacterial pneumonia caused by <i>Pasteurella</i> spp. (shipping fever) in
calves and yearlings, where retreatment is impractical due to husbandry
conditions, such as cattle on range, or where their repeated restraint is
inadvisable;  2) infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (pinkeye) caused by
<i>Moraxella bovis</i>.

Maxim 200 can also be administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection at
a level of 3 to 5 mg of oxytetracycline per pound of body weight per day.  In
the treatment of severe foot rot and advanced cases of other indicated
diseases, a dosage level of 5 mg per pound of body weight per day is
recommended.  Treatment should be continued 24 to 48 hours following remission
of disease signs; however, not to exceed a total of four consecutive days.
Consult your veterinarian if improvement is not noted within 24 to 48 hours of
the beginning of treatment.
<p>
<b>SWINE</b>
<br>
A single dose of 9 mg of Maxim 200 per pound of body weight administered
intramuscularly is recommended in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia caused
by <i>Pasteurella multocida</i> in swine, where retreatment is impractical due
to husbandry conditions or where repeated restraint is inadvisable.

Maxim 200 can be administered by intramuscular injection at a level of 3 to 5
mg of oxytetracycline per pound of body weight per day.  Treatment should be
continued 24 to 48 hours following remission of diseases signs; however, not to
exceed a total of four consecutive days.  Consult your veterinarian if
improvement is not noted within 24 to 48 hours of the beginning of
treatment.

For sows, administer once intramuscularly 3 mg of oxytetracycline per pound of
body weight approximately 8 hours before farrowing or immediately after
completion of farrowing.

For swine weighing 25 lb of body weight and under, Maxim 200 should be
administered undiluted for treatment at 9 mg/lb but should be administered
diluted for treatment at 3 or 5 mg/lb.

<b>	4.	TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY and DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><p>
Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as
amended by the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR
50460, December 15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new
animal drug application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an
approved new animal drug (pioneer product).  New target animal safety data,
drug effectiveness data, and human food safety data (other than tissue residue
data) are not required for approval of an ANADA.  An ANADA relies on the target
animal safety, drug effectiveness, and human food safety data in the pioneer's
new animal drug application.  Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the
generic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer.  If bioequivalence is
demonstrated through a clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to
establish the withdrawal time for the generic product is also required.  For
certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in
vivo</i> bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990).<p>
Based upon the formulation characteristics of the generic product, Phoenix
Scientific, Inc. was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>
bioequivalence study for oxytetracycline injection.  The generic and pioneer
products contain the same active and inactive ingredients and are parenteral
solutions. <p>
	<b>5.	HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
<b>Tolerance</b><p>
The tolerances established for the pioneer product apply to the generic
product.   A tolerance of 0.1 ppm is established for the uncooked edible
tissues of cattle, beef calves, nonlactating dairy cattle, dairy calves, and
swine under 21 CFR 556.500. <p>
<B>Withdrawal Time</B><p>
When a waiver from the requirement of an <i>in vivo</i> bioequivalence study is
granted, the withdrawal times are those previously assigned to the pioneer
product.  The withdrawal time for oxytetracycline injection is established
under 21 CFR 522.1660: 28 days for beef cattle, nonlactating dairy cattle, and
swine. <p>
<b>Regulatory Method for Residues</b><p>
The analytical method for detection of residues of the drug is the cylinder
plate microbiological test using <i>Bacillus cereus</i> var. <i>mycoides</i>
(ATCC 11778) as outlined in the "Antibiotic Residues in Milk, Dairy Products
and Animal Tissues:  Methods, Reports, and Protocols" October 1968, National
Center for Antibiotic and Insulin Analysis, FDA, Washington, D.C.
20204.<p>
<b>	6.	AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>
	<br>
This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that oxytetracycline injection when used under the proposed
conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled indications.<p>

EFFECTIVENESS
</A></H3>
Data in support of this application were obtained from dose titration and
clinical field studies.  All were well controlled and conducted in compliance
with the protocols covering these studies.<P>
The low end dose of enrofloxacin for controlling mortality due to <I>Escherichia
coli</I> in chickens was established in a severe artificial infection dose
titration study conducted under simulated use conditions.  The efficacy of the
25 ppm dose given for three days duration was confirmed in clinical field
studies conducted at three different geographic locations in chickens naturally
infected with <I>E. coli</I>.   <P>
For turkeys, the low end dose of 25 ppm was established against fowl cholera in
a severe infection model dose titration study with birds artificially infected
with <I>Pasteurella multocida</I>.  The efficacy of the 25 ppm dose was confirmed in
clinical field studies where a three day treatment regimen was evaluated at
three different geographic locations.<P>
To establish the efficacy of enrofloxacin for the control of mortality
associated with <I>Escherichia coli</I> in turkeys, a dose of 25 ppm given
continuously for three days was evaluated in clinical field studies at three
different geographic locations.  This treatment regimen was selected based on
the efficacy established against <I>Pasteurella multocida</I> (fowl cholera) and the
similar susceptibility of this pathogen to <I>E. coli</I>.<P>

1.  Dose Range-Finding Study - Chickens <P>
a.  Type of Study:  A dose titration study was conducted using enrofloxacin in
broiler chickens artificially infected with <I>Escherichia coli</I>. <P>
b.  Investigator(s):    Jeffrey N. Davidson, D.V.M., M.P.V.M.<BR>Health Management
Services<BR>P.O. Box 2046<BR>Tulare, California  93275<P>
c.  General Design:<P>
1)  Purpose:  The study was conducted to determine the efficacy of four graded
doses of enrofloxacin and to select a low end dose for controlling mortality in
chickens artificially infected with <I>Escherichia coli</I>.<P>
2)  Animals:  Commercial Peterson x Arbor Acre chickens, 21 days of age, 360
males, 360 females (4 pens per treatment, 15 males and 15 females per pen) were
used. <P>
3)  Control:  Non-medicated water was available <i>ad libitum</i> from waterers for the
duration of the study. <P>
4)  Challenge:  The <I>E. coli</I> challenge was by intramuscular injection with an
inoculum of the pathogenic organism. <P>
5)  Diagnosis:  Colibacillosis was diagnosed by necropsy.  A positive case was a
dead bird, dying any time following the initiation of treatment, having a
positive culture for <I>E. coli</I> and a lesion score &#62;= 2 using the following scale:
1 = no lesions, 2 = minimal air sac lesions, 3 = moderate air sac and
pericardial lesions, 4 = extensive air sac and pericardial lesions.<P>
6)  Dosage Form:  The dosage form used was a concentrated aqueous solution with
each mL containing 32.3 mg enrofloxacin.  This formulation is the same as the
marketed product.  <P>
7)  Route of Administration:  Orally, in the drinking water <i>ad libitum</i><P>
8)  Dose:  The doses tested in the study were 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 ppm,
administered continuously in the drinking water for five consecutive days.
Birds (except those in control groups) were started on the medicated water one
hour after injection of the pathogenic organism.<P>
9)  Test Duration:  The study continued for 10 days following challenge.<P>
10) Pertinent Variables Measured:  The primary parameter for determining
efficacy was based upon a comparison of mortality due to <I>E. coli</I> between the
unmedicated control group and each of the medicated groups.<P>
d.  Results:  Results are shown in Table 4.1 below.

e. Statistical Analysis:<P>
    An analysis of variance showed that the five infected groups had significantly
different mortality rates.  <P>
    A model fitting procedure using Anderson and Nelson's Linear-Plateau
models was done on the mortality rates to help determine the recommended dose
level. Although several models showed large R^2s and had good model fits, the
Linear-Plateau model VI (1,3) was the best model.  R^2  was equal to 0.992; the
model p-value was highly significant, p = 3.25E-5; and the beta coefficients
were highly significant (7.93E-8, 8.47E-4 and 3.33E-3).  The residuals p-value
was not significant, p = 0.804.  The model is two linearly decreasing lines
with significantly different slopes followed by a plateau (line parallel to the
x-axis).  The plateau occurs for dose levels of 25 and 50 ppm.  Thus, the model
indicates that the doses of 25 and 50 ppm give the best results but that there
is not a significant difference between a dose of 25 ppm and a dose of 50
ppm.<P>
f.  Conclusions:  Enrofloxacin was effective in controlling mortality associated
with an artificially-induced <I>E. coli</I> infection.  Based on the data from this
study, 25 ppm was chosen as the lower end of the dose range.<P>
g.  Adverse Reactions:  No adverse reactions were observed.<P>

2)  Animals:  Broad Breasted White turkeys, 12 weeks of age, 120 males, 120
females (4 pens per treatment, with 6 males and 6 females per pen) were
used.<P>
3)  Control:  Non-medicated water was available <i>ad libitum</i> from waterers for the
duration of the study.<P>
4)  Challenge:  The <I>P. multocida</I> challenge was initiated by swabbing the
palatine-cleft with an inoculum of the pathogenic organism.<P>
5)  Diagnosis:  Fowl cholera was diagnosed at necropsy by a positive culture for
<I>P. multocida</I>. <P>
6)  Dosage Form:  The dosage form used was a concentrated aqueous solution with
each mL containing 32.3 mg enrofloxacin.  This formulation is the same as the

8)  Dose:  The doses tested in the study were 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 ppm,
administered continuously in the drinking water for five consecutive days.
Birds (except unmedicated controls) were started on the medicated water one
hour post-challenge.<P>
9)  Test Duration:  The study continued for 8 days following challenge.<P>
10) Pertinent Variables Measured:  The primary parameter for determining
efficacy was based upon a comparison of mortality due to <I>P. multocida</I> between
the unmedicated control group and each of the medicated groups.<P>

e.
Statistical Analysis:  Statistical comparisons, with respect to mortality
rates, were made with Fisher's exact test and supported by a
Kruskal-Wallis test.  A preliminary analysis indicated that the mortality rates
of replicates within each group did not differ significantly and therefore all
data were combined for group comparisons.  All four active treatment groups had
significantly lower (p&lt;0.01) mortality rates than the control group.  The
mortality rate of the 12.5-ppm group (8.3%) was marginally significantly greater than the other three active treatment groups (p=0.06).<P>
f.  Conclusions:  Since mortality was reduced to zero at all dose levels except
12.5 ppm, it was concluded the 25 ppm should represent the low end of the dose
range. <P>
g.  Adverse Reactions:  No adverse reactions were observed. <P>

c.  General Design:<P>
1)  Purpose:  The study was conducted to confirm the efficacy of enrofloxacin
drinking water medication at a concentration of 25 ppm for 3 consecutive days
for controlling mortality in turkeys naturally infected with <I>E. coli</I>.<P>
2)  Animals:  Nicholas Turkeys, one-day-old, 800 males, 800 females (10 pens
with 40 males and 10 pens with 40 females per treatment) were used.<P>
3)  Control:  Non-medicated water was available <i>ad libitum</i> from waterers for the
duration of the study.<P>
4)  Challenge:  The <I>E. coli</I>  challenge was by natural infection.  This was
accomplished by natural stress on the birds at 16 days of age.<P>
5)  Diagnosis:  Colibacillosis was diagnosed by necropsy.  A positive case was a
dead bird, dying any time following the initiation of treatment, having a
positive culture for <I>E. coli</I> and a lesion score of &#62; = 2 using the following
scale:  0 = no lesions, 1 = minimal air sacculitis (slight cloudiness),
2 = moderate air sacculitis (non-coalesced fibrinous material) and/or mild
pericarditis and/or perihepatitis, 3 = severe air sacculitis (coalesced
fibrinous material) and/or moderate to severe pericarditis and/or
perihepatitis.<P>
6)  Dosage Form:  The dosage form used was a concentrated aqueous solution with
each mL containing 32.3 mg enrofloxacin.  This formulation is the same as the
marketed product.  <P>
7)  Route of Administration:  Orally, in the drinking water <i>ad libitum</i><P>
8)  Dose:  The dose tested in the study was 25 ppm, administered continuously in
the drinking water for three consecutive days.  Medication was initiated at 18
days of age (when house mortality exceeded a level of 0.5% in a 24-hour
period).<P>
9)  Test Duration:  The study continued for 10 days following the last day of
medication.<P>
10) Pertinent Variables Measured:  The primary parameter for determining
efficacy was based upon a comparison of mortality due to <I>E. coli</I> between the
unmedicated control group and the medicated group. <P>

Statistical Analysis:  Overall mortality was analyzed by sex using general
linear models methodology.  Mortality was transformed using an arc sine
transformation prior to analysis.  Models included the effects of blocks and
treatments.  A 0.05 level of significance was used to determine significant
results.  Treatment effect was significant for both males and females (p =
0.0001 for both).<P>
f.  Conclusions:  It was concluded that under the natural field conditions of
the study, enrofloxacin was effective in controlling mortality associated with
<i>P. multocida</i> susceptible to enrofloxacin when administered at the rate of
25 ppm in drinking water for three consecutive days to turkeys.<P>

Statistical Analysis:  Overall mortality was analyzed by sex using mixed model
methodology.  Mortality was transformed using an arc sine transformation prior
to analysis.  The random effects included locations, blocks nested within
locations and locations by treatment interactions.  Fixed effects included
treatments.  A 0.05 level of significance was used to determine significant
results.  A significant treatment effect was detected for both males and
females (p = 0.0071 and p = 0.0134, respectively) demonstrating that treatment
efficacy was consistent across study locations.<P>

these studies, enrofloxacin was effective in controlling mortality associated
with <i>P. multocida</i> susceptible to enrofloxacin when administered at the rate of
25 ppm in drinking water for three consecutive days to turkeys. <P>
B.  Studies Supporting Labeling <P>
1.  <i>In vitro</i> Susceptibility Study - Chickens and Turkeys<P>
a.  Type of Study:  This was a study to determine the <i>In vitro</i> susceptibility of
selected poultry pathogens to enrofloxacin.<P>
b.  Testing Laboratory: Colorado Animal Research Enterprises, Inc.
(CARE)<BR>6200 East County Road 56<BR>Fort Collins, Colorado  80524<P>
c.  General Design:<P>
1)  Purpose:  The purpose of this study was to determine the minimum inhibitory
concentrations (MICs) of selected pathogens to enrofloxacin.  Isolates
representative of pathogens known to cause disease in poultry were tested.
This study was intended to provide baseline <i>In vitro</i> susceptibility data for
the target pathogens (<I>E. coli</I> and <I>P. multocida</I>) and also to provide data for
labeling purposes.<P>
2)  Samples:  Isolates obtained from natural infections in chickens and turkeys
were sent to Colorado Animal Research Enterprises, Inc. from nine laboratories
representing five different geographical areas.  The identity of each isolate
was confirmed via observation of colony morphology and gram stain and each was
biochemically confirmed using the Biolog Microstation 3( identification system
of bacteria identification.<P>
3)  Procedure:  Each bacterial isolate with a confirmed identity was subjected
to broth dilution susceptibility testing using the microdilution technique.
All tests were performed according to National Committee for Clinical
Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) document M31-P, Vol. 14, No. 20, December, 1994.
Documented modifications of the technique were performed to accommodate the
unique veterinary pathogens.<P>
4)  Test Duration:  Isolates tested were collected from clinical cases occurring
from 1994 through 1996.<P>
5)  Pertinent Parameters Measured:  The MIC50 (minimum inhibitory concentration
for 50% of the isolates) and the MIC90 (minimum inhibitory concentration for
90% of the isolates) were determined and the ranges of MIC values were also
reported.<P>
d.  Results:  MIC50, MIC90 and MIC ranges are reported for each isolate by
animal source (chicken or turkey) in Table 4.15.

e.
Conclusions:  The information from this study, when combined with the results
of chicken and turkey pharmacokinetic studies, suggest that most isolates
tested would be susceptible to enrofloxacin when administered within the
proposed dose range.  These data, therefore, support the results of the
clinical field trials and the proposed dose range.<P>

1.  Target Animal Safety Study - Chickens<P>
a.  Type of Study:  This was a 28-day study in broilers in which enrofloxacin
was administered in the drinking water at 0, 25, 125, and 625 ppm for 21
consecutive days followed by a 7-day observation period.<P>
b.  Study Director: Jeffrey N. Davidson, D.V.M., M.P.V.M.<BR>Health Management
Services<BR>P. O. Box 2046<BR>Tulare, CA  93275<P>
c.  General Design:<P>
1)  Purpose:  This study was designed to determine the toxicological effects of
enrofloxacin when administered in the drinking water to chickens.  Potential
target organs and tissues were to be identified through clinical observations,
gross necropsy and histological examination.  Total blood cell counts, packed
cell volume, clotting time, estimate of buffy coat, body weight, feed and water
consumption were other variables of interest.<P>
2)  Animals:  One-day-old Hubbard broiler chicks (n = 160) were used in the
study.  For each of 4 treatments, there were 2 pens of 10 chicks for each sex
(80 males, 80 females).  The average initial weight was 33.0 grams.<P>
3)  Control:  Non-medicated water was available <i>ad libitum</i>.<P>
4)  Dosage Form:  An aqueous formulation containing 32.3 mg enrofloxacin per
milliliter was used.  The dosage form is the marketed formulation of Baytril
(enrofloxacin) 3.23% Concentrate Antimicrobial Solution.<P>
5)  Dose:  The doses were 0, 25, 125 and 625 ppm enrofloxacin. <P>
6)  Route of Administration:  Orally, in the drinking water <i>ad libitum</i><P>
7)  Study Duration:  The study included 21 consecutive days of treatment
followed by 7 days  of observation.<P>
8)  Pertinent Measurements/Observations:  Daily clinical observations,
mortality, hematological measurements (Days 22 and 28), body weight (pen basis
on days 7, 14, 21, and 28), feed consumption (pen basis on days 7, 14, 21, and
28), water consumption (pen basis daily during medication, then at weekly
intervals), gross necropsy and histopathology (Day 28) were evaluated to assess
the potential toxicity in broilers. <P>
d.  Results:<P>
1)  Clinical Observations:  The only clinical sign observed was a transient
droopiness of the eyelid in the 625-ppm group.<P>
2)  Mortality:  No deaths occurred during the study. <P>
3)  Body Weight:  On Days 21 and 28, the 625-ppm group weighed less than the
other three groups. <P>
4)  Feed Conversion:  Feed conversion was determined by taking total feed
consumption at each time period and dividing by total body weight.  There were
no differences between groups in feed conversion. <P>
5)  Water Consumption:  Water consumption measured on Days 21 and 28 revealed
reduced water consumption in the 625-ppm group when compared to the other
groups.  At Day 28, the consumption was also reduced in the 125-ppm group.<P>
6)  Hematology:  There were no statistically significant differences between
groups for total cell counts, clotting times or packed cell volumes on Days 22
and 28.  All birds had adequate buffy coats as measured on the
microhematocrit.<P>
7)  Gross and Histological Observations:  No drug related gross lesions were
observed at necropsy in any of the groups.  There were some minimal
histological changes described as atrophy of the testicles in the medicated
birds; this finding was not dose related.<P>
e.  Statistical Analysis:  A randomized complete block design was used with four
treatments in four replicate blocks.  An analysis of variance was used to
measure treatment differences. <P>
f.  Conclusions:  Results from this study, in conjunction with the lack of
adverse effects in the clinical field trials indicate that Baytril(
(enrofloxacin) 3.23% Concentrate Antimicrobial Solution is safe when used in
chickens in accordance with label directions.<P>

2)  Animals:  One-day-old Broad Breasted White turkey poults (n = 160) were used
in the study.  For each of the 4 treatments, there were 2 pens of 10 poults
each for each sex (80 males, 80 females).  The average initial weight was 56.6
g.<P>
3)  Control:  Non-medicated water was available <i>ad libitum</i>. <P>

7)  Study Duration:  The study included 21 consecutive days of treatment
followed by 7 days of observation.<P>
8)  Pertinent Measurements/Observations:  Daily clinical observations,
mortality, hematological measurements (Days 22 and 28), body weight (pen basis
on days 7, 14, 21 and 28), feed consumption (pen basis on Days 7, 14, 21, and
28), water consumption (pen basis daily during medication, then at weekly
intervals), gross necropsy and histopathology (Day 28) were evaluated to assess
the potential toxicity in turkeys. <P>
d.  Results:<P>
1)  Clinical Observations:  There were no adverse clinical signs noted in the
0-, 25-, and 125-ppm groups.  In the 625-ppm dose group, starting on about the
fifth day, birds demonstrated a marked decrease in activity and listlessness.
They appeared dehydrated and spent more time under the brooding heaters.
Mortality started occurring around the seventh day.  By the eleventh day the
activity of the birds appeared normal.  The adverse signs could not be
attributed to any one system, i.e., locomotor, respiratory, etc.  <P>
2)  Mortality:  There was no mortality in the 0-, 25-, and 125-ppm groups.
Eleven of the 40 birds in the 625-ppm group died between Days 7 to 10.
Post-mortem findings revealed dehydration and emaciation with no feed or
ingesta in the digestive tract.  There were no other abnormal findings. <P>
3)  Body Weight:  At Day 14, the 125-ppm group was heavier than the control
birds.  The birds treated with 625 ppm weighed less than the controls at Day 7
and Day 21.  The weights were not different between groups at the end of the
study.<P>
4)  Feed Consumption:  There was no difference in feed consumption except on Day
14 when the 625-ppm group showed a decrease in cumulative feed consumption
compared to the controls. <P>
5)  Water Consumption:  During the first week, the 625-ppm group consumed less
water than the controls.  After the first week, there was no difference in
water consumption among the groups. <P>
6)  Hematology:  There were no statistically significant differences between
groups for total cell counts, clotting times, packed cell volumes or white
blood cell counts.  All values were within normal ranges for birds of this age.
<P>
7)  Gross and Histological Observations:  No drug related gross lesions or
abnormal histopathological changes were observed in any of the groups. <P>
e.  Statistical Analysis:  A randomized complete block design was used with four
treatments in four replicate blocks.  An analysis of variance was used to
measure treatment differences. <P>
f.  Conclusions:  There were no mortalities or adverse clinical signs noted in
birds receiving either the 25 or 125 ppm dose.  Birds in the 625-ppm dose group
appeared to be listless beginning on about the fifth day and some mortality
occurred between the seventh and tenth days in this group.  Activity was normal
for the duration of the study.  Necropsy results from the birds that died
indicated water and feed were not being consumed.  There were no other abnormal
findings.  Results from this study, in conjunction with the lack of adverse
effects in the clinical field trials indicate that Baytril&#174; (enrofloxacin)
3.23% Concentrate Antimicrobial Solution is safe when used in turkeys in
accordance with labeling.<P>
3.  Target Animal Safety Study - Turkeys<P>
a.  Type of Study:  This was a 35-day study in growing male turkeys, in which

c.  General Design:<P>
1)  Purpose:  This study was designed to determine the toxicological effects of
enrofloxacin when administered in the drinking water to male turkeys.  Clinical
observations and gross necropsy were to be performed along with histological
examination of the testes and proximal end of the tibia.  Body weight, feed and
water consumption were other variables of interest.  <P>
2)  Animals:  Male, 21 days of age, Broad Breasted White turkey poults (n = 60)
were used in the study.  For each of the 3 groups, there were 2 pens of 10
poults per pen.  The average initial weight was 438 grams.<P>
3)  Control:  Non-medicated water was available <i>ad libitum</i>. <P>
4)  Dosage Form:  An aqueous formulation containing 32.3 mg enrofloxacin per
milliliter was used.  The dosage form is the marketed formulation of Baytril(
(enrofloxacin) 3.23% Concentrate Antimicrobial Solution. <P>
5)  Dose:  The doses were 0, 25 and 125 ppm enrofloxacin.<P>
6)  Route of Administration:  Orally, in the drinking water <i>ad libitum</i><P>
7)  Study Duration:  The study included 21 days of treatment beginning at
21 days of age followed by a 14-day observation period. <P>
8)  Pertinent Measurements/Observations:  Daily clinical observations,
mortality, body weight and feed consumption (pen basis at 28, 35, 42, and 56
days of age), water consumption (pen basis daily during medication, then at
weekly intervals), gross necropsy and histopathology (five birds from each
replicate at 43 days of age and five birds from each replicate at 56 days of
age) were evaluated to assess the potential toxicity in turkeys. <P>
d.  Results:<P>
1)  Clinical Observations:  No adverse clinical signs were noted in any
group.<P>
2)  Mortality:  No mortality occurred in any of the groups.<P>
3)  Body Weight:  There was no negative effect on body weights at any of the
intervals measured.  The treated groups weighed more than the controls (28, 35,
42, and 56 days of age).<P>
4)  Feed Consumption:  Enrofloxacin did not depress feed intake.  The treated
groups consumed more feed than the controls at all intervals measured (28, 35,
42, and 56 days of age).<P>
5)  Water Consumption:  Enrofloxacin did not depress water consumption.
Consumption was similar for all groups. <P>
6)  Gross and Histological Observations:  No drug related gross lesions were
observed at necropsy in any of the groups.  No treatment related histopathology
changes were observed in the tissues examined.<P>
e.  Statistical Analysis:  A randomized complete block design was used with
three treatments in two replicate blocks.  Statistical analyses of the data
were not performed since the primary purpose of the study was to evaluate gross
lesions and histological changes of the testes and proximal end of the tibia.
Weight gain and feed consumption were not analyzed because both treated groups
ate more feed and gained more weight than the controls. <P>
f.  Conclusions:  The results of this study confirm the results of an earlier
study in younger birds which demonstrated Baytril&#174; (enrofloxacin) 3.23%
Concentrate Antimicrobial Solution is safe for use in turkeys at the labeled
dose and duration.<P>
4.  Reproductive Safety Study - Chickens <P>
a.  Type of Study:  This was a 235-day study in which enrofloxacin was
administered to chickens via the drinking water at the rate of 150 ppm.  One
group received treatment for 7 consecutive days beginning at 1, 50, 100, 150,
and 200 days of age.  Another group received the same treatment for seven
consecutive days beginning at 100, 150, and 200 days of age, while a third
group served as a non-medicated control.  On Day 157, females and males in each
group were co-mingled for the remainder of the study.  Egg production was
monitored and chicks hatched from eggs were also monitored. <P>

c.  General Design:<P>
1)  Purpose:  This study was designed to determine the effects of enrofloxacin
on reproduction when administered in the drinking water to chickens.  Egg
production and egg weights were recorded along with hatchability and chick
viability.  Reproductive organs from treated birds were examined histologically
and the gonads of chicks from hatched eggs were also examined histologically.
Body weights of the treated birds were also monitored.<P>
2)  Animals:  One-day old Arbor Acres chicks (n = 900) were used in the study.
Each of three groups consisted of 10 pens containing 20 females and 10 pens
containing 10 males.  On Day 157, preselected females and males were co-mingled
for the remainder of the study.  The average initial weight for females was
44.0 g and for males was 43.0 g. <P>
3)  Control:  Non-medicated water was available <i>ad libitum</i>.<P>

5)  Dose:  The dose used was 150 ppm for seven consecutive days repeated three
times in one group and five times in the other treated group. <P>
6)  Route of Administration:  Orally, in the drinking water<P>
7)  Study Duration:  The study spanned 235 days beginning at one day of age.<P>
8)  Pertinent Measurements/Observations:  Body weights (pen basis on Days 1,
100, 157, and 206), egg production, egg weight, hatchability and chick
viability along with histopathology of male and female reproductive organs of
treated birds and testicles and ovaries of seven day old chicks hatched from
eggs of treated birds were evaluated to assess effect on reproduction.  <P>
d.  Results:<P>
1)  Body Weights:  Body weights were similar among the three groups throughout
the study.  The data were not statistically analyzed because under the
commercial poultry practices utilized in the study the amount of feed offered
to pens was limited to control the weight of the chickens.  This is necessary
to optimize reproductive function.<P>
2)  Egg Production:  The mean eggs produced increased with time during the
observation period for all three groups.  There was no significant difference
in egg production among the three groups (p &gt; 0.1).<P>
3)  Egg Weight:  Mean egg weights increased with time during the observation
period for all three groups.  There was no significant difference in egg
weights among the three groups (p &gt; 0.1).<P>
4)  Hatchability:  Overall, the median percent of chicks hatched normal was
73.3, 75.3, and 77.5 for the control, 5-treatment and 3-treatment groups,
respectively.  There was no significant difference among the groups with
respect to the percent of chicks hatched normal (p &gt; 0.1).<P>
5)  Viability:  Chick viability was evaluated based on six measurements:  weight
less than 30 g; deformed; navel not healed; dehydrated; abnormal down color;
and abnormal stance.  There was no significant difference among the three
groups with respect to any of the individual measured viability parameters
(p &gt; 0.1).  The median percentage of chicks evaluated as abnormal with
respect to at least one parameter was greater in the control group (median =
7.4%) when compared with both the 5-treatment group (median = 6.9%) and the 3-

treatment
group (median = 4.5%).  There was no significant difference among the three
groups with all viability parameters combined (p &gt; 0.1).<P>
6)  Histological Observations:  No significant histological changes were
observed in the male or female reproductive organs from the treated birds
necropsied on Day 157.  Further, no lesions were observed in the testicles or
ovaries of the seven day old chicks hatched from eggs produced by treated
birds.<P>
e.  Statistical Analysis:  A randomized complete block design was used with each
block containing one pen from each group.  The pen was the experimental unit.
All data were analyzed on a per pen basis so that the sample size/group was
10 pens.  A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to measure
treatment differences.<P>
f.  Conclusions:  Results of this study indicate that at the proposed label dose
and duration, Baytril&#174; (enrofloxacin) 3.23% Concentrate Antimicrobial Solution
is safe for use in broiler breeder chickens of both sexes.

    Body Weights:  A statistically significant reduction in mean body weight for
males and females from the high-dose group.<P>
    Food Consumption:  Feed intake was slightly increased for the high-dose
animals.<P>
    Hematology:  No treatment related trends were observed in these parameters.<P>
    Clinical Chemistries:  Total protein levels were significantly decreased for
both sexes in the high-dose group after Weeks 6 and 13.  Aspartate
aminotransferase was decreased for the high-dose males after 6 and 13 weeks.  A
decrease in total bilirubin occurred in the high dose males.  A dose-dependent
increase in inorganic phosphorous was reported in the males and females after
13 weeks.<P>
    Urinalysis:  A dose-dependent trend toward decreasing urine sodium output for
males in the mid- and high-dose groups at 6 weeks and for females in the mid-
and high-dose groups after 13 weeks.<P>
    Organ Weights:  Heart weights were decreased for mid-dose and high-dose
animals.  Mean prostate weights were significantly lower for mid- and high-dose
males.  Liver weights were decreased at the high-dose levels.<P>
    Gross Pathology:  Swollen external ears and distention of the cecum were
primarily in the high-dose animals.<P>
    Microscopic Pathology:  Auricular chondropathy was observed in all groups
including the controls, but appeared to be dose related (1 control, 1 low-dose,
6 mid-dose and 10 high-dose).  Microscopic changes of questionable relationship
to the test article were observed in the knee joints of 3 of 30 rats in the
high-dose group.  Microscopic change occurred in the epididymides and testes of
male rats from the high-dose group.  This change appeared to represent a
degenerating spermatid.<P>
    Conclusion:  The Agency concluded a NOEL of 500 ppm (40 mg/kg).<P>

h.  Route of Administration:  Oral<P>
i.  Parameters Tested and Discussion of Results:<P>
    Clinical Signs and Survival:  Scattered incidences of emesis and an aversion
to the test diet during the early phase in mid-dose and high-dose animals.  No
adverse effect upon physical condition or deaths occurred in test animals which
were 12 to 13 months of age at initiation of study.<P>
    Physical Examination:  Conducted prior to treatment and at termination
including opthalmoscopy with no adverse effects.<P>
    Body Weights:  Mean body weights which were recorded at weekly intervals
during the course of the study were not affected.<P>
    Food Consumption:  Diet consumption returned to normal after the initial
aversion phase.<P>
    Hematology:  No adverse effects at the 3 evaluations during course of study
including termination.<P>
    Clinical Chemistries:  Evaluated at 3 intervals including termination with a
decreased serum globulin/total protein early, but returning to normal as the
study progressed.<P>
    Urinalysis:  Evaluated at 3 intervals including termination with no adverse
effects.<P>
    Organ Weights:  Organ weights were within the normal historical range for the
laboratory.<P>
    Gross Pathology:  No drug-related observations.<P>
    Microscopic Pathology:  A high incidence of lipofuscin pigment was observed in
the epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidneys for
high-dose animals, but was mild in intensity.  The initial ages of the dogs
used in the study were beyond the sensitive periods for the development of
joint or testicular lesions associated with quinolone compounds in growing
animals.<P>
    Conclusions:  Agency concluded no toxic effect was observed in this study, but
the test animals were older than stated in the guidelines.<P>

g.  Levels and Duration of Dosing:  0, 100, 320, 2500 ppm for 91 days<P>
h.  Route of Administration:  Oral<P>
i.  Parameters Tested and Results:<P>
    Clinical Signs and Survival:  No deaths occurred, but abnormal gait and/or
posture was observed in the high-dose animals by the second week of the study.
Daily observations were conducted.<P>
    Physical Examination:  Radiographic examination revealed that neither bone
growth nor density were significantly affected.  Physical examinations
including direct ophthalmoscopy were conducted pretreatment and at termination
with the only finding described in the clinical signs section.<P>
    Body Weights:  Body weights (recorded at weekly intervals) and body weight
gains were not significantly different for treated and control animals.<P>
    Food Consumption:  Diet consumption, which was recorded daily, was not
affected.<P>
    Hematology:  Samples collected at 2 and 6 weeks as well as at termination
showed no abnormal findings.<P>
    Clinical Chemistries:  Evaluated at 2 and 6 weeks and at termination with no
abnormalities found.<P>
    Urinalysis:  Collected after Weeks 2 and 6, and at termination with crystal
formation in the urine of dogs receiving the high-dose treatment.<P>
    Organ Weights:  Absolute and relative organ weights for treated animals did
not differ significantly from those of controls, but testicular weights were
higher for the treated animals.<P>
    Gross Pathology:  Superficial erosions of articular cartilage surfaces were
seen in all high-dose dogs and one mid-dose male with no joint lesions in the
remaining mid-dose or low-dose animals.<P>
    Microscopic Pathology:  Microscopically, the joint lesions were characterized
by splitting of the articular cartilage surface and disorganization of
chondrocytes.  Necrosis and disintegration of hyaline cartilage was seen in
some cases.<P>
    A marked variation occurred in the appearance of testes including stage of
maturity, diameter of lumen of seminiferous tubules and vacuolar changes in the
lining cells of the tubules.  One dog from the control group and 3 dogs from
the mid-dose group had signs of testicular maturity as evidenced by the
production of tail-containing spermatozoa.  None of the low-dose or high-dose
animals had any evidence of tailed-spermatozoa.  Three dogs from the control
group and 1 each from the mid- and high-dose groups had immature testes that
were characterized by small seminiferous tubules with little or no lumen and
containing a single layer of spermatogonial cells.  Testes from 4 dogs, one
each from the low- and high-dose groups and 2 from the mid-dose group,
contained seminiferous tubules with dilated lumen and often contained more than
a single layer of lining cells.  Similar, but less advanced, tubules were
observed for one dog from the control group.  Vacuolar change in the apical
parts of the spermatogonial cells occurred in 2 dogs of the low-dose group, 3
dogs of the high-dose group, and 1 control.  The tubular morphology observed
for the 2 low-dose and 3 high-dose animals appeared to be beyond the normal
limits.<P>
    Conclusions:  The Agency concluded a NOEL of 100 ppm or equivalent of 3 mg/kg
for this study following conduction of additional subchronic dog studies.<P>

    Clinical Signs and Survival:  No deaths occurred and overt indications of
toxicity were limited to the musculoskeletal system in high-dose dogs.<P>
    Physical Examination:  Observed daily for appearance and behavior with
physical examination including opthalmoscopy prior to termination.
Abnormalities were described in clinical signs section.<P>
    Body Weights:  Recorded weekly with body weight gains not affected except for
high-dose animals during first 5 weeks of study.<P>
    Food Consumption:  Diet consumption was similar for all groups including
controls.<P>
    Organ Weights:  Absolute and relative testicular weights for treated animals
did not differ meaningfully or in a dose-related manner from those of
controls.<P>
    Gross Pathology:  Testes and epididymides were examined for all dogs at
termination.  No gross lesions or abnormalities were noted.<P>
    Microscopic Pathology:  The microscopic appearance of the testes was variable
due to stages of sexual maturity.  All dogs were considered within normal
physiologic limits except for one dog in the high-dose group which had distinct
bilateral degenerative changes.<P>
    Conclusions:  The NOEL was 40 ppm (approximately 1.2 mg/kg/day).<P>

days from the sixth through the fifteenth day of gestation.<P>
h.  Route of Administration:  Oral<P>
i.  Parameters Tested and Results:<P>
    Maternal Survival and Signs of Toxicity:  All dams survived and there were no
remarkable observations attributable to the test article.<P>
    Food Consumption and Body Weights:  Food consumption was significantly higher
in the high-dose group, but overall weight gain was significantly reduced in
that group.<P>
    Reproductive Performance:  There was no statistically significant differences
in any reproductive parameter for any test article group when compared with the
control.<P>
    Fetal Parameters:  Fetal weights for both males and females were significantly
reduced for the high-dose group.  Male and combined fetal weights were
significantly reduced also for the mid-dose group.  No gross morphological
external and visceral changes attributable to the test article were observed in
the fetuses, but they were generally smaller in the high-dose group compared to
the controls.<P>
    Skeletal Examination:  There was no increase in incidence of common skeletal
variations, but a statistically significant delay in ossification was observed
in the mid- and high-dose groups which accompanied the overall reduction in
body weights for these groups.<P>
    Conclusions:  The Agency concluded a NOEL of 50 mg/kg/day for the study.<P>

h.  Route of Administration:  Oral gavage<P>
i.  Parameters Tested and Results:<P>
    Maternal Survival and Signs of Toxicity:  No treated dams expired with one in
the high-dose group aborting on Day 19.<P>
    Food Consumption and Body Weights:  Mean food consumption was similar for the
3 lower-dosed groups, but a statistically significant decrease was noted for
the high-dose females.  This group also had a slightly decreased body weight
gain.<P>
    Reproductive Performance:  No statistically significant differences were
observed for the 3 lower-dosed groups.  Treatment at the higher dose caused
increased post-implantation loss.<P>
    Fetal Parameters:  No differences occurred in mean body weights of fetuses in
the treated groups.  Malformations observed were considered to be incidental
and within the normal spontaneous range.<P>
    Skeletal Examination:  No test article or dose-related differences were
evident and the stage of development in all groups was similar.<P>
    Conclusions:  The Agency concluded a NOEL of 25 mg/kg.<P>
9.  Specialized Male Fertility Study in the Rat<P>

f.  Number of Animals per Sex per Treatment Group:  60 (males only)<P>
g.  Levels and Duration of Dosing:  0 and 7500 ppm for 90 days<P>
h.  Route of Administration:  Oral<P>
i.  Parameters Tested and Results:<P>
    The study design consisted of treating males for 90 days with interim
sacrifices at 3, 6, 9, and 13 weeks.  Fifteen males from each group were
retained, placed on control diet and then mated during the late treatment phase
and at intervals during the recovery phase to non-treated females.  The females
were terminated on day 20 of gestation and evaluated for reproductive
indices.<P>
    Clinical Signs and Survival:  There were no overt effects on appearance and/or
behavior of the males during the study.<P>
    Food Consumption and Body Weights:  Feed consumption and body weight gain were
significantly decreased during the exposure period with both returning to
normal by the end of the recovery period.<P>
    Male Breeding Performance:  Libido was unaffected, but a significant decrease
occurred in fertility.<P>
    Male Testes/Weights and Histopathology:  There was an increase in mean
testicular weight during the treatment period, but by the end of the recovery
period, the weights were significantly less than the controls.  Epididymal
weights for the test article group were lower than the control group throughout
the study.  Abnormal sperm were observed in the treated animals after Week 3,
but a nearly complete reversal of this change occurred during the recovery
period.<P>
    Female Reproductive Performance:  An adverse effect was seen on fertility of
the untreated females at the initial mating (last 2 weeks of treatment phase),
but during each successive breeding, fertility improved and was judged to
return to normal by the 7th week of the recovery phase.<P>
    Conclusions:  The treatment of 7500 ppm caused a marked reduction in male
fertility due to the adverse effect on sperm development.  Functional fertility
returned to normal for 13 of the 15 males during the withdrawal period, but two
continued to have complete bilateral testicular atrophy and subsequent
infertility.<P>
10. 90-Day Feeding Study Followed by a 13-Week Withdrawal in Male Rats<P>

g.  Levels and Duration of Dosing:  0, 125, 500, and 7500 ppm for 91 days<P>
h.  Route of Administration:  Oral<P>
i.  Parameters Tested and Results:<P>
    The study design consisted of treating males for a period of 91 days with a
subgroup receiving 7500 ppm terminated after 14 days on the diet.  Fifteen
animals from each group were terminated after 91 days.  The remaining animals
were maintained on a control diet for another 90 days and then terminated.
Testes and epididymides were evaluated.<P>
    Clinical Signs and Survival:  One low-dose animal died, but no other deaths
occurred.  No signs of toxicosis were observed.<P>
    Body Weights:  There was no effect on weight gain in the low or mid-dose
groups.  The high-dose animals had a statistically significant decrease for
body weight gain during the treatment phase, but gained rapidly during the
reversible phase.<P>
    Physical Examination:  All animals appeared to be in good physical
condition.<P>
    Histopathology:  Abnormal spermatozoa were present in the testes of 10 of the
15 high-dose rats terminated at Day 14.  At the end of the withdrawal period,
no abnormal spermatozoa were detected in the testes, but bilateral testicular
atrophy was seen in 2 high-dose rats.  <P>
    Organ Weights:  At both terminations, a dose-dependent decrease in mean
epididymal weights occurred which were statistically significant in the mid-
and high-dose groups.  There was a significant increase in weight of testes in
the high-dose groups on Day-91 sacrifice.  <P>
    Conclusions:  The NOEL was judged to be 125 ppm or approximately
9.9 mg/kg/day.<P>

g.  Levels and Duration of Dosing:  0, 500, 2000 and 7500 ppm over a duration of
two generations.<P>
h.  Route of Administration:  Oral<P>
i.  Parameters Tested and Results:<P>
    Clinical Observations:  No overt toxicity signs at any dietary concentration.
General behavior and appearance was essentially normal for the F0 and F1
generations.  Swollen pinnae were reported in both the F0 and F1
generations.<P>
    Body Weight and Food Consumption:  Body weights for the high-dose males and
females from the F0 and F1 generations were significantly reduced during most
of the study.  A significant reduction in food intake for the F0 and F1
generation was seen in high-dose males.<P>
    Reproductive Performance of F0 and F1 Males:  Libido was unaffected and
breeding performance was considered favorable for males from both
generations.<P>
    Reproductive Performance of F0 and F1 Females:  No meaningful alteration
occurred in any reproductive parameter for dams exposed to 500 ppm or 2000 ppm
of test article in the diet.  There was a marked reduction in reproductive
performance in the dams receiving the 7500-ppm level.  The parameters affected
included increased gestation length, the pregnancy rates, total pups born,
litter size, number of implantations and birth index which were significantly
reduced for the high-dose group.<P>
    Neonatal Growth and Development:  There was no increase in the number of
stillbirths for any dose group from either generation when compared to the
controls.  The high-dose level reduced neonatal survival and neonatal weight
gain during lactation which were significantly reduced.  Unilaterally, small
testes were reported.<P>
    Microscopic Pathology:   No changes occurred in the female reproductive
tissues.  Spermatic morphological alterations were seen in the high-dose males
from both generations.  Cecal dilatation, unilateral testicular atrophy and
reduced prostatitis were observed in the various treatment groups.
Histopathological evaluations of the pinnae were not conducted.<P>
    Conclusions:  The Agency concluded a NOEL of 2000 ppm (165 mg/kg) for the
study.<P>

h. Route of Administration:  Oral gavage<P>
i. Parameters Tested and Results:<P>
 The effect of Bay Vp 2674 on chromosomal structure was investigated in bone
marrow cells of the rat following acute oral administration.  Two hours before
the surviving animals were killed, bone marrow cell division was arrested at
metaphase by the administration of a spindle poison.  At termination, bone
marrow cells were harvested and metaphase chromosome spreads were prepared on
microscope slides.  The mitotic index was calculated for each animal, giving an
indication of the gross toxicity to dividing bone marrow cells.  Fifty
metaphases were examined from each animal and all observed chromosomal
aberrations were recorded. <P>
j. Conclusions:  This assay was sensitive to the positive control chlorambucil,
but no significant damage to chromosomal structure in rat bone marrow was seen
following administration of enrofloxacin.  <P>

 This <i>in vivo</i> test system evaluates the induction of sister chromatid
exchange (SCE) in the bone marrow of Chinese hamsters.  Cyclophosphamate was
used as a positive control. The evaluation was conducted in two independent
phases due to an indication of a dose-dependent trend in the initial
evaluation.  The values of the second phase did not suggest a dose-dependent
trend, but there was a significant difference (P &#60;= 0.05) between the negative
control and the 4000-mg/kg group.  <P>
 Conclusions:  The Agency chose to reserve comment regarding the
adequacy of the test as performed and the results obtained. <P>

g. Levels and Duration of Dosing:  0, 1000, 3300, and 10,000 ppm for 24
months<P>
h. Route of Administration:  Oral<P>
i. Parameters Tested and Results:<P>
 Ten additional mice of both sexes were assigned to the above stated
treatments, plus 10 of each sex at 20,000 ppm for interim sampling at 12
months.<P>
 Inspection of Animals:  The body surfaces, orifices, eyes, general
behavior, posture, breathing and excretion products of the treated animals did
not show any unusual features compared to the controls when inspected twice
daily.<P>
 Ophthalmological Investigations:  No evidence of treatment induced
damage to the eyes in the groups receiving up to and including 3300 ppm at the
end of the study.  The females in the 10,000-ppm group showed a clearly
elevated incidence of focal lenticular opacity.  No histological correlation
could be assigned to the effect.<P>
 Mortality:  A slightly higher increase in mortality of the males in the
3300-ppm group and females in the 10,000 ppm- group was observed.<P>
 Body Weights:  Body weights were determined once a week with animals in
the 2 lower dosed groups being significantly higher than the controls with the
10,000-ppm group occasionally higher and the 20,000-ppm group comparable to the
controls.<P>
 Food Consumption:  Intake was monitored once a week, with no difference
in groups receiving up to and including 10,000 ppm and the control.<P>
 Hematology:  The total white blood cell counts were decreased in the
3300- and 10,000-ppm groups for the males and in the 3300-ppm group for the
females.  Significantly lower hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV and MCH values were
seen at the 10,000 ppm level.<P>
 Clinical Chemistries:  Samples obtained after 12 and 24 months showed
lower alkaline phosphatase levels at the 3300 and 10,000 ppm levels.  A dose
dependent trend was observed in total protein values with the reduction in
total plasma protein attributed to a decrease in the globulin fraction.<P>
 Gross Pathology:  No specific findings were observed at the 12-month
sacrifice.  After 24 months, an incidence of cecal dilation was observed which
increased with increasing dose.  Males treated at 1000 ppm had an incidence of
4.0%, 42.0% at 3300 ppm and 82.0% at 10,000 ppm.  Females had an incidence of
26.0% at 3300 ppm and 64.0% at 10,000 ppm.<P>
 Organ Weights:  No changes occurred in absolute or relative organ
weights except for increases in kidney weights of females receiving 20,000
ppm.<P>
 Microscopic Pathology:  On histopathological examination, there was
neither an increase in the incidence nor a decrease in the time of appearance
of tumors in the dosed groups compared to the controls.  Intrahepatic bile-duct
changes were detected in the 3300- and 10,000-ppm dose groups.  Focal papillary
mucosal hyperplasia in the gall bladder was observed in the 3300-ppm males and
the 10,000-
                                                                    
ppm
females.<P>
 Conclusions:  The Agency concluded a NOEL of 1000 ppm (323 mg/kg) for
all effects.  There was no evidence of carcinogenic effect in mice dosed with
1000 to 10,000 ppm enrofloxacin for two years.<P>

h. Route of Administration:  Oral<P>
i. Parameters  Tested and Results:<P>
 Additionally, 10 rats of both sexes were assigned to the above stated
treatments, plus 10 of each sex at 10,000 ppm for interim sampling at 12 mo.<P>
 Inspection of Animals:  The body surfaces, orifices, general behavior,
posture, breathing and excretion products of the treated animals did not show
any unusual features compared to the controls when inspected twice daily, with
a detailed inspection once a week.<P>
 Mortality:  Mortality increased for both males and females at the
6000-ppm level.<P>
 Body Weights:   The body weight development of males was highly
retarded at the 10,000-ppm level with a slight retardation at 6000 ppm.  Slight
growth reduction was recorded for females at 10,000 ppm.  Body weights were
recorded weekly until week 13 and then every 2 weeks.<P>
 Food Consumption:  Intake was monitored once a week, with a significant
increase for both males and females at the 10,000-ppm level.  Levels up to and
including 6000 ppm did not differ appreciably from the controls.  <P>
 Hematology:   Investigations were carried out after 6, 12 and 18 months
and at the end of the study.  Leukopenia was seen in the 770- to 10,000-ppm
groups for both the males and females.  Temporarily decreased erythrocyte,
hemoglobin, hematocrit, and MCV values were observed at the higher doses.<P>
 Clinical Chemistries:  Samples were obtained at 6, 12, and 18 months
and at the end of the study.  Total protein was significantly decreased in
males at all doses and at all sampling intervals.  Total protein decreases were
less for females.<P>
 Urinalysis:  Performed at 6 month intervals and overall, the results
indicated the test substance did not lead to toxicologically relevant kidney
damage.<P>
 Ophthalmological Investigations:  No evidence of treatment-induced
changes in the refractile media, the ocular fundus or the pupillary reflex
after one year and at the end of the study.<P>
 Gross Pathology:  A statistically significant increase in the incidence
of hepatic cysts was found in both sexes after 2000- and 6000-ppm treatments
and a biologically significant increase in males at 770 ppm.  Both sexes showed
a significant increase in the incidence of dilated cecum after 6000 ppm.  Size
of testes was reduced and consistency altered in male treatments at 2000 to
10,000 ppm.<P>
 Organ Weights:   Absolute and relative liver weights were decreased in
males at 2000 ppm and above.  The same decreases were seen in the females at
the interim, but not at the study termination.  In the 6000-ppm males, absolute
weights of the brain, testes and adrenals were significantly decreased, but the
relative weights were no different than the controls.<P>
 Microscopic Pathology:   The incidence of bile-duct hyperplasia in the
liver increased in a dose-response in all treatment groups and both sexes.
Sclerotic changes were statistically significant from 770 ppm in the males and
from 2000 ppm in females.  Cystic bile-duct hyperplasia increased with
drug exposure from 770 ppm in the males and 2000 ppm in females.  A marked
increase in the incidence of cardiomyopathy in males at the 6000-ppm dose and
in females dosed at 770 ppm and above.  There was also a significant increase
in the number of subendocardial proliferative lesions in males and females at
the highest dose, as well as an elevated number of subendocardial mesenchymal
tumors.  There was a marked increase in the number of sarcolemmal nuclei in
skeletal muscles of animals in the 6000-ppm treatments.  This lesion is
generally associated with degenerative changes in the muscle fibers.   Marked
degenerative changes were also noted in the sciatic nerve. Fewer females in the
treated groups showed mammary alveolar development and milk secretions than the
control animals.<P>
 Conclusions:  The Agency concluded a NOEL was not established for the
study due to incidence of bile duct hyperplasia and cardiomyopathy.  There was
no evidence of carcinogenic effect in rats dosed with 770 to 6000 ppm
enrofloxacin for two years.<P>

h. Route of Administration:  Oral<P>
i. Parameters Tested and Results:<P>
 Histological evaluation was limited only to the heart and liver.
Additionally, 10 rats of each sex per group were used for an intermediate
necropsy after 12 mo.<P>
 Inspection of Animals:   Twice daily observations with a detailed
inspection once a week did not detect abnormalities in body surfaces, orifices,
general behavior, posture, respiration or excreta.<P>
 Mortality:   No statistically significant differences were observed
compared to the controls.<P>
 Body Weights:   Weights were recorded weekly with treated rats having
comparable gains to the corresponding controls.<P>
 Food Consumption:   Feed intake was determined on individual animals
weekly until Week 13 and then every 4 weeks.  There were no significant
differences compared to the controls.<P>
 Hematology:   Investigations were conducted after 6, 12, 18, and 24
months on 10 rats per group.  There was no evidence of treatment related
damage.<P>
 Clinical Chemistries:   Again, the samples were evaluated at 6, 12, 18,
and 24 months.  No correlation was observed between parameter values and
dose or time in the study period.<P>
 Urinalysis:   Performed in 10 rats per dose and per sex after 27, 52,
79, and 104 weeks were of no toxicological significance.<P>
 Ophthalmological Examinations:   No evidence of any treatment related
changes after one year, or at the end of the study.<P>
  Gross Pathology:   No abnormalities were noted at the interim
sacrifices.  In the males at final necropsy, there was a trend toward an
increased number of swollen livers for the males.<P>
  Organ Weights:   No toxicological significance was attached to
differences.<P>
  Microscopic Pathology:   Sclerotic bile-duct hyperplasia was more common
in males and females treated with enrofloxacin than the control animals.  The
incidence increased in males after 52 and 104 weeks of treatment at 100- and
500-ppm dose levels.  By 104 weeks, there were as many affected males in the
100-ppm dose group and the lesions were of equal severity.  As the incidence at
52 weeks is approximately the same as at 104 weeks, the administration of
enrofloxacin accelerates the development of bile-duct sclerosis in male rats.
In females, there was an increased incidence of bile-duct hyperplasia at 104
weeks in the 500-ppm dose group.  The average severity increased in both the
100- and 500-ppm doses when compared to the control females.  The total number
of females affected was markedly less than the number of males.  No evidence of
carcinogenicity was seen in the hearts or livers in this study.<P>
j. Conclusions:  A NOEL for enrofloxacin had not been demonstrated by this
study based on significant increases in the bile-duct hyperplasia in all of the
exposure groups of male rats.  The Agency set the NOEL at 100 ppm after
considering the spectrum of data from all of the chronic rat studies and
opinions submitted to CVM.  The 100 ppm NOEL corresponded with doses of 5.3 and
7.2 mg enrofloxacin/kg bw for the male and female rats, respectively.<P>

 Dr. Squire conducted a second and independent histological evaluation of the
liver slides for the male rats from both the interim and terminal kills for the
previously described Study No. 74387.  This assessment was arranged and
conducted at the request of Bayer.  Conclusions were:  "There was an increase
over controls in the incidence of bile duct hyperplasia in both dose groups at
the interim kill, although this was probably a spurious finding.  At the
terminal kill, an increased incidence occurred only at the 500-ppm level.  No
clear effect on lesion severity was noted in any group.  The 100-ppm dose was a
no-effect level in this study."<P>

substance in the same doses and were used for an interim necropsy after 12
months.<P>
  Inspection of Animals:   Observations were conducted twice daily with a
detailed inspection once a week.  There were no treatment increases in the
incidence of unusual findings.<P>
  Mortality:   No influence of the test drug on mortality was suggested by
the numbers of rats which died or by their distribution between the individual
treatment groups.<P>
  Body Weights:   Weights were recorded once a week with the treated
animals comparable to the controls.<P>
  Food Consumption:   Feed intake was determined once a week until Week 13
and then every 4 weeks.  Quantities consumed were not substantially different
from the values in the control rats.<P>
  Hematology:   Samples were obtained on 10 rats per group after weeks 27,
79, and 104.  The investigations yielded no evidence of damage to red or white
blood cell parameters in either sex at any time.<P>
  Clinical Chemistries:   Conducted at the intervals as per hematology
investigations with no treatment-related changes.<P>
  Urinalysis:   Performed on 10 rats per dose and per sex at the intervals
stated for hematology investigations with no findings of toxicological
significance.<P>
  Ophthalmological Investigations:   The examination yielded no evidence
of any treatment induced changes after 1 or 2 years of treatment.<P>
  Gross Pathology:   There was no evidence of any treatment damage in the
rats dying spontaneously, after 12 months or at the end of the study.<P>
  Organ Weights:   No significant differences were seen in either absolute
or relative organ weights.<P>
  Microscopic Pathology:   Histological readings were conducted on one
part of the left hepatic lobe and one part of the right hepatic lobe.  The
incidence and severity of bile duct hyperplasia in the treated female and male
rats were comparable with the controls.<P>
j. Conclusion:  The Agency concluded that no apparent treatment-related effects
were noted in Wistar rats administered 10 or 50 ppm enrofloxacin in the
feed.<P>
24. Pathology Working Group on a Two-Year Chronic Feeding Study with One-Year

d. Conclusions:  The endocardial neoplasms and Schwann cell-like hyperplasia
were not considered by the Pathology Working Group to be related to treatment
with the test article for the following reasons:<P>
1) the incidence of endocardial neoplasia in male and female rats was not
statistically significant (P&gt;0.05) [the statistically positive trend in

The Agency concluded that under the given exposure conditions in the two-year
rodent studies, a significant increased frequency or distribution of  tumors
was not noted.  The Subchronic Oral Toxicity Study in Dogs (Study No. 73775)
was concluded to be the most appropriate study (based upon the lowest NOEL) to
determine the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI).  The no-observed-effect-level
(NOEL) for establishing the ADI is 3 mg/kg/day.<P>

The average human weight is approximated at 60 kg.  The daily consumption
values of edible tissues of poultry are approximated as 300 g for muscle, 100 g
for liver, 50 g for fat, and 50 g for skin.

E.
Determination of the Target Tissue and the Marker Residue<P>
 Using the data in the radiolabeled residue studies summarized in Section C,
liver was assigned as the target tissue and parent enrofloxacin was assigned as
the marker residue for both chickens and turkeys treated with enrofloxacin.<P>
1. Target Tissue Determination<P>
 In Bayer Report No. 106543, it was determined that the amount of time
required for the average total 14C-residue level in edible chicken tissues to
deplete to the safe concentration was less than 10 hours for liver and muscle
and 6 hours for skin with adhering fat.  Total residue levels in chicken muscle
and liver depleted to the safe concentrations at approximately the same time.
Muscle was selected as the target tissue for chickens, because muscle is an
easier matrix to analyze enrofloxacin residues than liver.<P>
 In Bayer Report No. 106544, it was determined that the amount of time required
for the average total 14C-residue level in edible turkey tissues to deplete to
the safe concentration was less than 24 hours for muscle and 6 hours for skin
with adhering fat.  Although total residue levels in liver did not deplete to
the safe concentration within 24 hours, muscle was selected as the target
tissue for turkeys based on the data obtained in the marker residue depletion
study (Section G) and the regulatory method developed to determine enrofloxacin
in poultry muscle.  In addition, a marker residue tolerance can be established
in muscle to monitor the safe concentration for liver residues.<P>
2. Marker Residue Determination<P>
 HPLC analysis of the chicken and turkey muscle samples collected at all
intervals after the administration of the final enrofloxacin dose indicated
that unchanged enrofloxacin comprised the major portion of the extractable
residues (Bayer Report Nos. 106753 and 106754).  Thus, parent enrofloxacin was
selected as the marker substance in poultry muscle.<P>
F. Determination of the Tolerance for Enrofloxacin in Poultry Muscle<P>
 Using the determinative procedure for enrofloxacin in poultry muscle (Section
G of this document), the enrofloxacin content in the muscle samples of poultry
treated with 14C-enrofloxacin (Section C, above) was measured.  Based on these
assay results, a tolerance of 0.3 ppm enrofloxacin was assigned for both
chickens and turkeys.<P>
1. Tolerance for Enrofloxacin in Chicken Muscle<P>
 In Bayer Report No. 106753, muscle samples from 6 chickens (3 males, 3
females) for each of 6-, 10-, and 15-hour sacrifice intervals were used in the
quantitation of radiolabeled enrofloxacin.  In order to correlate the total
14C-residue levels in liver and muscle with radiolabeled parent enrofloxacin
(the marker residue) in muscle of dosed chickens, average residue values from
each set of 6 animals at each sacrifice interval were calculated as shown
below:<P>

b Individual data taken from the metabolism study report (Bayer
Report No. 106753).</pre>

<P>
 From plots of the above average values, a tolerance value in muscle of
approximately 0.3 ppm was obtained when the chicken liver TRR (total
radioactive residues) cross the safe concentration of 1.8 ppm.<P>
2. Tolerance for Enrofloxacin in Turkey Muscle<P>
 The total radioactive residue depletion study report (Bayer Report No. 106544)
suggested that the TRR in turkey liver deplete to the safe concentration of 1.8
ppm after the muscle residues cross its safe concentration of 0.6 ppm.
Therefore, the tolerance would be the concentration of parent enrofloxacin
(marker residue) in turkey muscle (target tissue) when the total residue level
in turkey liver (the slowest-depleting tissue) reaches the safe concentration
of 1.8 ppm.  Since the total radioactive residue depletion study did not
continue until the average enrofloxacin-related residues in turkey liver
decreased to below the safe concentration, the following procedures were
employed in the estimation of a tolerance value for parent enrofloxacin in
turkey muscle.
<P>a) Based on the average of the percent of total radioactivity
calculations presented in Bayer Report No. 106546 for enrofloxacin in liver,
59%, 55%, and 46% of total radioactivities measured in turkey livers were due
to enrofloxacin at 6-, 12-, and 24-hour sacrifice intervals, respectively.
During the marker residue depletion study under field conditions (Bayer Report
No. 106542), unlabeled enrofloxacin concentrations of 2.37 ppm, 1.31 ppm, and
0.40 ppm were measured in the liver of one turkey at 6, 12, and 24 hours,
respectively, after removal of the medicated drinking water (Bayer Report No.
106546).  The liver marker residue concentrations were divided by the fraction
of marker residue in total residues to estimate the TRR levels of 4.02 ppm,
2.38 ppm, and 0.87 ppm in turkey liver at 6-, 12-, and 24-hour sacrifice
intervals, respectively.<P>
b) The marker residue concentrations of 0.72 ppm, 0.40 ppm, and 0.11 ppm were
determined at sacrifice intervals of 6, 12, and 24 hours, respectively, in the
muscle of the same turkeys from which liver marker residues were quantitated
(Bayer Report No. 106546).  These muscle marker residue values and the
estimated liver TRR values in a) were then plotted.<P>
 From these plots, a tolerance value of approximately 0.3 ppm enrofloxacin
marker residue in turkey muscle was obtained when the estimated turkey liver
TRR (total radioactive residues) cross the safe concentration of 1.8 ppm.<P>

The residue data were statistically analyzed using Center for Veterinary
Medicine's criteria to determine, with 95% confidence, the length of time
required for      enrofloxacin residues to deplete to the tolerance (0.3 ppm)
in 99% of all medicated chickens and turkeys.  The withdrawal interval was
determined to be 2 days for chickens and turkeys treated with 3.23%
enrofloxacin concentrate in the drinking water at 50 ppm for seven days.<P>
H. Regulatory Method<P>
1. Analytical Method for the Determination and Confirmation of Enrofloxacin in
Poultry Muscle<P>
 The determinative and confirmatory procedures for measuring enrofloxacin
residues in treated chickens and turkeys consists of the extraction of the
parent drug from muscle tissue. The quantitation of the enrofloxacin residue in
the extract is by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and
fluorescence detection, and the confirmation of identity is by tandem liquid
chromatography and mass spectrometry.<P>
 In the determinative procedure, ground muscle tissue is homogenized with
ethanol:water:acetic acid (98:1:1) to extract the enrofloxacin residues.  The
homogenate is centrifuged and the supernatant collected.  The enrofloxacin
residues are isolated using a strong cation exchange solid phase extraction
(SPE) column.  The SPE column is washed with methanol and water, and the
enrofloxacin residues eluted with concentrated aqueous ammonium
hydroxide:methanol (1:3).  The volume of the eluate is adjusted to 10 mL and a
portion is evaporated to dryness and redissolved in the mobile phase.  The
solution is analyzed by HPLC, using a reversed phase C8 analytical column under
isocratic conditions with excitation at 280 nm and measuring the fluorescence
at 440 nm. The limit of quantitation for the determinative procedure is
approximately 0.01 ppm.<P>
 In the confirmatory procedure, a sample is processed as above, through the
point at which the residue is eluted from the SPE column and adjusted to a
final volume of 10 mL.  A portion of the extract is dried and dissolved in the
mobile phase.  The procedure uses HPLC for separation and electrospray mass
spectrometry/mass spectrometry (ESI/MS/MS) with selective ion monitoring (SIM)
to monitor three major product ions characteristic of enrofloxacin.     <P>
2. Method Validation<P>
 A method trial of the determinative and confirmatory procedures was
satisfactorily completed by FDA.<P>
3. Display of the Method<P>
 The validated regulatory analytical method for enrofloxacin (marker residue)
in poultry muscle is on display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305),
Parklawn Building (Room 1-23), 12420 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD  20857.  It
is attached to this FOI Summary.<P>
I. User Safety<P>
 User
safety concerns associated with enrofloxacin have been satisfactorily addressed
by establishing label warnings.  In addition, a toll-free number is available
on the label which users can call to report adverse events or to obtain
Material Safety Data Sheets.
 
<P>
  <h3><A NAME="RTFToC9">VII. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</A></h3> <P>
The data submitted in support of this NADA satisfy the requirements of
Section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and 21 CFR Part 514 of
the implementing regulations.  The data demonstrate that BAYTRIL&#174; (enrofloxacin)
3.23% Concentrate Antimicrobial Solution, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, when
administered <i>ad libitum</i> in the drinking water at a concentration of 25
to 50 ppm to chickens and turkeys for 3 to 7 days, is safe and effective for
the control of mortality associated with <i>E. coli</i> susceptible to
enrofloxacin in chickens and for the control of mortality associated with
<i>E. coli</i> and<i> P. multocida</i> (fowl cholera) susceptible to
enrofloxacin in turkeys.<P>
Based on a battery of toxicology tests, the safe concentrations for total
enrofloxacin-related residues are 0.6 ppm in muscle, 1.8 ppm in liver, and 3.6
ppm in skin with adhering fat.  Based on metabolism studies in chickens and
turkeys and the measurement of unchanged enrofloxacin in turkey liver, a
tolerance (Rm) of 0.3 ppm for the marker residue, parent enrofloxacin, has been
established in chicken and turkey muscle.  The tolerance (Rm) refers to the
residue measured by the regulatory method described herein.<P>
A pre-slaughter withdrawal period of 2 days for both species was calculated
from the results of the marker residue depletion studies in chickens and
turkeys, following the oral administration of Baytril&#174; 3.23% Concentrate
Antimicrobial Solution.  The 2-day withdrawal time was based on a statistical
analysis of the depletion data, using an upper tolerance limit containing 99
percent of the population with a 95 percent confidence limit.<P>
Labeling restricts this drug to use by or on order of a licensed veterinarian.
This decision was based on the following factors:  a) adequate directions
cannot be written to enable lay persons to appropriately diagnose and
subsequently use this product to control mortality associated with <i>E. coli
</i>or<i> P. multocida </i>organisms, (b) restricting this drug to use by or on
order of a licensed veterinarian should help prevent indiscriminate use which
could result in violative tissue residues, and (c) the rate of emergence of
enrofloxacin-resistant organisms may be reduced by the involvement of
veterinarians in product use.<P>
Public health concerns associated with potential increases in antimicrobial
resistance have been satisfactorily addressed by establishing conditions of use
intended to minimize inappropriate use of this product and to minimize
excretion of drug and drug-resistant zoonotic pathogens into the environment.
In addition, the sponsor has agreed to participate in an antimicrobial
resistance surveillance program.<P>
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this
action and has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on
the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not
required.  The agency's finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and the
evidence supporting that finding are contained in an environmental assessment,
which may be seen in the Docket Management Branch (HFA-
                                                                        
305),
Parklawn Building (Room 1-23), 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, Maryland
20857.<P>
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
this approval for food producing animals qualifies for THREE years of marketing
exclusivity beginning on the date of approval because the application contains
reports of new clinical or field investigations and new human food safety
studies essential to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored
by the applicant.<P>
BAYTRIL&#174; 3.23% Concentrate Antimicrobial Solution is under patent numbers

<br>
<b>2. TARGET ANIMAL SAFETY AND DRUG EFFECTIVENESS:</b><br>
<b></b><br>
Under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by
the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, (53 FR 50460, December
15, 1988, First GADPTRA Policy Letter) an abbreviated new animal drug
application (ANADA) may be submitted for a generic version of an approved new
animal drug (pioneer product).   New target animal safety data, drug
effectiveness data, and human food safety data (other than tissue residue data)
are not required for approval of an ANADA.  An ANADA relies on the target
animal safety, drug effectiveness, and human food safety data in the pioneer's
new animal drug application.   Ordinarily, the ANADA sponsor shows that the
genetic product is bioequivalent to the pioneer.  If bioequivalence is
demonstrated through a clinical end-point study, then a tissue residue study to
establish the withdrawal time for the genetic product is also required.  For
certain dosage forms, the agency will grant a waiver from conducting an <i>in
vivo </i>bioequivalence study (55 FR 24645, June 18, 1990; Fifth GADPTRA Policy
Letter; Bioequivalence Guideline, April 1990).<br>
<br>
Based upon the formulation characteristics of the generic product, I.D. Russell
Company was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo  </i>bioequivalence
study for Penicillin G Potassium soluble powder.   The generic and pioneer
products contain the same active ingredient and are water soluble powders
administered as oral solutions.  The generic product contains no inactive
ingredients that may significantly affect the absorption of the active
ingredient.<br>
<br>
<b>3. HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><br>
<b></b><br>
<b>Tolerance</b><br>
<b></b><br>
The tolerance established for the pioneer product applies to the generic
product.  A tolerance of 0.01 ppm is established for the uncooked edible
tissues of turkeys, <B>21 CFR 556.510</B>.<br>
<br>
<b>Withdrawal  Time</b><br>
<b></b><br>
When a waiver from the requirement of an <i>in vivo  </i> bioequivalence study is
granted, the withdrawal time is that previously assigned to the pioneer
product.<br>
<br>
The withdrawal time for penicillin G potassium is established under 21 CFR
520.1696b(b): one day for turkeys; not to be used in turkeys producing eggs for
human  consumption.<br>
<br>
<b>Regulatory  Method:</b><br>
<b></b><br>
The regulatory analytical method for the determination of penicillin in tissues
is a microbiological assay procedure.  The method is published by the Food and
Drug Administration, "Antibiotic Residues in Milk, Dairy Products, and Animal
Tissues:   Methods, Reports, and Protocols", revised October 1968, reprinted
December 1974.<br>
<br>
<b>4. AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><br>
<b></b><br>
This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that penicillin G potassium when used under the proposed
conditions of use, is safe and effective for its labeled indications.<br>

Animal Health, Inc. was granted a waiver from conducting an <i>in vivo</i>&#160;
bioequivalence study for neomycin sulfate soluble powder.  The generic product
is administered as an oral solution and contains the same active ingredient and
drug concentration as the pioneer product.  The generic product is the same
dosage form as the pioneer and contains no inactive ingredients that may
significantly affect the absorption of the active ingredient. <p>
<b> 3.  HUMAN FOOD SAFETY:</b><p>
<b>Tolerance </b><p>
The tolerances established for the pioneer product apply to the generic
product.  A tolerance of 0.25 ppm is established for neomycin residues in the
uncooked edible tissues of cattle, swine, sheep, and goats and a tolerance of
0.15 ppm is established for milk (21 CFR 556.430).<p>
<b>Withdrawal Period</b><p>
When a waiver of <i>in vivo</i>&#160; bioequivalence testing is granted, the
withdrawal times are those previously assigned to the pioneer product.  <p>
The withdrawal times are 30 days for cattle (excluding veal calves) and goats
and 20 days for swine and sheep (21 CFR 520.1484). <p>
<b>Regulatory Method for Residues</b><p>
The regulatory analytical method for detection of residues of the drug is a
microbiological test using <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>&#160; suspension.  The
method is published  by the Food and Drug Administration, "Antibiotic Residues
in Milk, Dairy Products and Animal Tissues: Methods, Reports, and Protocols",
revised October 1968, reprinted December 1974. <p>
<b> 4.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
    
        This ANADA submitted under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act satisfies the requirements of section 512(n) of the act and
demonstrates that neomycin sulfate when used under the proposed conditions of
use, is safe and effective for its labeled indications.<p>

 <b> Route of  Administration: </b> Orally in finished feed. <p>
 
 <b>Limitations:</b><p>   Do not feed to layer chickens.  Not approved for use
with    pellet binders.  May be fatal if accidentally fed to    horses or
adult turkeys.<p>

<b> 4.  Effectiveness </b> <p>
      In the approved NADA (128-686) for salinomycin, it has
been established     that salinomycin is safe and effective for the prevention
of coccidiosis  caused by <i>Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E.
acervulina, E. maxima, E. brunetti</i>&#160; and   <i>E. mivati , </i>48 FR 30616; July 5,
1983.<p>
 Virginiamycin has approved NADAs (91-467, 91-513) for increased rate of
weight gain and improved feed efficiency, 40 FR 13959; March 27, 1975.  
 In the present NADA, it has been established that the addition of
virginiamycin to salinomycin improves weight gain and feed efficiency. The data
also demonstrate that the addition of virginiamycin to salinomycin does not
interfere with the coccidiostatic activity of the latter compound.  Therefore,
the data support the effectiveness of the virginiamycin/salinomycin combination
when used as indicated in 2,3.A and 2,3.B above. <p>
 <b> A.    Non-interference Studies</b><p>
 Two hundred eighty twelve-day old, Hubbard x Hubbard, broiler chickens were
used in two adequate, well-controlled battery studies with approved protocols.
The studies were conducted in a uniform environment with adequate air exchange
to test for non-interference of virginiamycin with the effectiveness of
salinomycin.  For each  study, combinations of <i>Eimeria maxima, E.
acervulina ,</i> and <i>E. tenella, 
 E. mivati, E. brunetti ,</i> and <i>E. necatrix </i>&#160;were used.  
  This arrangement
 facilitated identification of lesions. <p>
 These studies (Tables I and II) were conducted using the lowest approved
level of the coccidiostat; i.e., 40 grams per ton of salinomycin with the
highest level of virginiamycin, viz 20 g/ton. The protocols were designed to
show "non-interference" of each component with the others for the
virginiamycin/salinomycin combination. <p>
 Evaluations were by lesion scores (analysis was performed on preselected
birds from each pen), dropping scores, weight gains, and feed
conversions. <p>

Forty birds were placed on each of seven treatments as indicated below, with
ten chicks in each of four battery pens per treatment. An eighth group,
consisting of two pens of ten infected, unmedicated chicks each was used to
monitor progress of the applied infections in each study.<p>

 <b>B.  Floor-Pen Studies </b><p>
 Six adequate and well-controlled floor-pen studies, utilizing approved
protocols and 9,964 broiler chickens (equal numbers of males and females) of a
variety of commercial strains, were conducted in six geographic locations in
the United States under  conditions simulating actual use to determine the
effectiveness of virginiamycin in the feed for performance enhancement in the
presence of salinomycin.<p>
 The same general experimental design was used in all studies. Salinomycin,
60 g/ton, was used with virginiamycin at 0 or 15 g/ton in each study.  Birds
(half male, half female) were selected at random and assigned to pens; pens
were assigned to one of the two treatments within blocks as follows:<p>

 Studies
were designed to simulate varying conditions such as geographic location,
differences in climate, changes in weather, differences in management
practices, and degree of disease contamination of the premises.  The diets were
balanced to provide adequate levels of nutrients (protein, energy, minerals,
vitamins, and fatty acids).  All chickens were maintained from one day of age
to market weight. <p>
 Data were collected to evaluate virginiamycin for increase in rate of
weight gain and improvement in feed efficiency in the presence of the highest
approved level of salinomycin.  Parameters of evaluation included body weights,
mortality, and feed-to-body-weight ratio. <p>
 Birds medicated with the combinations were healthy throughout the
respective studies.  Mortality was within the normal range for each house, and
there was no evidence of any drug toxicity. <p>
 The tables below give average arithmetic values for and mortality
treatments at each location for final body weight, feed conversion and

</pre>
 Body
weight was significantly improved, P &#60; 0.05, by both analyses. Feed
conversion was also improved significantly by both analyses, 
 P &#60; O.Ol.  There was no effect on mortality. <p>
 These studies demonstrate that there is no interference of salinomycin with
the effectiveness of virginiamycin.  The combinations were compatible. <p>
 The above data satisfy the criteria for evaluation of the application under
the CVM policy outlined in the guidelines for combination drugs.  The
guidelines provide for granting a range approval for the production drug in
combination when the maximum level tested for the claim(s) is demonstrated to
make a significant contribution to the combination.  Data from birds receiving
virginiamycin (15 g/ton) in combination with salinomycin (60 g/ton) show a
significant (P&#60; 0.05 at least) increase in weight gain and improved  feed
 efficiency (P &#60;  0.01) when compared  to salinomycin alone.  The range
approval, in accordance with the guidelines, is from 15 g/ton to the minimum
level approved for virginiamycin in the parent application (5 g/ton).
Therefore, the approval levels for this NADA are 5 to 15 g/ton of virginiamycin
plus salinomycin, 40-60g/ton, in complete broiler rations. <p>

 <b>5.  Animal Safety  </b><p>
   The original approved NADAs for virginiamycin (91-467, 91-513) and
salinomycin (128-686) contain adequate data to establish the safety of each
drug for broiler chickens. <p>
 The safety of the combination was demonstrated in the drug residue
interference studies, in the floor-pen trials, and in the compatibility battery
trials described in this document.  Birds in the drug residue studies were in
good health throughout the studies and did not have any gross pathology at
sacrifice.  The birds in the floor-pen and battery trials were healthy
throughout the experimental periods.  Mortality in each study was within an
acceptable range for each facility, and there was no evidence of drug-related
mortality. <p>
 Based on the data in the parent NADAs, in the compatibility battery trials,
in the floor-pen trials, and in the drug residue interference studies, CVM
concludes that the combination is safe to be fed in complete broiler rations as
indicated in the labeling. <p>
 The data show that the combination of salinomycin (40-60 g/ton) plus
virginiamycin (5-15 g/ton) in finished rations can be safely fed to broiler
chickens. <p>
 Further safety studies were not required because: <p>
 A. The drugs have been approved individually. <p>
  B.    Sufficient data have been provided to establish that these
compounds are compatible in combinations fed to broiler chickens.<p>
 C. The label claims are not antagonistic. <p>
 
 <b>6.  Human Safety</b><p>
    <b>A.   Data to Support Human Safety </b> <p>
 The safety of each of the approved products, salinomycin
(Bio-Cox&#174;   ) and virginiamycin (Starac&#174;), has been
established by data submitted in each respective original NADA (128-686,
salinomycin; 91-467 and 91-513, virginiamycin).<p>
 Tolerances established for negligible residues of virginiamycin in the
edible tissues of chickens are:  O.l parts per million (ppm) for muscle, 0.3
ppm for liver and 0.2 ppm for skin/fat, 21 CFR 556.750. <p>

<b> B. Residue Depletion/Non-Interference Studies</b> <p>
 Residue data supporting the approved individual uses of salinomycin and
virginiamycin, each having zero withdrawal times, were submitted in their
respective original applications (see Part A, above). <p>
 Drug residue interference studies were completed using acceptable protocols
at SmithKline Animal Health Products facility in Nest Chester, Pennsylvania,
and by A.H. Robins Company, in Richmond, Virginia.  In the Pennsylvania study,
12 male and 12 female birds were assigned to three groups of eight birds each.
One group received 45.4 grams of roxarsone per ton of feed plus 80 grams of
salinomycin per ton for 21 days, followed by the same drugs plus 20 grams of
l4C-virginiamycin per ton for an additional 24 days. 
 A second group received the roxarsone/salinomycin combination for the
entire 45-day feeding period.  This procedure was sufficient to satisfy
equilibration requirements for each drug.  A third group received no drug and
served as controls.  After 45 days medicated feed was withdrawn and replaced by
control feed to simulate travel time to a processing plant.  Control birds were
sacrificed first to avoid possible contamination, followed by the treated
birds.  Edible tissues were radioassayed.  The following table summarizes the
results of the assays:<p>

In the A.H. Robbins study, birds were divided into two groups, receiving either
 no
medication or a diet containing the combination of 75 g/ton salinomycin, 45
g/ton roxarsone and 15 g/ton virginiamycin for 42 days.  On day 42 the
medications were withdrawn from the diet and birds were sacrificed following
zero withdrawal. Tissues were collected for salinomycin analyses using an
established HPLC method.  The average concentration of unchanged salinomycin in
skin/fat was observed to be &#60; 50 ppb.  This value is below the upper limit
of 200 ppb established for unchanged salinomycin in skin/fat under NADA
128-686. <p>
 Residues for virginiamycin and salinomycin were below their respective
tolerances or, safe concentrations at zero withdrawal, the established periods
for each of the drugs, thereby indicating the absence of interference. <p>
 A regulatory analytical methodology for virginiamycin is not required.
Practical analytical methods for the determination of tissue residues of
salinomycin are available in the Food Additives Analytical Manual on display in
FDA's Freedom of Information Room (Room 12A-30, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,
MD  20857).  The sponsor provided a study showing that virginiamycin did not
interfere with the salinomycin analytical method. <p>

<b>7.  AGENCY CONCLUSIONS</b><p>
The data  submitted in support of this original NADA satisfy the 
requirements of Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that salinomycin 
(40-60 g/ton) plus virginiiamycin (5-15 g/ton) are safe and effective 
for the claims indicated in Section 2 of the FOI  Summary.<p>

This original NADA is classified as a Category II application under 
CVM's supplemental policy (42 FR 64367, December 23, 1977) which did not
 require reevaluation of safety and efficacy data in the parent
 NADAs (128-686,  salinomycin and 91-467 & 91-513, virginiamycin).  The 
 drugs are to be supplied to the feed mill in individual premixes (Type
 A Medicated Articles) for combining in finished feeds (Type C Medicated
 Feeds) in agreement with the dosages approved  in the individual parent
 NADAs.<P>
 
 Residue data show that salinomycin is well within the established safe
 concentratrion of 200 ppb.  The concentration of unchanged salinomycin
 in skin/fat was observed to be  &#60; 50 ppb at zero withdrawal.  Residue
 data show that virginiamycin is well below the tolerances (21 CFR 556.750)
 of 0.3 ppm in liver, 0.2 ppm in skin/fat and 0.1 ppm in muscle tissues 
 at zero withdrawal.<P>
 Non interference studies demonstrate that salinomycin prevented an outbreak 
 of coccidiosis, alone and in combination with virginiamycin,
 when the birds were exposed to the six major species of <i>Eimeria </i>.  The
 data from six well controlled floor pen studies deomonstrate the effectiveness of 
 virginiamycin (15 g/ton) in the presence of salinomycin (60 g/ton).
 These data satisfy CVM's guidelines on
 combination drugs, permitting the granting of  range approval for
 salinomycin (40-60 g/ton) for the prevention of coccidiosis caused by
 the six major species of <i>Eimeria </i>&#160; in combination with virginiamycin
 at 5 g/ton for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency,
 or with virginiamycin at a range of 5-15 g/ton for increased rae of weight 
 gain in broiler chickens. <p>
 Salinomycin and virginiamycin are sold over the counter (OTC). 
 Therefore, this combination drug has OTC status.<P>

<b>4.    Effectiveness</b><p>
 In the approved NADA (132-447) for salinomycin and roxarsone, it has been
established that salinomycin and roxarsone are safe and effective  for the
prevention of coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix,</i> 
<i>E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. brunetti </i>&#160;and <i>E. mivati, </i>including some
field strains of <i>E. tenella </i>&#160; which are more susceptible to roxarsone
combined with  salinomycin than to salinomycin alone, 48 FR 46023  October
11, 1983. <p>
 Virginiamycin is approved (NADA 91-467, 91-513) for increased rate of
weight gain and improved feed efficiency, 46 FR 18966; March 27, 1981. In the
present NADA, it has been established that the 

addition
of virginiamycin to salinomycin and roxarsone improves feed efficiency. The
data also demonstrate that the addition of virginiamycin to salinomycin and
roxarsone does not interfere with the coccidiostatic activity of the latter
compound.  Therefore, the data support the effectiveness of the
virginiamycin/salinomycin/roxarsone combination when used as indicated in 2,3.
above. <p>
 <b>A.  Non-interference Studies</b> <p>
   
Two hundred eighty twelve-day old, Hubbard x Hubbard, broiler chickens were
used in two adequate, well-controlled battery studies with approved protocols.
The studies were conducted in a uniform environment with adequate air exchange
to test for non-interference of virginiamycin with the effectiveness of
salinomycin and roxarsone.  For each study, combinations of <i>Emeria maxima, E.
 acervulina ,</i> and <i>E. teneIla ,</i>&#160; or <i>E. mivati, E. brunetti ,</i>&#160; 
and <i>E. necatrix
</i>&#160;were  used.   This arrangement facilitated identification of
lesions. <p>
 These studies (Tables I and II) were conducted using the lowest approved
level of the coccidiostat; i.e., 40 grams per ton of salinomycin and 45.4 g/ton
roxarsone with the highest level of virginiamycin, viz., 20 g/ton.  The
protocols were designed to show "non-interference" of each component with the
others for the  virginiamycin/salinomycin/roxarsone combination.<p>
 Evaluations were by lesion scores (analysis was performed on preselected
birds from each pen), dropping scores, weight gains, and feed
conversions. <p>

 Forty birds were placed on each of  seven  treatments as indicated
below, with ten chicks in each of four battery pens per treatment. An eighth
group, consisting of two pens of ten infected, unmedicated chicks each was used
to monitor progress of the applied infections in each study. <p>

 <b>B.  Floor-Pen Studies</b> <p>
   
 Seven adequate and well-controlled floor-pen studies, utilizing approved
protocols and 13,104 broiler chickens (equal numbers of males and females) of a
variety of commercial strains, were conducted in seven geographic locations in
the United States under conditions simulating actual use to determine the
effectiveness of virginiamycin in the feed for performance enhancement in the
presence of salinomycin and roxarsone. <p>
 The same general experimental design was used in all studies. Salinomycin,
60 g/ton, and roxarsone, 45.4 g/ton, was used with virginiamycin at 0 or 15
g/ton in each study.  Birds (half male, half female) were selected at random
and assigned to pens; pens were assigned to one of the two treatments within
blocks as follows:<p>

 The studies were designed to simulate varying conditions such as geographic
location, differences in climate, changes In weather, differences in management
practices, and degree of disease contamination of the premises.  The diets were
balanced to provide adequate levels of nutrients (protein, energy, minerals,
vitamins, and fatty acids).  All chickens were maintained from one day of age
to market weight. <p>
 Data were collected to evaluate virginiamycin for improvement in feed
efficiency in the presence of the highest approved levels of salinomycin and
roxarsone.  Parameters of evaluation included mortality, and
feed-to-body-weight ratio. <p>
 Birds medicated with the combinations were healthy throughout the
respective studies.  Mortality was within the normal range for each house, and
there was no evidence of any drug toxicity. <p>
 The tables below give average arithmetic values for feed conversion and
mortality (by percent) at each location for the critical comparison treatments
used in the evaluation of these data according to the CVM's October 1983
guidelines for combination drugs

</pre>
 
 Feed conversion was improved significantly by both analyses, P = 0.059.
There was no effect on mortality. <p>
 These studies demonstrate that there is no interference of salinomycin or
roxarsone with the effectiveness of virginiamycin. The combinations were
compatible. <p>
 The above data satisfy the criteria for evaluation of the application under
the CVM policy outlined in the guidelines for combination drugs.  The
guldelines provide for granting approval for the production drug in combination
when the maximum level tested for the claim(s) is demonstrated to make a
significant contribution to the combination.  Data from birds receiving
virginiamycin (15 g/ton) in combination with salinomycin (60 g/ton) and
roxarsone (45.4 g/ton) show a significant (P= 0.059) improvement in feed
efficiency when compared to salinomycin and roxarsone alone.  The approval, in
accordance with the guidelines, is 5 g/ton.  Therefore, the approval levels for
this NADA are 5 g/ton of virginiamycin plus 40 to 60 g/ton of salinomycin and
45.4 g/ton roxarsone in complete broiler rations, because 5 g/ton is the only
level approved for improved feed efficiency when virginiamycin is used
alone. <p>

<b>5.   Animal Safety</b><p>
  The  original approved NADAs for virginiamycin
 (91-467, 91-513), salinomycin (128-686), and roxarsone (7-891) contain
adequate data to establish the safety of each drug for broiler
chickens. <p>
 The safety of the combination was demonstrated in the drug residue
interference studies, in the floor-pen trials, and in the compatibility battery
trials described in this document.  Birds in the drug residue studies were in
good health throughout the studies and did not have any gross pathology at
sacrifice.  The birds in the floor-pen and battery trials were healthy
throughout the experimental periods.  Mortality in each study was within an
acceptable range for each facility, and there was no evidence of drug-related
mortality. <p>
Based on the data in the parent NADAs, in the compatibility battery  trials,
in the floor-pen trials, and in the drug residue interference studies, CVM
concludes that the combination is safe to be fed in complete broiler rations as
indicated in the labeling. <p>
 The data show that the combination of salinomycin (40-60 g/ton) plus
roxarsone (45.4 g/ton) plus virginiamycin (5 g/ton) in finished rations can be
safely fed to broiler chickens. <p>
 Further safety studies were not required because: <ul><p>
<li>A. The drugs have been approved individually. <p>
<li>B.  Sufficient data have been provided to establish that these compounds are
compatible in combinations fed to broller chickens.<p>
<li>C.  The label claims are not antagonistic.</ul><p>
<b>6.  Human Safety</b> <p>
 <b>A.  Data to Support Human Safety</b> <p>
   The safety of each of the approved products, salinomycin
(Bio-Cox&#174;), roxarsone (3-Nitro&#174;) and virginiamycin
(Stafac&#174;), has been established  by  data submitted tn each original
NADA (128-686, sa11nomycin; 7-891, roxarsone; 91-467 and 91-513,
virginiamycin).<p>
Tolerances established for negligible residues of virginiamycin in the edible
tissues of chickens are:  0.1 parts per million (ppm) for muscle, 0.3 ppm for
liver and 0.2 ppm for skin/fat, 21 CFR 556.750. For roxarsone, the tolerances
are 0.5 ppm for muscle, 2.0 ppm in edible by-products and 0.5 ppm in eggs, 21
CFR 556.60.<p>
<b>B.   Residue Depletion/Non-Interference Studies</b><p>
 Residue data supporting the approved individual uses of salinomycin and
virginiamycin, each having zero withdrawal times, and roxarsone with a five-day
withdrawal time were submitted in their respective original applications (see
Part A, above).  Metabolism data on virginiamycin in chickens are included in
approved NADAs 91-467 and 91-513.  The following studies establish that each
drug in the presence of the others does not exceed its established tolerances
or safe concentrations at zero withdrawal and that each does not interfere with
the tissue residue assay of the others.<p>
Drug residue interference studies were completed using acceptable protocols
at SmithKline Animal Health Products' facility in West   Chester,
Pennsylvania, and  by  A.H. Robins Company, in Richmond,  Virginia.  In
the Pennsylvania study, 12 male and 12 female birds were assigned to three
groups of eight birds each. One group received 45.4 grams of roxarsone per
ton of feed plus 80 grams of salinomycin per ton for 21 days, followed  by
 the same drugs plus 20 grams of  14C-virginiamycin per ton for an
additional 24 days.  A second group received the roxarsone/salinomycin
combination for the entire 45-day feeding period.  This procedure was
sufficient to satisfy equilibration requirements for each drug.  A third
group received no drug and served as controls.  After 45 days
medicated feed was withdrawn and replaced  by  control feed to simulate
travel time to a processing plant.  Control birds were sacrificed first
to avoid possible contamination, followed  by  the treated birds.
Edible tissues were radioassayed.  The following table summarizes
the results of the assays:<p>

 In one A.H. Robins study, 122 birds were divided into two groups, receiving
either no medication or a diet containing the combination of 80 g/ton
salinomycin, 45.4 g/ton roxarsone, and 20 g/ton virginiamycin for 41 days.  On
day 41 the medications were withdrawn from the diet of the second group and the
birds were sacrificed following drug withdrawal periods of 0 to 5 days.
Tissues were collected for roxarsone assay at 0, 1, 3 and 5 days
withdrawal. <p>

 In another A.H. Robbins study, birds were divided into two groups,
receiving either no medication or a diet containing the combination of 75 g/ton
salinomycin, 45.4 g/ton roxarsone and 15 g/ton virginiamycin for 42 days.  On
day 42, the medications were withdrawn from the diet and the birds were
sacrificed following zero withdrawal.  Tissues were collected for salinomycin
analyses using an established HPLC method.  The average concentration of
unchanged salinomycin in skin/fat was observed to be &lt; 50 ppb.  This value
is below the upper limit of 200 ppb established for unchanged salinomycin in
skin/fat under NADA 128-686. <p>
 Prior to conducting this study, A.H. Robins "spiked" chicken tissues with
various combinations of salinomycin and virginiamycin and roxarsone and, in
this replicated experiment, demonstrated that virginiamycin and/or roxarsone do
not interfere with the assay for salinomycin. <p>
 Residues for virginiamycin and salinomycin were below their respective
tolerances or safe concentrations at zero withdrawal and for roxarsone at 5
days withdrawal, the established periods for each of the drugs, thereby
indicating the absence of interference. <p>
 A regulatory analytical methodology for virginiamycin is not required.
Practical analytical methods for the determination of tissue residues of
salinomycin and roxarsone are available in the Food Additives Analytical Manual
on display in FDA's Freedom of Information Room (Room 12A-30, 5600 Fishers
Lane, Rockville, MD 20857).  Assay noninterference data are not required for
arsenic because the ashing procedure used in total arsenic determination
destroys the arsenic compounds. <p>
<b>7.   AGENCY CONCLUSIONS:</b><p>
  The data submitted in support of this original NADA satisfy the
requirements of Section 512 of the Act and demonstrate that salinomycin (40-60
g/ton) plus roxarsone (45.4 g/ton) plus virginiamycin (5 g/ton) are safe and
effective for the claims indicated in Section 2 of this FOI Summary. <p>
 This original NADA is classified as a Category II application under CVM's
supplemental policy (42 FR 64367; December 23, 1977), which did not require
reevaluation of safety and efficacy data in the parent NADAs, (91-467 &amp;
91-513, virginiamycin; and 132-447, salinomycin/roxarsone).  The drugs are to
be supplied to the feed mill in individual premixes (Type A Medicated Articles)
for the manufacture of finished feeds (Type C Medicated Feeds) in agreement
with the dosages approved in the individual parent NADAs. <p>
 Residue data show that salinomycin is well within the established safe
concentration of 200 ppb.  The concentration of unchanged salinomycin in
skin/fat was observed to be &lt;50 ppb at zero withdrawal.  Residue data show
that virginiamycin is well below the tolerances (21 CFR 556.750) of 0.3 ppm in
liver, 0.2 ppm in skin/fat and 0.1 ppm in muscle tissues at zero withdrawal.
The roxarsone residue data show levels of arsenic below the tolerances of 0.5
ppm in uncooked muscle and 2.0 ppm in uncooked edible by-products (21 CFR
556.60). <p>
 Non-interference studies demonstrate that salinomycin/roxarsone prevented
an outbreak of coccidiosis in the presence of virginiamycin when the birds
were exposed to the six major species of <i>Eimeria.</i><u>  </u>The data from
seven adequate and  well controlled floor pen studies demonstrate the
effectiveness of virginiamycin (15 g/ton) in the presence of salinomycin (60
g/ton) plus roxarsone (45.4 g/ton).  These data satisfy CVM's guidelines on
combination drugs, permitting the granting of range approval for salinomycin
(40-60 g/ton) plus roxarsone (45.4 g/ton) for the prevention of coccidiosis
caused by  <i>Eimeria acerruling, E. brunetti, E. maxima, E. mivati, E.
necatrix, </i>and<u> </u><i>E. tenella</i><u>,</u> including some field strains
of <i>E. tenella</i> that are more susceptible to roxarsone combined with
salinomycin than <u>to </u>salinomycin alone, and for virginiamycin at 5 g/ton
for improved feed efficiency.  The approval of the claim for improved feed
efficiency is limited to 5 g/ton for virginiamycin because that is the only
level approved in the parent NADA (91-467) and codified in the CFR for that
claim. <p>
