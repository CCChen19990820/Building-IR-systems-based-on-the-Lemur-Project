MEMS DEVICES WILL CONTINUE TO CARVE OUT SIGNIFICANT
MARKETS

The foundation of MEMS (Microelectromechanical Systems)
technology is the ability to create controllable, mechanical, moveable

structures using silicon IC technology, notes Dr. Janusz Bryzek,
president of Intelligent MicroSensor Technology (IMST, Fremont, CA,

510-770-9168). The silicon pressure sensor represents the first
commercially successful application of micromachining.

Since sensors are often the vital components determining the
feasibility of new products, they have a significant leverage factor,
enabling production of sensor-based systems exceeding sensor cost
by several orders of magnitude; e.g., a $10 MAP (manifold absolute
pressure) sensor facilitates production of fuel efficient, low polluting,

$25,000 cars. Originally an expensive and exotic technology, silicon-
based pressure transducers were initially employed exclusively in
specialized aerospace, testing, and instrumentation functions, Bryzek
explains. However, within the past decade, advances in silicon
micromachining manufacturing technology have created a plethora of
new uses for such technology.

Silicon is widely used in manufacturing purely electronic integrated
circuits, where only the material's electrical properties are exploited.

Micromechanics utilizes the electrical and mechanical properties of
silicon to create a new generation of electromechanical silicon chips.

Silicon micromachining technology is attractive, owing to its
mechanical properties and to the support available from the IC
industry. Mechanically, silicon is almost a perfect material for
pressure sensors, since it is stronger than steel, as light as aluminum,
not subject to mechanical hysteresis, highly sensitive to stress, and
can be readily batch micromachined. Support available from the
mainstream electronic industry includes proven semiconductor
manufacturing processes, ultra-pure, low-cost materials, advanced
manufacturing equipment, high-volume manufacturing and
packaging technologies, and educated technologists.

The significance of the leverage that silicon sensor technology enjoys
is particularly clear when comparing the total R&D expenditures in
the sensor and IC industries. The global sensor budget, covering a
diverse range of technologies, is on the order of $200 million
annually, according to Bryzek. Funding for new developments by the
IC industry and supporting services totals on the order of billions of
dollars per year. Adopting mainstream electronic industry
developments significantly reduces the development time and cost
for micromechanical devices; and new micromachining or sensor-
specific technologies can be developed from the rich foundation
created for electronic ICs.

The roots of silicon micromachining technology hark back to Bell
Laboratories. The research team developing the basics of
semiconductor technology discovered a piezoresistive effect in silicon
and germanium. The first research paper, published in 1954,
characterized the basic piezoresistive properties of such materials.
The piezoresistive effect creates a resistance change in the
semiconductor material in response to stress, which is about two
orders of magnitude larger than the equivalent resistance change of
metals used for non-silicon strain gage applications.

California's Silicon Valley played a vital role in bringing MEMS
devices to the marketplace. Characteristic of many semiconductor
companies, the initial silicon sensor start-ups spun-off from Fairchild
in the 1970s: ICT Transducers (now Foxboro/ICT, San Jose, CA);
National Semiconductor's Sensor Group (now SenSym, Milpitas, CA);
Endevco R&D (Sunnyvale, CA); and Cognition (now Rosemount, whose
Measurement Division is headquartered in Eden Prairie, MN).

Bryzek has helped pioneer and generate the market momentum and
infrastructure for silicon micromachined sensors, having been a co-
founder of such companies as NovaSensor, which was acquired by
British-based Lucas Industries, plc circa1990. Lucas NovaSensor(R)
(Fremont, CA) is under the rubric of Lucas Control Systems Products
(Hampton, VA), a part of Lucas Industries, plc.

During the past ten years, the Silicon Valley MEMS market has
emerged to form a mini industry. According to Bryzek, about 900
people are currently employed in the MEMS industry in the Valley,
which is comprised of eight active microsensor companies, 13

companies/organizations involved in microstructures, and three
university R&D centers. The average sales per employee for the top
three microsensor companies in Silicon Valley amounts to about
$133,000.

The total MEMS sensor/non-sensing market is forecast by Bryzek to
grow at a 16.5% compound annual rate to reach $6.7 billion in 2005,
compared to about $1.45 billion in 1995. The non-sensing MEMS
market (encompassing fluid controls, data storage, displays, biochips,

communication, and miscellaneous devices) is anticipated to advance
at 52.5% compound annual rate to total $3.4 billion in 2005, from
about $50 million in 1995.

The MEMS pressure sensor market is projected to expand at a 9.6%
compound annual rate, from $1.0 billion in 1995 to $2.5 billion in
2005. Shipments of silicon pressure sensors, according to Bryzek,
rose from about 3 million units in 1983 to over 40 million units in
1995, and are forecast to exceed 125 million units/year in the next
decade. The total market for MEMS inertial sensors is expected to
increase at nearly a 7.2% compound annual rate to reach $800
million in 2005, from $400 million in 1995. During the past three
years, the silicon acceleration sensor market mushroomed to 15
million units per year. Several additional MEMS inertial sensor
applications are in the initial commercialization phase, promising the

formation of billion dollar market opportunities.

Bryzek expects sanguine expansion in MEMS sensor markets, as well
as non-sensing MEMS applications. MEMS pressure sensors will
experience significant growth, primarily fueled by automotive
applications and smart sensors with networked output. Emerging
automotive applications for MEMS pressure sensors include fuel
vapor sensors, high-pressure fuel injection systems, diesel MAP
(manifold absolute pressure) sensors, and "braking by wire"
(electronic braking) in passenger cars and trucks. The volume of
inertial (acceleration, rate, gyro) sensors will rapidly expand, mainly
in the automotive and virtual reality sectors, accompanied by
substantial price erosion.

The next generation of fluidic components (such as pressure valves)
is expected by Bryzek to enjoy considerable growth. The current
generation of fluid controls is not yet capable of sufficiently meeting
user requirements, since they have drawbacks in terms of lack of
media compatibility, limited temperature range, and restricted
pressure range.

Active development of MEMS-based data storage technology is
underway; and Bryzek perceives the most commercially promising
development to be the hard drive head suspension (gimble) with an
on-chip servomotor, driven by an industry consortium initiated by
Professor D. Miu of UCLA.

The servomotor enables .1 um positioning accuracy of the head,
corresponding to about 100 GB/sq. in. read-write density, and fits
into the "sockets" of the existing mechanical devices to provide 10
um resolution. Since current industry volume is on the order of one
million heads per day, with an estimated volume price of about $5
for the gimble/head assembly, this application represents a potential
market of $1.3 billion. Moreover, several other storage chip
technologies hold promise for achieving volume production during
the next decade.

Activity in the area of MEMS display chips is being spearheaded by
Texas Instruments' (Dallas, TX) micromirror display development.
Two Silicon Valley start-ups are focusing on MEMS display
technology (electrostatically activated microbeams reflecting light),
including Echelle (Mountain View, CA). MEMS displays have potential
to capture a significant share of the large display industry.

MEMS biochips can allow a new generation of products to appear in
the marketplace, including DNA multipliers, chemical reactors, and
bacteria processors. Bryzek expects the MEMS biochip market to
grow briskly over the next ten years, adding that about one billion
biochips annually could potentially be used in DNA multipliers.
Concerning MEMS communication devices/components, fiber-optic
aligners have been on the market for a number of years. Bryzek
observes that the recent development of fiber-optic MEMS switches
has potential for enabling the implementation of on-demand
residential multimedia applications.

In November 1995, Dr. Bryzek left Lucas NovaSensor to start-up
IMST, which aims to become the global leader in smart integrated
and networkable sensors in less than five years. The company, which
is in the process of formation, plans to initially develop a new
generation of OEM pressure transducers featuring advances in
functionality, price/performance, quality, and reliability, while
retaining socket compatibility with many competitive "dumb"
devices. The products will incorporate a unique on-sensor-chip
pressure media protection capability to eliminate the need for metal

diaphragms. They will also offer a high level of electronics
integration, including electronic trimming for compensation and
calibration, wireless communication, and control networking.

Dr. Bryzek has initiated discussions with selected companies
interested in creating strategic partnerships with his new venture.
He plans to initially introduce products that meet the requirements
of such partners, and then unveil standard product lines. Dr. Bryzek
welcomes inquiries from companies interested in establishing a
business relationship with IMST.

Sincerely,
Peter Adrian, Editor

AMMI EXPLOITS GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR SILICON
MICROMACHINED SENSORS

Advanced MicroMachines Incorporated (AMMi, Cleveland, OH, 216-
229-4636) has doubled its sales staff over the past few months to
capitalize on promising business opportunities in the silicon
micromachined sensors arena.

One opportunity entails the design and development of a
micromechanical extreme temperature sensing bimetallic switch that
does not require power. The device is based on the same principles
that apply in the macro world--two adjacent materials with different

coefficients of thermal expansion will experience a bending moment
along their lengths, as one material expands more than the other.
Although this concept is well over 100 years old, new challenges
must be surmounted when dealing with structures that are about the
size of a human eyelash, such as residual stresses formed in the
structures due to wafer processing.

However, micromachined bimetallic temperature sensors offer the
key benefits of enhanced sensitivity, due to both their larger
deflections and increased radii of curvature. Such advantages can be
leveraged to cost-effectively produce micromachined bimetallic
switches that latch into place when an extreme hot or cold
temperature is achieved, which enables the device to be effectively
applied for diagnostic monitoring. For example, such sensors are
sufficiently small to be embedded in a truck tire. When it is time to
retread the tire, a quick check can be performed to determine
possible damage to the polymer rubber caused by overheating.
Additional potential applications include relays, temperature
switches, and thermostats.

Another business opportunity identified by AMMi calls for designing
and developing a miniature array of high frequency response heat
flux sensors to be used inside a gas turbine engine. The product is
unique, since an array of sensors is embedded in a flexible material,
allowing for mounting many sensors onto the curved surface of a
turbine blade in a timely and effective manner. While the
commercial applications for such a product in aircraft engine testing
are limited due to high temperature constraints, many other market

opportunities are opened when other types of sensors are considered
as candidates for being embedded as arrays in flexible materials,
notes Louis Toly, AMMi's business manager.

AMMi's mission within the competitive sensor market is to be the
preferred source for the design, development, prototyping,
integration, testing, and packaging of microsensors and
microactuators for industrial and medical applications. The company
has expertise in all aspects of sensor design, including both the
sensor component and the associated ASICs for signal processing.
Such components are integrated in a hybrid configuration and
packaged for protection from harsh environments. The company,
therefore, can provide its clients with sensors possessing smart
capabilities.

AMMi began as a provider of consulting services in the area of MEMS
about two years ago, and still plans to continue in this arena. Large

corporations are often reluctant to invest manpower and equipment
in MEMS, due to the significant inherent financial risks involved in
making a new technology commercially available. AMMi helps
mitigate such risks by assisting new entrants in the silicon
micromachined sensors arena, which is fraught with growth
opportunities.

Demand for MEMS-based temperature sensors for tires is projected
to total $250 million (representing 25,000,000 units) in 2000,
according to System Planning Corporation's (Arlington, VA, 703-351-
8677) Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS)  market study. The
global market for MEMS temperature sensors in automobiles is
forecast to reach $400 million (representing 40,000,000 units) in
2000. The report notes that sensors that demand for MEMS
temperature sensors is expanding in the automobile, truck, and tire
industries, and that such sensors will continue to find new
applications in such devices as fire alarms, HVAC systems, and
portable electronics.

The value of the Western European market for silicon temperature
sensors is projected to rise at a 10.6% average annual rate to total
$19.5 million in 1997, from $10.7 million in 1992, according to Frost
& Sullivan's report on The European Market For Silicon Sensors
(#RE1760/J). The market for silicon temperature sensors in Western
Europe is pegged at $15.9 million in 1995. In 1997, the end-user
industry distribution of the Western silicon temperature sensor
market will be: while goods (e.g., washing machines, dishwashers,
ovens, coffee makers)-35%; automotive-32%; HVAC (including
industrial/domestic thermostats)-10%; electronics/instrumentation
(temperature compensation and control)-15%; and "other" (including
shavers)-8%.

SBD  forecasts that global revenues for silicon/IC temperature
sensors will expand at a 6% compound annual rate to reach $40.2
million in 2000, compared to about $30 million in 1995.

FIBER-OPTIC SENSOR MAY SPARK DIESEL ENGINE COMBUSTION
PRESSURE MONITORING

The new diesel combustion pressure sensor (Model OPS350-3000)
available from Optrand, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI, 313-769-4094) is
designed for continuous, long-term operation under diesel
combustion conditions. The reliable, low-cost sensor-- which is
especially suitable for engine health monitoring or control in
stationary and movable diesel engines--is capable of withstanding
high overpressures and combustion detonations without suffering
damage or performance degradation.

Using Optrand's fiber-optic sensing technology developed for adverse

environmental applications, the OPS350-3000 operates at sensor
housing temperatures up to 350 degrees C, and has a guaranteed life
of 200 million cycles, which is purportedly not currently available
from other competing commercial products. Optrand's diesel
combustion pressure sensor is available in a sealed gage pressure
package, and is offered in two versions with accuracies of 1% and 3%.

In conjunction with Optrand OPT1000 series opto-electronic
interfaces, the sensor system provides a frequency response of 0.1
Hz to 15 kHz, covering engine knock frequencies. The sensor is
available in four miniature housing styles ranging in size from M5
(5mm diameter thread) to 3/8"-24 in diameter. Specifically intended
for high-volume and OEM applications, the OPS350-3000 is offered in
custom OEM housings suitable for direct engine installation in
addition to standard pressure configurations.

Incorporated in 1992, Optrand focuses on researching, developing,
and manufacturing fiber-optic sensors for extreme environments.
The company's products address pressure, temperature, air/fuel
ratio monitoring, and control requirements in the combustion engine,
electrical utility, and jet engine industries.

Marek Wlodarczyk, Optrand's president and CEO, told SBD  that the
OPS350-3000 provides key performance and design advantages over
competing piezoelectric and piezoresistive sensing technologies for
engine monitoring/control applications. He notes that piezoelectric
sensors, which are used predominantly for combustion engine
research/testing, are expensive, and have a relatively short life, due
to their construction and to the limitations of piezoelectric materials.

The silicon piezoresistive combustion pressure sensor, which
Wlodarczyk indicates is also mostly used for research purposes,
requires special mounting so that the temperature of the sensing
element does not exceed about 125 degrees C. Moreover, the
required size of the silicon piezoresistive sensor package (which
includes the sensor and electronics) limits its mounting flexibility in
the engine.

As noted in Multi-Channel Fiber-Optic Pressure Sensor System for
Monitoring and Control of Reciprocating Engines, by T. Poorman, S.
Kalishnikov, and M. Wlodarczyk, which was presented at the 10th
Annual Gas Machinery Conference & Exhibition  in October 1995,
sensing crystals are unable to withstand continuous high pressures.
Strain or capacitance gages used in pressure transducers exhibit
large unrepeatable, unpredictable changes in output at high
temperatures. The changes, resulting from such effects as alloy
segregation, phase changes, selective oxidation, and diffusion,
ultimately lead to premature failure of the gage or lead wires.

Transfer pin designs--which connect the pressure sensing diaphragm
to the crystal to separate the temperature-sensitive crystal from
high combustion temperatures--are subject to hysteresis and
repeatability errors, resulting from response variations induced by
temperature gradients presented to the mechanical assembly.

Water cooling is required for piezo-type sensors to operate over the
full range of combustion engine temperatures. The signal
conditioning electronics of such sensors must be located at or near
the sensor head to counteract strong EMI effects, which can subject
the electronic components to temperatures exceeding 125 degrees C,
thereby requiring expensive components with high-temperature
capability. The sensing crystal and the electronic circuitry must be

electrically and thermally well-shielded, resulting in a large sensor
package. The authors note that electronic sensors have not thus far
been able to effectively address the overall cost, size, reliability, and

high-temperature durability requirements for continuous engine
control applications.

Optrand's uncomplicated intensity-modulated fiber-optic combustion
pressure sensor, which uses an optical fiber in front of a flexing
diaphragm for optical reflection measurement of pressure-induced
diaphragm deflections, offers promise for satisfying the performance
and cost constraints of industrial and, over the longer-term,
automotive applications.

In contrast to both the piezoelectric and silicon piezoresistive
combustion pressure sensors, the OPS350-3000 does not require a
transfer pin to mechanically couple the diaphragm to the sensing
element. Furthermore, in the OPS350-3000, which does not require
special mounting, the top of the sensing element is only 30 microns
away from the diaphragm. The diesel combustion pressure sensor's
diaphragm, moreover, has been optimized in terms of its operating
and overpressure range, yield strength, and fatigue life.

Wlodarczyk notes that Optrand's longer-term strategy entails
offering reliable, low-cost fiber-optic sensors for use in passenger
cars. The OPS350-3000 is primarily intended for larger, less price-
sensitive engines. Target markets/applications include natural gas
and diesel fueled engines used in power generation, marine
applications, and locomotives. Optrand's OPS350-3000 has been
evaluated for use in stationary engines for power generation; and
OEMs have expressed keen interest in integrating the sensor into a
new generation of engine controls.

The starting prices for the OPS350-3000 sensor and signal
conditioning electronics are $395 and $595, respectively. In OEM
quantities (1,000 units), the sensor plus signal conditioning
electronics is available at a starting price of about $400.

Significant gains in the efficiency of large-bore combustion engines,

diminished levels of noxious emissions, and enhanced engine life can
be achieved via closed-loop engine controls based on combustion
pressure information, according to the aforementioned paper. The
use of cylinder pressure as a control parameter in gasoline engines
has been demonstrated to lead to optimal control of spark-timing,
engine speed, throttle, air/fuel ratio, and to an optimized response to
ambient conditions. In-cylinder pressure sensors can also provide for
direct and deterministic misfire detection. In lean burn combustion,

controlling spark timing and air/fuel ratio via in-cylinder
measurement so that "cold combustion" can occur leads results in
high efficiency, reduced NOx emissions, and minimized torque
variability.

Although reduced fuel consumption and increased torque output are
obtained in large-bore engines operating under lean burn conditions
and at higher compression ratios, the increased ratio leads to a
greater tendency toward engine knock. Effective knock control is
facilitated by monitoring each cylinder individually. Currently used
knock sensors mounted externally to the engine body can suffer
from shock and vibration effects.

Cylinder pressure information is of considerable value, along with
other engine parameters, for engine diagnostics and health
monitoring. Pressure trend analyses can extend maintenance
schedules and provide a warning before significant engine problems
develop.

In addition, there are opportunities to use continuous cylinder-
pressure monitoring to address existing and emerging emissions
regulations. The Clean Air ACT Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 will
induce most US operators of Stationary Reciprocating Internal
Combustion Engines (SRICEs) to continuously monitor and report
their emissions.

Some emissions sources will need to be equipped with Enhanced

Monitoring/Compliance Certification (EM/CC) capability, in which a
mechanism, procedure, or system will be implemented to ensure that
the unit complies with an emission limit/standard on a continuous
basis. Although cylinder pressure measurement does not provide
direct information on emissions, the authors note that maintaining
nominal pressure levels in all cylinders is a prerequisite for realizing
low emission levels. Moreover, cylinder pressure measurement is
described as the best predictor in Parametric Emissions Monitoring
Systems (PEMS) that are used to predict emission levels of
combustion emission gases, such as NOx, VOCs, and carbon monoxide
(CO), without requiring direct monitoring techniques.

Global revenues for fiber-optic pressure sensors are predicted to
expand at a 13.9% compound annual rate to reach $92.7 million in
1999, from $37.3 million in 1992, according to Frost & Sullivan's
World Fiber Optic Sensor Markets  report (912-40). Revenues for
1996-1998 are projected at $59.2 million, $68.0 million, and $79.0
million, respectively.

Worldwide unit shipments of fiber-optic pressure sensors are
anticipated to rise at an 18.3% compound annual rate to total
380,300 in 1999, compared to 117,100 in 1992. Unit shipments
during 1996-1998 are put at 200,700, 243,500, and 300,600,
respectively.

Revenues for the US fiber-optic pressure sensors market are forecast
to expand at a 13.2% compound annual rate to reach $65.8 million in
1999, from $27.6 million in 1992. Revenues for 1996-1998 are
projected at $42.8 million, $48.9 million, and $56.6 million,
respectively.

Unit shipments for the US fiber-optic pressure sensors market are
expected to rise at about a 17.7% compound annual rate to total
274,200 in 1999, as opposed to 87,900 in 1992. Unit shipments
during 1996-1998 are pegged at 147,100, 177,800, and 218,500,
respectively.

In 1996, the projected end-user industry distribution of the total
global revenues for fiber-optic pressure sensors is (all figures are
rounded): process industries-17.3%; industrial machinery-11.4%;
medical-61.1%; and "other" (including power plants, explosives
manufacturers, plastic producers, automotive industry, and machine
tool manufacturers)-10.5%.

Revenues for the Western European market for fiber-optic pressure
sensors are forecast to advance at about an 8.7% compound annual
rate to reach $7.4 million in 1999, as opposed to $4.1 million in 1992,

according to Frost & Sullivan's report on Fibre Optic Sensor Markets
(Europe)  (1940-40). Revenues in 1996-1998 are placed at $5.6
million, $6.1 million, and $6.7 million, respectively.

Unit shipments for the Western European fiber-optic pressure
sensors market are expected to rise at a 13.3% compound annual rate
to total 34,452 in 1999, from 14,360 in 1992. Unit shipments for
1996-1998 are projected at 23,483, 27,038, and 30,582, respectively.

In 1996, the projected geographical distribution of the total revenues
for the Western European fiber-optic pressure sensors market is:
Germany-38.6%; UK-13.7%; France-16.0%; Italy-8.6%; Iberia (Spain,

Portugal)-9.2%; Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway)-
4.6%; Benelux (Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands)-4.6%; and the
rest of Europe (Austria, Greece, Ireland, Switzerland)-4.7%.

The world market for fiber-optic pressure sensors is forecast to
stand at $17.7 million in 1998, compared to $16.8 million in 1993,
according to Business Communications Company, Inc.'s Fiber Optic
Sensors  report (LG-116R). Global unit volume of fiber-optic pressure
sensors is projected to total 16,000 in 1998, from 14,000 in 1993.

Civilian, open global demand for pressure sensors used in ships and
railborn vehicles is forecast to reach 49.5 mil. DM (about $29.1
million at the exchange rate of 1.7 DM for the dollar) in 2000,
compared to 45.7 mil. DM (about $26.9 million) in 1991 and 48.5 mil.
DM (about $28.5 million) in 1995, according to Prognos AG's Sensor
Technology 2000  report.

SBD  projects that global revenues for fiber-optic pressure
sensors/systems will expand at about an 8% compound annual rate
to reach $25.4 million in 2000, compared to about $17.3 million in
1995.

Global demand for automotive pressure sensors is projected at $210
million in 1995 and $240 million in 1996, according to BIS Strategic
Decisions' (Luton, England, ++44-1-582-405678) latest Automotive
Sensor Demand Forecast Market Report. Worldwide unit volume for
automotive pressure sensors in 1995 and 1996 is projected at
21,000,000 and 26,000,000, respectively.

RESEARCHERS CLARIFY KEY SOURCES OF INDOOR AIR VOCS

A research study funded by the Georgia Environmental Technology
Consortium--a division of the Georgia Research Alliance-- suggests
that metabolic gases emitted from molds and fungi growing inside
buildings may constitute a significant source of airborne volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) that can engender indoor air quality
problems collectively referred to as the "Sick Building Syndrome."

Indoor air quality problems have historically been blamed on
various factors, including emissions from particleboard partitions,
paints, carpets, and cleaning supplies. The study suggests that control

measures prescribed for sick buildings may have to be altered to
address microbial problems in addition to building materials.

"As molds and fungi grow, they give off metabolic gases that contain
VOC emissions," explained Dr. Charlene Bayer, principal research
scientist and director of the Georgia Institute of Technology's Indoor

Environment Research Program (Atlanta, GA, 404-894-3825). "Some
of the volatile compounds that we are finding are primary solvents;
and we think some of the manufacturers are being blamed for
emissions from their products when the emissions may actually be
coming from the microbes. Because the VOCs have usually been
attributed to other types of sources, the source control may be
incorrect."

Bayer and Sidney Crow, a biologist at Georgia State University
Southeast, collected fungi samples from buildings afflicted with
microbial contamination, and allowed the samples to grow in the
laboratory. The VOCs released from the microbial broths were
collected, identified, and then compared to those detected in the
ambient air within the buildings.

"Many of the volatile compounds produced by the cultured fungi are
identical to those originating from solvent-based building materials
and cleaning supplies," Bayer noted. "These VOCs included hexane,
methylene chloride, benzene, and acetone."

The microbial VOCs may contribute substantially to the overall level
of ambient VOCs in buildings, according to Bayer. For example, in one
building the researchers scrutinized, microbial contamination was
clearly evident on the walls, carpets, and other locations.

"The concentration of hexane--a solvent commonly used in cleaning
fluids, paints, and adhesives--was extremely high, but no source of
hexane could be found," Bayer stated. "The microbial contamination
could have been the source of the hexane."

Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Aspergillus are among the myriad of
commonly occurring microbes that can beset homes, schools, and
offices. Typically, a foul, musty odor is the initial indication of their

presence. The rampant growth of such microbes produces headaches,
itchy eyes, rashes, and respiratory problems.

Conditions favorable for stimulating microbial growth include heat
and moisture. In the Southeast's semi-tropical climate, buildings are
major targets for microbial contamination.

Molds and fungi are not particular about what they eat, and will
devour nearly any organic material, including the dirt and dust
trapped within ventilation systems. To ameliorate the risk of
microbial contamination, one should first seek ways to reduce the
required nutrient base.

"Under ideal conditions, a building's ventilation system should filter
out both the microbes and the dirt they feed upon," Bayer indicated.

"Unfortunately, however, many homes, schools, and small office
buildings use cheap, throwaway filters in their ventilation systems."

Cheap furnace filters are merely "boulder catchers," Bayer remarks.
"They only catch the big stuff. They don't catch the fine dust
particles, and they don't catch the microbes. So, they really don't do
anything to help human health." Bayer recommends discarding the
cheap filters and replacing them with more efficient, albeit more
expensive, ones.

However, the problems with ventilation systems increase with the
size of the building. In the fiberglass-lined ductwork often used for
noise control in larger office buildings, the fibers tend to trap dirt,
which provides a rich nutrient base for the microbes.

"Add a little moisture, and you have a mold garden growing in your
network," Bayer declared. "The microbes grow and multiply, and
then get blown all over the building to infest other areas." Moisture
control is vital for preventing microbial contamination, since
microbial growth can skyrocket when the humidity rises. "Many
buildings erected in the Southeast simply were not designed to
handle the heavy humidity loads we have, particularly during our
hot, muggy summers," Bayer remarked. "And most building owners
don't run their ventilation systems continuously."

Schools typically turn their systems off during the summer months;
and most office buildings cycle their systems over nights and
weekends, often creating an unpleasant "Monday morning cocktail"
for the workers. Such intermittent operation permits the humidity to
increase and the molds to multiply.

Preventive maintenance encompasses proper filtration, correct
moisture control, and periodic cleaning of the entire ventilation
system, including the humidifier assembly on residential furnaces.
"Typical reservoir humidifiers are little mold factories," Bayer notes.
"They are just pools of standing, stagnant water throughout much of
the year that allow mold to grow and infiltrate the ducts. They
should be cleaned regularly."

A considerable amount of research remains to be conducted,
including identifying individual metabolic gases and their respective
odors, and acquiring a greater understanding of the microbes that
are producing them. The human response to molds and fungi, and the
sources of complaints in buildings can be more fully understood, once
a knowledge base is developed in these areas.

"Ultimately, we want to identify the microbial contamination on the
basis of the odors which are present," Bayer states. "That way, we
will be able to identify the source much more quickly and accurately,
and deal with the problem faster and more effectively...before it
becomes a major problem requiring extensive remediation."

SBD  forecasts that global revenues for gas sensors used in building
and safety applications will rise at a 9.4% compound annual rate to
total $185 million in 2000, compared to about $108 million in 1994.

Revenues for the Western European HVAC (heating, ventilating, and
air conditioning) market for gas sensors are forecast to increase at
more than a 28% average annual rate to reach about $16.8 million in
1998, from nearly $3.8 million in 1992, according to Frost &
Sullivan's European Gas Sensor Markets  report (1902-40). Revenues
for 1996 are pegged at nearly $10.1 million.

Unit shipments for the Western European HVAC gas sensor market
are projected to rise at about a 32.9% average annual rate to total
308,000 in 1998, compared to 56,000 in 1992. Unit shipments in
1996 are placed at 185,000.

The projected distribution of the total revenues for the Western
European HVAC gas sensor market by sensor type in 1996 is:

electrochemical-$6.15 million; zirconia-$0.05 million; and miniature
selective semiconductor-$6.5 million.

CALORIE SENSOR COULD HEAT UP CONSUMER HEALTH CARE AND
MEDICAL ARENAS

MOI Corporation (Pittsburgh, PA, 412-231-5776) has developed a
calorie sensor that measures body energy (calories) by using
sophisticated heat flow sensors that measure the body's heat flow.
The sensors are capable of measuring conductive, convective,
evaporative, and radiant heat flow. The heat flow detected by the
sensors is monitored by a minicontroller that calculates, after input
of anthropomorphic measurements, actual calorie expenditures. The
calorie sensor provides an accuracy comparable to that of oxygen
consumption measurements.

Measuring energy expenditure is reportedly quite difficult. A widely
accepted method of indirectly assessing energy expenditure is to
measure oxygen consumption. Directly measuring energy
expenditure requires expensive equipment and a controlled
environment, and is, therefore, limited to laboratory settings. Other
attempts at measuring energy expenditure, such as heart rate
monitors and motion sensors (accelerometers), have limitations
which adversely affect their measurement accuracy. Heart rate is not

well-correlated to calorie expenditures. Accelerometers cannot
measure calorie expenditure during static activity, and do not
accurately measure such expenditures during vertical motion (e.g.,
bike riding, stair climbing).

MOI's extremely sensitive calorie sensor actually measures the
amount of heat the body releases; and continuously, directly
measures the amount of calories that are "burned" by an individual
regardless of whether he/she is resting, sleeping, or vigorously
exercising. Key characteristics of the sensor include: simple
calibration (merely input height and weight); no usage restrictions
(all activities are accurately monitored, and 24 hour/day, 365
day/year use is possible); and design parameters are limited only by

electronics and sensing area considerations.

The determination of calorie expenditures is a vital component of a
weight control or fitness program. The MOI calorie sensor can be
configured as a watch-like consumer product for people wishing to
lose weight, or as a medical device for monitoring the calorie
requirements of patients with specific caloric needs, including
diabetics and critical care patients. The sensor can also be an
alternative or adjunct tool for oxygen consumption measurements for

researchers.

The calorie sensor is touted as the "next step" in the ongoing
development of personal diagnostics (i.e., glucose meters, home
cholesterol tests, pregnancy tests, blood pressure meters, pulse and
heart rate monitors) that has broad applicability to consumer
markets, since it offers individuals more control over their lives. The
genesis of the product--which embodies significant research and
product development--was guided by numerous focus groups of
potential consumers (including people in exercise, wellness, and
dieting programs), as well as endocrinologists, diabetologists, exercise

physiologists, and weight-loss industry executives. The results
indicate to MOI that there is a very substantial market for the calorie
sensor.

Prototype units are available, and have been used extensively by
university researchers in studying metabolism and obesity. The
system consists of two components--the sensor unit and the display
unit. A low power RF transmitter is used for communication with the
display unit. Capable of being either a simple LCD display or a more

sophisticated PC-based analysis system, the display unit uses a
prefabricated receiver to minimize design complexity. Patents for the
calorie sensor have been filed worldwide; and the first US patent
should be issued this spring. MOI seeks a licensee or partner for
creating a final design, manufacturing, and marketing.

A medical product development company, MOI has developed
successful and creative technology (including the BMC Accu-Chek
Advantage glucose system). The company specializes in applying
sensor technology to the needs of the medical marketplace, and has
particular expertise in biosensors and heat flow sensors. MOI--whose
principals are Neil Szuminsky and Paul Pottgen--has licensed patents
to sensor technology that have become highly successful products in
the consumer health care market.

Civilian, free global demand for calorimeters/thermal sensors is
projected to total 406.9 mil. DM (about $203.4 million at the
exchange rate of 2.0 DM for the dollar), compared to 278.9 mil. DM
(about $139.4 million) in 1991, according to Prognos AG's Sensor
Technology 2000  report.

BSAC AND CDS-PENN STATE TO INVESTIGATE PZT FILMS FOR MEMS
STRUCTURES

The Berkeley Sensor & Actuator Center (BSAC, 510-643-6690)) at
the University of California, Berkeley and the Center for Dielectric
Studies (CDS) at Pennsylvania State University have been awarded
funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), under the Tie
Grant Industry/University/NSF Cooperative Research Program, to
conduct a mutually supportive research program on thin dielectric
and piezoelectric films applied to MEMS structures. The two-year
program is budgeted at $25,000 per year to each institution. The
principal investigators are Professor R.S. Muller at BSAC, and
Professors J.P Dougherty and Susan Trolier-McKinstry at CDS-Penn
State.

The two Centers will utilize their expertise to characterize films and
film preparation technologies from all sources, with the aim of
establishing reliable processes for producing dielectric and
piezoelectric films for MEMS applications. A key goal of the research
is to increase by at least an order of magnitude (a factor of 10) the

performance of piezoelectrically activated microdevices by
implementing highly active piezoelectric films--mainly PZT (lead-
zirconate-titanate)--in MEMS devices.

Fundamental work on surface micromachined devices, microsystems,
and components has been conducted at BSAC. Piezoelectric devices
have been built and integrated with silicon microelectronics,
primarily using thin-film zinc oxide (ZnO), a considerably less active

piezoelectric than PZT. Such zinc oxide devices--including
microminiature microphones and sound sources, acoustic wave
sensors, and fluid pumps--are expected to exhibit markedly
enhanced performance, as a result of substituting a highly active
piezoelectric material, such as PZT, for ZnO.

Recognizing the need for improved piezoelectric films, BSAC has
begun producing PZT thin films by using a state-of-the-art, one-
third-million-dollar advanced sputtering system. Moreover, other
fabrication facilities at UC Berkeley are starting to produce PZT; i.e.,
within the Department of Materials Science and Minerals Engineering
(under Professor T. Sands), and the Integrated Materials Laboratory.

CDS-Penn State has amassed a strong background in the preparation
and properties of PZT; and has conducted cutting-edge research in
the fabrication, and underlying physics of thin-film dielectric,
piezoelectric, and ferroelectric materials. CDS-Penn State researchers
have the background and equipment for extensive testing of film
materials.

In PZT Dielectrics for MEMS Applications --the proposal for the NSF
grant--the principal investigators note that piezoelectric and
ferroelectric films are finding an increasing number of applications in
the rapidly expanding MEMS field. Achieving a fundamental
understanding, reliability, and control over the fabrication of such
films is necessary to transform these advances into practical, reliable

engineering products. The need for piezoelectric film expertise is a
particular challenge for the US.

"In Japan, piezoelectrics have been incorporated into important
commercially successful products (starting with camera-focusing
drivers) for some years." Japanese researchers have focused on PZT
for microactuation, and have demonstrated considerable expertise
with the thin-film material. In the US, however, thin-film dielectrics
and piezoelectrics--especially PZT--are still primarily a focus area at

research laboratories. Via the tie-grant research, and the corporate

memberships of the two Centers, highly active piezoelectric, and high
quality dielectric, films for MEMs will be demonstrated to American
industry.

CDS has extensively studied piezoelectric materials--in bulk,
multilayer, thick- and thin-film forms--for their dielectric and
piezoelectric properties. The most useful piezoelectric materials are
ferroic nature--either ferroelectrics or closely related substances.
The intimate coupling between the piezoelectric and dielectric
properties in ferroics necessitates that both be completely
characterized to understand the materials and the physical
mechanisms responsible for their properties.

A central focus of the study is to understand the role of PZT film

microstructure, film composition, and electrode materials relative to
the observed response and charge storage in thin films of the
material. The dielectric and electromechanical properties of the films
will be studied using a wide variety of standard characterization
techniques, along with transmission electron microscopy and double
beam interferometry.

One of the open questions concerning the use of thin-film PZT sensors
and actuators is the degree to which non-180o domain walls
contribute to piezoelectric activity. In commercial (bulk) piezoelectric

actuators, typically up to half the strain obtained is associated with

domain-wall motion.

However, thin films are mechanically clamped by the substrate, and
generally have a considerably smaller grain size than bulk materials.
Since each of these factors can lead to clamping of the domain-wall

contribution to the dielectric and piezoelectric properties, it is
unclear what piezoelectric constants should be assumed for the film
in designing MEMS devices. The study will elucidate the role of
domain walls in controlling the piezoelectric properties of PZT thin
films, and provide a set of useful piezoelectric properties for MEMS
designers.

BSAC envisions a variety of surface micromachined devices
employing PZT films, including cantilevered actuators, microgrippers
with integral-force feedback, and accelerometers. The principal
investigators expect activating films of PZT to play a vital role that
cannot be matched by alternative piezoelectrics, such as ZnO. For
example, in-plane microgrippers presently in fabrication require the
large piezoelectric coupling offered by PZT for the desired deflection

amplitudes; and the sensitivity of piezoelectrically-based
accelerometers will be significantly bolstered by the large coupling

coefficients of PZT. Joel Nice, BSAC's manager, indicated that PZT

accelerometers would offer such advantages as increased sensitivity,
greater frequency range, and instantaneous readout.

SBD  projects that global revenues for automotive and non-
automotive silicon micromachined accelerometers will increase at a
27.2% compound annual rate to reach $169.5 million in 2000,
compared to about %50.9 million in 1995.

Worldwide revenues for piezoelectric accelerometers are projected at
$116.7 million in 1996, according to Frost & Sullivan's World
Acoustic and Vibration Sensors and Test Instruments Market  report
(727-30).

The US market for microactuators is projected to total about 2 million
ECU (approximately $2.6 million at the current exchange rate) in
1995 and 30 million ECU (about $38.7 million) in 2000, according to
sgt Sensor Consulting Dr. Guido Tschulena's (Wehrheim, Germany,

++49-6081-56168) Micromechanics  report.

SENSORS AND ACTUATORS ARE BECOMING THE SOUL OF THE
MACHINE

The application of sensors and actuators is becoming increasingly
important for controlling machines and plants, and is determining
the internal competition of machine building companies, according to
a detailed investigation of the current state and key trends in the use
of sensors and actuators in the German and Dutch machine building
industry.

The study, conducted by sgt Sensor Consulting Dr. Guido Tschulena,
scrutinized six selected sectors of the machine building industry in
Germany and The Netherlands: agricultural and horticultural
machines; textile machinery; lifting and handling equipment; wood,
furniture, and paper machinery; and packing and packaging
machinery.

Electronics control and sensors/actuators accounted for 14.5% and
3.65%, respectively, of the total selling value of the machines. The
share of the total machine value attributed to sensors and actuators
for each machine building segment is: packaging machinery-3.3%;
lifting and handling equipment-4.5% (floor conveyor and stock
systems-12.8%; passenger, mass, and part loads transport-2.1%);
textile machinery-5.6%; woodworking and processing machinery-
3.4%; machinery for food and beverages-1.9%; and agricultural
machinery-2.3%.

Information--including the degree of automation in the selected
sectors, and the specific profit for the machine builders--has been
gathered from 122 companies, representing 253 machine products.
The sensors that are commercially available at present only partially
fulfill the product requirements, such as quality, reliability, and
freedom from maintenance.

The investigation demonstrates that the use of sensors and actuators
is enhancing the economy of machines and plants and boosting the
quality of fabricated goods. The high technical standard of the
machine builder is reflected in their ability to integrate appropriate
sensors and actuators into the machines. Moreover, the utilization of
sensors and actuators provides a powerful tool for machine builders
to differentiate their products from those of their competitors.

Figure 1 shows the percentage share of various types of sensors that
are used in the German- and Dutch-built machines, based on the
responses of 122 companies, encompassing 253 machines. The share
of the various types of actuators used in such machines is:
micromechanical-5%; electric-80%; pneumatic-51%; mechanical-33%;
and hydraulic-36%.

The investigation was conducted for Centrum voor Micro-Elektronica.

NANO-ENGINEERED MATERIALS IMPROVE SENSOR PERFORMANCE

Sensor technology can significantly benefit from nano-engineered
materials (i.e., materials whose grain sizes have been precision
engineered at scales of less than 100 nanometers, a shown in Figure
2), notes Dr. Tapesh Yadav, president of Nanomaterials Research
Corporation (NRC, Tucson, AZ, 520-294-7115). Such materials exhibit
a very high interfacial area and a unique blend of physical and
electrochemical properties.

When their grain size is reduced below 10 nanometers, conventional
materials exhibit unique properties because quantum confinement
effects increasingly become dominant. The confinement effects
enable a blend of mechanical properties that simplify and accelerate
sensor fabrication. Moreover, the nano-engineering of sensors allows
for miniaturization to sub-micron levels. The high interfacial area,
unique electrochemical properties, confinement effects, and
packaging advantages of nano materials offer an opportunity for
engineering sensors in general, particularly chemical sensors, that
provide substantially improved sensitivity, selectivity, response
time, stability, and reliability.

Under NASA and ARPA sponsorship, a team of scientists at NRC and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is developing a
range of nano-engineered sensors (NANOSENSORS(TM)) for industrial,
domestic, and medical applications. The effort has already
demonstrated several sensors with superior performance. For
example, nano-engineered oxygen sensors have been prepared from
a ceramic composite.

Such oxygen sensors are easier to prepare than conventional oxygen
sensors because of the ease in which the ceramic layer can be made
more fully dense without losing its interface area. Nano-engineered
oxygen sensors can operate at temperatures of less than 500 degrees
C (which is nearly half the temperature required by conventional
oxygen sensors), and exhibit enhanced selectivity, stability, and
response time. Furthermore, nano-engineered hydrogen sensors have
been found to exhibit an order of magnitude higher sensitivity.

Applications for nano-engineered sensors that are under
investigation include automobiles, neonatal care, industrial process

monitoring, and domestic safety. In automobiles, low-temperature
oxygen sensing can facilitate more rapid control of engine
combustion during cold-engine ignition; and oxygen sensors with
enhanced stability and sensitivity can help control optimal
fuel/oxygen stoichiometry and reduce NOx emissions. Nano-
engineered humidity sensors can help provide auto-control of
humidity inside the passenger cabin.

By utilizing lower energy consuming, less intrusive, more sensitive

nano-engineered sensors, health care quality can be bolstered, while
reducing costs in intensive care units and for premature babies. In
the industrial area, NRC sensors are particularly suited for moderate

temperature (RT to 700 degrees C) process monitoring in the
chemical, metallurgical, and utility industries. In addition, nano-
engineered sensors can enable more reliable technology with
reduced false alarms for domestic monitoring of carbon monoxide
and VOCs.

To meet the anticipated market and product development
requirements for nano-engineered sensors, NRC is also scaling-up its

patent-pending synthesis process for bulk producing the precursors
necessary for preparing nano-engineered sensors. The process is
capable of producing precision distributed, 1 to 100 nanometer scale
powders of sensor precursors (ceramics, metals, intermetallics,
composites). The effort is sponsored in part by NASA, the DOE, the US
Army, and the NSF. Moreover, several leading corporations have
initiated discussions with NRC regarding focused, milestone-based
strategic alliances for meeting their anticipated needs for next-
generation sensors.

Revenues for the US market for automotive lambda oxygen sensors
are forecast to increase at a 20% compound annual rate to reach $465
million in 1998, from $156 million in 1992, according to Frost &
Sullivan's Industrial Gas Sensor Markets  report (2661-40). Revenues
for 1996 are pegged at $385 million.

Revenues for the US zirconia gas sensor market are predicted to
expand at a 10% compound annual rate to total $43.1 million in 1998,
compared to $24.5 million in 1992. Revenues for 1996 are placed at
$35.8 million.

In 1996, the projected industry distribution of the total US zirconia
oxygen sensor market is: power generation-$9.1 million;

chemical/petrochemical-$12.2 million; metals/steel-$3.1 million;
commercial (office buildings)/health care-$4.1 million; and "other"
(including glass, ceramic, and semiconductor)-$7.3 million.

Revenues for the Western European market for lambda oxygen
sensors are forecast to advance at a 23.5% average annual rate to
reach $347.7 million in 1998, from $97.9 million in 1992, according
to Frost & Sullivan's European Gas Sensors  market report (1902-40).
Revenues for 1996 are put at $150.9 million. The data
overwhelmingly refers to closed-loop engine control application for
such sensors in vehicles equipped with catalytic converters.

Unit shipments of lambda oxygen sensors in Western Europe are
anticipated to rise at a 21.5% average annual rate to total about
24,200,000 in 1998, as opposed to about 7,500,000 in 1992. Unit
shipments for 1996 are projected at about 11,600,000.

Revenues for the Western European zirconia gas sensor market are
expected to increase at a 2.4% average annual rate to reach $17.2
million in 1998, from $14.9 million in 1992. Revenues for 1996 are
pegged at $16.5 million.

Unit shipments for the Western European zirconia gas sensor market
are predicted to rise at a 4.5% average annual rate to total 8,670,000
in 1998, from 6,650,000 in 1992. Unit shipments in 1996 are placed
at 7,945,000.

In 1996, the projected end-user industry distribution of the total
revenues for the Western European zirconia gas sensor market is (all
figures are rounded): chemicals-$2.4 million; petrochemicals-$2.7
million; power generation-$4.0 million; steel-$1.4 million; heat
treatment-$1.7 million; HVAC-$0.1 million; and "other"-$4.3 million.
Such zirconia gas sensors are primarily used for combustion
monitoring applications, where they are configured as fixed
installations for heavy-duty boilers and furnaces, or used in
fixed/portable combustion efficiency test equipment.

Global demand for automotive oxygen sensors is projected to total
$745 million in 1999, compared to $341 million in 1994,
representing a 16.9% compound annual growth rate, according to BIS
Strategic Decisions' (Luton, England) latest Automotive Sensor
Demand Forecast Market Report.

SBD  forecasts that global revenues for solid electrolyte/Lambda
automotive oxygen sensors will increase at a 5.8% compound annual
rate to stand at $675 million in 2000, compared to about $480
million in 1994. The growth over the forecast period will be
primarily driven by California and federal OBD (On-Board
Diagnostics)-II requirements necessitating that the vehicle self-
diagnose/monitor the hydrocarbon conversion efficiency of the
catalyst system, which began to take effect in new emissions control
systems during the 1994 model year.

The automotive industry is now mainly using a dual oxygen sensor
system (rather than a single oxygen sensor) to diagnose the catalyst's

deterioration and monitor its hydrocarbon performance. However,
the dual oxygen sensor method has limitations for addressing
increasingly stringent automotive emissions monitoring
requirements, since it essentially measures the catalyst's oxygen
storage capacity, rather than catalyst hydrocarbon conversion
efficiency. By circa the end of the decade, the growth in the
automotive oxygen sensor market is expected to be negatively
impacted by competition from other gas sensors that are capable of
more directly monitoring low levels of key (non-oxygen) exhaust
gases to diagnose the catalyst's efficiency.

INNOVATIVE SENSORS COULD REFRESH AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS

Hokuriku Electric Industry Co. (Toyama-ken, Japan, ++81-0764-67-
1111) is focusing on developing high-performance composite sensors,
including a 30 mm square module comprised of a high-density
ceramic substrate and a sensor capable of measuring temperature,
air current, radiation, and humidity. The IC substrate functions as the
signal processing circuit for the module that could be used in air
conditioner systems. The company, which uses various technologies
to promote its sensor business, also has other single-unit composite
sensors that measure temperature, humidity, and dew formation.

Yamatake-Honeywell (Tokyo, Japan, ++81-03-3486-2031) has
developed a radiation temperature sensor for measuring
temperature in perimeter zones that are affected by light radiated
from the sun. The device is designed to measure radiated heat from a
remote location (ceiling) to form a monitoring system for an air
conditioner controller used to adjust the temperature to a
comfortable level. The sensor, which sells for 30,000 yen per unit
(about $296.40 at the current exchange rate), can be attached to the
ceiling, as well placed in open space where there are no columns or
walls.

Civilian, open global demand for temperature sensors used in the
area of heating, air conditioning, and ventilating technology is
projected to reach 353 mil. DM (about $176.5 million) in 2000, from
177.6 mil. DM (about $88.8 million) in 1991, according to Prognos
AG's Sensor Technology 2000  report.

The civilian, free Japanese market for temperature sensors used for
climate technology in the building and safety area is forecast to total
66.9 mil. DM (about $44.6 million at the exchange rate of 1.50 DM for
the dollar) in 1996 and 89.5 mil. DM (about $59.7 million) in 2001,
according to Intechno Consulting AG's (Basel, Switzerland) Sensor
Markets 2001  report. An updated version of the report is now
available.

SBD  estimates that global revenues for infrared temperature sensors
(excluding IR thermal imaging) totaled about $102 million in 1995.

ALCOHOL SENSORS INTERNATIONAL COULD BE READY TO TAKE IGNITION
INTERLOCK MARKET BY STORM

     The market for sensors that disable a car's ignition if drivers
have too much to drink continues to grow, and a new company wants into
this robust business.  Islandia, N.Y.-based Alcohol Sensors
International Ltd. topped off several years of intensive R&D with an
initial public offering of its stock in mid-November, and already has
seen its market value double.  From an initial price of 7 on NASDAQ,
ASI's stock price had risen to 12 5/8 at our deadline.
     The frenzied reception by investors is no surprise to ASI
President and CEO Robert Whitney, who told SENSOR BUSINESS NEWS his
firm's technological superiority should help ASI rake in $50 million
in sales during 1996.
     ASI claims its sensor, called the Sens-O-Lock, is superior to
competing products since it never needs to be recalibrated and is
easier to use because of its unique, open-chamber technology, which
requires no direct mouth contact to take a breath sample and test for
the presence of alcohol.
     "There is no question we lead the way.  We've spent tons of time
and money for the best mousetrap in the world," said Whitney.
     But the chief executive of LifeSafer Interlock Inc., of
Cincinnati, Ohio, which makes a competing product, questioned the
credibility of a product that never is checked for accuracy once it is
installed.  He said sensors used for such critical tasks ought to be
verified regularly, as is his firm's LifeSafer.
     "I wouldn't want the liability associated with it," said
LifeSafer President Richard Freund.  "I think that's a real big issue. 
It exposes a publicly traded company to a lot of liability problems."

  ...State Laws Create Market

     In as many as 32 states, authorities have the option to require a
driver convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI) to have an alcohol
sensor installed in his or her vehicle as a condition of retaining
their driver's license.
     Once the vehicle begins moving, the devices ask randomly for
another sample.  If the driver fails, the unit will flash the
vehicle's external lights and sound the horn if the vehicle is not
brought to a stop within a brief period.
     ASI also wants to sell the device to parents and others who want
a means of preventing their families from driving drunk.
     In all cases, the device will be installed by specially trained
technicians who work for firms that install car alarm systems, Whitney
said.  Drivers who use the device under court order will return to the
technician regularly to enable authorities to keep tabs on whether the
system has detected alcohol and how often it has been used.
     Auto safety experts vouch for the effectiveness of the devices in
keeping alcohol-impaired people from operating their vehicles.  "We
support ignition interlocks if they are set up properly," said John
Undeland, spokesman for the American Automobile Association's
Washington, D.C.-area division.  "The only downside, if there is one,
is that once the system is in place, it doesn't change people [who
have alcohol problems].  They still drink, but they just can't drive."
     Carl Ekstein, vice president of marketing and business
development for Rockville, Md.-based Life Sciences Corp., which
installs and maintains LifeSafer units in several mid-Atlantic states,
agreed.  "These devices are highly effective in stopping repeat
offenders.  Our experience is that less than 1 percent of people using
the sensor are rearrested for DWI," Ekstein told us.
     Whitney told us ASI plans to market the Sens-O-Lock in two
versions.  Equipped with a data logger, the device will be used by
people who have been ordered by authorities to do so.  Whitney said
the market in just the United States is perhaps $300 million per year. 

  ...Voluntary Market Expected to Be Larger

     ASI charges about $600 per year for each data logger-equipped
device.  But officials said they expect to realize the majority of
their revenue from sales of the Sens-O-Lock to municipalities and
businesses for use on their vehicle fleets, and from retail sales of a
simpler, Sens-O-Lock stripped of the data recording capabilities and
priced at about $429.
     "We see this as going into every school bus, locomotive and
subway train," said ASI Director of Marketing Frank Savarese.
     But Ekstein questioned ASI's ability to crack the voluntary
market.  "I've already tried it and I'm not deluged with requests. 
It's hard to get enough cases for market research," he told us.
     Freund said the Sens-O-Lock's positioning as a product the
consumer can have installed and never have to adjust could be a
problem.  "I understand their motivation [in wanting to sell to
consumers]," he said.  "We have looked at the possibility of a simple
product, but if we put it out for the consumer market, we would
require that it be periodically recalibrated.  We have some voluntary
users, but they are a small percentage.  We focus on DWI offenders."
     ASI also may have overstated the size of the market for ignition
interlock devices, Freund said.  "The market is 10 years old, and at
the end of 1995 about 20,000 people had the devices in their cars," he
told us.  "That's about a $15 million market, and we have half of it."
     ASI's Whitney remains undeterred and said that all told, the
worldwide market for vehicle alcohol sensors could one day top the
billion-dollar figure.
     In addition to making a big splash in the market for alcohol
sensors, ASI hopes to expand into sensing other substances, although
Whitney declined to provide details.  "We will be a major player in
the sensor world," he predicted.

AFTER A YEAR OF TURMOIL AND GROWING PAINS, SENSORMATIC WANTS A CALMER
1996

     Sensormatic Electronics Corp., buffeted last year by
improprieties in its accounting practices and by disappointing sales
following a banner year in 1994, hopes new President and Chief
Operating Officer Robert Vanourek--who joined Sensormatic in October
1995--will improve its fortunes this year.
     The Boca Raton, Fla.-based company's stock price on the New York
Stock Exchange fell by more than half during the second half of 1995,
to 17 3/8 at our deadline.  The stock tumbled in mid-December after
officials told shareholders the company would take an unspecified
charge as part of a restructuring effort to strengthen results.
     "The company last year had a lot of trouble attributable to its
phenomenal success and growth," said a source close to Sensormatic. 
"The company's growth outpaced its infrastructure.  Things have
happened so rapidly that they really weren't able to put the checks
and balances in place."
     Officials would not specify what steps they plan to take to
rejuvenate the company, but it is likely the company will try to
improve its financial recordkeeping, keep close tabs on expenses, and
boost productivity.  Executives said it was too early to say how much
the changes would cost, but the sour response from Wall Street to the
restructuring announcement suggests investors remain somewhat
skeptical of the company.

  ...Checkpoint's Presence Formidable

     Although Sensormatic counts among its customers most of the
world's largest retailers, it continues to face a strong challenge
from arch rival Checkpoint Systems Inc., of Thorofare, N.J.
     "We have lost the momentum in drug stores and there is aggressive
competition in the food market," Vanourek acknowledged to shareholders
Dec. 14, "but we will not concede any market to any competitor." 
     Checkpoint officials said their firm is poised to control about
75 percent of the drug store theft control market.  Overall sales at
Checkpoint grew more than 60 percent for the nine months ended Sept.
24, 1995, even as sales at Sensormatic were soft.
     Expect Sensormatic to continue its attack on Checkpoint as it
tries to solidify its dominant position in loss prevention and renew
its commitment to the retail market.  A possible tactic could be
emphasizing the advantages of Sensormatic's magnetic technology
compared with Checkpoint's radio frequency-based equipment, which has
been called unreliable by some critics.
     "Sensormatic will hit Checkpoint hard over the issue of how its
technology can be fooled," our source told us.  "Sensormatic is
certainly going to use that as ammunition."

SENSOR FIRMS WORK TO BUILD BLOOD SUGAR SENSORS FOR DIABETICS

     Several sensor companies are racing to give diabetics relief from
the daily finger-pricking required to monitor their blood glucose
levels and to enable better management of the troublesome disease.
     San Diego-based Synthetic Blood International Inc. told SENSOR
BUSINESS NEWS tests on laboratory animals indicate its implantable
biosensor is nearing the point where it does not upset the immune
system and lasts long enough to be practical.  The device, similar in
some respects to a pacemaker, would be placed in the stomach or the
abdomen and could go a year or longer between battery changes, said
Synthetic's Alan Brunson.  It would provide measurements as often as
every seven minutes.
     Meanwhile, MiniMed Inc., of Sylmar, Calif., reported it plans to
start a clinical trial of its glucose sensor by late this year.  The
sensor is designed to be inserted subcutaneously by diabetics.  An
alarm would signal abnormal blood sugar levels.
     "I don't think people know how bad people who are diabetics have
it," said Synthetic Blood President and CEO Gerald Schlatter.  "It is
really a different way of life.  We've done market research on this
product and we feel that the product would be very well received."
     Synthetic Blood believes the market for blood glucose sensors
could hit a billion dollars or more.  The company hopes to partner
with a larger company to commercialize its technology, and plans human
trials by the end of 1996.
     "We're versatile and we can correct mistakes easily.  But
companies like ours can have a tough time raising R&D money.  Larger
companies in biotechnology look for small companies like ours.  We've
had various conversations with pacemaker and drug companies,"
Schlatter told us.

  ...Biocontrol Technology Points Angry Finger at the Press

     The announcements from Synthetic Blood and MiniMed come as
Pittsburgh-based Biocontrol Technology Inc. publicly complained about
media coverage of its Diasensor noninvasive blood glucose sensor,
which has been in the FDA approval process for more than a year.  The
company already is selling the device abroad and said it expects to
begin U.S. production of the sensor this month, but Biocontrol
officials appear to be worried the company is seen in a negative
light.
     The firm issued a sharply worded news release urging potential
customers to lambast reporters for criticizing the product's large
size and $8,000 cost, and for raising questions about its reliability.
     "Biocontrol pledges that we will continue to focus on getting the
Diasensor...through the process necessary to market it and that we
will not be stopped by any negative or uninformed sources who would
prefer, for known and unknown reasons, to have us fail," the release
said.  "...It is very difficult to believe that the timing [of the
criticism] is simply a matter of coincidence."
     A Biocontrol spokeswoman did not return phone calls from SENSOR
BUSINESS NEWS to discuss the issue.  
     (Synthetic Blood's Schlatter said he does not anticipate
difficulty when the time comes to get FDA approval to market the
company's product.)
     In a related matter, Biocontrol and Diasense Inc., which jointly
have developed the Diasensor, said they planned to combine their
operations sometime in the first quarter of this year.  Officials said
the merger was in the financial best interest of the Diasensor
project.  (Biocontrol Technology, 412/ 429-0673; MiniMed, Synthetic

SIEMENS ROLLS OUT SENSORS TO DISABLE PASSENGER AIRBAG IF CHILD SEAT
PRESENT

     In spite of their proven ability to save lives, front passenger
airbags pose a threat to young children.  When the airbag deploys, it
can injure or kill a child riding in a car safety seat, say experts.  
     A solution is for the child to ride in the back seat, but some
vehicles, such as pick-ups, do not have rear seats.  In any case, many
parents feel more comfortable with their children beside them as they
drive.
     Siemens Automotive Corp. believes it has a better answer.  The
Auburn Hills, Mich.-based unit of German multinational Siemens AG last
month introduced a sensor designed to deactivate the passenger airbag
if a specially equipped child safety seat is directly in its path.
     As an added benefit, the system also will turn off the airbag if
the seat is empty, saving the considerable cost of replacing the
airbag in the event of a collision that otherwise would cause it to
activate.
     Beginning late this year, 1997-badged cars from two unnamed
European luxury carmakers will come with the sensors as standard
equipment, accounting for some 600,000 vehicles worldwide, said
Siemens spokesman David Ladd.  
     Chrysler, Ford and General Motors also are "enthusiastic," he
said.  The cost to the automakers will be under $40 per vehicle, Ladd
told us.
     The system uses pressure-sensitive foil within the seat to detect
weight greater than 25 pounds.  Sensors at either side of the seat
look for devices on specially-equipped safety seats and will disable
the airbag if the seat is rear-facing or at an angle.
     Ladd said safety seat makers in Europe already have agreed to put
the equipment on their seats, and U.S. makers are likely to follow
suit.  The modifications cost boost the seat prices by about 5
percent, he said.
     Within a few years, other sensing systems--perhaps based on
optical or radar technology--should appear and eliminate the need for
specially equipped child seats, Ladd said.  Today, such alternative
systems are considered too unreliable and are cost-prohibitive, he
told us.
     Ladd said Siemens will discourage retrofitting existing vehicles
or child safety seats with the technology.  "The strategy is to
install the equipment at the point of manufacture," said Ladd.  "It's
more reliable."
     Some 1996 vehicles will come equipped with a key-operated switch
to disable the front passenger airbag, but whether people will use the
switch properly is questionable, experts say.  (Siemens Automotive,
810/253-1000.)

FIRST TECHNOLOGY POSTS HEALTHY GAINS

     Sales and profit figures from a key supplier of fuel cut-off
sensors and other safety products to many of the world's automakers
underscore the importance of the automotive industry as a hot market
for sensor makers.
     Southwood, England-based First Technology PLC reported sales of
$28 million for the six-month period that ended Oct. 31, 1995, up a
healthy 10.2 percent.  Profits grew to almost $5.1 million, a gain of
some 16 percent.  The company predicts strong sales in 1996 even if
worldwide demand for cars falls, as its safety products are installed
on a greater proportion of new vehicles.
     Much of the growth is a result of the company's growing
domination of the market for the fuel cut-off sensors, which disengage
a car's fuel system in the event of a crash, said Chairman Fred
Westlake.  In November, First Technology opened a factory in eastern
France to increase its capacity to produce the sensors (SEN, Dec. 6,
1995, p. 3).  The company also has facilities in the United States. 
(First Technology, Phone: 011/01344/22322.)


S. Himmelstein Rolls Out High-capacity Torquemeters
     S. Himmelstein and Co., of Hoffman Estates, Ill., introduced a
series of high-capacity, non-contact, strain gauge torquemeters.  The
sensors measure the torque, speed, power and efficiency of large
rotating equipment.  They are available in capacities ranging from
750,000 to 4 million pound-inches.  (S. Himmelstein, Steven Tveter,
708/843-3300.)

Breed Technologies Gets ISO 9001 and QS 9000 Certification
     Breed Technologies Inc., a Lakeland, Fla.-based maker of crash
sensors and airbag systems for automakers worldwide, reported it has
received ISO 9001 and QS 9000 quality assurance certification from the
British Standards Institution.  The QS 9000 program identifies auto
suppliers that meet certain standards for quality management, and
recognition by the program is likely to be crucial by 1997.  (Breed
Technologies, Lisa Spinazzola, 941/668-6464.)

ISA Merges With International Division
     The International Society for Measurement and Control (ISA) and
its international subsidiary have dropped the distinction between
themselves effective Jan. 1.  ISA, headquartered in Research Triangle
Park, N.C., created the international division in 1986 to handle its
growing international membership base, but delegates recently voted to
combine ISA's North American and international operations and create
an International Development Council instead.  ISA sponsors an annual
conference and trade show that attracts hundreds of sensor,
instrumentation and software firms.  (ISA, 919/549-8411.)

Sensotec Rolls Out Two Sensors
     Sensotec Inc., of Columbus, Ohio, released two new sensors to
measure static and dynamic displacement.  The units have free,
unguided armatures and are ideal for use in limited-space, remote or
hazardous locations, according to the firm.  The sensors cost $136
each.  (Sensotec, 800/848-6564.)

HPS Leases New Building
     MKS Instruments Inc.'s Boulder, Colo.-based HPS Division, said it
leased a 13,000-square-foot facility to expand its production of
SensaVac vacuum gauges.  The new building is next door to the
company's present location and should help HPS provide faster service
and a broader product line, the company said.  The SensaVac line
currently includes standard and convection Pirani gauges and hot and
cold cathode ionization gauges.  (HPS, 800/345-1967.) 

Arizona Instrument Moves Ahead With New Technologies
     Arizona Instrument Corp., a maker of equipment for quality
control, industrial control and environmental monitoring, said it has
completed development of a gold film micro-sensor to be used in its
next-generation toxic gas monitors.  The Phoenix, Ariz.-based firm
also said it has made progress on its new line of moisture analyzers,
which will be sold under the name Computrac and will be targeted at
the titration market, estimated to be $60 million worldwide.  Both
product lines are scheduled for commercial availability at the end of
1996.  (Arizona Instrument, Scott Carter, 602/470-1414.)

Toshiba Shows Samples of New Shock Sensor
     Japan's Toshiba Corp. late last month began shipping samples of a
new shock sensor, according to the Comline news service.  The sensor
uses half the power of its predecessor and is just a third of the
size.  Samples are available for 300 yen, or about $3, each. 
(Toshiba, Phone: 011/03/3457-2148.)

New Accelerometers Are Less Costly to Repair, Company Says
     A pair of piezoelectric accelerometers from San Juan Capistrano,
Calif.-based Endevco Corp. are the industry's first such devices with
a completely replaceable subassembly, the company said.  The devices
can measure vibration in three orthogonal axes and are considerably
less expensive to fix than competing products, which must be entirely
replaced if one axis is damaged, according to 
Endevco.  (Endevco, Anthony Chu, 714/493-8181.)

Honeywell Buys General Signal's Sensor Business
     Honeywell Inc. said it has agreed to buy the sensor,
instrumentation and measurement business of General Signal Corp.'s
now-defunct Leeds & Northrup unit for an undisclosed sum.  Honeywell,
based in Minneapolis, will fold the business, which includes assets
related to analytical devices, controllers and temperature and
humidity sensors, into its existing industrial control business.  The
sale bolsters Honeywell's position as a supplier to the process and
discrete manufacturing industries.  It also is the final step in
Stamford, Conn.-based General Signal's dismantlement of the Leeds &
Northrup division and will help the firm reduce its debt load. 
(General Signal, Nino Fernandez, 203/329-4320; Honeywell, Meta
Gaertnier, 612/951-0773.)

Ohio Firm Expands Data Acquisition Offerings
     Cleveland, Ohio-based IOtech Inc., announced it has expanded its
DBK series of signal conditioning and expansion products for personal
computer-based data acquisition.  The firm's new eight-channel relay
contact output card is designed for industrial applications that
require power signal switching.  It lists for $295.  (IOtech, 216/439-
4091.)

U.S. Carmaker Buys FiberChem Sensor System
     Las Vegas-based FCI Environmental Inc., a unit of FiberChem Inc.,
said a Big Three auto manufacturer has purchased one of its CMS-5000
continuous monitoring systems to monitor storm water discharge in
accordance with federal regulations.  FCI declined to identify the
purchaser, but officials said they expect to sell more of the systems
to it during 1996.  The sale is an indication that its environmental
sensor technology has applications beyond the oil industry, where FCI
has realized most of its sales.  (Liviakis Financial Communications
Inc., 916/448-6084.)

New Photoelectric Sensors Use Lasers for Extended Range
     A new series of photoelectric sensors from Banner Engineering
Corp. are the world's first retroreflective laser sensors, according
to the Minneapolis-based company.  The Omni-Beam sensors contain a
Class II laser diode and achieve sensing ranges up to 225 feet, and
sport LEDs for power, signal and output.  The laser beam is visible,
simplifying the process of aligning the sensor.  (Banner Engineering,
Floyd Schneider, 612/544-3164.)

Centronic's New Silicon Photodiode Eliminates Distortion
     Newbury Park, Calif.-based Centronic Inc. unveiled a large area
silicon photodiode designed for easy insertion into standard "vector"
board PCBs.  The QD100-5T-COW, eliminates distortion, light loss and
crosstalk, and is aimed at customers involved in laser beam position
detection, target acquisition, machine controls and encoders,
officials said.  It is priced at $37.50 in quantities of fewer than
100.  (Centronic, Yuval Tamari, 800/700-2088.)

CAR BUYERS BECOMING AWARE OF SIDE-IMPACT AIRBAGS; SOME ARE DEMANDING
THEM ALREADY

     There are indications people shopping for high-end automobiles
may begin to expect side-impact airbags by late this year.  That is
when Cadillac and Mercedes-Benz will join Volvo in offering the safety
systems as standard equipment on all their models.
     For 1996, several Mercedes models offer the side airbags.  Most
people do not yet know about side airbags, so few purchasing decisions
are likely to hinge on their presence for now, said Len Logue, who
sells Mercedes vehicles in Silver Spring, Md.
     The situation at Volvo is different.  The Swedish automaker--long
associated with "safety" in car buyers' minds--was the first
manufacturer to offer the equipment, and an official said side airbags
are growing increasingly important to prospective customers.
     "People with one- and two-year-old Volvos want to trade their
cars in for cars with the side airbags," Volvo District Sales Manager
Robert Brissie told us at the Washington, D.C., International Auto
Show last week.
     That could be a sign that well-heeled car buyers are beginning to
conclude that side airbags add a significant measure of safety, even
as they realize widespread availability is still in the future.  Once
several manufacturers offer the technology as standard equipment,
others are likely to follow quickly, in a manner similar to the way
front airbags proliferated after automakers discovered many buyers
consider them essential.

  ...Truck Buyers See it Differently 

     Even as some luxury car buyers are eager to buy cars equipped
with the latest safety gear, it appears demand for the equipment
depends, in part, on perception, perhaps even more than on hard facts. 
One salesman told us people looking for pickup trucks are sometimes
convinced the size of the vehicle makes airbags unnecessary.
     "In the past year, I don't think one customer has asked me if the
vehicles have airbags," he said.  Some buyers inquire about safety
features after the sale, he said, underscoring the dichotomy between
buyers of different types of vehicles when it comes to safety issues.
     Still, federal regulations will compel at least a driver's side
airbag to be installed in all trucks sold in the United States within
the next few years.
     All passenger vehicles will come with two front airbags standard
not long afterward.  The burgeoning demand for airbags--front systems
as well as side-impact units, is good news for airbag makers Bosch,
Siemens, TRW and Breed Technologies.

FROM THE EDITOR


Rich Heintz, a new member of our staff, compiled a lot of
information about the various segments of the SMT equipment
market for this issue.  We appreciate the help that all of  you,
who have been contacted, have given Rich.  Gathering
information can be a hard job because people in the industry
don't see the payback to themselves for taking the time to talk. 
Rich is a good interviewer, and thorough, which means that
talking to him often helps a person clarify his or her own
thinking about the nature of the market and the dynamics
within the market.  Like any good dialogue, a conversation
with Rich can increase your enthusiasm and your knowledge
of the market.  We do not just take information when we talk
to people; We try to give it back  as good as we got it.  

In talking to manufacturers in the electronics industry, we get
the feeling they do not expect 1996 to be quite the year 1995
was.  In particular, people don't seem to think the U.S.
personal computer industry can sustain the growth of last year. 
We're not saying things look gloomy, only lest robust.  We
believe, though, that there are some hopeful signs in this
market, especially for people working with the expertise and
equipment devoted to SMT.  While the market for portable
computers has remained more sluggish than experts predicted
a couple years ago, we still feel that the potential for this
market is great.  The big factor, we feel, is price.  We kept
hearing that prices on portables were going to come down at
the end of last year.  Acer's entrance into the U.S. market was
supposed to help this.  It did not happen.  If it happens this
year, portables could cause the entire PC market to perform
better than expected.  In addition, the European market for
PCs will probably be better this year than last.  Companies
able to take advantage of this market will benefit.

The other area that we've been keeping our eyes on, which we
think has good potential for SMT people in 1996, is the
wireless communications industry.  Some people are saying
this market will not do as well in 1996 as it did in 1995, but
we're of the opposite opinion.  Much work with high-
frequency components, along with the development of two
standards--code division multiple access (CDMA) and
personal communication services (PCS)--, promise, we feel, to
help the 1996 U.S. market for wireless devices outperform the
1995 market.  The Yankee Group (Boston, MA) projects
cellular growth will be up from $70 million in 1995 to around
$100 million in 1996.  The cellular partnership formed by
Nynex, Bell Atlantic, U.S. West and AirTouch
Communications placed a $600 million order for new phones
from Motorola Inc., Nokia Oy of Finland and Audiovox Corp. 
This represents three million analog cellular phones over a
one-year period.  PCS carriers will generate approximately
$10 billion in annual revenues by the year 2000, and $18
billion by 2005 according to Economic and Management
Consultants International (New York, NY).  These new
networks will translate into multi-billion dollar expenditures to
infrastructure providers such as AT&T, Motorola, Northern
Telecom, Ericsson and the many contract manufacturers who
work with these larger companies to produce subassemblies. 
While the U.S. market will be good for wireless
communications, developing countries, such as China will be
very good targets for wireless sales because of the lack of
traditional communications infrastructure.  Now, with the
development of wireless equipment, some experts are
predicting that this traditional type of communications
infrastructure will never be installed in developing countries.


Wireless, or non-tethered, communications devices range from
cordless telephones to mobile cellular phones to fashion-
coordinated pagers.  The big news in cordless phones is the
migration of digital systems operating in the 900-MHz range
using spread-spectrum technology.  Manufacturers expect to
ship more than a million such units by midyear.  In the United
States, cellular telephone systems are beginning to migrate to
digital technology, but there appears to be a few more years of
life remaining in analog mobile phone service.  Cellular
Digital Packet Data is just now being introduced as a way to
piggyback digital data onto existing voice-band systems. 
Growth for analog cellular will remain strong throughout the
year.

Somewhere between full-blown cellular systems and in-house
cordless phones, is Personal Communications Services (PCS),
which caused a big stir last year when the Federal
Communications Commission held auctions to sell spectrum
space in major cities.  During 1996, PCS systems will finish
their initial build-outs and begin offering services that compete
with both cellular and wire-line telephony.  In Europe, the
digital cellular system called GSM (Global System for Mobile
Communications) is already a hit.  Well over one million GSM
handsets have already been sold.

In South America, Africa, Asia, and many island countries,
cellular and PCS phones are the only solution because an
infrastructure of wired communications services does not
exist.  Almost half of all new sales of two-way wireless
equipment will be in these areas.  These wireless systems can
be set up quickly and work well.

BULL NAMES BENDER V.P.


Bull Electronics (Boston, MA) named Louis P. Bender its new
V.P. of Marketing & Business Development.  Bender's most
recent position was a V.P. of Worldwide Sales for Avex.  In
his new position, Bender will have full responsibility for all
Bull's external sales and marketing efforts, especially on the
company's aggressive efforts to grow its high-end circuit board
business for regional, national, and multi-national customers. 
Bull's president, Brian Byrne, said:  "Louis has outstanding
skills and experience, both as an executive in the contract
manufacturing business and in a variety of senior marketing,
sales, and business development positions.  We are very
pleased to have him on our team and expect him to make a
rapid impact on our growth objectives."

Next month we'll talk to Bender about what enticed him away
from a top position at Avex in America's southern
manufacturing belt.

of Hewlett-Packard's PCB facility in Loveland, CO, reported
2Q96 sales grew 35% to $33.6 million from $24.8 million in
2Q95.  Net income for the quarter ended 11/25/96 rose to $2.9
million, or 45 per share, from $2.6 million, 42 per share, in
the same quarter a year ago.  Merix also reported six-month
sales rose 29% to $61.3 million versus $47.6 million during
the same period a year ago.  Net for the six months was $5.6
million, or 86, versus $4.6 million, or 75.

SOLECTRON 1Q SALES UP 36%, NET 50%


Solectron Corp., who completed its acquisition of Hewlett-
Packard's PCB assembly operation in Boeblingen, Germany, 
reported 1Q96 sales grew 36% to $691 million from $506.7
million in 1Q95.  Net income for the quarter ended Nov. 25,
1995, which was up 50% to $27.3 million, or 52 cents per
fully diluted share, from $18.2 million, or 38 cents per fully
diluted share.  Annualized return on equity was said to be
19.7%.  Operating income was $40.8 million versus $28.7
million in the year-ago quarter.  We talked to one of
Solectron's competitors a few days ago and, when we
mentioned the company, he said:  "They are one of the stars of
the industry."  A few years ago, we had the chance to sit and
talk with Koichi Nishimura, the president of Solectron.  At one
point, we asked him to what he attributed Solectron's success. 
Without hesitation, he replied:  "Our people."  We like a
person who answers are quick and short.  We explored this
area with Mr. Nishimura and found that Solectron invested a
lot in their employees, offering training and opportunities for
them to participate in the decision making that goes on in the
company.

SM SENSOR KEEPS TRACK OF FISH


Star Oddi (Rykjavik, Iceland) wanted to monitor cod and
Atlantic salmon in the Islandic waters.  A device was designed
to periodically measure and record pressure and temperature. 
The data is used to compare growth of fish in different
environments.  The device, the DST 100, had to be small
enough to be placed internally and externally without causing
problems to the fish.  In order to produce the DST 100, a
surface mountable pressure sensor, the Model 1431, was
created by EG&G IC Sensors (Milpitas, CA).  The Model
1431 pressure sensor consists of a micromachined silicon
pressure sensor chip mounted on a ceramic substrate.  A
ceramic lid is bonded to the ceramic base to provide
mechanical protection for the sensor element.  The pressure
sensor chip is formed by chemically etching hundreds or
thousands of thin diaphragms into a 4 in. silicon wafer.  Later
in the manufacturing process, a glass wafer is electrostatically
bonded to the silicon wafer under vacuum, sealing a vacuum
reference within the sensor.  Once this has been accomplished,
the wafer is sawed apart to create individual sensors.

Boron impurities are implanted in selected regions of the
silicon diaphragms to form piezoresistors--resistors that
change their electrical resistance in response to changes in
strain.  Multiple resistors are interconnected into a Wheatstone
bridge circuit so that a change in diaphragm strain results in a
proportional change in sensor output voltage.  After
fabrication is completed, individual chips are tested to verify
that they are functioning properly.  The chip is then attached to
a ceramic substrate, wire bonds are made to form electrical
connections from the chip to the package, and a ceramic lid is
epoxied to the ceramic substrate to provide mechanical
protection for the sensor chip and the wire bonds.  Pressure
enters the sensor through an opening located at the base of the
top cover.  After a conventional IR reflow process, solder on
the bottom of the ceramic substrate forms the electrical
connection to the board, or hybrid circuit.

MICRON CMS EXPANDS SMT CAPABILITY


Micron Custom Manufacturing Services Inc. (Micron CMS)
began as an onsite division of Micron Technology in 1984,
providing board-level product design, assembly, and testing. 
Micron CMS began offering contract manufacturing to
vexternal customers in 1989, and established its current
autonomous location in 1990.  The operation became a
subsidiary in March, 1992, and became ISO-9001 certified in
February 1993.  In 1995, Micron CMS, Micron Computer, Inc.
and ZEOS International Ltd. entered into a merger to form
Micron Electronics, Inc.  Micron CMS is currently expanding
its contract manufacturing services by adding several SMT
lines.  The expansion is taking place in its Boise, ID and
Durham, NC plants.

The Boise facility consists of 92,000 square feet in two
adjacent buildings.  Over 550 employees operate seven fully
automatic surface mount manufacturing lines, which operate
24 hours a day, seven days a week to meet customer demand. 
The Boise facility is scheduled to have an eighth line up and
running by February 9 of this year. 

The Durham facility, established in January 1995, began with
an initial investment of approximately $10 million.  It has 75
employees and its third SMT line began operation on January
17 of this year.  A fourth line is scheduled for delivery in mid-
march, 1996, to be in production by April 1996.  The new
lines in Durham  increase the floor space there from 30,000
square feet to 60,000 square feet.  The Durham facility expects
ISO 9002 certification in April 1995.

MCMS said:  "Beyond the quality and competitive pricing all
customers expect, we believe the significant factors in contract
assembly are technology, service and cycle time.  Location is
also becoming increasingly important."

JAPANESE ELECTRONICS TO LOOK UP


After five years of declines, consumer electronics output will
increase in Japan in 1996 due to the creation of new products
such as car navigation systems and other digital devices,
according to the Electronic Industries Association of Japan,
which represents 600 companies.  Total production of
electronics in 1996 will be $234 billion, up 5.7% over this
year.  Leading the way will be higher production of
semiconductors and components to fuel booming worldwide
demand for chips from makers of computers and mobile
phones.

With the reawakening of the Japanese electronics industry,
there will come renewed capital spending for production
equipment.  Tencor Instruments' sales of in-line inspection
equipment to Japan constituted 16% of the company's total
revenue in 1993, the year Japan began recovering from its
economic slump.  In 1995,  the Japanese market made up 26%
of Tencor's company revenues.  This number is expected to
increase to 28% in 1996.

VOLUME KEY TO SUCCESS


We received a news release from Pittiglio Rabin Todd &
McGrath (PRTM) about a study they've completed:  1995
High-Performance Factory Benchmarking.  We called PRTM
and spoke to them about the study because it seemed like the
sort of information that our subscribers would be interested in. 
PRTM does multi-client studies for large companies.  This one
was sponsored by AT&T, Compaq, Digital Equipment, GE
Medical Systems, IBM, Nokia Mobile Phones, Nortel, Pitney
Bowes, Sequent and Unisys.  They don't offer the studies for
sale to other companies, but, in part to advertise PRTM, but
also in part as a service to the manufacturing industry, they
release some of the information for the general population.

PRTM's examination of manufacturing processes revealed the
significant impact high volume had on factory costs in 1995. 
For example, median cost per placement for printed circuit
board assembly was 32 for factories with a volume of 25
million placements, 15 for those with 200 million, and only
10 for those with 800 million.  The study indicated that the
high-tech industry has recognized the importance of volume: 
volumes have risen throughout the industry and reduced
overall product assembly costs.  For example, median cost per
placement for printed circuit board assembly declined by 20%
since 1992, from 35  to 28 .  PRTM attributes this to the
decreasing number of low-volume producing, various factory
improvements, and the increasing reliance on outsourced
production.

Though median assembly costs have dropped, typical
companies are still lagging behind the best-in-class
competitors--the top 20%--whose costs are at 7  per
placement.  Figures show, however, that the best-in-class
companies saw no cost improvements during the last few
years.  "Our numbers indicate that the influence of volume
may have topped out for the leading companies," said Raj
Nooyi, a director at PRTM.  "However, though volume is still
key, some of the other cost-related areas companies can
address include plant location [offshore facilities], unique part
numbers manufactured [component mix], PCB assembly
density, and the ratio of indirect [managers] to direct
employees [operators]."

Volume is also a major factor in low material acquisition
costs.  PRTM found that the material acquisition rate--the cost
of acquiring the material as a percentage of material
expenditures--varies from 1% to more than 20%.  Companies
with a volume of $25 million worth of material expenditures
had a rate of 6%, while companies at $200 million were just
over 3%, and those at $800 million were at 2.3%.

"Again, companies buying the most material are obviously
going to have the lowest rates," said Nooyi, "but companies
can still find ways to remain competitive within their volume
categories.  They can improve the efficiency of their
acquisition function by examining the number of suppliers, the
number of parts procured, percentage of material procured
from international sources, and the percentage of material
received without inspection."

In the high-tech arena, where getting to market quickly means
the difference between market leadership and a warehouse of
obsolete inventory, the time required to ramp up a product
from first prototype to full-volume production is critical.

"With the product life cycle under 35 weeks in segments like
personal computers and consumer electronics, the pressure on
companies is tremendous," says Nooyi.  "The median launch
and ramp-up time in the PC industry is only 10 weeks--and
each day the factory operates at less than peak capacity,
hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue can be lost."

A major factor in a product's manufacturing launch time is the
number of engineering change orders (ECOs), which are
typically brought about by product design quality issues and
difficulties with component sourcing.  Best-in-class companies
speed their development cycle times--and save significant
money--by reducing the number of mistakes made in the
design process.  In fact, best-in-class computer companies
generate 84% less ECOs within the first year of production
than average companies.

Proper management of inventory is also critical for cost,
flexibility and cycle-time performance.  For example, across
all industries, sourcing time (the time to specify and acquire
materials and components) comprises nearly 75% of the entire
source-make cycle-time--but companies that find ways to
reduce sourcing time take a dramatic lead time advantage.  In
addition, companies that improve inventory management gain
cost, flexibility and cycle-time advantages.  The personal
computing industry has proven itself a leader in this area, with
fewer inventory days of supply than every other study
segment.  In fact, PC factories have reduced "work-in-
progress" and "finished goods" inventories to less than one
week of supply each.

"Supply-line management," known in the old days as
"purchasing," has become an important new tool for gaining a
competitive advantage.  PRTM's study reveals that supply-line
practices are changing dramatically, providing companies with
new ways to speed production, save money and improve
quality.  As an example, in 1995, the average computer
company obtained 80% of its material from 22 suppliers, as
opposed to 31 suppliers in 1992.  These companies are also
phasing out cumbersome paper-based ordering mechanisms: 
27% of transactions are now completed by EDI, compared to
12% in 1992.  In addition, companies are replacing time-
consuming inspection efforts with vendor certification
programs:  in 1995, 82% of incoming material lots were
received without inspection, an increase from 65% i 1992. 
Although changes in supply-line practices are industry-wide,
some companies are far ahead of the pack on the issue of
supply-line flexibility.  In the computer sector, best-in-class
companies needed only 20 days to achieve an unplanned 20%
increase in production, while median companies needed 56
days.  These same best-in-class companies can also more
easily adjust to a downturn, sustaining an average 94% order
reduction within 45 days of scheduled product delivery with
no inventory or cost penalty.  The average company can only
sustain a 20% reduction for the same amount of time. 
Companies that can't respond quickly to changes in the
marketplace run the risk of out-of-control inventory and lost
revenue.

WORLD'S FIRST SM RESETTABLE FUSE FOR TELECOM EQUIPMENT


Raychem's PolySwitch Division (Menlo Park, CA) announced
the world's first surface mount resettable fuse for
telecommunications equipment.  The new PolySwitch TS250
helps protect telecommunications equipment from overcurrent
conditions.  With an installed height of only 3.4 mm and a 9.0
mm by 7.1 mm footprint, the compact TS250 resettable fuse
has a 60% lower profile than previous through-hole
PolySwitch devices for telecommunications equipment.  Like
other SM parts that Raychem manufactures, the TS250 is
supplied in tape and reel that is compatible with standard
industry pick and place equipment in high-volume
manufacturing environments.  The part is designed to be
reflowed onto boards using convection, IR, and hot-air
techniques.  PolySwitch resettable fuses are designed to
operate repeatedly and reliably.  Unlike one-use fuses, they
automatically reset after a fault condition is cleared.  When
short circuits or overcurrent conditions occur, a conductive
polymer, sandwiched between two metal electrodes, increases
in resistance, limiting the current.  In this high resistance state,
the device remains latched until the fault clears.  Resetting
occurs when the power is interrupted and the fault is removed. 
The device then cools and enables the polymer to revert to a
conductive state.  The TS250 is priced as low as $0.35
depending on volume.  Lead times are six to eight weeks.

AVX ADDS 2 MLCC LINES


One of the mainstay passive components, along with the
resistor, is the capacitor, whose primary responsibility in
today's electronic circuits is as a decoupling device:  a shunt
used to maintain proper voltage levels within the circuit. 
Switching power supplies, ubiquitous elements in an
electronic circuit, are an important application area for
capacitors.  As power supplies increase in switching frequency
and decrease in size, designers are turning to specialized
multilayer ceramic chip (MLCC) capacitors to help them keep
control of the circuit.  The input filter of a high-speed power
supply must provide a high-current burst to the power supply
without generating noise, and must suppress noise generated
by the switch circuitry as well.  Output filtering capacitors
must smooth the ripple effect of the switching circuitry by
absorbing and then discharging energy during the switching
cycle.

In response to demand from designers working with advanced
power supplies, AVX Corp. (Myrtle Beach, SC)  introduced
two surface mount capacitor series:

  1.  SupraCap--high-capacitance MLCCs

  2.  SV--high-voltage radial MLCCs

The SupraCaps offer low equivalent series resistance (ESR) in
the milliohm range and equivalent series inductance (ESI) in
the 1-nanohenry (nH) to 4-nH range.  The SV is for high
voltage, low leakage current, and low ESR applications in a
small package.

MLCC MATERIAL DEVELOPMENTS


Most of the raw-material cost in multilayer ceramic capacitors
comes from palladium.  As a result of the rising cost of
palladium, many ceramic-capacitor suppliers are considering
alternatives such as nickel.  Ceramics made of nickel, the inner
electrode could now account for as much as 10% of Murata's
ceramic-capacitor business.  Aluminum-electrolytic capacitors,
in heavy demand from power-supply makers, are in short
supply, as is polycarbonate.  New materials that are being
investigated to replace some of those that are in short supply
include polyphenylenesulfide (PPS) and
polyethyleneaphthalate (PEN).  (PPS is used in applications
requiring stability at high temperatures or over a wide
temperature range; PEN is appealing because it can be dipped
in molten solder in the wave solder process.)

ATC RAMPS UP FOR MLCC DEMAND


During the past two years American Technical Ceramics
(ATC) (Huntington Station, NY) saw an unprecedented
demand for multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs),
particularly for commercial and communications applications. 
In 1995 the company made significant investments to upgrade
production and process equipment for manufacturing their
core products--RF/microwave porcelain and ceramic
multilayer capacitors.  End-users of their products include
engineers in industries as diverse as wireless communications,
aircraft radar, navigation systems, satellite broadcasting,
medical electronics, space programs and automotive
electronics.

CAPACITOR NETWORKS ON THE RISE


New miniaturization demands are forcing many capacitor
houses to turn to integrated, semiconductor-style silicon
networks to achieve further reductions.  Size, performance,
and pricing are becoming increasingly critical, and surface-
mount packaging and thin-film technology are making inroads. 
A sizable chunk of future passives business could go to such
devices, particularly for portable communications and similar
applications where size reduction is critical.  PC manufacturers
want 100% surface mount.  The whole trend in the industry is
to surface mount for PCMCIA.  New high-frequency
requirements for communications and computing are making
such parts more necessary all the time.  Koa Speer has the
CR73 capacitor/resistor chip, a 1206 size for surface mount.

The passive-networks market--made up of various thick and
thin-film resistor-network configurations as well as resistor-
capacitor networks--grew moderately during the early 1990s. 
Venture Development Corp. (Natick, MA) said U.S. shipments
of the products grew from $1993.7 million in 1988, to $250.8
million in 1993.  A resurgence in the computer industry,
coupled with an interest in surface-mount designs, has helped
the passive-networks market maintain modest growth.  The
form factor continues to shrink.  Under development are
QSOPs, TSOPs, and narrow-body SO designs.  Small form
factors mean passive networks are offered, increasingly, in
surface-mount packages.  The mix of surface-mount and
through-hole resistor networks is currently about 50-50.  But
future designs are leaning more toward surface-mount
packages.

The name of the game is reducing size and increasing
frequency.  Performance level of surface-mount devices--in
some cases--has been close to or equal to that of through-hole
technology.  The biggest reason for the shift to surface-mount
is ease of assembly and size.  Applications that require high
levels of integration, such as cellular phones and wireless
communications, can generally be served better by discrete
components.  Traditionally, networks have three or maybe
four major applications:  pull-up/pull-down, termination,
current limiting, and precision analog circuits.  Applications in
which there is a need for low noise and tight tolerances,
however, require thin-film resistor networks, a portion of the
passive-networks market that should gain momentum in the
next few years.

Thin film has room to grow, especially where you can
incorporate a resistor and a capacitor in a single package.  The
market for thin-film resistor-capacitor networks is still in its
infancy, but most suppliers believe it shows great promise.  It
may still be about a year and a half before demand for these
integrated networks begins to generate much activity.

POROUS SILICONINCREASES CAPACITOR PERFORMANCE


Present-day capacitors suffer several drawbacks.  Electrodes
made of dielectric materials such as polystyrene or SiO2 have a
low surface-to-volume ratio.  Increasing the electrode area by
etching or sintering techniques such as those used for
aluminum or tantalum capacitors suffers the disadvantages of
anodically formed oxides.  The strong temperature and
electric-field dependence of the dielectric constant in ceramic
devices remains a drawback.  To resolve the limitations of
standard capacitors, porous silicon technology has been
developed by Siemens (Munich, Germany) to fashion novel
capacitors by combining an electrochemically enlarged
electrode surface with high-performance dielectric thin-film
layers.  The macroporous silicon, that was used as a substrate
for capacitors, has pores with a diameter in the micrometer
regime and a depth of several hundred micrometers.  Using a
standard microelectronic process, the capacitor structure is
completed with the deposition of dielectric films and a
polysilicon electrode.  In principle, the electrochemical
process allows the pore diameter to be reduced to values close
to atomic dimensions.  Reducing lateral dimensions in this
way would increase the specific capacitance to values around
20 mFV/mm3.  This would surpass the values for the best
tantalum or aluminum electrolytic capacitors without the
polarity and high-ESR drawbacks of these technologies.

PCMCIA DESIGN REQUIRE FLEXIBILITY


One of the products that helped make 1996 such a good year
for the electronics industry was the PCMCIA card.  Since the
1992 introduction of the first FPGAs, in thin quad flat pack
(TQFP) packages, static RAM-based FPGAs have been used
successfully in hundreds of PCMCIA designs, including
memory cards, I/O cards, and host systems.  The biggest
challenge of PCMCIA card designs is to fit the required
functionality into the available space.  High-integration levels
are needed to meet size and power constraints.  As a result, the
most popular PCMCIA IC technologies feature high
integration levels and include memories, chip sets, custom
ASICs (including gate arrays), and FPGAs.  Application-
specific approaches allow for the customization of the bus
interface and integration of other logic.  Custom IC
development is only feasible, however, when the design is
fixed and fairly large volumes are required.  This is because
such development typically involves lengthy design and
procurement cycles and high engineering costs.

As a result, many designers have turned to FPGAs, which
provide high integration levels without the lengthy
development cycles, design risk, and expenses of custom
ASICs.  Furthermore, the flexible nature of in-system
programmable FPGAs meets the demands of an unsettled PC
card market, with its changing standards, fierce competition,
and short product life cycles.  FPGA densities range from
about 1000 to over 20,000 gates with larger devices coming. 
The CMOS technology of FPGA devices is inherently low-
power.  One benefit of SRAM-based FPGA technology is its
ability to be configured and reconfigured while resident in the
target system.  This flexibility helps shorten development
times and facilitates field upgrades.

SRAM-based FPGAs make the PC Card more adaptable. 
Different FPGA configurations can be applied to the same
hardware design; variations in the FPGA configurations, result
in different adaptations of the same card.  Allowing for the
thickness of the circuit board and card enclosure leaves only
1.2 and 2.0 mm for ICs on double-sided Type I and Type II
cards, respectively.  This imposes severe restrictions on the
IC-package size, and has led to the adoption of TQFP and
VQFP (very thin quad flat pack) packaging for FPGAs. 
TQFPs feature a package height of 1.6 mm, making them
suitable for single-sided Type I cards and single or double-
sided Type 2 cards.  With 1.2-mm height, VQFPs can be used
on all single- or double-sided PCMCIA boards.  (Package
height is defined as the distance from the surface of the board
to the top of the IC package, and is the sum of the package
thickness and its clearance off the board.)  For high-density,
high-pin-count FPGA designs, Ball Grid Arrays (BGAs), just
emerging, offer a nominal height of 2.0 mm, suiting them for
PCMCIA designs.

The U.S. semiconductor market is dominated by
microprocessor and logic manufacturers, both standard logic
and ASICs.  Intel is the largest manufacturer by far.  Some
memory is produced mostly is the form EEPROMs.  Because
of the preponderance of MPUs and logic chips produced in the
United States, there tend to be more QFPs, PGAs, and LCCs
used proportionally, compared to the Asian market, where
there would be a higher proportion of DIPs, ZIPs, SIPs, and
SOIC packages used for memory applications.

HARRIS TO STICK TO X86S


Although Harris Corp. (Dallas, TX) was said to be evaluating
the possibility of migrating to the next generations of X86
processors, right now they are still dedicated to their decade-
old 8086 and 286 product lines.  A spokesman said:  "We've
been making these parts for many, many years now, but we're
seeing demand increase to the point that we've had to go back
in and re-allocate fab capacity, and we are investing
significant money in new speed upgrades and package types." 
Including the processors and peripheral devices, such as timer
circuits and direct-memory-access controller, Harris sold more
than 5 million of the 8086 and 286 devices in 1995.  Among
the new package options Harris is adding to its 8086 and 286
product lines, are surface-mount packages.

INTEL SHIFTS TO PLASTIC PACKAGES


Some years ago one of the pundits we talk to periodically said
that packages of the future, despite what was being said then,
would be eventually be plastic.  Intel went a long way toward
confirming that recently when it made some of  the biggest
news around by saying it will migrate the majority of its
microprocessor product line from ceramic to plastic packages. 
By moving to plastic, Intel will spend $29.50 less on each
microprocessor and be able to reduce the cost of the products. 
As much as 80% of Intel's microprocessors are now packaged
in ceramic.  The move to plastic was made possible by the
superb heat and power dissipation characteristics of Intel's
0.35-micron process.

OLE 2.0 AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN ECAD & MRP II 


Simple tools are the best tools.  Think of the extremely
qualitative work that can be done by an artist with simple paint
and ordinary canvas.  When two or more pieces of software
can interact in a simple manner it opens a previously narrow
gap by which the operators of the software can move data with
positive consideration for the task.  Consequently, an
individual can more easily motivate himself to take on a more
arduous task.  This in turn helps the overall data stream
between the engineering department and the manufacturing
and/or the administrative departments of a company.  OLE
provides this linkage and widens the gap.

An engineering group can spend a significant amount of their
time trying to get information and documentation about an
assembly to manufacturing.  Perceptively, much of this
information is going to be entered into the company's MRP
software quickly and accurately.  OLE does this without any
manual intervention.  Therefore, an MRP system, having been
defined as an infinite planning system, can immediately
breakout the materials required to start this project into motion
with rapid precision.  Now that the work orders and materials
can be generated, the aspect of more finite costing can be
established.  With this information now assigned a  new role, it
can quickly generate purchase orders and work orders.

A digital circuit board with 20 square inches of real estate can
easily have over 300 discrete parts.  They may not necessarily
all be different, but here must be a bill of materials and they
will all have different reference designators.  Coupled with all
the other information that is needed to define a circuit board
there is a wealth of data needed to clearly define the project to
other persons inside the company and out.  OLE keeps this
data from having to be reproduced.  As in a reference
designator chart of those 300 parts for hand placement, rework
or test.  When this data does not have to be retyped the
engineering staff and the administrative staff can manage a
project more efficiently.  This in turn would benefit by the
lowering the cost of not having to maintain multiple data
bases.  This allows purchasing and scheduling to utilize the
MRP system much earlier in the design cycle.  Manufacturing
can now start to consider what the capacity constraining
resource is and the production path to be taken.

When a single database can be maintained, the allowance for
multiple individuals to access this information with the
perception that it is accurate and updated frequently is
generated.  This is the basis for a concurrent engineering
environment with minimal redundancy.  With all this
happening in rapid succession, the model of the product also
needs to be created, which is why OLE Design and Modeling
is going to be an important factor for the MCAD group to keep
pace with the ECAD systems.

DESIGN TOOLS TARGET BGA AND PCB APPLICATIONS


Two new physical-design packages from Harris EDA (Fishers,
NY) target ball-grid-array (BGA) and PC-board applications. 
The first product, Encore BGA, is aimed at single- and few-
chip designs using BGA packaging technology.  Encore PCB
is a physical design and layout environment for PC boards. 
Encore BGA was developed in partnership with Amkor
Electronics, a leading packaging supplier.  Users can reduce
design time, improve manufacturability, and reduce
manufacturing costs.  The tool includes automatic, optimized
wire-bound generation and no-net-list, all-angle, filleted trace
routing.

Push-and-shove editing allows engineers to dynamically re-
route traces on the substrate.  All-angle routing and advanced
editing features ensure that all available space is used.  And
Encore BGA comes with a standard set of BGA design rules to
make the tool easy for first-time and casual users, while still
allowing for a high degree of user configurability if desired. 
Encore PCB lets users design, analyze, and optimize PC-board
designs.  User-specified design rules guide floorplanning,
partitioning, and manual placement.  In addition, floorplanning
lets users consider electrical constraints and manufacturability
issues in the early design stages.

Using a physical-synthesis option, users can automatically
derive component placement and interconnect from CAE data
and user-specified constraints.  Partition synthesis
automatically optimizes component groups, partitions, and
individual component assignment.  Placement synthesis
employs placement algorithms that consider constraints such
as clearance rules, voids, and channels, while minimizing
route congestion and interconnect lengths.  Encore BGA and
Encore PCB run on Unix platforms and work with leading
CAE design software, including products from Cadence,
Mentor and Viewlogic.  Encore PCB also works with popular
PC-based design systems.  Pricing starts at $25,000 for each
product.

TITANIUM OXIDE FILM BINDS IC LAYERS


A lightweight metal best known for its use in advanced aircraft
structures may provide the adhesive needed to hold together
groups of integrated circuits in multichip modules -- and the
layers of material used to build high-speed circuits.  Multichip
modules will facilitate the miniaturization of computer
equipment by allowing several chips to be placed in the same
space now needed for a single integrated circuit. To improve
the operating speed of the circuits and the new modules and
allow use of smaller currents, electrical engineers would like
to use wiring patterns made from high-conductivity metals
such as silver, gold or copper -- instead of standard aluminum.

But those high-conductivity metals are usually difficult to use
in circuits because other electronic materials -- silicon dioxide
and polymers -- do not bond well to them.  Now, researchers
at the Georgia Institute of Technology report that a thin film of
titanium oxide can serve as an intermediary layer to help bond
films of high conductivity gold to the other materials used to
build an integrated circuit.  The research is sponsored by the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
through the U.S. Air Force.

"This will allow us to think about replacing aluminum on
integrated circuits with a more conductive material such as
copper, gold or silver," explained Dr. Paul A. Kohl, professor
of chemical engineering at Georgia Tech. "This process may
be of substantial value in integrated circuit and multichip
module technology."

Aluminum has long been used for wiring in integrated circuits
because it forms a stable insulating oxide to which other
electronic materials readily bond. But metals like gold and
silver -- which are better conductors -- do not readily form
stable oxides and therefore are more difficult to use in layering
the circuits.

Kohl and Graduate Student Kirkland W. Vogt believe they
have solved that problem by depositing a thin film of titanium
metal on top of gold conducting films. The titanium adheres
well to the gold, and is then allowed to form an insulating
oxide (TiO2) on which the researchers can build layers of
silicon dioxide or polymers.

"It's a simple one-step coating process that allows us to switch
back and forth between insulators and metals at will without
having to worry about adhesion for each," explained Kohl. "In
our work with multichip modules, we use this exclusively to
get adhesion. It's a kind of universal adhesion layer for us."

Because it is thin, the titanium film does not alter the dielectric
properties of the insulator surrounding the metal. And because
it does not significantly diffuse into the gold, conductivity is
not degraded.  Vogt analyzed the surface of the titanium layer
with help from Dr. Lawrence A. Bottomley in Georgia Tech's
School of Chemistry and Dr. Brent Carter in the School of
Materials Science and Engineering. Using angle-resolved
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) and other techniques, he studied the
characteristics of the titanium oxide film and found that its
thickness was critical to the success of the process.

When deposited in layers of between three and 10 Angstroms
thick on the gold film, the titanium forms "islands" which
occupy about 90 percent of the surface -- but do not contact
one another. Oxidation of the titanium metal creates a
continuous film of insulating titanium oxide, which builds up
on top of the titanium islands and provides a bonding surface
for the next layer of the circuit.  A core of titanium metal
remains beneath the oxide to provide good adhesion to the
gold.

If the titanium layer is thinner than three Angstroms, oxidation
does not leave enough titanium to ensure good adhesion, Vogt
found. If the layer is thicker than about 30 Angstroms, the
titanium islands grow together, forming a continuous metal
layer that can become a conductor and short out the circuit. 
Multichip modules will allow the miniaturization of computer
components by allowing several integrated circuits to be
placed into a single package in the space normally required for
just one circuit. 

"This can replace several packages of chips inside a
computer," Kohl explained. "All the interconnection is
provided on the base material, so you end up with a very dense
array of circuits."

Engineers would like to use the higher conductivity metals to
increase the speed of the circuits and to reduce the current they
must carry. Because the chips are closer together, the electrons
carrying signals have less distance to travel; helping them
travel faster would give additional speed to the computing
work. Higher conductivity would also mean less current loss
and less heat to remove from the circuit module.

CHANGES IN TODAY'S PCB MARKET


The printed circuit board (PCB) market, like all the electronics
industry, is in a state of continual evolution.  Some of the
major outside factors that have helped shape that evolution
are:

  1.  The shift from a military and mainframe dominated
market to a commercial product focus;
  2.  The movement away from vertical integration and captive
PCB shops to independent PCB fabricators and independent
contract assemblers;
  3.  The slow but steady move from through-hole technology
to surface mount technology; and
  4.  The rapidly increasing levels of density and integration on
semiconductor devices.

From a technological standpoint, the basic processes used
today are the same that were used twenty years ago.  Clearly
there have been steady improvements in materials, proprietary
chemicals, equipment and our understanding of PCB
processing.  Nonetheless, there has been little change in how
PCBs are processed today compared to twenty years ago. 
Layers are still imaged, etched and laminated.  Next comes
drilling, metalization, imaging, etch and finishing.

It is clear that change will be needed in the future!  The
transition from through-hole to surface mount technology
provided an easy route to increased interconnection density. 
Replacing large holes that served a mechanical and electrical
function with small connection vias freed up routing channels. 
Combined with enhanced dimensional stability of laminates,
smaller line widths and spaces, stiff and accurate drill
machines, fine grained tungsten-carbide drills, and the ability
to scale artwork with raster-based laser photoplotters--large
improvements have been made.  The result has been a five to
ten fold increase in interconnect density over the past twenty
years.  Nonetheless, the easy changes have been made. 
Further enhancements on the present methods of building
PCBs will result in diminishing returns.  The industry is ripe
for a change, but a change to what?

Today it is obvious that the density improvements in the PCB
fabrication industry are not keeping pace with those of the
semiconductor industry.  Semiconductors serve only an
electrical purpose.  Shrinking their geometries usually
improves the electrical properties and results in more die and
more revenue per wafer.  Printed circuit boards serve both an
electrical and a mechanical purpose that is difficult to separate. 
Frequently, the mechanical size is dictated by a form factor,
making it impossible to shrink the overall board size, while at
the same time, the geometries decrease and the cost per square
inch increases.

What is needed is a new PCB technology that allows very high
connection densities (where needed) without driving the cost
of the rest of the package out of sight!  Fortunately, there are
many new technologies that exhibit the potential for greatly
increased interconnection densities.  Some of the most
promising of these new processing methods and materials are:

  1.  Photoimagable dielectrics,
  2.  All organic dielectric materials in which vias can be
chemically or reactive ion etched,
  3.  Electrically conductive pastes for filling vias,
  4.  Lasers that can simultaneously machine thousands of vias,
and
  5.  Lasers that can machine through copper.

Most of these emerging technologies are squarely aimed at
reducing the high cost of via formation when using small drills
for conventional through-board via formation.  Secondary
benefits are that these processes allow the use of much smaller
via pads; They only place vias between the required layer pairs
(opening up routing channels on all other layers), and they
allow the use of optical alignment fiducials for improved
layer-to-layer alignment, further reducing the required via pad
size.

The challenges facing the acceptance of any new PCB
fabrication technology are:

  1.  It must be producible on large panel sizes, i.e., 300-500
sq. in.;
  2.  It must provide reliability that is at least equal to existing
semiconductor packages;
  3.  It must be compatible with existing semiconductor
assembly and packaging processes; and
  4.  Any increased processing and material costs must be less
than the increased density on a per unit area.

ELECTROLESS PALLADIUM: A SURFACE FINISH FOR INTERCONNECT TECHNOLOGY


With the continuous evolution of interconnect technology a
series of new demands on the  surface finish is emerging.  The
co-planarity of the surface finish is essential for paste printing
accuracy and placement on fine featured SMT devices.  The
finish must be capable of withstanding multiple thermal
excursions in air without loss of solderability.  Preferably the
same finish is also compatible with wire bonding and contact
switching.  Electroless palladium over bare copper can meet
the above requirements.  It is  cost competitive and
environmentally safe.  Electroless palladium eliminates the use
of lead in the PCB manufacturing facility and is compatible
with no-clean fluxes at the assembly end.

Atotech developed a process that uses a novel reducing agent
that produces an electroless deposit of pure palladium that is
free of phosphorous or boron, eliminating variability in the
deposit and its solderability.  An electroless palladium coating
of 5-7 microinches (0.15 microns) over bare copper has 
excellent solderability preserving properties.  It is compatible
with no clean fluxes after  multiple thermal excursions in air. 
At a thickness of 20-24 microinches (0.5- 0.6 microns) with a
gold flash (0.1 microns)  the finish is 100% gold wire
bondable.

Palladium has a density of 12gm/cm and a melting point of
1552oC. Palladium is almost twice as hard as copper; it has a
hardness of 250-290 Vickers as compared to copper at 150
Vickers.  On the same scale gold is at 90 and nickel comes in
at a hardness of 600 Vickers.  Palladium will not form a solid
solution in copper even with prolonged dwell at elevated
temperatures (120 and 176o C for 48 hours).  The metal will
strip in molten solder at a rate of 0.02 microns per second at
250 and 176o  C.  Copper at the same temperature has a strip
rate of 0.12 microns and gold is at 1.3 microns per sec.

Atotech's process consists of four steps:  

  1.  Acid Clean;
  2.  Microetch;
  3.  Activate; and 
  4.  Electroless palladium.  

The activator is highly selective to the copper surface. The
process uses the copper surface as a reducing agent for the
deposition of a thin layer (1.0 microinches) of immersion
palladium.  Activation depends on temperature and chemical
composition.  The system is buffered to the point that pH
control is not required.  A controller maintains the chemical
composition and doses the bath continuously during operation. 
The electroless bath will only deposit on a palladium metal
surface.  This surface is initiated in the activation step. The
deposited metal then acts as the catalytic sight for sustained
plating.  This unique feature renders the bath totally
independent of bath loading.  The thickness of the palladium is 
a function of dwell time beyond this point.  Of course
deposition rate is dependant on temperature, chemical
composition and pH.  A controller maintains the chemistry
within the specified range.  The bath is water clear, odorless
and very stable under operating conditions.  

At the operating temperature and pH the bath is compatible
with all the solder masks  tested to date.  The list includes the
following:  Probimer 52,62; Conformask 2000; Taiyo PSR400;
Enthone 3241LG; Coates XZT15; Vacrel; Epic 200 and
Imagecure XV 501 TSM.  Multiple tests were conducted to
evaluate the solderability of a thin electroless palladium finish. 
Thicknesses tested were 0.2 microns and 0.1 microns. Test
conditions were steam aging, multiple IR thermal excursions
and baking.  Four different assembly fluxes were used  namely
Alpha 350(2%), Kester 951(2%), Kester 922(2%) and Alpha
855(15%).  Soldermasks tested were; Probimer 52, Probimer
71, Enthone 3241ALG and Taiyo 4000.  The finish with a
thickness as  low as 4.0 microinches (0.1 microns) survived
eight hours of steam aging. The resulting surface gave good
hole filling properties when assembled with a 2% no clean
flux in air.  No loss of solderablity was experienced after three
IR thermal excursions.  No loss of solderability was detected
after 24 hours of dry bake at 160 and 176o C.  No clean fluxes
in an air atmosphere were used in all applications.

Boards coated with 0.7 microns of palladium were assembled
using standard reflow and wave procedures.  Cross sections of
the joint were then prepared.  EDX was used to study the
elemental composition at; the solder/copper interface, at 2
microns and at 5 microns into the solder.  EDX analyses were
conducted on; the joint as formed, after baking and after 1000
thermal cycles.  From the data it is evident that  an
intermetallic phase between tin and palladium is set up as the
joint is formed.  This phase then migrates during tempering
into the solder away from the copper. This allows for  the
formation of a copper/tin intermetallic at the copper surface.
The palladium/tin phase forms a neutral solid solution in the
solder away from the copper interface.

A palladium deposit 0.6-0.7 microns thick with immersion
gold flash over bare copper was submitted for gold wire bond
testing.  Coupons with surface mount assembly sites were
used.  The coupons were split into two groups. One group was
assembled through reflow, using water soluble solder paste
followed by aqueous cleaning.  The second group, a control
group, was processed as received.  A bead of die attach epoxy
was placed around the bond site and was cured per vendor
specifications.  All assemblies were then plasma cleaned using
argon gas.

A Hughes Aircraft wire bonder was used.  The bonder
employed a stage preheat.  The gold wire had a diameter of 1.0
mil. Pull strengths were performed per MIL-STD-883B.  The
results show that average pull strength was 8.4 gms with a
S.D. of 0.46 for the control group and 8.2 gms for the
assembled group with a S.D. of 0.43.  The brake per
MIL-STD-883B had a Failure Location Code 1 (wire break at
neck down point).  Additional testing is in progress to
evaluate; alternate assembly equipment, palladium without
gold flash and to optimize wire bonding parameters.  Contact
switch testing was conducted on a 0.2 microns palladium
deposit over bare copper.  Initially 200,000 switches were
performed at a pressure of 80 cN. This was followed by a
dwell in a humidity chamber for 4 days at 85 & 176o C and
85% relative humidity.  An additional 400,000 switches were
then performed at the same pressure. No increase in resistivity
was recorded throughout the testing conditions.

Under normal thermal stress both nickel/gold and palladium
deposits showed no deterioration in resistivity . At increased
stress temperature of 155 and 176o C palladium shows no
significant increase in resistivity for 28 hours.  Nickel/gold on
the other hand showed an increase of 300% after 16 hours. 
Under chemical stress conditions of 10 ppm H2S for 60 hours
no change was recorded for palladium. Nickel/gold exhibited a
30% increase in resistivity.  For the palladium deposit to show
the same rise in resistivity it was necessary to increase the
concentration of the gas H2S to 100 ppm and the dwell time  to
144 hours.

Electroless palladium is an economical, environmentally safe
surface finish. It does not require any modifications to existing
assembly operations. The finish has great versatility and a
multitude of applications.  As a diffusion barrier it may replace
electrolytic nickel for gold tab electroplating applications. 
Can 25 microinches of electroless palladium replace
nickel/gold tab plating and offer a final finish that is
solderable, wire bondable and suitable for contact switching? 
How about electroless palladium on ceramic substrates? 
Electroless palladium offers answers to existing technology
demands and will be at the forefront to meet the challenges of
future technological advancements.

PRECISION STENCILS FOR SMT ASSEMBLY


A-Laser, Inc. (Beaverton, OR) announced a new service
providing laser cut stencils for the printing of solder paste on
circuit boards (PCBs) when using fine pitch surface mount
components.  The new service takes advantage of laser
technology to manufacture stencils that improve SMT
assembly yields by drastically reducing print errors.

With fine pitch technology becoming more pervasive in
surface mount designs the need for precision stencils is
increasing.  The component solder points for these fine pitch
parts have become so small and closely aligned, A-Laser feels,
that the accuracy needed cannot be met any longer by
traditional chemical stencil manufacturing technology.

A-Laser uses a stencil laser system manufactured by LPKF
CAD/CAM Systems that was specifically developed for
stencil fabrication.  The laser system creates stencil apertures
with very clean, straight walls which allow printing of clean,
precise solder paste islands.  High aperture positioning
accuracy (<15 m) combined with low inner wall roughness
(<3  m) permit trouble-free fine-pitch PCB assembly, for
pitches finer than 250  m (10 mil).

Stencils are generated from common data formats such as
Gerber and HPGL.  The typical stencil is made of flat stainless
steel, up to 60 x 80 cm (24" x 32"), in a range of thicknesses,
typically from 50-250  m (2-10 mils).  Typical turnaround
times are three to five days and the cost starts at $275 per
stencil without frame and about $400 per stencil with frame. 
First time customers receive a 50% discount on their first order
of a standard stencil.  To receive a free information packet,
call (503-641-9428) or FAX (503-643-3662).

AMISTAR INTRODUCES TP-12


Amistar Corp. (San Marcos, CA) has introduced its new
TrayPro TP-12, a multiple-tray feeder for the PlacePro family
of surface mount assembly equipment.  The TrayPro TP-12 is
capable of handling up to 12 JEDEC trays on two platforms. 
A special feature of this tray feeder is that while the machine
is picking a component from one platform, the other platform
can be re-loaded or re-configured by the operator, saving
valuable time.  The trays can be easily changed out, even
while the machine is in operation.  Utilizing a simple
mechanical latching arrangement, the TrayPro TP-12 offers a
solution to handling large numbers of tray-fed components. 
The TrayPro TP-12 takes full advantage of the PlacePro's four-
head models allowing multiple, simultaneous pick-up of
memory devices.  This efficient methodology means high
production at an affordable cost-per-placement.  The TrayPro
TP-12 is especially effective for manufacturing memory
modules because multiple waffle trays of DRAMs can be
handled very efficiently with the PlacePro machines.

DIE-TECH INTRODUCES NEW SUBSTRATE HANDLING SYSTEMS


Die-Tech, Inc. (York Haven, PA) has introduced a package
handling system that transfers devices through multiple
operations without the operator having to handle them directly. 
The Model 6502 Substrate Handling system can process quad
flat packs, DIPs, or SIPs in 12" long stainless steel "boat." 
Each boat holds multiple devices, the number depending upon
the size of the component.  There are 10 boats in each
magazine.  The standard unit comes with a double magazine,
and can be equipped with as many as four.  The basic system
includes two vertical travel elevators, which lower the boats
onto the main track of the machine.  Once the substrates
complete the desired processes, the boats are then loaded back
into a magazine by means of the outgoing travel elevator. 
These magazines can then be transferred to other stations for
additional work, such as reflow, trim and form, testing,
marking and inspection.  The system can also be used to
automate wire bonding, epoxy dispensing, paste dispensing,
and component placement.  Pricing for a Model 6502
Substrate Handling System, incorporated into a custom Die-
Tech Model 4602 DIP machine with double magazine, boat
transfer, lead attach and solder paste dispensing, is
approximately $250,000.

1995 was a good year for manufacturers of screen printers for
SMT.  Much of the highest growth in the market came from
contract manufacturers.  End-users are looking for increased
performance features that will make their screen printing more
automatic to stepup throughput.  One of the additions to the
screen printer that is helping to speed up the operation is a
vision system.  Vision systems help insure the proper
alignment of the screen as well as check the completed board
to make sure all patterns have been properly applied.

MASK TECHNOLOGY SIGNS CROSS LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH KOKI


Mask Technology, Inc.  (Santa Ana, CA) and Koki  Company Ltd.   (Tokyo, Japan)
announced the signing of a cross licensing agreement relating to the Precision
Pad Technology (PPT) solid  solder deposit  process.   Both Koki  and Mask Tek
will be opening PPT service bureaus in Tokyo and Santa Ana, in addition to the
existing Mask Technology PPT facility in Orlando, FL.  The patented technology
is claimed to improve fine pitch solderability by applying  a solid, reflowed,
macro- planar solder deposit to SMT lands or pads.   The  solid solder deposit
formed is typically  0.002-inch to  0.010-inch, although  thinner deposits are
normally employed for TAB devices.  

Mask Tek has been doing solder masking for nearly a decade and a half.  Their
PPT process grew out of this expertise.  They began obtaining patents for the
PPT process four years ago.  Seven months ago, with their last patent in hand,
they began to push the PPT process as a service.  Initially, the service was
offered only in Orlando.  Now the Santa Ana site as well as the Tokyo site
also offer the service.  What is eliminated by using the service is the
printing of solder paste.  Solder paste printing, like board fabrication, is
ordered by the end-user.  Generally, the entire board is processed, but it can
be just parts of the board, if there are certain hard to place components in a
particular area.

When the processed board reaches the assembler or OEM a flux is applied to the
board, either by dispensing, stencil or spray.  Components are then place and
the board is reflowed.  Peel strength is increased with the PPT process, while
shorts and bridges are virtually eliminated.  The savings in rework, the
company says, justifies the cost of the process.  The PPT cost is typically
$0.05 per square inch of board, plus the cost of the stencil.

WHO WHAT IN PLACEMENT


Nothing in market research is more vain than trying to
determine marketshare.  It's easy enough to figure out who are
the major competitors, harder by a great deal to determine
exactly what share of the market these major competitors
possess.  In placement the task is even more daunting because
the market itself can be segmented into three, maybe four,
maybe five different categories, based on chip placement
speed (CPS) or cost.  With that caveat, we put forth our ideas
on this dubious area.  We will, over the course of time, refine
these numbers, both as the market shifts and as our
participation in the market deepens and allows us more
accurate perceptions of what is really going on.  Now we must
rely on information that is probably hedged because
marketshare figures are extremely vague unless based on unit
sales, and few SMT placement manufacturers have a
relationship with us, yet, that gives them the confidence to
release these figures.


We include this information because we feel that major
players in the market are important, which is not to say minor
players are not important.  But the research and product
development at a major company is more likely to influence
the nature of the SMT market more than the research and
product development at a minor company.  As always, we are
looking for answers for people actively involved in PCB
assembly using surface mount components.  When, in the
months to come, we discuss work being done at Fuji or
Universal, it will be because we feel as if this work is
something that will benefit you.

BGA BONDING UPGRADE KIT


The new ball grid array (BGA) kit from Kulicke & Soffa
Industries (Willow Grove, PA) enhances the bonding
capability of the model 1488L turbo automatic gold ball
bonder for handling ball grid arrays and other devices with
large or varying height differentials.  The BGA kit enhances
machine vision capability to focus more clearly on BGAs, for
more accurate and reliable bond placement.  BGA devices
typically have large die/lead height differentials, ranging from
0.41 to 0.56 mm.  By expanding machine vision range to 0.76
mm, the kit provides bonders with a sharper visual image of
BGAs, for clearer bond position targeting.  Stationary optics
eliminate the need for operator adjustments; focusing is
performed with out time-consuming mechanical motion,
maximizing UPH.  A loop trajectory also improves second
bond angle approach for reduced risk of contact with
ground/supply pads.  Greater loop control allows accurate
placement of second bonds in multiple rows for effective fine
pitch.  A new algorithm minimizes wire sweep and reduces the
risk of wires shorting when molding for higher yields.

SOLDERING EQUIPMENT


The U.S. market for soldering ovens, we feel, is going to
continue to be very healthy through the year 2000.  New
package types will keep end-users looking for good ovens.  In
addition, included in the category are curing ovens which will
find better acceptance during the next few years as the market
for conductive adhesives grows.  Prices will increase because
of added performance needed to provide reliable soldering of
fine pitch devices and dense array packages.

FLIP CHIP ATTACHMENT WITHOUT SOLDER 


Solderless flip chip technology is challenging the traditional solder bump
technique.  Solderless flip chip technology involves the deposition of a
screen-printable dielectric polymer onto the silicon chip in wafer form,
leaving the metallized bond pads open.  This process, called advanced wafer
passivation (AWP), utilizes high precision, automatic screen printers with
pattern recognition alignment.  The printer must be able to print the micron
range with acceptable resolution and repeatability.  After the dielectric is
cured, an electrically conductive polymer is stenciled onto the bond pads of
each chip on the wafer to form the interconnect bumps.

A 25 micron layer of dielectric polymer is stencil printed over the entire
surface of the wafer, excluding bond pads and streets.  A printer with vision
alignment is required because the bond pad size is typically 100 microns
square and the spacing between adjacent bond pads is usually 200 microns.  In
the second step of the process, the conductive bumps are formed.  A
laser-etched stencil, with the bond pad array etched open, is aligned to the
wafer bond pads.  The bump height is 50 microns (+/-3 microns).  The
conductive bumps are then cured in an infrared furnace with a nitrogen
atmosphere after which they are ready for assembly. 

A thin layer (0.001") of conductive adhesive is stenciled onto the bond pads
of the substrate.  A high precision printer employing a metal stencil is
mandatory so that interconnect height, volume and diameter can be accurately
controlled.  The flip chip is then aligned and amounted onto the substrate
using a flip chip aligner/bonder.  The bumps of the flip chip are contacted to
the wet adhesive on the metallized substrate pads and 30 to 40 gms is
typically used to adhere the flip chip to the substrate.  A 300X magnification
on the aligner/bonder is used to ensure accurate alignment of the bumps to the
substrate.  This is essential because conductive adhesives do not have the
self-aligning properties exhibited by solder.

SMT INSPECTION


Inspection is an increasingly important part of the entire PCB
processing when surface mount components are involved. 
Inspection equipment can be one of the most ubiquitous pieces
of equipment on the line.  Inspection equipment can be found
at the head of the line for incoming inspection of both printed
circuit boards and components, after solder paste screen
printing, after component placement, after reflow soldering,
and after cleaning.

An order of magnitudes' escalation in the cost of finding and
correcting a defect at each successive stage in the production
of an electronics system should turn a manufacturing
manager's thoughts to finding defective boards and
components early.  Checking for manufacturing defects in
circuit fabrication and assembly must await performance of the
physical process at issue.  Many component defects, however,
can be found at incoming inspection, when the components
enter the manufacturer's facility.

Probably the most important function of incoming parts
inspection is the detection of oxidation of the PWB traces. 
This is because the boards are exposed most often to
contaminants such as moisture and body oils.  They are
frequently shipped and stored without the packaging
precautions used for paste and components.  Components are
usually received in containers that prevent contamination
caused by handling or atmospheric exposure.  Solder paste
may be refrigerated and kept in sealed containers for use
within a few weeks after receipt.  Boards, however, may be
kept in inventory for several months.  Therefore, inspection for
oxidation should occur not only upon receiving them but also
before the boards enter the assembly process.

Inspection of the application of solder paste is the first step in
ensuring a good solder joint.  After printing solder paste onto
the pads, the process may require inspection of the wet solder
before components are placed.  This level of inspection
ensures that the correct amount of paste is located on the pads
within acceptable tolerances.  The kinds of problems
associated with faulty paste printing include solder bridging,
excessive print deposition, and whether the print registration is
off.  Insufficient solder paste can result in opens.  Unlevel
printing can lead to downline process problems such as
skewing or tombstoning.  Boards not printed to spec can be
removed from the line before there is any more value added. 
Equally important, the cause of the fault is identified so
corrective action can be taken.

After components are placed on the board, the assembly
should be inspected for correct component positional
tolerances including pattern error correction (PEC), lead
inspection, coplanarity inspection, and part-to-pad matching. 
Because of the greater density of these circuits, placement is
much more critical than with through-hole components.

The solder joint inspection process can be broken down into
two categories:

  1.  Pre-solder inspection; and
  2.  Post-solder inspection.

The objective of post-assembly, pre-solder inspection is to find
and replace wrong, misoriented, misplaced, and missing parts
at the most cost-effective point in the process.  The objective
of post-solder inspection is to assure sound solder joints
between component leads and pads on assembled PCBs. 
Some common defects occur after the components have been
soldered to the board.  Solder balls may form if boards are not
properly prepared or if paste is improperly applied.  The defect
is more common to vapor phase soldered boards.  Dewetting
or missing solder are easy to detect visually.  Solder bridges
and cracks are difficult to spot if they occur beneath a
component.

Defects occur which may not affect the performance of the
product immediately but which may degrade the long-term
reliability of the circuit.  Flux residues may cause corrosion or
the failure of a conformal coating.  Voids or pinholes may be
caused by gases formed during reflow or by flux which has
failed to escape from the solder before it hardens.  These will
rarely impede the functioning of the circuit but may affect its
long-term reliability, especially if the assembly is subjected to
vibration.

Included in the SMT inspection equipment market are
automatic and manual inspection equipment.  Manual systems,
which generally involve a microscope, perhaps with 3D
capability and a video camera and monitor, are most often
found at the end of the process line, where they are used to
inspect fully assembled PCBs.  A manual system necessarily
involves a technician whose judgement is used to evaluate the
quality of the board.  Manual systems are still very much in
use not only because of their lower cost but also, with well-
trained operators, they are very good systems for providing
assemblers with go or no-go judgements about boards.  

Automated systems include x-ray, laser, and automated optical
systems.  They involve "golden" board models which are used
to automatically compare boards being processed.  Automated
systems can be found throughout the process line.  Although
automated systems are used widely, because of their ability to
monitor boards during several phases of processing, they are
anything but perfect, and they are often very expensive.

BEYOND CFC


Last summer when we visited EMPF (Indianapolis, IN), one of
the bits of information we picked up was how many
companies were unaware of the Montreal agreement that lead
to the phasing out of CFC use in PCB cleaning.  The fact is,
we feel, that companies are trying to hold onto their CFC
cleaners as long as possible, and, in many cases, until someone
comes along and tells them to stop using them, they're going to
continue as in the past.  The difference, they are going to find,
is that they will have to recycle the cleaners that they do have,
that no new CFC will be on the market.  In addition, of course,
manufacturers of CFC-based cleaning systems have stopped
making those types of equipment and the market has gradually
moved toward other types of equipment.  There are, however,
other types of solvents that are being used and therefore the
market for solvent cleaners remains.  How long it will remain
depends on how good aqueous cleaners become and how
effective no-clean, fluxless solders become.

MEASURING PATTERNED IC LAYERS 


NIST researchers are developing techniques for measuring the
critical dimensions of patterned layers on integrated circuits.
The work involves theoretical projects on the formation of
images in the optical and scanning electron microscopes as
well as experimental and design projects on the construction of
new metrology instruments for the calibration of standards.
The project was initiated about 15 years ago at the request of
the semiconductor industry. 

The ever smaller dimensions on integrated circuits have
created a demand for new and improved techniques of
measurement and their related standards, especially as feature
sizes approach and become smaller than the wavelength of
light used in conventional optical metrology instruments. The
dimensions of present interest range from about 0.5
micrometers to 30 micrometers and will extend to smaller
dimensions in the future. A series of three line width/pitch
Standard Reference Materials for photomasks is presently in
production. Research is in progress to develop new and
improved standards for use in instruments utilizing optical or
scanning electron microscopy.

IRDAS DETECTS DEFECTS


Test- and quality-oriented engineering research suggests that a
unit under test can be compared to a "golden board" to identify
defective components.  When used in conjunction with
electronic test, this method can reduce the time for
troubleshooting and repairing a circuit.  But it does not address
other issues such as early lifetime component failure, poor
heat sinking or cold solder joints unless thermal output is
significantly different.

At the same time, simple comparison also highlights small
random variations in thermal output resulting from normal
production variations.  As a result, a test person has to make
value judgments to differentiate "acceptable" trouble spots
from real ones.

Motorola Information systems Group (ISG) in Mansfield, MA,
decided to develop a system that could detect circuit boards
that run outside an acceptable temperature threshold despite
passing traditional electronic test methods.  It also wanted a
system that would account for normal variations in thermal
output and thus eliminate arbitrary personal judgment from the
assessment process.  To do this, Motorola built a "model board
image" from the statistical mean of the thermal intensity
images of a large number of boards rather than the image of a
golden board.

The system, called IRDAS, for infrared defect analysis system,
comprises an IR camera interfaced to a UNIX workstation
(SUN Sparc 10/50 with Ethernet interface).  It uses General
Imaging Corp.'s software based upon that company's
ProtoPIPE Object-Oriented Grahical Programming
Environment.  The high-performance IR camera and
sophisticated signal/image-processing software have made this
technology available for the factory floor.

Motorola ISG tested the IRDAS system by developing mean
intensity images for each product type.  The IRDAS system
interfaces a fixture holding the test assemblies to the camera
and powers the assembly to ensure that images are captured at
precise times for analysis.  Three LEDs in the fixture shine
through tooling holes in the circuit to register the board images
during analysis.

The system imaged 30 electrically proven assemblies and
incorporated each pixel into a composite image of this mean-
intensity model for average operational boards.  Then design
data for a particular assembly was downloaded into the system
to create an overlay of components specific to the assembly
being tested.  The LED alignment positions, the template
images for each image time (10, 20, and 30 s) and CAD data
were used to create a test-control file specific to the circuit
assembly being tested.

To test boards from the factory, a baseline thermal reference
image was taken prior to automatic power-up and then the
boards were imaged in the factory-run mode.  The baseline
was subtracted from each image to eliminate random thermal
fluctuations.  The system compared the images taken at each
time to the template for that time, calculated any differences in
thermal intensity and determined statistical significance.  The
system "passed" the assembly if no excessively hot or cold
components were found.  In a "failed" unit, cold areas were
displayed blue and hot areas red.

According to Motorola, analysis shows that IRDAS detects
nonfunctional components by identifying the absence of
thermal output resulting from open circuits or excessive
outputs resulting from shorts, damage or misaligned parts. 
The company is currently trying to determine the limits of
detectability including out-of-specification resistances,
parametric shifts in output and other faults.

NO-CLEAN FLUX CREATES BOARD-PROBING PROBLEMS


Environmental agencies are prohibiting the use of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) because it's commonly believed
that they affect the ozone layer.  Since traditional circuit board
assembly processes relied heavily on CFCs as solder flux
solvents, a replacement process was desperately needed.  One
alternative to cleaning PCBs with solvents is the use of no-
clean fluxes.  While no-clean solder flux solves the
environmental problem, it creates a new problem for test
fixturing, because it leaves a thick layer of residue on the unit
under test (UUT).  Although this "benign" residue will not
affect how the UUT operates, many test probes have trouble
penetrating it; also, nonconductive solids in the residue can act
as insulators and keep test probes from making a good
electrical contact.  There are various techniques  you can use
to alleviate this headache.

Standard test-fixture probes frequently cannot perform
adequately on a UUT coated with flux residue, so probe
manufacturers have developed new models that work in the
no-clean flux environment.  Single-needle probes can usually
penetrate the flux, and they are a popular choice for many
applications.  But the probe tips need to be replaced
frequently.  Even though the normal tip material--beryllium
copper--is a hard material, the tips still wear down prematurely
because of the high forces used to break through the flux.  An
alternate tip material is steel:  It is nearly twice as hard as
beryllium copper and, hence, lasts up to twice as long.  Single-
needle probes are ideal for solder-filled holes or pads, but if
you try using them for through-hole applications, you will get
slipping and side loading, which lead to inconsistent results
and bent tips.  For through-hole applications, you'll find tri-
needle, crown-shaped, or aggressive multifaceted tips to be
more appropriate.  Some probe manufacturers recommend
using rotating probes.  With these probes, the tip rotates
(usually 90 degrees) upon contact with the UUT, drilling
through contamination and making a good electrical
connection.  One obvious problem with this aggressive
solution is that it can damage the UUT; another problem is that
the debris produced by probe operation can clog the rotation
mechanism and disable it, so increased maintenance is
required.

In addition to selecting the optimum tip, you'll also need to
select the right probe spring pressure.  The normal range of
pressure, usually between 4 oz and 8 oz, may not be high
enough to penetrate the layer of residue.  You may need to
experiment with forces of 10 oz or greater.  Increased probe
pressure requires increased upward force on the UUT, which
may create vacuum leak problems.  Here are a few ways to
prevent leaks:

  1.  Use a high-capacity vacuum pump.  A minimum of 25 in.
of Hg and 40 CFM is suggested.  Use a dedicated vacuum
pump for each test area.

  2.  Vacuum volume can be just as important as vacuum
pressure.  Try to use a 10-15 gallon vacuum surge tank for
each test fixture.  This can improve test performance and
reliability by providing faster fixture actuation, which causes
both a better initial seal and a better electrical contact.

  3.  For maximum efficiency, avoid any plumbing restrictions. 
All pipes and hoses should be the largest practical size, and
valves and fittings should have the same inside dimensions as
the pipes, if possible.

Ideally, vacuum alone is all you need to actuate the fixture and
hold the UUT inplace.  If you use many high-force probes,
though, vacuum alone will not do the job, and the UUT may
become deformed or even become damaged because of
unbalanced forces.  To prevent such damage, you must use a
type of overclamp or hold-down gate.  The simplest solution
uses pressure fingers to hold the UUT firmly on the fixture and
to compensate for uneven test probe pressures.  Sometimes,
you'll need to isolate all or part of the UUT from the vacuum,
such as when there are open vias (multilayer feedthrough
connections) or large holes on the board.  Isolating open vias
and large holes minimizes contamination of the vacuum
system by flux residues, but it also exacerbates the uneven test
probe pressure problem, since the vacuum forces are not
present to counteract probe forces.  The probe plate could
deflect if the pressure is excessive; you may need to use a
thicker plate to reduce deflection.  Stress analysis can
determine which fixture components need strengthening. 
Loaded board lids, or vacuum boxes, are becoming more
common; these eliminate the vacuum isolation required when
using oveclamps but do not allow access to the UUT.  A
concentration of high-pressure probes without counterforce
from pressure fingers can distort the UUT, possibly causing
trace fractures or causing surface mount devices to pop off. 
Try to distribute probes evenly, but if you can't, allow space
on the top of the UUT above dense probe areas for pressure
fingers.  Work with the board designer to ensure that there is
space left for the pressure fingers.

The no-clean flux process generates much more residue than
conventional wave soldering, so new preventative
maintenance standards are needed to reduce downtime.  No
single maintenance schedule will work for all test fixtures.  If
you think your test conditions are not too severe, start by
cleaning or replacing probes every 25,000 cycles.  Fixtures
should be cleaned and seals and gaskets serviced every 20,000
cycles.  Be sure to inspect everything more frequently than
20,000 cycles, though, and adjust the replacement interval as
needed; some probes may need replacement after only 3000
cycles.  Try to minimize the impact of no-clean flux on testing
by fine-tuning the soldering process:  allow the board more
time to be heated; control solder paste application; raise the
temperature slightly during reflow; monitor the results; and
adjust all aspects of the process as required to minimize
residue on the test pads.  If possible, work with the designer to
ensure that:

  1.  Vias are not left open and the number and size of holes
are minimized; by attending to these details, you'll prevent
problems with vacuum leaks and eliminate the need for special
test probe tips;

  2.  Test points are evenly distributed over the UUT if
possible, especially on high-density boards;

  3.  The target pads for test probes are big enough to be
accessed repeatedly without special fixturing; and

  4.  There is adequate space for pressure fingers when they are
needed.

You should also work with the fabrication and inspection
groups so they know what types of errors to watch out for. 
You don't want to suddenly have a test point with no
continuity because of an undersized pad or an inaccurately
drilled hole.  Remember that the source of a testing problem is
often somewhere back up the production line.  With proper
design and fabrication, production problems can be
minimized.  There is no magic solution to test fixturing in a
no-clean flux environment.  The more you control a board's
design and manufacturing processes, the easier it will be to
design a fixture and perform a proper test; you'll uncover more
real failures and have fewer false failures due to fixturinig and
probing problems.  After years of fighting to get engineers to
design testable products, test engineers finally saw progress: 
designers began to design boards with enough space between
test points to allow easy and effective board probing.  Now,
the need to make circuits even smaller is causing test
engineers new problems.  But with proper planning, you can
ease the way you test assemblies that use a dense array of
small devices with fine-pitch leads.

Not only are designers shrinking the size of components, but
they are also increasing the number of pins on each
component.  As a result, lead pitches, or the distances between
leads, are becoming finer than ever.  The definition of "fine
pitch" depends on whom you ask.  Some engineers define
"fine pitch" as spacings of less than 0.040 in.  You can even
find some IC packages with lead pitches of only 0.010 in! 
When circuit leads are that close, it is difficult to build a robust
test fixture.  Nevertheless, there are several ways you can help
a product-development team improve the testability of
assemblies that incorporate fine-pitch components:

  1.  Encourage your designers to add boundary-scan
capabilities that will aid interconnect testing.  Boundary-scan
testing was developed to address the problem of circuit
density.  Testing the interconnects of an assembly with
boundary scan requires access to only four test points.  For
boundary scan to be effective, it must be designed into an IC. 
Look for off-the-shelf ICs that have boundary-scan capability,
and ask your designer to put boundary-scan circuits in custom
ICs.  Fortunately, most EDA vendors provide tools that let
designers insert boundary-scan circuits into custom designs. 
You also need a modern ATE that can drive boundary-scan
chains and evaluate test results.  ATE vendors supply test-
development tools that automate the test-program
development.

  2.  Make sure to set the design rules properly in your printed-
circuit board (PCB) layout program.  Most layout programs let
you set design rules and check for rule violations once the
design is complete.  Be sure the settings match the types of
testing you plan to do.

  3.  Add test points that you can probe.  In general, test points
should be in centers that are at least 0.020 in. apart, and the
farther apart you can place them, the better.  Adding test points
lets you better probe a printed-circuit board, but it also may
increase the size of the board or reduce the density of the
circuitry o the board. 

  4.  Pay special attention to fixture design and probe selection. 
Some newer probes let you probe test points on 0.010 in.
centers.  You must, however, handle these probes very
carefully, and you must design and build the fixture so the
probes can maintain their probe-pointing accuracy.  To
maintain the point accuracy, drill the probe's mounting holes
in a very accurate and straight manner.  Other factors that
contribute to pointing accuracy include straightness of the
plunger, clearance between the probe and the barrel, retained
length of the plunger, and extended length of the plunger.

  5.  Send assemblies directly from manufacturing to functional
test, shipping the manufacturing defect test stages.  The
disadvantage of using this approach is that you will have to
rely on your functional test to find manufacturing defects.  If
you select this approach, you should analyze failures carefully. 
When a manufacturing defect causes a failure, quickly send
the failure information back to the manufacturing engineers.

  6.  Use moving-probe testers to probe circuits that you can't
test with fixed-probe fixtures.  Moving-probe test systems are
often the solution of last resort, because they can be expensive,
and they don't test points as rapidly as a fixture with 100 test
points can.  Models are available that let you probe test points
as small as 0.002 in.  Manufacturers of moving probe testers
supply software that uses your printed-circuit board's layout
data to control the prober.

Even if your assemblies have not been designed for testability,
you still have test options.  You should, however, talk to your
designers and persuade them to add testability features to their
designs.  By adding the ability to adequately test products, the
engineers make it easier for you to set up tests and design test
fixtures.

SMTA TO REVISE TESTABILITY GUIDELINES


The Surface Mount Technology Association has undertaken
the revision of its popular publication TP-101A, Testability
Guidelines.  According to Tom Borkes, SMTA Vice President
of Technical Programs, the SMTA Board of Directors decided
that "our members would best be served by revising TP-101 to
bring it up to date" and "by providing a road map to help our
members establish a test strategy for their particular
applications."  The new Testability Guidelines will update and
expand the document's scope and reorganize the material into
a more user-friendly test handbook format.  The contents will
include sections on developing a general test strategy,
establishing a specific product test protocol (including a
discussion of ESS and burn-in), digital and analog testing,
boundary scan and capacitive characterization methods, and a
glossary.

BGA REWORK


OK Industries (Yonkers, NY) announced the all new BGA-
2000 series, BGA rework system.  Ed Zambrowski told us that
the BGA-200, which has a base price on the unit was $11,000,
is like having a small reflow oven at your fingertips.  The
system has been engineered to allow safe, efficient rework of
BGA components.  Utilizing a microprocessor profile
controller, the operator simply selects the appropriate removal
or replacement profile and starts the rework sequence. 
Removal and replacement profiles can be stored, recalled and
edited with the touch of a button, or to guarantee process
control, the profiles can be locked to eliminate operate
adjustment.  The BGA-2000's exclusive Micro Oven design
encapsulates the BGA being reworked ensuring that a constant
temperature controlled environment is maintained throughout
the reflow cycle.  The Micro Oven's proprietary PCB seal
combined with its elevated nozzle vents protect surrounding
components from adjacent heating damage normally
associated with non-focused convection heating devices.  The
BGA-2000's exclusive dual path heater module, bypasses the
heater chamber during cool-down ensuring a controlled, rapid
cool-down protecting solder ball integrity.

The closed loop temperature control feed back system
maintains the Micro Oven temperatures at +/-5o C, protecting
delicate components and ensuring accurate reflow process
control.  The BGA-200 offers 2 modes of operation:

  1.  Removal--with 5 pre-programmed removal heating
profiles; and
  2.  Placement--with 15 pre-programmed reflow profiles.

The BGA-2000 provides four temperature controlled zones in
each profile:

  1.  Subzone/Pre-heat;
  2.  Soak;
  3.  Peak; and
  4.  Cool-down.

Each of the profiles parameters (time/temperature) is digitally
displayed on the BGA-2000's front panel.  Operators can store
an additional 25 removal and 55 replacement profiles in the
BGA-2000's on-board profile storage locations.  An optional
RS-232 interface allows the operator to display, edit, monitor
and run profiles on the BGA-2000 directly from a PC.  An
additional thermocouple input is provided for remote
monitoring (i.e., under the component for profile set-up), and
is displayed on the BGA-2000 front panel or on the PC
through the RS-232 interface.  In addition to BGAs the BGA-
2000 can also rework QFPs, PLCCs and many other SMT
components, utilizing the full range of FCR SMT nozzles.

ASIAN MARKET STILL GOOD


The Asian market for SMT repair equipment has always been
different than the U.S. market.  Here boards, destined for
military or aerospace applications, for example, were
expensive and repair a necessity.  Asian manufacturers were
interested in boards destined for consumer electronics.  They
worked very hard to get their lines running as efficiently as
possible and when mistakes were made, the boards were
simply discarded.  The Asian market was, traditionally,
dominated by the Japanese.  When the Japanese market
slowed down, the market for SMT equipment generally
slowed down too, except that at about the same time the
Japanese market was slowing down, the Korean market, in
particular, was heating up.

In terms of the attitude of Asian manufacturers toward SMT
repair equipment, we found in talking to SMT repair
equipment manufacturers that the nature of the market was
still about the same.  These are still high volume
manufacturers and they spend less time repair boards than U.S.
manufacturers do, except that with an increase in the use of
some advanced packages, such as multichip modules and
BGAs, there is a slight improvement in the amount of repair
work being done.  The more significant change in the market
is, though, geographical.  Whereas the Japanese market
dominated the area tremendously five years ago, now the
Korean market, particularly, is very good, along with the
market in Taiwan and Singapore.

Additionally, with the growth of Asian markets outside Japan,
there has been a great deal of prototyping work which has
drawn in a lot of rework equipment from the United States. 
Altogether U.S. manufacturers were finding the Asian market
as good as it ever was or much better.  One company saw their
equipment being bought in part as a means to help
manufacturers improve their processing lines rather than just
to repair boards.  When problems began occurring, boards
could be examined with the rework station and the cause of the
problem determined.  Sales in Asia often came through Asian
reps although some sales to Asia originated in the United
States with U.S. companies that have manufacturing facilities
in Asia, particularly in Singapore.

While the trend toward automation was evident to most
manufacturers, there was the feeling that much of the market
was still interested in semiautomatic and manual equipment. 
Machines designed for BGA work were the ones that got the
company's name in the trade journals, but customers were
mostly interested in equipment that allowed them to quickly
remove and replace SOICs and other less glamorous
components.  But the market for BGA repair equipment is
definitely here and growing.  Sales are coming from larger
manufacturers right now, since these are the companies using
BGA packages the most.  As much as 20% of the larger
manufacturers are probably buying BGAs and repair
equipment for PCBs with BGAs.  By the end of the years,
however, the market for BGA repair equipment, it's felt, will
have spread to larger contract manufacturers.

Chipmaster Simplifies BGA Rework 

The Chipmaster from A.P.E.  (Key Largo, FL) is another system designed for BGA
rework.  Jim Dornan told us the unit was developed for work at Motorola and
was sold as part of Metcal's line.  The unit sells for $3,800 and provides a
single station BGA and SMT repair solution.  The Chipmaster organizes the
rework environment while addressing the problems of BGA and SMT component
repair, by providing better process control and less maintenance.  With the
Chipmaster, the replacement consumables are limited to a simple vacuum cup.
The Chipmaster X-Y table dictates and creates the reflow and placement
topography and becomes the "engine" which drives the bench allowing an
ergonomic arrangement of bench management.  With the Chipmaster being the only
true BGA machine designed for Motorola at an equipped price of $3,800, it
represents a sensible cost effective answer to tomorrow's components today.

METCAL OFFERS TO CUSTOMIZE TIPS 


The Metcal (Menlo Park, CA) Custom Talon Tip Program ensures that Talon
users can get custom tips in a fraction of the time of a normal custom tip
program or production release.  The program fills in the gap for the majority
of end-users with customized tip requirements between readily-available
standard tips and those with highly specialized configurations.  There is no
minimum order for custom tips; however, it order to achieve time and cost
goals, certain limitations have been placed on the program in terms of
guidelines.  For example, tips must meet certain dimensional requirements,
must be for 2-sided component removal only, and be in the 500 and 600 series
temperature ranges.  Other requirements and restrictions apply.  Custom tips
which fall outside the shape, temperature range, or other guidelines can be
accommodate, but not as part of the program.

"Composites represent what  may really be the last opportunity for the USA

"Composites represent what  may really be the last opportunity for the USA to
achieve a world-wide dominance once again in a manufacturing area."
-- Brandt Goldsworthy (Plastics Hall-of-Famer and winner of the
SPE Hyatt Award and the SME Composites Manufacturing Award)
This is why we want to encourage innovation and judicious risk-taking. . . .


     We applaud the NIST Advanced Technology Program (see Page Three) for
that reason.  Take for example the program awarded to the team led by DuPont
to develop composites manufacturing for large structures for civil
infrastructure applications.  This effort will be largely directed to
construction and retrofit of bridge structures -- an area of great need.
The approach will be to use an embryonic technology involving resin
infusion, with the prospect of reducing costs by at least 30% while
producing high-quality structures.  Further, according to J. Michael Bowman,
DuPont V.P., the plan is to reduce time to market by at least 50%.  This
will be accomplished by concurrently developing and validating the
processing technology and rapidly deploying it to large commercial
structures.
     Another good example of innovation and willingness to take risk is the
recent award of a $750,000 contract to Textron Specialty Materials by the
Dept. of Energy.  TSM will develop and fabricate "in a cost-effective
manner," high-strength hot-gas filters with "greatly enhanced durability."
The approach is to modify TSM's continuous fiber-reinforced ceramic
composite (nitride-bonded SiC).  The goal:  the next generation of hot-gas
filters for use in combustors and power-generation systems.
     NIST and Dept. of Energy, as well as the contractors involved, deserve
our praise. (As one reader observed, we might contrast these efforts with
the limited commitment to composites made by ARPA in its TRP program;  see
Vol. 10, No. 4, Page Two.)
                                        -- George Epstein, Editor

NACFAM OBSERVATIONS ABOUT TRP . . .

     The National Coalition for Advanced Manufacturing (NACFAM), a
non-profit, non-partisan association of companies, technology centers, trade
associations, and technical education associations, seeks to raise the U.S.
industrial base to world-class levels of productivity, quality, and
competitiveness.  As such, it was a strong supporter of the legislation that
created the Technology Reinvestment  Project  (TRP).
     In its analysis of the TRP program to date, NACFAM addressed the
successes and failures.  "The awards have gone to a series of worthy
projects. . . .  However, experience in the first year of the "RP has also
pointed to some problem areas that need to be worked out."  These include
the need to revise the costly proposal writing process;  acceleration of the
contracting process;  and broader participation by small business. -- We
agree, and hope that ARPA  takes these observations seriously, recognizing
that this constructive criticism is meant to make the TRP a more valuable
program for the U.S.

RUSSIA:  QUITE ADVANCED IN COMPOSITES TECHNOLOGY

     In connection with McDonnell Douglas Aerospace's agreement with the
Russian Central Research Institute, Ken Drake of The Aerospace Corp. had the
opportunity to view some composite structures developed in Russia, including
a 4-ft. diam. interstage adapter.  It "had a very crisp lattice structure
and showed a high degree of advancement in manufacturing technology," he
told us; and he cited potential weight and cost savings of 25-50%.  Drake
noted that the Russians typically do extensive development before starting
production;  and they require robust designs and processes.  Once the item
is released to production, it is built to drawing or it gets scrapped. --
This policy avoids a lot of the paperwork and concomitant costs related to
non-conforming hardware, that is typical in U.S. defense and aerospace
programs. -- Editor

phone: 510/847-9500) prepares to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy (see last
issue), business continues.  Of special interest to our industry, a search
is underway for a permanent CEO to replace John J. Lee who was asked to
serve in that capacity since January 1994 during the reorganization.  (Lee
will likely remain as a director of the company and serve as a consultant
for strategic planning.) For the third quarter ending Oct. 2, 1994, Hexcel
incurred an operating loss of $7.3 million (compared with a loss of $44.6
million for the same quarter in 1993).  This loss includes an $8 million
provision for costs associated with its joint venture with Dainippon Ink &
Chemicals,  in which Hexcel owns a 50% interest, for the production and sale
of advanced composites, nonmetallic honeycomb, and decorative laminates for
the Japanese market.  DIC-Hexcel is to be either restructured or liquidated.
With the sale of its Chandler, AZ plant to Northrop Grumman in November (see
last issue), Hexcel will now concentrate the majority of its U.S. honeycomb
manufacturing at the Casa Grande, AZ, plant.

     Texas Almet Inc. (Arlington, TX;  phone:  817/649-7056) will become a
specialized distributor of Hexcel's honeycomb materials throughout  North
America.   Almet  will  focus on small  and expedited orders without minimun
quantity requirements.  Hexcel will directly support customers for large
volume orders.  (Note:  Texas Almet produces machined honeycomb parts for
overhaul and repair of aircraft.)   Also, Hexcel is exploring the sale of
its resins business, which will help provide operating cash .

FY'95. Even before the election in November, the joint Senate-House
appropriations conference committee had passed a bill that retains all major
DoD programs. Based on the original budget, there will be some spending cuts
which will be spread across the programs.  The final appropriations were
$820 million below the Clinton Administration's request but $3.5 billion
higher than the FY'94 spending level..  The F-22 advanced tactical fighter
will receive $2.35 billion; the Navy's F/A -18E/F fighter gets $1.34
billion;  the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft receives $467 million.  The bill
appropriated $607 million for the Milstar satellite program that had been in
danger of cancellation.  The Army's Comanche scout/attack helicopter will
receive $495 million.  All of these make extensive use of composites and
adhesive-bonded structures.  In addition, the bill appropriates $550 million
for the DoD Technology Reinvestment Program (TRP;  see Vol. 10, Nos. 3 and
4). There had been some hope of a TRP budget of $625 million.  Also,
Congress has called on DoD to place special emphasis on the TRP program.

CALTRANS:  COMPOSITES FOR BRIDGE REHAB/RETROFIT

     On November 4, 1994, the California Department of Transportation
(Caltrans) held a special kick-off meeting to inform industry of its new
program entitled "Caltrans Program for the Evaluation of Fiber-Reinforced
Plastics for Seismic Retrofit and Rehabilitation of Structures."  According
to Mohsen Sultan, Chief of the New Technology Management Branch at Caltrans,
Division of Structures (P.O. Box 942874, Sacramento, CA  94274;  phone:
916/227-8247), the primary focus will be seismic retrofit  and methods for
strengthening bridge structures. The program is planned as a cooperative
partnering effort between Caltrans and the industry, with likely
participation from other government agencies.
     Among the approximately 100 people in attendance were representatives
of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Univ. of Calif. at San
Diego (UCSD is a key participant in the ARPA and FHWA bridge programs),
aerospace companies, SPI/CI, SACMA, as well as both U.S. and foreign
companies (Japan and Canada). Sultan made it clear that foreign
participation will be welcomed as long as it contributes to the success of
the program.
     Jim Roberts, Director of the Caltrans Engineering Service Center, noted
that Caltrans has had several limited studies underway on seismic
retrofitting, which suggest the potential of composite wrapping around
concrete columns.  This new program is intended to develop a generic
specification  reflecting the need to replicate the design and process in
the field and performed under field conditions;  it will establish design
guidelines and ensure repeatability and consistency.  The approach is to
apply composite material around concrete bridge columns to provide
restraint, thereby confining the column so it won't explode under load.
Composite wrapping will be competing with the current approach which uses
heavy steel jacketing.  (Steel jackets are now being installed as part of
the seismic strengthening program in California.  However, installation is
difficult and costly.  Sections are welded together, resulting in joints
that are difficult to inspect and are subject to corrosion.)
     There are a number of issues that must be addressed in establishing the
specification for seismic retrofit/rehabilitation:  materials selection,
processing, and design;  standardized testing methods to verify performance;
quality control/assurance;  and system performance criteria -- to ensure
long-term durability and performance under all environmental highway
conditions. The program  also will develop data as well as design guidelines
that can be applied on a nation-wide basis.  Caltrans expects the program to
serve as a "springboard" for other applications of composites in highway
construction.
      According to Ray  Zelinski, Chief, Seismic Technology, Bay Bridge
Design Group, there are about 4500 state and local bridges that require
retrofit;  it is hoped to complete the task in about five years.  He sees
this program as providing means for bridge repair.  Every earthquake leaves
some bridge structures in need of "quick repair," he said.  Other states
also have need for bridge strengthening.  In addition to bridge columns,
there is need for strengthening of superstructures, for which composites
might be applied.
     Caltrans plans to have the USAF Advanced Composites Program Office at
McClellan Air Force Base, and The Aerospace Corp. (El Segundo, CA) as key
members of the government team.  In addition, Caltrans is establishing
academic and engineering consultants advisory panels.
     %   Industry presentations were made by a number of organizations.  Dr.
Gil Hegemier of UCSD described his team's related efforts and offered to
make the information available for the Caltrans program.  Japanese companies
have made a sizable investment and are already applying composites in
building and highway construction, although to date only a little work has
been done in retrofit of bridge columns.  Representatives of several foreign
companies discussed their capabilities and experience -- including Bayex of
Canada;  and Mitsubishi Chemical, Obayashi Corp., and Sumitomo Corp. of
Japan.
     Ed Fyfe,  president of Hexcel-Fyfe, reviewed his company's efforts  in
wrapping of bridge columns.   He noted that wrapped columns had been tested
at the Univ. of Calif., San Diego laboratory, demonstrating their
effectiveness in improving the ductility of the concrete.  A number of
bridge columns, he said, are already in operation in California.  Several
materials manufacturers and prepreggers briefly described their companies'
products that might be useful in these applications.

NHTSA ACTION WILL IMPACT USE OF CARBON/EPOXY  NGV TANKS

     The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the Dept.
of Transportation (DOT) is planning to increase the burst safety factor for
carbon fiber-reinforced composite tanks.  These tanks are being used for
storage of compressed natural gas for natural gas vehicles (NGV).
     In March, NHTSA plans to issue Standard 304, Compressed Natural Gas
Containers, which will require a burst safety factor of 3.33;  whereas the
currently accepted ANSI/AGA NGV2 standard and ISO/TC 58 SC 3/WG 17 drafted
in 1993 specify a value of 2.25.  This increase would result in substantial
weight and cost increase -- possibly forcing carbon fiber composite tanks
out of the market for NGVs in the U.S., according to Peter Plate, No.
American Sales & Marketing Manager, EDO Canada Ltd. (1940 Centre Ave., N.E.,
Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2E 0A7;  phone:  800/361-8265), one of the major
manufacturers of such tanks.  He stated that  weight savings through the
successful certification of these tanks has "opened new markets for NGVs,
particularly buses and lightweight passenger cars, which had previously been
hampered by the excessive weight of metal and fiberglass tanks."  (Note:
The EDO tanks use a seamless thermoplastic liner, over which the carbon
fiber/epoxy composite is filament-wound.)
     The burst factor of 2.25 was developed by the NGV industry working with
the American Gas Association, and approved by the American Standards
Institute. Tests are required to verify ability to withstand severe impact,
damage (cuts), puncture by gunfire, extreme temperatures, exposure to
corrosive gas contaminants, exposure to fire, and repeated pressure fills.
Acceptance of the 2.25 burst factor is supported by a number of
organizations, including the Federal Transit Administration, the Dept. of
Energy, the Calif. Highway Patrol, the Texas Railroad Commission, and the
National Fire Protection Association.
     Apparently the NHTSA is anxious to ensure that only safe vehicles will
be put on U.S. roads, and lacks confidence in the reliability of the carbon
fiber composite tanks.  Note:  Carbon fiber composite tanks are not
vulnerable to sulfuric acid which had caused the rupture of two
fiberglass/epoxy composite tanks. (See Vol. 11, No.1, Pages Eleven and
Twelve.)  Meanwhile, foreign manufacturers likely would not be impacted by
the higher safety factor.  Unless amended or postponed because of industry
protests, the new standard is scheduled to take effect on March 27, 1995.

SURFACE TRANSPORTATION MATERIALS ROADMAP DEVELOPED

     In response to Dr. Mary Good, Undersecretary for Technology, U.S. Dept.
of Commerce, an ad hoc industry committee has developed a technology
insertion plan for the application of advanced materials (especially
composites) in surface transportation.  Objective is low-emission, lighter,
and more fuel-efficient vehicles at dramatically reduced cost.   The
committee consists of 14 private sector organizations, chaired by Jerry
Fields, Vice President of Atlantic Research Corp.  (Other members:  Alcoa
Composites, American Flywheel Systems, Amoco Performance Products, Detroit
Diesel, Dow Chemical, Eno Transportation Foundation, General Electric, GHL,
Hardcore Composites, Lanxide, Materials Sciences Corp., Northrop, and TMA
Int'l.).
     The committee's efforts are intended to complement and support related
Federal initiatives, especially the Advanced Technology Transit Bus (ATTB --
see Vol. 9, No. 4, Page Seven), the Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles (PNGV), the DoE Transportation Sector Materials Technology Program,
the NIST  Advanced Technology Program (ATP) on Manufacturing Composite
Structures, and the ARPA Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Technology (EV/HEV)
program.

%   A Well-Conceived Approach
     The approach recommended by the industry committee calls for an orderly
introduction of advanced composites into successively larger-scale surface
transportation applications.  Purpose is to demonstrate feasibility in a
variety of highly visible applications so as to instill confidence for both
the vehicle manufacturers and end-users, and promote a robust advanced
materials manufacturing infrastructure that will grow as markets expand
and/or emerge. Key is the selection of composite materials application
targets:  near-term (1-3 years) -- light-duty electric vehicles, bus frames
and bodies, rail car components, locomotive cab structures, truck trailer
beds, automotive seat frames, and marine fenders;  mid-term (3-6 years) --
brakes and suspension components, CNG fuel tanks, automotive drive train
components, flywheel energy storage systems, passenger rail cars, trailer
frames, glazing, a fifth wheel, and an electric vehicle chassis;  and,
long-term (6-9 years) -- automotive engine components, design methodology
and standards, Class-A finish body components, monocoque automotive
structures.

NATURAL GAS VEHICLES (NGVS) ARE OFF AND RUNNING . . .

     Having resolved the concerns resulting from the ruptures of two
composite NGV tanks (see Vol. 11, No. 1, Pages Eleven and Twelve;  and Vol.
10, No. 4, Pages Four-Six), the automotive industry is moving ahead with
plans to introduce more NGVs into the market. In addition to General Motors
with 2500 NGV pickup trucks on the roads, Ford and Chrysler are offering
fully warranted NGV trucks and vans;  and, for the 1996 model year, Ford
will offer a Crown Victoria NGV car. Also, NGV buses are already in
operation in many cities in the U.S., with composite tanks generally mounted
on the vehicle roofs to avoid loss of passenger space.
     Southern Calif. Gas and San Diego Gas & Electric now have 70 NGV
refueling facilities in So. California; hundreds more will be available in
the next five years.  Ultimately, about 10% of all service stations will be
able to deliver compressed natural gas.  Travelers at Los Angeles Airport
(LAX) will soon be able to ride (in comfort) on NGV Super Shuttle vans.  The
company is in the process of converting its entire L.A.-area fleet of 145
vans to natural gas. Mesa Corp., the Texas natural gas producer owned by
Boone Pickens, is putting up NGV refueling stations at both LAX and John
Wayne Airport in Orange County, Calif., to serve both the Super Shuttle
fleet and the public.
     Meanwhile, the Applied Physics Lab. at Johns Hopkins Univ. has designed
an advanced NGV car under an $800,000 contract from the Dept. of Energy, the
Gas Research Institute, and several gas companies.  The new design will
permit the car to travel 300 miles without refueling -- whereas the current
vehicles are limited to about 150 miles.
     The Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition estimates that 5 million NGVs --
trucks, vans, buses, and cars -- will be on the U.S. highways by the year
2000!

%   Advantages Are Significant;  Few Disadvantages
     NGVs have important advantages over conventional gasoline-powered
vehicles: Key is much lower pollution, satisfying most state vehicle
emissions requirements.  Natural gas is readily available in the U.S.  NGVs
lend themselves to standard automotive industry assembly-line production.
Fuel cost per mile is about one-third less than gasoline.
     A major challenge is developing the infrastructure to handle the
refueling and servicing of NGVs.  NGVs are somewhat heavier in order to
accommodate the storage of compressed natural gas.  To the extent that tanks
are stowed in the trunks, less trunk space is available.  Current NGV costs
are as much as $4500 more than comparable gasoline-powered vehicles.
Improvements in storage space and lower costs are expected as the industry
becomes more mature.

BOOK REVIEW . . .  CARBON FIBER COMPOSITES

     by Deborah D. L. Chung (Director of the Composite Materials Research
Laboratory at the State Univ. of New York at Buffalo);  published by
Butterworth-Heinemann (313 Washington St., Newton, MA  02158;  phone:
617/928-2500).  Publ. 1994. 225 pages.  Price:  $89.95.
     This book is a significant contribution to our industry, covering all
types of carbon fiber-reinforced composites.  Major emphasis is on materials
technology; although there are a few notable omissions -- e.g., cyanate
ester resins and rayon-based carbon fiber used in high-temperature
applications.  More discussion would be desirable on composites processing,
joining, repair, and inspection. Applications are discussed to a limited
extent.
     Nevertheless, this book is a valuable resource, providing a wealth of
information and data on various types of carbon fibers;  surface treatments
and fiber-matrix bonding;  and properties of polymer-matrix, metal-matrix,
carbon-matrix (carbon-carbon), ceramic-matrix, and hybrid composites.  Each
chapter contains numerous literature references that makes the book even
more valuable.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SAMPE TECHNICAL CONFERENCE
(October 18-20, 1994;  Atlanta, GA)

%    Composites:  Growing in Aircraft;  Future is Attractive -- But . . .
       At a special plenary session on "Advanced Materials Applications,"
Dick Hadcock, vice president of RNH Associates (6 Sue Circle, Huntington, NY
11743; phone:  516/271-7037) reviewed the evolution of composites in
aircraft structures.  Starting in 1940 with glass fiber-reinforced polyester
radomes and drop tanks, aircraft structural applications have grown steadily
in both variety and quantity.
       Glass/phenolic firewalls were introduced in 1944.  It was in 1952
when glass/epoxy became available and has since been used extensively in
radomes, rotor blades, floors, doors, control surfaces, empennages, wings
and fuselages. Glass/polyimide radomes, firewalls, and high-temperature
ducts were introduced in 1960.  By 1969, aircraft were using boron/epoxy
composites in stabilizers, rudders, reinforcements and patches for repair of
other structures. That same year, carbon fiber/epoxy composites were
introduced in stabilizers, wings, fuselages, air brakes, control surfaces,
spoilers, doors, floors, inlet ducts, cowlings, and thrust reversers.
Kevlar/epoxy was introduced in 1971 in radomes, fairings, and
leading/trailing edges.  Carbon fiber/polyimide engine inlet ducts and flaps
were produced in 1974.  Carbon fiber/BMI composites in wing flaps, strakes,
wing/fuselage skins, stabilizers, engine casings, and thrust reversers were
introduced in 1978.  Carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastics were first
introduced in stabilizers and wing ribs in 1988.
       Concomitantly, composite structural weight in U.S. aircraft has
experienced a dramatic rate of growth.  In 1960, use of composites on the
A-6A was just 200 lbs.  By 1970, the F-14A was introduced with 521 lbs. of
composites.  The F/A-18A had 1320 lbs. in 1978;  the AV-8B used 1615 lbs. in
1981.  Currently the F/A-18E/F is using 2820 lbs.  And the F-22A will soon
be in service with 5680 lbs. of composites.
       Foreign military aircraft have likewise taken advantage of composites
structures.  According to Hadcock, the French Dassault Mirage F1 used 150
lbs. of composites when it went into service in 1976, increasing to 1200
lbs. in the Mirage 2000 in 1978;  and then 3200 lbs.in the Rafale C/M in
1991. Russia has also used composites in its aircraft;  the Mikoyan MiG-29
fighter, introduced in 1977, uses about 1000 lbs. of composites in the
empennage and control surfaces. The Swedish SAAB Gripen fighter, which first
flew in 1989, uses 1250 lbs. of composites for wings, canards, control
surfaces, and doors.
       Military  transports and bombers use large quantities of composites.
The Ukranian Antonov An-125 heavy transport (1984) uses 12,000 lbs. of
composites; and the McDonnell Douglas C-17A (1991) uses 15,000 lbs. for
control surfaces, fairings, doors, and nacelles.  Composites usage in
bombers has grown from 10,000 lbs. in the bomb bay doors, fairings,
longerons, and nacelles of the Rockwell B-1B (1984) to about 50,000 lbs. in
the wing skins, control surfaces, and doors of the Northrop B-2A (1989).
       The growth in airliner applications is also quite remarkable.  The
Boeing 757 was introduced in 1982 with 3800 lbs. of composites. The
McDonnell Douglas MD-11 (1990) uses 11,000 lbs. and the new B-777 is using
about 30,000 lbs. per vehicle!  Since 1983, Europe's Airbus usage of
composites has grown from 9900 lbs. on the A310 to 25,000 lbs. on the new
A330 and A340 (1991).
        In 1988, the French/Italian ATR-72 became the first fully certified
airliner with a CFRP wing.  (Note:  This is the aircraft that  recently was
involved in the American Eagle Flight 4184 crash in Indiana during a severe
rain storm, killing all 68 people on board.  Initially, there was some
speculation that the composite structure may have been at fault;  however,
icing is considered the most likely cause. An earlier version, the ATR-42
was known to have icing problems.)

%   The Future is Bright
       In terms of world-wide aircraft production, Hadcock expects that
military and civil aircraft will require over 6 million lbs. of composites
in 1995.  He predicts usage will approach 15 million lbs. by the year 2010.
Civil aircraft will account for 80-90%.
       Hadcock's data was part of a study conducted for the NASA Langley
Research Center, Advanced Composites Technology (ACT) Office, to chronicle
the lessons learned during the past 25 years while composite structural
components for aircraft were being developed, produced, and put into
operation.
       Conclusions:  Composites are accepted as alternatives for metals in
aircraft structures.  Advantages include weight savings and improvements in
corrosion and fatigue resistance.  Use of composites will expand, but
composite parts do cost more than aluminum;  special skills are required for
maintenance and repair;  and there is need for standardized materials and
processes specifications.

%   A Changing Environment
       Chairing the plenary session on "Advanced Materials Applications," Cecil
Schneider, Manager of the Advanced Structures & Materials Division of Lockheed
Aeronautical Systems (Marietta, GA), discussed some of the changes taking place
in the aircraft industry that are bound to have a profound effect on materials
technology, including composites and adhesives.
       "Affordability," he said, "is the key design driver for future DoD
systems."    For commercial aircraft, "life cycle and direct operating costs
are the key design drivers," he added.  This means reductions in fabrication
cost, development time, and operations and support costs, in addition to
lower materials costs.
       Challenges to materials technology include weight reduction,
increased fatigue life, and higher structural temperatures.
       Schneider called for a "paradigm shift in design philosophy."  In the
past, contractors treated almost everything as proprietary;  there was
little sharing of data.  The trend is for increasing collaboration with
government agencies and other companies in the industry, including teaming
up on important programs.  From this, he expects there will be important
spin-offs of the aerospace technology to commercial applications -- such as
buses, autos, Maglev rail transportation, shipping, and construction.

%   Barriers to Composites Applications
       Dr. Andy Pickard, Vice President of Engineering at Rolls-Royce (Atlanta,
GA),        addressed the barriers that composites must overcome in order to
realize new applications in commercial and military markets.  For composites to
gain acceptance in aircraft gas turbine engines, with which his company is
concerned, the customer needs to have confidence that the technology will
satisfy his requirements.  Key issues are predictable and consistent
performance, integrity and reliability (including cyclic life), maintainability
and customer support, repairability,  environmental friendliness, and low cost
of ownership.
       The cost  barrier includes material cost, processing cost (of
particular concern for metal-matrix composites), evaluation cost, and the
high cost associated with usage of "niche materials" that are produced in
low volume.  On the other hand, Pickard noted that system cost reductions
may be possible by reducing weight in many applications.  This would be a
special advantage for composites in competing with other structural
materials.

%   NIST Advanced Technology Program Will Grow
       Another special plenary session at the SAMPE Technical Conference
focused on technology transfer.  Speakers representing the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Sandia National Lab., the
Washington Technology Connection, NASA, and the Air Force Wright Labs.
described their respective organizations' efforts to transfer technology
from aerospace/defense to commercial applications.
       Dr. John P. Gudas, program manager for NIST's Advanced Materials
Advanced Technology Program (ATP), expects that NIST's budget will steadily
increase over the next few years:  $199.5 million for FY'94;  $431 million
for '95;  $543 million for '96;  and $744 million for '97.  NIST has
committed $150 million over the years 1995-1999 to invest in its ATP
designated "Manufacturing Composites Structures."
       Areas of interest include composites in offshore applications,
automotive and infrastructure.  To be placed on the NIST mailing list,
phone: 800/ATP-FUND.    The objective is to support industry efforts in
high-risk areas which can lead to U.S. economic growth, Gudas explained. All
ATP programs are cost-shared.  Funding is not provided directly to
universities, federal labs., or non-profit organizations.

%  Expert System for Adhesive Selection
       The American Joining Institute (AJI, 10628 Dutchtown Rd.,  Knoxville,
TN 37932;  phone:  615/675-2150) is computerizing adhesive bonding
technology.  In 1991, the firm was awarded a Phase I SBIR program from the
Naval Research Lab. which led to the development of an expert system for
selecting adhesives for 44 different adherends, "almost every type of
engineering material joining need," according to Robert B. Allen of AJI.
Twenty-six different adhesive families are included.  JOINADSELECT will
identify the primary and secondary adhesive materials to satisfy the user's
requirements.
     Co-authored by Allen and Hans H. Vanderveldt of the American Welding
Institute, the paper describes how the effort has now advanced into the next
phase with additional support from ARPA  to develop JOINEXCELL (Joining
Expert Manufacturing Cell).  This is a computer-aided software tool to
facilitate joint design and will consist of expert systems that interact
with the user and a series of databases to accomplish various tasks within
the joining sequence. Expert systems include the Joining Scheduler, Joint
Selection, Joint Designer, Adhesive Selection, and Curing Process Selection.
Efforts are underway to collect adhesive test data for incorporation into
the databank.

Environmental Regulations Can Have Serious Impact
       Environmental, health, and safety (EHS) regulations are having a
major impact on processes used in the aerospace industry.  Speaking at a
session on Adhesive Bonding/Surface Preparation/Composite Repairs, SAMPE
president Susan Ruth of The Aerospace Corp. (El Segundo, CA) explained that
"development of a substitute chemical or elimination of a process will not
be a trivial matter in many instances."  Part of the problem is deciding how
best to qualify a substitute material or process.
       She described an example of a program impact:  A subcontractor had
developed an assembly using an adhesive system that relied on methylene
dianiline (MDA), a hazardous air pollutant (HAP).  During development a new
health and safety regulation was issued which necessitated a change.  There
were two alternatives.  One approach would require compliance with the
regulation, for which the cost would be about $250,000.  The second
approach, which was deemed preferable, was to switch to an adhesive and
primer system that do not contain MDA.  Specifications were modified
accordingly to accommodate the new materials, and process validation was
initiated.  However, problems soon emerged "with the ability to reproducibly
generate the required mechanical properties," necessitating further process
development.  Not only was there a schedule delay of approximately 10
months, but further work also had to be done by both the adhesive
manufacturer and the company  "to make the material and the process
production-ready."

%   Grid-Lock( is a unique sandwich structure developed by Tolo Inc. (2401
S. Pullman St., Santa Ana, CA  92705;  phone:  714/261-8656).  It uses
tongue-and-groove joints along with adhesive to attach machined or molded
cores to metal or composite skins.  The skin-to-core bonds in the interfaces
become shear joints, and thus are substantially stronger than conventional
filleting-type honeycomb core-to-skin bonds.  Claims:  greater damage
tolerance; improved dynamic response (harmonic suppression) and structural
stability; simplified quality assurance, ability to incorporate attach
points, flanges, edge close-outs and end fittings;  and greater design
flexibility.  Some recent and potential applications:  antenna mast
supports;  AV-8 bulkhead; telescope/mirror support structures;  and modular
assemblies.  The technology is covered under U.S. Patent No. 5,273,806.
     Note:   And we believe this type of sandwich structure could be ideal
for space applications to avoid the necessity for venting.

LASC PRESIDENT SPEAKS ON "RE-ENGINEERING/LEAN MANUFACTURE OF COMPOSITES"

James A. Blackwell, president of Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co.
(Marietta, GA) was the keynote speaker at the recent SAMPE Technical
Conference in Atlanta, GA.
     Our aerospace/defense environment is changing.  There are no major
powers threatening world stability.  The defense budget is shrinking;  and
military aircraft manufacturers are consolidating.  (Prior to 1945 there
were 14 U.S. prime military contractors.  With the proposed Lockheed/Martin
merger, 1995 will leave just 5 prime contractors.)  In order to survive, the
remaining contractors must establish a lean enterprise--focusing on selected
markets;  re-engineering the organizational structure; overhaulng the core
processes;  developing advanced technologies;  and achieving reductions in
total costs.  Expected benefits:  greater customer satisfaction;  best value
products;  and greater shareholder value.
         LASC is organizing by  business lines to co-locate personnel on a
project basis;  and the management structure is "being flattened" (25%
reduction).  Programs are being organized to implement integrated product
teams. Computer integrated systems are being applied to overhaul the core
processes, including materials, design, fabrication, assembly, and business
systems.  Lean fabrication is concentrating on focused factories to include
composites, fiberglass/honeycomb, welding, wiring, painting,  tubing,
machined parts, small extrusions, and bench assembly.  Also, the factory
will use a paperless shop order system.  These and other  changes are expect
to be completed in 1997.

        The composites focused factory will co-locate all relevant processes
and include updated equipment such as automated ply cutting and
laser-projection for ply layup.  Improved quality and cost reductions are
already being realized. ---- "Look ahead where the horizons are absolutely
unlimited."  ---  Robert E. Gross, founder of Lockheed Aircraft

SPACE APPLICATIONS NEW

     McDonnell Douglas Aerospace (Huntington Beach, CA) is continuing to
work on the Delta Clipper (DC-X) vehicle to demonstrate technology for a
reusable, single-stage to orbit launch vehicle.  Responsibility for the
program has been transferred to NASA.  The current one-third scale model
will be upgraded to a two-thirds model -- making even more extensive use of
advanced composites for significant weight savings.  If all goes well, the
next step would be a full-size flight model.
       The composite aeroshell was damaged in a recent test when an
accumulation of vapors from the propulsion system caused an explosion.  The
aeroshell is being repaired in preparation for further tests.
     Meanwhile, NASA has announced plans to award a $24 million, 13-month
contract to study the X-33, a heavy-lift vehicle intended for both
government and commercial payloads.  McDonnell Douglas is expected to team
up with Boeing;  the other contenders are likely to be Lockheed and Rockwell
International.  If the X-33 program continues as planned, NASA would fund a
second phase in 1996 for the construction and test of an X-33 prototype.
Over $600 million would be allocated for this effort.
     Subsequently, industry would be expected to make the heavy investment
to produce a fleet of the vehicles.  To a large extent, this decision would
be made based upon whether DoD would use the X-33 for military missions.

%   Potential Conflict with DoD
     Recently the Air Force announced plans to upgrade the currently
available expendible launch systems -- the Titan, Delta, and Atlas --  into
a single family of launch vehicles.  The Air Force would invest as much as
$2 billion for this effort.
     According to Richard del Bello, Assistant Director for Aeronautics and
Space Policy for the Administration, these programs represent no conflict.
The DoD effort would serve medium-term needs for the military; the NASA X-33
program looks to the long term.

UPDATE:   THE CARBON-PHENOLIC  SITUATION

     The  problem is still serious because of its potential impact on launch
vehicles that are essential to U.S. defense systems, but a solution appears
to be at hand.
     There is a single source, with limited capacity,  for the
Aerospace-grade rayon fiber qualified for conversion into carbon fiber
suitable for use with phenolics in high-temperature propulsion system
components.  Fortunately, the situation has been somewhat ameliorated by the
downturn in the aerospace industry so that available supplies are adequate
for at least several years.
     For the long term, the plan (and hope) was to use readily available
PAN-precursor carbon fiber as an alternative.  After considerable R&D by the
NASA Solid Propulsion Integrity Program, it was indicated that low-fired PAN
may be suitable.  Accordingly, tests were conducted last year using large
subscale motor firings -- but the PAN-based materials did not perform well.
Considerable "pocketing" occurred.
     Still hopeful, it was then decided to retest the PAN-based carbon
material with the same phenolic resin.  But this time, several processing
modifications were evaluated.  Parts made with lower-resin content prepreg
performed well! Thus it was demonstrated that, with suitable M&P
optimization, low-processed PAN-based carbon fiber can provide a relatively
low-cost and stable supply replacement for the Aerospace-grade rayon.

ALERT . . .
Stripping coatings from Composites

     Environmental and safety regulations have virtually eliminated the use
of chemical strippers for removal of paints/coatings.  Increasingly,
industry is resorting to dry mechanical stripping processes such as blasting
with solid beads or powders.  For both composites and metals, blasting with
either plastic beads/powder or wheat starch has been found to be quite
effective.

       However, plastic media are more aggressive and can damage the surface
of composites -- esp. resin removal, leaving fibers exposed.  Wheat starch
is quite effective and less prone to cause damage to composite substrates.

THE DoD PLAN FOR SPACE LAUNCH MODERNIZATION
Composites Likely to Play Important Roles

       Lt. General Thomas S. Moorman, Jr., head of the Air Force Space
Command, recently briefed key government and congressional committees on the
results of a study requested by Congress as part of the FYU'4 Defense
Authorization Act. The study was considered necessary because space launch
is regarded as a critical issue for America's future in space.
       Four options are offered -- ranging from merely sustaining the
existing system (the least costly) to developing a reusable launch vehicle
(the most costly but of the greatest long-term value).  Among the most
significant findings and recommendations: %   The DoD core space launch
technology is significantly underfunded. %   A number of areas need to be
addressed for cost reduction, including improving the reliability (the high
cost of failure) and reducing operations costs. %   A heavy-lift launch
vehicle capability is required for the foreseeable future. %   There is a
general concensus on the potential  benefits of a new, reusable system --
but there are widely divergent views on timing, approach, cost, and risk.  A
cooperative DoD/NASA technology maturation effort is recommended. %   DoD
and NASA space launch programs need to be better coordinated.  The study
recommends DoD be responsible for expendable vehicles and NASA take the lead
for a reusable system.
%   DoD should continue to monitor the development of small launch vehicles
but let the commercial market take the lead.
%   Lightweight structures and reusable launch vehicle technologies are
areas of special interest that need to be addressed.
       These findings and recommendations  translate into more emphasis on
composites technology for weight savings;  heat-resistant composites;
life-cycle cost reductions (including manufacturing costs);  improved
reliability and quality control (especially robust designs, in-process
controls, and non-destructive inspection);  more standardization;  and
repair technology.

COMPOSITES FOR SERVICE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES

       The NASA Advanced High-Temperature Engine Materials Technology
Program (HITEMP) is developing extensive technology on advanced composites
for high-temperature applications.
       During FY'94 and FY'95, NASA  plans to spend $13 million on R&D in
this area, including 49 contracts to industry and 13 university grants, as
well as in-house efforts.  In addition, NASA has funded a large
interdisciplinary grant program with Pennsylvania State University as part
of its HITEMP project.
%    The 7th Annual HITEMP Review was held October 24-26, 1994, sponsored by
NASA Lewis Research Center. Presentations emphasized polymer matrix
composites for use up to 600 degrees-700F, metal-matrix composites up to
2200 degrees F, and ceramic-matrix composites for use up to 3000 degrees F.
       Of special interest, Textron Lycoming (Stratford, CT) and Brunswick
Composites (Lincoln, NE) are collaborating to apply composites as
replacements for metal components in turbine engines to save weight and cut
cost.  To date, the team reports a 30% weight savings and 10% cost
reduction;  much of this was achieved by reducing the number of detail parts
in the assembly.  Current efforts are directed at the fabrication of a
net-shape compressor case by filament winding using a polyimide resin with
S-2 fiberglass and carbon fiber reinforcements for the inner skin (exposed
to hot gases) and a carbon fiber/epoxy outer skin, adhesive bonded to a
polyimide honeycomb core.
       A report also was presented on the Metal-Matrix Composite Life
Cooperative effort.  Participants are Allison Engine, AlliedSignal, GE
Aircraft Engines, Pratt & Whitney, Textron Lycoming, and Williams IntUl,
along with NASA Lewis Research Center and the Air Force Wright Laboratory.
Working through the Ohio Aerospace Institute, a joint Air Force/NASA
contract has been received; and the cooperative is working with the
University of Texas, San Antonio, to obtain a NASA grant. The team hopes to
develop a system for predicting the operating life of titanium metal-matrix
composites as structural components in gas turbine engines.

     Nippon Oil Co., Ltd. (NOC) and Nippon Steel Corp. (NSC) are planning to
join forces to form a new carbon fiber manufacturing organization.  Both
companies separately have been developing pitch-based carbon fiber
technology;  the 50-50 joint venture would take advantage of these
capabilities.  In addition to production of pitch-based carbon fibers, the
new company (name TBD) would produce and market  fabrics and prepregs.  The
fibers will be produced at the NSC Hirohata Works;  also NOC would transfer
equipment from its Yokohama Refinery to Hirohata.  Prepregs would be
produced under contract at both NOC and Nippon Steel Chemical Co. (NSCC).
The decision for go-ahead is expected in time to permit startup in April.
     NOC has concentrated on applications in communication and broadcast
satellites, and the sporting and leisure goods markets.  NSC has developed
carbon fiber materials for applications in the construction market,
including the unique NOMST (Novel Material Shield-Cuttable Tunnel-Wall
System) and repair of civil engineering structures.  Because NOC and NSC are
not competitive in their markets, the joint venture appears beneficial to
both companies.

NOTEWORTHY . . .

       Our readers are excellent sources of interesting information.  Often
we receive leads for follow up;  frequently the information is worthy of
being passed on directly via the Newsletter.

%   Don Schmidt (the carbon-carbon expert) provided information about
durability of adhesive bonds -- very important!   A recent study at LTV
Missiles (now part of Northrop) sponsored by the Air Force Wright Lab.,
showed that degradation of metal-to-metal adhesive bonds occurs due to
corrosion -- a filiform mechanism between the base metal and the oxide
"grown" by the surface preparation. "Edge-sealing of bonded joints could be
a big factor in preventing loss of bond durability."

%   Ken Drake (the composites expert at The Aerospace Corp.) told us about a
new satellite that will be ALL COMPOSITE!  Forte (Fast On-orbit Recording of

T50/ERL 1962 carbon fiber/epoxy will be used, based on extensive flight
history. The satellite will be made of composite sections, bonded together
to form an egg-crate configuration.  The payload will be designed to
demonstrate technology for detection of  nuclear testing events to help
monitor treaty provisions.  The Forte is scheduled to be launched by Pegasus

Mid-IR Laser
Likes it Warm

A team of scientists from the Naval Research Laboratory and the
University of Houston Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center (SVEC) has
developed a mid-infrared solid-state laser that operates at near
room temperature.

According to Shin-Shem Steven Pei, SVEC's associate director for
research (Tel: 713/ 743-3621, E-mail: spei@uh.edu), lasing was
observed at temperatures up to 285K. "This is by far the highest
operating temperature for an interband transition laser at this
wavelength," he explained. "We now have a device that works with a
compact thermoelectric cooler instead of a unwieldy cryogenic
system, and room-temperature operation is just around the corner."

The new laser is an optically-pumped InAs/GaInSb/AlInSb type-II
quantum-well structure producing light at a wavelength of 4
microns. The device was fabricated from materials produced by SVEC
and then tested at the NRL. The NRL/SVEC team is now optimizing the
material growth and device design for diode lasers that can produce
sufficient power at 3 to 5 microns without cooling. Currently, SVEC
scientists are also testing a more advanced quantum-cascade laser
design, which should produce higher-intensity light with less
electric current while emitting within either of two atmospheric
transmission windows of 3 to 5 microns and 8 to 12 microns.

Lasers emitting in these windows have many important industrial,
medical, and military applications, such as IR radar for vehicle
and air traffic control, medical diagnosis, eye-safe covert
illumination for night vision, free-space communications, and IR
countermeasures.  Further, since many gases absorb strongly in
these windows, these lasers are ideal for remote chemical sensing.
This large class of applications includes pollution and greenhouse-
gas monitoring, drug and explosives detection, chemical process
control, and leak detection.  The projected market for these IR
systems will approach $1.5 billion by 2001 if efficient and compact
IR sources are available.

The semiconductor lasers used in most consumer devices emit at much
shorter wavelengths. Long-distance telephone networks use 1.3 and
1.5 micron lasers in their optical fiber systems, and a 0.8 micron
beam reads music and data from CDs.  (By comparison, visible light
ranges from about 0.4 to 0.7 microns.) However, water vapor readily
absorbs light with wavelengths outside the atmospheric transmission
windows, restricting its range.  Gas lasers operating within the
windows are too bulky and expensive for most commercial
applications.

InGaN LEDs with
Quantum Wells

Shuji Nakamura of Nichia Chemical Industries Ltd. (Dept. Of R&D,
491 Oka, Kaminaka, Anan, Tokushima 774, Japan), in a paper
presented at the Materials Research Society's Fall Meeting,
reported the successful growth of high-power blue, green, and
yellow light-emitting diodes with quantum-well structures.  The
devices are based on III-V nitrides and were grown by metalorganic
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on sapphire substrates.

The single quantum-well (SQW) structured LEDs are described in
contrast to InGaN/AlGaN double-heterostructure devices.  The latter
produce high-power output in the blue and blue-green regions with
a broad emission spectrum represented by a full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of 70 nm and output power over 1 mW.

The SQW LEDs feature a thin InGaN active layer, from which a high-
power emission with a narrow emission spectrum is obtained.
Typical FWHM for green LEDs of this type is 45 nm, 20 nm from blue
devices, and 90 nm from yellow devices.  Power output from the same
LEDs were 1 mW, 4 mW, and 0.5 mW respectively, all at 20
milliamperes.  The drop in output power with the emission
wavelength increase from blue to yellow was noted.

One primary goal of the research was to improve the performance of
green LEDs.  Those made from GaP and AlInGaP exhibit emission
wavelengths of 555 and 570 nm and external quantum efficiencies of
0.1% and 1% respectively.  The SQW LED described by Nakamura
achieved a quantum efficiency of 2.1% at a peak wavelength of 525
nm, a pure green emission.  The 555 and 570 nm emissions are
described as yellowish green.

InGaAs Photodetectors
Set a Record

A record low dark-current operation of InGaAs (1.55 micron) p-I-n
Photodetectors on silicon and GaAs has been reported in Applied
Physics Letters.  The authors, led by F. E. Ejeckan (School of
Electrical Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853; E-
mail: felix@ee.cornell.edu), fabricated the photo conductors by
first bonding the p-I-n epitaxial layers, followed by chemical
removal of the host InP substrate from the p-I-n structure, after
which the photodetector was fabricated on top of the exposed p-I-n
layers.

Bonding of the photodetector to the substrate is done as efforts at
heteroepitaxial growth have not met with success due to the
inherent material defects present in devices grown by this method.
Bonding eliminates these material defects, but the films often are
mechanically weak and thermally unstable.  The technique employed
by the authors of bonding by atomic rearrangement (BAR) avoids this
weakness and obtains a covalently bonded interface free of defects
other than crystallographic misfit.

Under 5 volt reverse bias, dark currents down to 57 pA on GaAs and
290 nA on Si were measured.  A external quantum efficiency of 80%
was deduced from the responsivity at 1.55 microns of 1 A/W, and the
series resistance across the bonded interface was 17 ohms for GaAs
and 350 ohms for Si.

Low-Temperature
Growth Method

A chemist at Washington University (St. Louis, MO 63130) has
discovered a new method to grow semiconductor crystals at
temperatures far lower than ever reported.  The method is the first
to use solution-phase chemistry to grow the micrometer-sized
crystals of indium phosphide (InP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and
indium arsenide (InAs) at low temperature.  The semiconductors made
by the new method may be used in devices such as light-emitting
diode displays, laser pointers, grocery scanners, compact disc
players, and computer components.  The breakthrough offers
intriguing possibilities for developing integrated devices
consisting of semiconductors and polymers, plastics, or composites.

Present ways of growing semiconductor crystals prohibit combining
other materials with the semiconductors because of the very high
temperatures required to grow the crystals.  Crystals are currently
produced at temperatures of 500 oC-1,200 oC, but the method William
E. Buhro (Tel: 314/935-4269, E-mail: buhro@wuchem.wustl.edu),
associate professor of chemistry, has discovered allows growth at
200 oC.  Buhro's technique, the solution-liquid-solid (SLS) growth
method, is similar to the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) gas-phase growth
method that has been used for some 30 years.

Buhro and other materials chemists had been stymied by the
nonmolecular structures of the semiconductor materials, which do
not allow crystal growth from conventional solvents at low
temperatures.  Buhro made a solution suspension of indium and
indium-gallium nano-sized metal droplets.  The droplets are the
sites from which the semiconductor crystal compounds InP, GaAs, and
InAs (type III-V semiconductors) nucleate and grow.

Buhro explains, "We refer to this as the solution-liquid-solid
mechanism, a three-phase system where the chemistry occurs in
solution, then elements of the semiconductors are deposited into
the liquid--the molten metal droplets--and the product crystallizes
out as a solid."  An important goal in materials chemistry is to
turn down the heat on solid-state synthesis.  This new method
expands the range of possibility for these semiconductors.

Optical AND Gate in
Ge-Doped Silica Guide

An all-optical programmable AND gate has been fabricated in a
germanium-doped silica waveguide (P.M. Ranon, Air Force Technical
Applications Center/TXO, 1030 S. Highway A1A, Patrick Air Force
Base, FL 32925; E-mail: pmranon@crusher.aftac.gov).  The gate
consists of the Ge-doped silica planar waveguide, a Q-switched and
a mode-locked Nd:YAG laser and coupling two fundamental frequency
beams into different guiding modes of the waveguide along with a
second harmonic beam coupled into one guiding mode.

The waves interfere in the guide, generating a set of semi-
permanent second-order susceptibility gratings that generate second
harmonic light.  When optically programmed, the second harmonic
light behaves as an output of an AND gate with a signal-to-noise
ratio of 17 dB.

The waveguide was produced by ion-beam sputtering of silica and
germanium (6 atomic %) onto an optical grade silica substrate to a
thickness of 2.0 microns.  Indices of refraction were 1.532 and
1.546 at the fundamental (1064 nm) and second harmonic wavelengths
(532 nm), respectively.  The second harmonic of the film had  an
output of 150 mW.  This type of gate is expected to be able to be
extended to other logic functions, with an electronic NOT gate
possibly forming a complete set.

Room Temperature Si
High-Vacuum Bonding

Bonding of 4-inch silicon wafers has been done at room temperature
in ultrahigh vacuum conditions.  After local initiation of the
process, it is essentially self-propagating, with resultant bonded
wafers having bulk-like properties.  According to U. Gosele (Max
Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics, Weinberg 2, D-06120
Halle, Germany; E-mail: goesele@mpi-msp-halle.de), this is in
contrast to the current technological process, which requires
heating to 700oC to reach the required bonding strength.

Commercially available 4-inch (100 mm) Si wafers were etched in
dilute HF to remove the oxide and to make the surfaces hydrophobic.
Two wafers were bonded in a microcleanroom set up at room
temperature and then transferred to an UHV chamber that was pumped
down to 3x10-9 Torr.  The wafers were separated, and the residual
hydrogen volatilized by raising the chamber temperature to 600oC-
800oC.  After cooling to room temperature, the wafers were rebonded
with an estimated bonding speed of greater than 1 m/sec, in
contrast to the bonding speed in atmospheric conditions of 0.01
m/sec.  High-resolution transmission electron microscopy showed the
bonded interface to lack any defects aside from the unavoidable
crystalline mismatch at the interface.

Thermal Annealing
Improvements in GaN

Rapid thermal annealing of GaN in argon or nitrogen at temperatures
up to 1100oC has been shown to improve surface morphology and
photoluminescence in Applied Physics Letters.  Atomic force
microscopy characterization, done by a group led by J. C. Zolper
(Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM 87185-0603; E-mail:
jczolpe@somnet.sandia.gov), showed the average root mean square
surface roughness to decrease from about 4 nm to about 1 nm after
annealing at 1100oC.  Band-edge luminescence intensity was
increased by a up to a factor of four after a 1100oC anneal, which
improves the ratio of the band edge to deep-level luminescence and
also reduces the electron concentration and mobility.

These developments will enhance GaN-InN-AlN materials technology,
with which a number of improved electronic and photonic devices
have been developed.  Reduction in  the electron mobility can be
explained in terms of  two-band conduction mechanism or an
increased compensation ratio.  The improvement in surface roughness
might be attributed to quenching of the high-temperature surface
state, but more work is required to explain the mechanism behind
the improved photoluminescence of GaN with thermal annealing.

Spire Wins Contract to
Push GaAs Technology

Spire Corp. (1 Patriots Park, Bedford, MA 01730-2396; Tel: 617/275-
6000, Fax: 617/275-7470) announced earlier this month the receipt
of a contract from the Naval Research Laboratory for the continued
development of gallium arsenide (GaAs) monolithic complementary
heterojunction bipolar transistor (CHBT) push-pull power amplifiers
and operational amplifiers.  Power amplifiers have applications in
phased-array radar and mobile phone communications, while
operational amplifiers are used broadly in analog electronics that
require high-speed analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog
converters.

The company will use selective metalorganic chemical vapor-
deposition techniques to integrate both Npn and Pnp HBTs on one
wafer in a planer topography. Pascale Gouker, manager of
Microelectronic Structures at Spire, said that though the research
will be done on 2-inch GaAs wafers, 4-inch wafers will eventually
be qualified for use by the developed technology.

Heat Treatment for
PTCR Barium Titanate

Semiconducting barium titanate (BaTiO3) is of interest for a
variety of applications but is difficult to manufacture due to the
necessity of preferential distribution of dopants in the titanate
grains and the sensitivity of the positive temperature coefficient
of resistance (PTCR) performance to the heat-treatment schedule
used to sinter the microstructure of these electronic ceramics.
Prof. Vasantha Amarakoon at Alfred University (New York State
College of Ceramics, Alfred, NY 14802; Tel: 607/871-2497) reports
in the Journal of the American Ceramic Society  the effects of heat
treatment on PTCR behavior.

The PTCR behavior occurs as a result of either doping BaTiO3 with
an aliovalent ion or heating in a low-oxygen atmosphere that
reduces Ti4+ to Ti3+.  Electronic conduction occurs up to the Curie
temperature (about 120oC) where the resistance increases by several
orders of magnitude.  The necessity of achieving uniform
distribution of liquid-phase additives (excess barium, tin) is
dealt with by using a gel-coating process of the grains.  The PTCR
effect is seen to develop when the material is cooled to the
annealing temperature, as the grain boundaries rapidly oxidize when
the liquid phase there solidifies.  Oxygen diffusion continues
during annealing and cooling, which increases the PTCR response.

11.4 MHz Transmission
Ultrasonic Transducer

Surface micromachining of gold-coated, nitrided, oxidized, highly
doped p-type (100) silicon has been used to fabricate novel
capacitive, ultrasonic air transducers at 11.4, 9.2, and 3.1 MHz.
The transducers consist of circular silicon nitride membranes
suspended above the heavily doped silicon.  Electrostatic forces
attracting the membrane towards the Si are resisted by stresses in
the membrane when a voltage is applied, so the membrane returns to
its original position when a voltage oscillation is switched.  Igal
Ladabaum (E. L. Ginzton Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford,
CA 94305; E-mail: igal@leland.stanford.edu) and coworkers report in
Applied Physics Letters  that their devices have a bandwidth range
of 5-20%.

Detection of 10 MHz capacitance fluctuations as small as 10-18
farads can be made, corresponding to displacements on the order of
10-3 Angstroms in a bandwidth of 2 MHz and a signal-to-noise ratio
of 20 dB.  The detection sensitivities obtained can withstand more
than 100 dB of signal attenuation, which makes these devices of
interest for ultrasonic imaging, nondestructive evaluation, gas-
flow and composition measurements, and range sensing.  These
properties are a marked improvement over piezoelectrics for air
applications that suffer from a six-order-of-magnitude difference
in acoustic impedances between air and piezoelectrics.

AT&T Dials Up New
Way to Passivate GaAs

AT&T IPM Corp. was issued U.S. Patent 5,464,664 on Nov. 11, 1995,
for a downstream ammonia plasma gallium arsenide (GaAs) passivation
technique that claims fast, stable, room-temperature operation.
The inventors are Eray S. Aydil, Konstantinos P. Giapis, and
Richard A. Gottscho.

A workpiece with an exposed GaAs surface is passivated by placing
the workpiece in an evacuated chamber and generating an ammonia
plasma between 10 and 30 cm from the workpiece and  causing the
plasma products to flow downstream into contact with the workpiece.
The plasma gas pressure is held between 0.5 to 6.0 Torr, and the
exposure time should be sufficient to increase the
photoluminescence intensity of the gallium arsenide by at least a
factor of 10, which is said to be more than five minutes.

Though the patent abstract specifies a  substrate temperature of
less than 100oC, it also specifically states that the process can
be done at room temperature.  The workpiece should also not be
placed within line-of-sight of the plasma to avoid UV, visible, and
x-ray radiation-induced damage for a time sufficient to increase
photoluminescence intensity from said gallium arsenide by at least
a factor of 10.

Diffusion Barrier
Method Patented

AT&T was issued U.S. Patent 5,468,689 on Nov. 21, 1995, for a
method for preparing a silicon nitride gallium diffusion barrier
for use in molecular beam epitaxial growth of gallium arsenide.
The inventors are John E. Cunningham, Keith W. Goossen, William Y.
Jan, and James A. Walker.

The technique involves reacting nitrogen and silane in a ratio of
less than 300:1 in a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor-deposition
apparatus to form a silicon nitride layer.  This layer is deposited
on a reflowable glass layer previously deposited on a (100) silicon
substrate oriented 3 degrees off axis and bearing a thin film of
silicon dioxide.  Finally, GaAs is deposited by molecular beam
epitaxial growth on the silicon nitride layer.  The technique is
said to be of interest for use in the monolithic integration of
interconnected GaAs/AlGaAs double heterostructures, modulators, and
silicon MOSFET structures.

Hughes Develops
Improved HEMTs

Hughes Aircraft Co. was issued U.S. Patent 5,471,077 on Nov. 28,
1995, for a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) and a method
for its fabrication.  The inventor is Marko Sokolich.  Improvement
in the device results from alloying the diffusion layer.

The resulting HEMT includes a diffusion barrier, made of titanium
nitride, that prevents gate-metal diffusion into the substrate
during fabrication and a sacrificial platinum alloy layer that
forms the Schottky barrier.  The titanium nitride layer is formed
on a platinum layer, and sufficient heat is applied to cause the
platinum layer to alloy with the gallium arsenide layer forming a
platinum gallium and a platinum arsenide alloy layer and Schottky
barrier.

All the platinum is consumed in this method, so precise control of
the thickness of the gate layer is achieved, and diffusion of the
platinum gate layer into the gallium arsenide layer during later
processing steps is eliminated.

Hg-Based Superconductors
Challenge Researchers

A paper presented by Paul Chu et al (The Texas Center for
Superconductivity and Dept. Of Physics, University of Houston,
Houston, TX 77204; Tel: 713/743-8212) at the fall meeting of the
Materials Research Society focused on research underway on mercury-
based high-temperature superconductors, the homologue series,
HgBa2Can-1CunO2n+2+d [Hg-12(n-1)n or HBCCO] with n = 1, 2, ...7.

They were first found by a Swiss team in Zurich to be
superconducting at temperatures up to 134K.  Later, the Houston
group raised the superconducting temperatures of these compounds to
a record-high temperature of 164K by squeezing the sample, making
it possible for the first time to achieve the superconducting state
by the use of household air-conditioning technology.

These materials exhibit an impressive current-carrying capacity of
up to 1 million amperes per square centimeter at 100K, observed by
the IBM group at Yorktown Heights after making the compound into
the thin-film form.  The figures translate to a theoretical limit
of about 10 million amperes per square centimeter at the liquid-
nitrogen temperature of 77K.

Chu said that because of the simple and subtle crystal structure of
the compounds, specifically the linear Hg-O coordination that
allows a large cation-doping range, scientists are given the
opportunity to peer into the effects of atomic arrangement and
doping on the occurrence of superconductivity at high temperatures.

Some of the experimental results on these compounds have
demonstrated the limits of and the modifications needed in some of
the prevailing models of high-temperature superconductivity.  A
superconducting quantum-interference device (SQUID) was made from
this compound and operated at the unprecedentedly high temperature
of 114K by the IBM group.

However, he added that the mercury-based compounds are rather
unstable.  Usually, they are not easy to make in pure form, and
they decompose easily at the high temperatures required to shape
them into practical forms, such as wires for power transmission and
generators.   This is to say that Hg is lost at temperatures above
350oC.

Recently, progress has been made in this respect.  By doping the
compounds, the synthesis of the materials has been simplified and
the materials so prepared become more stable.  Preliminary success
has been achieved in wire-making.  Small single crystals of the
compounds have been obtained with high enough quality for
scientific study.

However, more material improvements are needed before these new
compounds can become a material of practice. Chu was not available
to elaborate on these topics at press time.  Look for a follow-up
in next month's issue.

Optical Waveguides of
Alumina Thin Films

Alumina waveguides formed by reactive rf magnetron sputtering were
studied by researchers at Massachusetts Insitute of Technology and
Hanscom Air Force Base (Lionel O. Bouthillette, Optoelectric
Components Branch, Hanscom AFB, Bedford, MA 01731-2909) as a
candidate material for optical waveguides.  Use of sputtering to
form alumina films enables it to be deposited in the amorphous
state, removing the necessity of achieving a crystallographic match
with the substrate.  The researchers describe in the Journal of the
American Ceramic Society amorphous alumina films deposited at
temperatures up to 800 oC and varying oxygen flow rates in the
deposition chamber.

The refractive index of the amorphous alumina films averaged 1.65
over a transmission range of 200 nm to 7 microns with reproducible
losses of 1dB/cm at a 632.8 nm wavelength.  A refractive index of
greater than 1.4 is desirable for compatibility with silicon
technology and less than 1.8 for coupling with fibers.  The
chemical inertness, adherence, hardness, wear resistance, and
mechanical durability of alumina films additionally makes these
materials suitable for waveguide applications.

Lightning Optical Picks
Up Two SBIR Contracts

Two Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contracts totaling
almost $700,000 have been awarded to Lightning Optical Corp. (431
E. Spruce St., Tarpon Springs, FL 34689; Tel: 813/938-0092, Fax:
813/938-9493). Gregory J. Quarles and Arlete Cassanho, director of
research and senior research scientist, respectively, at Lightning
Optical, will head up the programs.

The first is a $600,000 Phase II award from NASA Langley and will
be in support of solid-state laser materials development at NASA
Langley's Flight Electronics Division.  The SBIR is effective
through 1997 and covers the crystal growth of highly-doped
Cr:LiSrAlF6 (LiSAF) for diode-pumping applications.

The program's primary emphasis is for the company to make use of
their proprietary Czochralski fluoride growth technique to develop
and commercialize a reliable source of LiSAF materials.  The
characterization and optimization of the furnace thermal
characteristics and various growth parameters and their impact on
the crystal structure during the growth process will be included in
the development.

Quarles noted that the Phase II award follows a $65,000 Phase I
program completed in July 1994, which proved that the material
could be grown and losses minimized.  Lightning Optical's process
results in LiSAF ingots about 25 mm in diameter and 170 mm in
length.

The second award is a $71,500 Phase I contract from the Department
of Energy and will be in support of component development for Laser
Technology for Chemical Analysis and Nonproliferation Activities
for DOE.  The SBIR is effective from Sept. 1, 1995, to March 23,
1996.

The emphasis of the research will be crystal growth and
characterization of Cr-doped LiSrGaF6 (LiSGaF) for diode-pumped,
solid-state laser applications.  A second focus is on the
development of environmentally rugged ultraviolet coatings for
nonlinear crystals.  The final area of research is the measurement
of thermo-optical parameters and laser efficiencies of Cr:LiSAF and
Cr:LiSGaF under identical conditions.  The purpose of this testing
is to determine which material is more robust and better suited to
the applications.

Display Panels Made
from Plastic Wrap

U.S. Patent 5,469,020 was issued on Nov. 21, 1995, to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a flexible large-screen
display that has multiple light-emitting elements sandwiched
between crossed electrodes.  The inventor is Bradley R. Herrick
(Lincoln Laboratory, Cambridge, MA 02139; Tel: 617/981-3356).  The
resulting panels are especially well adapted to inexpensive flat-
panel TV screens or exceptionally large flat-panel displays whose
geometry is not limited to flat surfaces, but may take on curved or
cylindrical configurations.

The patent abstract explains that active light-emitting components
are integrated into a thin, flexible, plastic-wrap like film to
provide an exceptionally large continuous display in which the film
contains densely distributed light-emitting elements that are
addressed by a grid of transparent conductors.  Inexpensive bulk
processing techniques are used to produce plastic wrap with
embedded components completely through the film to permit
activation via a row-column matrix.  The displays are comprised of
a flexible film having two opposing sides and a pair of crossed
electrodes on either side of the film.  A number of light-emitting
elements are dispersed in the film and extend from one side of the
film to the other, sandwiched between the crossed electrodes.  The
light-emitting elements are small enough to permit numbers of the
elements to exist at a crossover.

The topological layout provides mass redundancy of components,
spatial decorrelation of component yields, and dramatic reduction
in registration problems of metallic interconnects.  The design can
be used for electroluminescent tape in automotive pin striping and
sign applications, for flexible glue-on displays, and for video
displays such as workstations, HDTV, theater screens, and
billboards.

Herrick explained that the patent is based on theory for the time
being, and that no working models currently exist.  He also said
that calculations indicate that the thinner the plastic the better,
and he would initially be working with films in the 10 to 100
micron thickness range.  The concept involves placing up to
hundreds of diodes in a single pixel, making the technology most
suitable to displays larger than 60 inches diagonally and scaleable
to even larger sizes.  He is currently assembling a production team
and says the only real problem is the same one faced industry-wide
-- blue diodes.

The Payoff in
No-Clean

Low-residue soldering processes now being used by the electronics
industry in manufacturing military equipment are saving time and
money while reducing pollution, according to a recent task force
report.

Texas Instruments reports that since it received permission to use
low-residue soldering for work done under more than 60 military
contracts, it has reduced its materials-processing costs for
printed circuit boards by 96 percent. Texas Instruments was one of
nine companies and military organizations that collaborated with
the U.S. Department of Energy in a task force evaluation of the use
of such processes for making military components. The task force
was organized by Sandia National Laboratories, a DOE multiprogram
national laboratory.

Conventional processes for soldering printed wiring boards use an
activated rosin-based flux prior to soldering to remove oxidation.
Oxidation also is prevented by doing the soldering in a sealed
nitrogen chamber. The rosin-based flux leaves a tacky residue that
previously was removed with ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbon
(CFC) solvents. It has been estimated that solvents used to clean
electronic equipment accounted for 24 percent of the consumption of
CFCs in the United States.

Low-residue processes eliminate the need for these CFC cleaning
solvents by using a mild organic acid as the fluxing agent. These
organic agents, such as the common food additive adipic acid, leave
little residue and require no cleaning.

When the Low-Residue Soldering Task Force was organized in 1993,
low-residue processes were being used for commercial applications,
but the Department of Defense required that use of the low-residue
processes to manufacture military equipment be negotiated on a
contract-by-contract basis. The task force was charged with
evaluating these processes for general use in manufacturing
military electronic components.

Sandia researcher Ron Iman (Tel: 505/844-8834) chaired the task
force, which consisted of 17 core members and a team of more than
100 people from 17 companies, three military services, and 12
laboratories and technical centers.

The task force tested low-residue processes at four manufacturing
sites -- Texas Instruments, Hughes Electronics, Alliant
Techsystems, and AlliedSignal's Kansas City Division. Each company
used low-residue processes to produce 80 test printed-wiring
boards. After extensive testing, the task force concluded that
these boards were as good as those manufactured by using rosin
flux.

For confirming the value of the low-residue soldering processes,
the task force was recognized with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's 1995 Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award.
Stephen O. Anderson, deputy director of the EPA's Stratospheric
Protection Division, called the task force's findings "one of the
most important soldering reports of the decade."

Besides Sandia and the four companies, other organizations
participating in the task force were the Naval Air Warfare Centers
(China Lake, CA, and Indianapolis, IN); the Army Missile Command
(Huntsville, Ala); the Air Force Materiel Command (Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base); and the Electronics Manufacturing Productivity
Facility.

Jeff Koon, a Texas Instruments process engineer who served on the
task force, says Texas Instruments is now using a low-residue
process in its production facility in McKinney, Texas. Using the
process is saving more than $300,000 annually in materials costs,
Koon says. It also is simpler to use and saves time in the
production process.

Koon says the low-residue process is friendlier to the environment
in several ways. It eliminates the need for CFCs and other noxious
cleaning materials, and it significantly reduces the amount of lead
dross produced during the manufacturing process.

Book-to-Bill Down, but
Billings Hit New High

The Semiconductor Industry Association reports its preliminary
book-to-bill ratio for the North American market in December
dropped slightly from November's figure of 1.10 to 1.09.  However,
billings for the month came in at a record $4.43 billion, up 38.4%,
or $1.23 billion, over December of 1994.

Additionally, the book-to-bill ratio also indicates that, despite
the record, bookings continue to strongly outpace billings.  The
ratio indicates that for every $100 billed, the industry registered
$109 in new orders.  Overall, billings rose 0.5% over November's
figures, and bookings declined from the November record of $4.87
billion to $4.82 billion.  Preliminary figures for 1995 show that
billings for the North American semiconductor market rose 39.8% to
$46.9 billion.

Commerce Department
Reduces Export Controls

Action by the Commerce Department to reduce export controls that
create obstacles such as licensing burdens and delays for U.S.
semiconductor companies drew nothing but praise from the
Semiconductor Industry Association (181 Metro Drive, Suite 450, San
Jose, CA 95110; Tel: 408/436-6600, Fax: 408/436-6646).  The new
regulation, which went into effect Dec. 20, liberalizes export
controls on certain semiconductor devices shipped to China, the
republics of the former Soviet Union, and certain other
destinations for civilian end uses.

In a statement released to coincide with the start of the new
policy, SIA President Thomas W. Armstrong said, "This modernization
of export controls on semiconductors will greatly reduce needless
and costly licensing delays and burdensome paperwork.  These
reductions will lead to further export opportunities in areas with
major growth potential over the next decade."

The SIA notes that commercial semiconductors represent one of the
least controllable and most widely available high-technology
products in the world today.  Further maintenance of the old export
controls would have damaged U.S. industry without making any
material contribution to U.S. security.

Armstrong added, "The Commerce Department has made substantial
progress in the reduction of outmoded export licensing
requirements.  Continuation of this export liberalization process
to reflect the end of the Cold war will only stimulate business
opportunities and job creation."

In a related development, SIA also reported that the foreign share
in the Japan market for semiconductors rose more than 3% in the
third quarter to 26.2%.  Though no specific figures regarding the
U.S. share of the increase were available, Armstrong touted the
competitiveness of domestic chip makers as well as the U.S.-Japan
agreement as major factors.  SIA spokesman Jeff Weir said that
indications pointed to a "substantial" U.S. share in the increase.

Armstrong also added that "strong relationships between the U.S.
and Japanese industries are being built," which would not have been
possible without the agreement.  Weir emphasized the SIA's support
for renewal of the pact, due this year, which is meeting some
resistance in Japan.

Alpha Metals
Acquires SMT

Alpha Metals Inc. (600 Route 440, Jersey City, NJ 07304; Tel:
201/434-6778, Fax: 201/434-6548) has acquired Screen Manufacturing
Technologies Inc., a Santa Clara, CA-based producer of chemically

The deal expands Alpha's line of stencil products used in the
assembly of circuit boards.  The company also develops and
manufactures solders, cleaners, preforms, fluxes, and solder creams
in no-clean and water-soluble formulations.  Ian Fleck, product
manager for Alpha, called the acquisition a "natural fit for both
companies.  This enables Alpha to become a single resource for
electronic manufacturers with wide-ranging process needs."

Radiance Process Is
Technology of the Year

IndustryWeek Magazine has chosen Radiance Services Co.'s (4405
East-West Hwy., Suite 512, Bethesda, MD 20814; Tel: 301/654-0228,
Fax: 301/654-1034) Radiance Process as a Technology of the Year
award winner.  Radiance Services was one of only five companies or
institutions so honored.

The novel system cleans wafer surfaces without the use of
chemicals.  It makes use of a pulsed-laser light source radiating
between 172 and 257 nm and a flowing inert gas.  The energy
imparted by the light lifts away contaminants, which are then
carried away by the flowing gas.  The light's energy is capable of
breaking covalent, ionic, coulombic, dipole-dipole, and hydrogen
bonds holding the contaminants to the surface.  Laminar flow of the
gas is said to provide a stable boundary layer, preventing
contaminant reattachment.

The company recently announced an agreement with Microelectronics
Research Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency for the EPA to provide funding to
acquire a Radiance Process wafer-cleaning system for a
demonstration project.  The project is to be managed by the MRL and
the EPA's National Risk Management Research Laboratory.  The EPA
will contribute $335,000 to the construction of the tools as part
of its Environmental Technology Initiative.  The process is
currently being demonstrated at Diffraction Ltd. in Waitsfield, VT,
and at IMEC in Leuven, Belgium.

Radiance Services President Donna Fitzpatrick was delighted with
the award, saying that the publication has proven itself superb at
picking winners.  She added that the award was an acknowledgment of
the recognition Radiance has received from around the world.  She
also noted recent recognition from Solid State Technology for their
innovative marketing strategy.

Manufacturing Services
to Get New SIC Codes

The U.S. Department of Commerce and the Bureau of the Census, in
cooperation with the Institute for Interconnecting and Packaging
Electronic Circuits (2215 Sanders Road, Northbrook, IL 60062-6135;
Tel: 708/509-9700, Fax: 708/509-9798), have developed a new
Standard Industry Classification (SIC) Code for the Electronic
Manufacturing Services Industry (EMSI).

The code, 3679800, establishes the government's recognition of what
has become an $11 billion-a-year industry.  The new description,
codes, and request for data will be published by the Department of
Commerce in their 1995 instruction manual, MA36Q, and will be sent
to EMS providers early this year.

The new code is broken down into seven markets: "Computer and
peripheral printed board assemblies (3679851)"; "Communications
printed board assemblies (3679853)"; "Industrial process control
board assemblies (3679855)"; "Instrumentation printed board
assemblies (3679857)"; "Search and Detection printed board
assemblies (3679859)"; "Consumer electronic printed board
assemblies (3679861)"; and "Other electronics, printed board
assemblies (3679890)."  The previous one-line SIC description for
the industry read, "Receipts for work by contract assemblers, board
stuffers, and related job shops."

Additionally, work continues with the Department of Commerce in the
development of a new North American Industrial Classification
System (NAICS).  IPC is seeking to ensure proper recognition and
clarification of the NAICS codes for printed board assemblies,
printed boards, and laminate base material.

Group to Set Exit
Charge Standards

Electrostatic charges are the cause of a wide array of problems in
semiconductor-manufacturing processes, ranging from circuit damage
and particle contamination to outright equipment malfunctions.  The
industry believes that static-related problems cost it more than
$100 million a year in lost productivity and reduced yields.

Now, a new group has been formed to add muscle to the fight against
static discharge problems.  The Exit-Charge Working Group is made
up of Arnold Steinman of Ion Systems, Julian Montoya of Intel
Corp., David Jensen of Advanced Micro Devices, Michael Yost of the
University of Washington, Vaughn Gross of IBM Microelectronics,
Robert Donovan of Sandia National Laboratories, Steve Silverman of
Meissner & Wurst, Fred Lakhani of Sematech, Al Lieberman of
Particle Measuring Systems, Jay Shideler of National Semiconductor,
and Chris Billat of KLA Instruments.

At the Group's second meeting, held recently in Austin, TX,
Steinman noted that the ESD Association studies the effects of
static charge from and on people but have yet to tackle equipment
issues.  According to Gross, its goal is the development of a SEMI
standard that will "set acceptable levels of static charge for the
purposes of eliminating equipment problems due to ESD events that
produce electromagnetic interference, eliminating equipment
problems due to difficulties in handling charged objects, reducing
the attraction of particles to charged surfaces, and reducing
product and reticle damage due to ESD."

Steinman added that existing SEMI Standard 801-2 does address ESD
immunity levels for equipment only, and it relies on test levels
that are much lower than is actually experienced in operation.
Thus, the standards fall short of protecting both wafers and
equipment at key stages of the manufacturing process.

The Group will focus on the development of a matrix of various
levels of static charge and recommended practices.  A meeting with
SEMI standards officials is set for the Working Group's next
gathering, which will take place in Norfolk, VA, where the
formation of a standards committee on exit charge will be
discussed.  The plan is to have a SEMI standard in place in 1997.

IPC Has the
Right Stuff

The IPC Printed Circuits Expo, to be held March 3-7, 1996, at the
San Jose (CA) Convention Center, will feature former astronaut
Capt. Wally Schirra as keynote speaker.  His address can be heard
on March 5.

Captain Schirra is the only astronaut to have flown Mercury,
Gemini, and Apollo missions.  In 1962, he piloted the Sigma 7
Mercury craft on its six-orbit mission and later served as Command
Pilot for Gemini 6.  That mission included the successful
rendezvous with Gemini 7.  He also served as Command Pilot for
Apollo VII in 1968, which was the first flight test of the three-
person spacecraft.

The Printed Circuit Expo will feature some 100 technical
presentations, 21 workshops, and will house nearly 650 exhibit
booths.  Further, IPC expects the event to draw some 3,500
attendees to what is the largest trade show and technical
conference in North America exclusively devoted to the printed wire
board industry.

Diamond Nucleation by
Gas-Phase Seeding

Diamond films have been deposited on substrates without
pretreatment by placement of a nickel wire above the substrate by
a group in Germany, led by Ch. Woll (Institut fur Angewandte
Physikalische Chemie, Universitat Heidelberg, INF 253, 69120
Heidelberg, Germany; E-mail: cc1@ix.urz.uni-heidelberg.de),
according to Applied Physics Letters..  The nickel wire was seen to
increase the nucleation density by five orders of magnitude.
Electron microscopy showed continuous diamond films to be produced
with Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
showing the presence of Ni in the diamond phase.

The diamond was grown in a standard hot-filament CVD chamber with
a tungsten hot coil and a resistively heated substrate holder.  The
substrate (100 or 111 silicon or Cu) was heated to 800oC -850oC, 5
mm from the filament.  Growth rates of 0.5-1 micron/hour were
attained in a 0.5% methane, 95.5% hydrogen at a 100 sccm flow rate.
When the Ni wires were placed 0.5-1 mm from the substrate, diamond
was seen to grow preferentially in the area in line with the Ni
wire and the coil.

Lam Upgrades
CVD Systems

Lam Research Corp. (4650 Cushing Pkwy., Fremont, CA 94538-6470;
Tel: 510/659-0200, Fax: 510/572-2935) has announced upgrades to the
company's Integrity PMD (premetal dielectric) and Epic IMD
(intermetal dielectric) chemical vapor-deposition (CVD) tools first
introduced for advanced development efforts in 1990 and 1993
respectively.  The new systems address production-level dielectric
film needs for devices produced with 0.35-micron design rules and
below.

The deep SubMicron (DSM) 9900 deposits insulating films between
metal layers for IMD applications, while the DSM 9800 deposits
dielectric films prior to first metallization in PMD applications.
The 9800 will also handle such applications as SiO2 spacers and
Ta2O5 storage capacitors for 256-megabyte DRAMs.  Lam's Chairman
and CEO Roger D. Emerick noted that both systems have deposited
films on devices with 0.18-micron features, and the 9800 has
deposited films of high quality on 300 mm wafers (EMTN, August).

The company said the new 9000-series CVD tools offer features
developed in cooperation with several leading chipmakers and the
industry consortium SEMATECH.  Changes include footprint
reductions, throughput increases, and newly developed process
solutions for specific film types.  Lam also claims a reduced cost
of ownership for the latest designs.

New Ion Implanter
From Applied Materials

Applied Materials (Santa Clara, CA; Tel: 408/727-5555) introduced
its Precision Implant xR80 ion implanter that is targeted to the
low-energy implant market.  The energy range is capped at 80 KeV,
but the system performs the delicate task of forming the
transistors on chips with deep submicron design rules.

The new implanter is capable of generating a beam at relatively
high current levels (5 milliamps at 5 KeV).  This boosts throughput
when forming the shallow junctions, as opposed to deep wells, of
DRAM and logic devices built with 0.25- and .18-micron line widths.
The xR80 is tailored to the formation of transistors and differs
from the recently announced Genus implanter, which is more of a
general purpose system.

Focused Ion Beams
Make Smaller Chips

Los Alamos National Lab researchers are trying to make smaller
computer chips using technology first developed for the Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization's now defunct Neutral Particle
program.  Ion beams used in microlithography are focused by
magnetic optics.  This technology offers narrower linewidths than
now possible, which makes more compact and powerful circuits.

According to Tom Mottershead (Tel: 505/667-9730) of Los Alamos,
this technology can achieve a 25-to-1 reduction in beam diameter.
A sharp focus such as this allows the beam to deliver high current
densities for etching the fine lines of microchip circuitry.  The
technology is also useful in probing the surfaces of high-density
microcircuits, inspecting the patterns of photomasks, and checking
for defects.  Data storage is another possible application as
focused beams of gallium ions could read and write data in media
more durable than today's CD-ROM.

Mottershead has proposed experimentation on an in-house basis at
the Lab's Accelerator Operations and Technology Division using an
existing tandem electrostatic accelerator and is interested in
possible collaborations with industry.

Curable Printed
Circuit Boards

Curable flame-retardant resins intended for use as the basic
material in printed circuit boards has been prepared by Gurit-Essex
(Papiermuhlestrasse 155, CH 3063 Ittigen-Bern, Switzerland; Tel:
31/580388) scientists.  Herbert Schriber, Gunter Burkart, and Bruno
Knaus report that the new formulation includes a thermally curable
1-oxa-3-aza tetraline group-containing compound, a curable epoxy
compound, and a flame retardant.  The flame-retardant additive may
be aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, elemental red
phosphorus, oxygen acids of phosphorus, inorganic salts of oxygen
acids of phosphorus, polyphosphates, boric acid, or salts of boric
acid.

Although bromine-based flame-retardant additives impart the
required flame retardance to resins used in the manufacture of
printed circuit boards, they can generate poisonous and/or
corrosive gases when exposed to fire.  As a result the Gurit-Essex
researchers sought a nonhalogenated alternative to flame retard the
resins.  U.S. Patent 5,443,911 explains the Gurit-Essex work in
detail.

New Testing
Probes Developed

Researchers at the New Jersey Institute of Technology's
Microelectronics Research Center (University Heights, Newark, NJ
07102-1982; Tel: 201/596-3434, Fax: 201/624-2541) have developed
two new types of probes for testing semiconductor chips.  According
to center spokesman Paul F. Hassen, the first device measures the
function of the chip or chip package itself, while the second looks
for hot spots.

The Conformable, HI-Pin-count, Programmable (CHIPP) probe card is
said to offer several advantages over current technology.  The
device can be conformed to match chip pads that may be found on
various levels or a curved surface.  It can also make contact with
closely spaced pads and can be programmed to handle a large number
of chip designs.  The research was funded by NJIT and Pacific
Western Systems Inc.

The heat sensor uses a thermometer probe to measure chip surface
temperatures over distances as small as a few tens of atoms.  Aside
from scanning for the tiniest of hot spots, it can also serve as
the probe tip for scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopes.
Research on this device was funded by Murray Hill Devices Inc. and
Digital Equipment Corp.

sensor and integrates directly into the throttle valve of these
popular etch tools to provide production-level monitoring in real
time.  The system's sensitivity has been increased to 0.4 microns,
and it features a new thermoelectric cooler to help maintain laser
operating temperature and stable sensor performance. Peter Borden
emphasizes that for process-control optimization "in-situ sensors
are key enablers."

The complete package includes the controller, PC-based software for
data analysis, and hardware for synchronization of particle counts
with the process cycle.  The base price is $20,700, and HYT says it
can deliver in 30 days.

Spectropolarimeter
Is Small, Fast

Research Corp. Technology (101 N. Walnut Road, Suite 600, Tucson,
AZ 85711-3335; Tel: 520/748-4400, Fax: 520/748-0025) has licensed
new technology to Containerless Research Inc. (Evanston, IL) for
the development of enhanced photo- and spectropolarimeters.  RCT
manages the technology for the University of New Orleans and the
inventor, Rasheed M. A. Azzam.

As a result of the new technology, CRI expects polarization to find
wide use in optical systems such as lasers, modulators,
interferometers, etc.  The company believes the devices could find
use as transducers to monitor coating and film-production
processes, as well as in the development and use of optically
active chemicals, catalysts, and pharmaceuticals.

According to CRI President Paul Nordine (Tel: 708/476-2678, Fax:
708/467-2679), the lack of a simple, portable device for measuring
polarization has limited the development of polarimetry
applications.  He called the new invention a  breakthrough that is
"smaller, lighter, faster, and simpler than conventional
instruments, as well as more rugged, sensitive, and repeatable.  We
envision an accurate device with no moving parts, prisms, beam
splitters, or modulators, capable of real-time resolved
spectropolarimetry."

New Defect-Data
Management System

Tencor Instruments (Mountain View, CA; Tel: 408/654-2926)
introduced a defect-data management system tradenamed SwiftAccess
that performs fast, in-line analysis of defect data from a variety
of sources, including the company's new Surfscan inspection system.

Identification of defects and their significance is becoming more
critical to the inspection process.  Although current inspection
systems generate large amounts of defect data, the info is only
valuable if device makers can use it to improve their manufacturing
process.  Therefore, they need a fast, reliable means of viewing,
analyzing, and acting on the defect data generated during
inspection.  SwiftAccess is designed to meet this need.

The system collects and analyzes defect data as it is gathered from
inspection systems, scanning electron microscopes (SEMs), review
stations, and probe and test systems, and then uses the information
to monitor the process, identify process excursions and provide
critical process-control information.  It can distribute data over
mulitple networked nodes, independent of the hardware platform, and
can collect data from the majority of inspection systems.  Designed
for ease of use, SwiftAccess features an X-Windows architecture and
Unix operating system that enable smooth integration into a fab's
existing network.  The system offers high reliability and
robustness, as well as scalability for next-generation
applications.

New Copper
Heat Sink Design

Aavid Thermal Technologies Inc. (1 Kool Path, P.O. Box 400,
Laconia, NH 03247-0040; Tel: 603/528-3400, Fax: 603/528-1478) has
added a new heat sink to its extensive lineup designed to cool low-
power devices in surface-mount packages.  The devices use highly
conductive copper in a profile only 0.013 inches thick for use in
tight quarters.

According to Gary Kuzmin, Aavid's director of corporate technical
marketing, the new Thin-Fin product line may be affixed to a
surface-mount package even if heat sink attachment was not
considered in the design process.  The low-profile configuration
requires minimum vertical clearance and allows continued reductions
in system enclosure sizes.

The surface of the heat sink extends beyond the boundaries of the
package, increasing the dissipating surface.  Further, the extended
surfaces are scored to allow for folding of the devices to provide
clearance around other components.  A pressure-sensitive adhesive
is pre-applied.  The adhesive has a low modulus to take up CTE
mismatch and is pliable to conform to surface irregularities.

BOOKS AND REPORTS

EDN Offers New Guide to
Analog Circuit Design

A part of EDN's Series for Design Engineers edited by Jim Williams,
The Art and Science of Analog Circuit Design, is an interesting and
unusual blend of prose (Art) and how-to (Science).  The 398-page
volume, a follow up to the original Analog Circuit Design - Art,
Science, and Personalities, is sprinkled with anecdotes offered up
by each of its 17 authors, including Williams, so much so as to
make it interesting to read in its own right.  Also included is a
chapter adapted from a commencement address given at Cal Tech by
Richard P. Feynman in 1974, a truly fascinating eight pages.

The book is presented in four parts: Learning How; Making it Work;
Selling It; and Guidance and Commentary.  In its 20 chapters can be
found such topics as design productivity, signal conditioning, IC
development, computer use, and linear IC design.  The volume also
includes a heavy and perhaps necessary, emphasis on economics.
Like it or not, a good design is worthless if it can't be sold.
The book is published by Butterworth-Heinemann (313 Washington St.,
Newton, MA 02158-1626; Tel: 617/928-2500, Fax: 617/928-2620).

Every Aspect
of VCSELs

Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers, by Terence Edward Sale of
the U.K.-based University of Sheffield, covers the principles,
theory, design, and operation of vertical cavity surface-emitting
lasers (VCSELs).  Semiconductor lasers have advanced a long way
since their first demonstration in the early 1960s and have a large
impact on many devices today.

They act as sources for optical fiber systems and permit the
reading of data from compact discs and barcode labels.  VCSELs have
many advantages over conventional semiconductor lasers.  The most
obvious is the possibility of very large arrays and a narrow
circular output beam, which can be efficiently coupled into the
core of a fiber.  As a result, the author believes that the time
for a book devoted to VCSELs has come.

The first chapter of the volume describes the history and prospects
of VCSELs and the choice of material systems for emission in
different wavelengths.  The second chapter concerns the optical
properties of short vertical cavities, and the quantum-mechanical
processes facilitating optical gain and spontaneous emission
processes are the focus of the third chapter.  Concepts are
developed from basic principles, and the effect of strain on the
optical processes in quantum wells is also covered.  Readers are
introduced to techniques for epitaxial crystal growth and the
fabrication of VCSEL devices in Chapter 4, and Chapter 5 explores
the resistance problems that can arise due to the many
heterojunctions in dielectric reflector stacks.

Chapters 6 and 7 are case studies that describe measurements made
on 2 VCSEL structures, one grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
and the other by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).
In Chapter 8, experimental data from these case studies are
analyzed using models, and the final chapter describes other
aspects of VCSELs, such as modulation response, arrays, and noise
performance.

The book does a good job of covering the VCSEL field and should be
of value to those experienced in the optics field, as well as to
novices and students.  Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers is
published by John Wiley & Sons Inc. (605 Third Ave., New York, NY
10158; Tel: 212/850-6336). 1995.  Price: $89.95.

CRACKING IN LARGE-SIZED LONG-SPAN PRESTRESSED CONCRETE
GIRDERS

During the production of large-sized long-span
prestressed concrete AASHTO girders in the prestressing
plant, vertical cracks often develop near the mid-third
of the span after the girders have been cured overnight
on the casting bed and before the prestressing strands
are detensioned.  The cracks extend across the top
flange of the girder transversely and penetrate
vertically down through the girder web, reaching toward
the bottom flange.

This (North Carolina State University) report presents
and discusses an investigation to identify the causes
of the problem and recommendations for its remedies.
It includes: a national survey of prestressed concrete
producers to assess the status of the problem; a
literature review of relevant issues; a series of
laboratory and field studies to determine the condition
of concrete and tendon forceS during the curing period;
and an analysis of the girder under-restrained thermal
contraction.

ANALYSIS OF A SYSTEM FOR DYNAMICALLY MEASURING ROAD
DEFLECTION

This (University of Michigan) report concerns analysis
of a system for dynamically measuring road deflection.
The system configuration consists of an instrumented
tractor-trailer truck to make road deflection
measurements at highway speeds.  The proposed system
utilizes a beam that carries laser distance-measuring
sensors.  The sensors are positioned to make reference
measurements of undeflected surface as well as the
deflected surface.  Signal processing algorithms are
proposed that give the system the potential to
compensate for beam movement as well as random surface-
texture features.  The report presents a complete error
analysis of the system, including suitable mathematical
models for all components as well as all signal
processing steps.  A random and systematic error
analysis is conducted of all components and the
complete system, showing that the system's total errors
are within allowable error-bands for practical
applications.

COMPACT HEAT EXCHANGERS: INVESTIGATION OF LOCAL HEAT
TRANSFER BY HOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY

Compact heat exchangers are key components for the
development of future aircraft devices.  This
translation from Germany (Technische University)
presents a technique for enhancement of the heat
transfer rate, resulting in a decrease of the heat
exchanger size and, thus, lower weight and lower
investment costs.  An exact knowledge of the
temperature distribution in the boundary layer is
necessary for a specific augmentation of heat transfer.
The holographic interferometry is applied as a
measuring method to enable visualization of the
temperature field without disturbing the flow pattern.
The local Nusselt number is determined from the
isotherms at the wall.  A digital image-processing
system is used for evaluation of interferograms.  The
measuring method is demonstrated for three different
types of geometries for compact heat exchangers, using:
air as the test fluid; plain fin arrangements of
plate-fin heat exchangers; flow in a profile-shaped
duct for tubular matrices; and flow over circular
segment-shaped turbulence promoters.  During the
experiments, the Reynolds number is varied between 500
and 3000, a range where low pressure losses occur.

ANALYSIS OF VIBRATION-INDUCED THREAD MOVEMENT IN BOLTED
CONNECTIONS

This (Auburn University) report discusses the main
design parameters contributing to the loosening of
bolts due to vibration, and identifies the relative
importance and degree of contribution of each parameter
to bolt loosening.  Vibration testing is conducted on a
shaketable having controlled random input.  Test
specimens are vibrated for a fixed amount of time and
the percentage of pre-load loss is measured.  Each
specimen tested implements some combination of
11  design parameters, as dictated by the design of the
experimental methodology employed.  The 11 design
parameters are: bolt size (diameter); lubrication on
the bolt; hole tolerance; initial pre-load; nut locking
device; grip length; thread-pitch; lubrication between
mating materials; class of fit; joint configuration;
and the mass of the configuration.  Two values of each
design parameter are used, and each combination of
parameters tested is subjected to two different
directions and two different g-levels of vibration.
One replication is made for each test to gain some
indication of experimental error and repeatability, and
to give some degree of statistical credibility to the
data -- which results in a total of 96 tests being
performed.

PIEZOELECTRIC AND PYROELECTRIC SENSORS

The pyroelectric properties of the composite
%Ca/Epikote 828, at 50/50 and 60/40 vol %,
respectively, are given in this report from North Wales
(the University College of North Wales).  The report
provides an account of the preparation of pure lead
titanate and calcium modified lead titanate (%Ca) by
the sol-gel process.  X-ray spectroscopic structural
analysis and differential scanning calorimetric studies
of the ceramic grains produced by this technique are
given.  The sol-gel method for preparation of
ferroelectric ceramics can offer many advantages over
conventional processing techniques.  The ceramics
produced via the sol-gel method: show high degrees of
purity and homogeneity; can produce fine powders; are
able to be formed into a variety of structures; and can
be processed at lower temperatures.

COPPER PRECIPITATES AND POINT-DEFECT CLUSTERS IN
REACTOR PRESSURE VESSEL EMBRITTLEMENT

Embrittlement of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels
is believed to arise primarily from matrix hardening
due to the formation of radiation-induced point-defect
clusters (PDC) and radiation-enhanced copper-rich
precipitates (CRP).  This (Oak Ridge National
Laboratory) report discusses a model developed to
investigate the relative importance of PDC and CRP in
RPV embrittlement.  The model is used to determine the
influence of a range of irradiation and material
parameters on the predicted change in yield strength.

RESEARCH ON PRESSURE VESSEL STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) report concerns
technology used to assess the safety of
irradiation-embrittled nuclear reactor pressure vessels
(RPVs) containing flaws.  Fracture mechanics tests on
RPV steel, coupled with detailed elastic-plastic
finite-element analyses of the crack-tip stress fields,
show that: (1) constraint relaxation at the crack tip
of shallow surface flaws results in increased data
scatter but no increase in the lower-bound fracture
toughness; (2) the nil ductility temperature performs
better than the reference temperature for nil ductility
transition as a normalizing parameter for shallow-flaw
fracture toughness data; (3) biaxial loading can reduce
the shallow-flaw fracture toughness; (4) stress-based
dual-parameter fracture toughness correlations cannot
predict the effect of biaxial loading on shallow-flaw
fracture toughness, because in-plane stresses at the
crack tip are not influenced by biaxial loading; and
(5) an implicit strain-based dual-parameter fracture
toughness correlation can predict the effect of biaxial
loading on shallow-flaw fracture toughness.  The
results of experimental irradiation investigations are
also included.

PRODUCTION AND EMISSION OF NITROUS OXIDE IN A SEWAGE
TREATMENT PLANT

This translation from Sweden (the Swedish Environmental
Research Institute) concerns nitrous oxide emissions
from a sewage treatment plant.  Calculations are made
using a `stagnant film' model.  The results show an
increased concentration of nitrous oxide in the
atmosphere above the denitrification zone.  The
concentration is about 25-times higher than the
background concentration in the atmosphere.  The high
concentration in the atmosphere shows evidence that
there is production and emission of nitrous oxide from
the denitrification zone.  This is also supported by
the measured concentration in the water that is
supersaturated, compared with the theoretical
concentration based on equilibrium between the
atmosphere and water.  The report discusses the effects
of active mixing by pumping air into the water at
different zones.

CORRELATION OF FRACTURE TOUGHNESS WITH IMPURITY
COMPONENTS

This (Los Alamos National Laboratory) report concerns
the phenomenon of stress-assisted diffusion in cracked
structures operating in corrosive environments.  It
discusses work done on extending the existing "Coupled
Thermomechanical Diffusion" theory, to enable
prediction of diffusion of a solute species in stressed
solids in the presence of cracks.  Mathematical
formalism is provided to support the intuitive notion
that a singular solution for the concentration field
can exist in crack tip neighborhoods, driven by
singular solutions for stresses that have been obtained
within the framework of classical linear elastic
fracture mechanics.  It is shown that under certain
limiting assumptions, a singular solution for the
concentration profile emerges from the governing
equations.  Both steady state and transient solutions
are obtained.  A numerical simulation using the
quarter-point finite-element method is carried out, and
the results obtained also indicate the presence of this
singularity. (This 1992 report was only recently
released for public use.)

PROPERTIES AND CREEP RUPTURE BEHAVIOR OF SILICONIZED
SILICON CARBIDE AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES

This (Pennsylvania State University) report
investigates the long-term load bearing capability of
two siliconized silicon carbides for high-temperature
applications (up to 1350 C).  These materials are
Norton NC430 and CS101K.  The NC430 is an earlier
more expensive material that requires an extra
furnacing operation during processing.  Batch-to-batch
variation in the microstructure of CS101K results in
large differences in creep rate and time-to-failure for
that material.  The results clearly show that details
of the rupture of siliconized silicon carbides depend
on the degree of interconnectivity of the silicon
carbide skeletal framework and also the
volume-fractions of the silicon carbide and silicon
phases.  (This 1991 report was only recently released
for public use.)

REACTION SYNTHESIS OF FE-AL ALLOYS: EFFECTS OF
PROCESSING VARIABLES

The effects of alloy composition and reaction
atmosphere on reaction synthesis of binary FeAl alloys
are discussed in this (Oak Ridge National Laboratory)
paper.  Reactions are observed in an open-air furnace,
under static vacuum (in an evacuated quartz tube), and
in a dynamic vacuum furnace.  High-speed videotapes of
reaction syntheses of compacts formed from 45(mu)m Fe
and 10(mu)m Al powders reacted in air and under static
vacuum, reveal that an unusual two-stage reaction
exists in this system under these conditions.  The
first stage of the two-stage reaction lasts several
seconds, and starts at around 650 C.  The second stage
begins at about 900 C, reaching temperatures between
1250 C and 1350 C.  The progress of the reaction to the
second stage is sensitive to the alloy composition and
reaction environment.  The reaction behavior is
explained in terms of thermodynamics and heat transfer,
which control the delicate balance between heat
accumulation and heat loss during reaction synthesis.

relationships that can be used in regional earthquake
damage and loss studies.  Three main areas for
modification of the existing ATC-13 damage probability
matrices are investigated.  The first develops detailed
descriptions of the original 90 building classes
defined in ATC-13.  The second approach for modifying
the motion-damage relationships is through the
collection of existing data.  The third modification
considers the development of fragility formulations
based on information from the ATC-13 damage probability

SYNTHESIZING CARBON-FILAMENT-REINFORCED ALUMINUM-MATRIX
COMPOSITES

This (Pennsylvania State University) report concerns
the synthesizing of branched (3-D) carbon filaments
from natural gas in a graphite tube, for subsequent
infiltration with aluminum.  A deposition reactor is
fabricated in which carbon filaments can be grown on
the inside surface of net-shaped parts.  A vertical
arrangement of the furnace is found to optimize
filament growth, and palladium is found to catalyze the
growth of filaments.  The diameter of the filaments
grown from the vapor phase is proportional to the
radius of the metal catalyst particle, and this has an
impact on the structure of the filaments.  The optimum
processing route involves Pd powder deposited on the
surface of a graphite substrate using an alcohol
solution to disperse the powder.

TENSILE DAMAGE PREDICTION FOR CERAMIC-MATRIX COMPOSITES
UNDER HIGH TEMPERATURE

This (City College of New York) report documents
experimental and theoretical results obtained in
studying the tensile damage behavior of ceramic-matrix
composites (namely Nicalon/CAS II composites) at room
and elevated temperature.  The composite specimens are
machined into dog-bone shape and polished to increase
the efficacy of observation in the scanning electron
microscope (SEM).  The specimens are placed inside the
chamber of an SEM and subjected to tensile loading at
room and higher temperatures up to 700 C.  At each
temperature, the load is increased until failure of the
specimen; the progression of damage is observed and
recorded from first crack to total failure.  Damage
usually starts with matrix cracking, followed by
debonding along fiber-matrix interface, fiber pull-out,
and finally fiber breakage.  At each load level the
displacement is measured, resulting in a stress-strain
curve having linear and non-linear portions.  Similar
behavior is observed at higher temperatures.
Theoretical models are developed to predict and
simulate the observed behavior.

USE OF BETA-ALUMINA AS A WEAK INTERFACE IN
ALUMINA-FIBER COMPOSITES

This (Rockwell International) report presents results
from a three-year study aimed at identifying and
developing suitable inter-phase materials for
oxide-oxide composites that are stable in high
temperature oxidizing environments, yet sufficiently
weak to allow debonding as required for toughening.
Most of the effort is devoted to two systems: LaPO4
(monazite); and beta-aluminas.  Monazite satisfies all
of the requirements for an inter-phase in
alumina-alumina composites (and most likely many other
ceramic matrix-fiber combinations).  It has a high
melting point (2074 C); it is stable with alumina at
high temperature in both oxidizing and slightly
reducing environments; and it forms a sufficiently weak
bond with alumina.  Beta-alumina materials, which
possess weak mica-like planes in their crystal
structures, are phase compatible with alumina, and
their debonding characteristics are adequate.  However,
their use and fabrication temperatures are limited by
morphological instability of the fiber/matrix interface
(i.e, grain growth of the beta-alumina platelets into
the fibers).

PREDICTING THE LIFE OF COMPOSITE LAMINATES: CONSTANT
AMPLITUDE AND TWO-STRESS-LEVEL FATIGUE

A strength-based wear-out model is presented in this
(Wright Laboratory) report.  It is used to predict the
residual strength and life of composite laminates
subjected to constant amplitude or two-stress-level
fatigue loadings.  It is assumed: that the laminate
undergoes proportional loading; that its residual
strength is a monotonically decreasing function of the
number of loading cycles; and that the probability of
failure after an arbitrary number of cycles may be
represented by a two-parameter Weibull function.  The
model also incorporates a cycle-mix-factor to account
for the degradation of strength and life that may be
associated with frequent changes in the stress
amplitude of the loading.  Experimental results from
two-stress-level loadings are used to evaluate the
model's predictive capability for sequencing effects,
as in a low-high or high-low test, and for cycle-mix
effects, as in a low-high-low-high repeating test.
Good correlation between theory and experiments is
obtained for all loadings and laminates studied.

DETECTION OF MACHINING DAMAGE IN CERAMICS USING THERMAL
WAVE IMAGING

Evaluation of the feasibility of a thermal wave imaging
technique for the detection and characterization of
machining damage in ceramics is presented in this
(NIST) report.  A well-defined crack system produced by
Vickers indentation is used to examine the
characteristic response of thermal wave signals to
different forms of cracks (i.e. median/radial and
lateral).  The results clearly indicate that thermal
wave imaging can be used for the detection of surface
and subsurface cracks in ceramics.  Thermal wave
imaging is then conducted on the surfaces of ground
alumina and the cross-section of scratched silicon
nitride.  Careful examinations of the thermal wave
images confirm that this technique can be used to
detect grinding-induced subsurface microcracks.  The
report discusses the limitations of the thermal wave
imaging technique in the detection of small cracks, and
precautions regarding choosing appropriate sets of
imaging parameters.

discusses air-exchange measurements in a hospital,
administrative and maintenance buildings, barracks, and
a laboratory.  Using a tracer gas method that entails
releasing a tracer gas in an initial well-mixed
concentration, it then monitors tracer gas
concentration over time.  The faster the tracer gas
dilutes, the greater is the air change rate.  ASTM

different finite-element models are compared with one
another and with industrial measurements.  The first

DEVELOPMENT OF LOW DIELECTRIC ALUMINA-BASED CERAMICS
FOR MICROELECTRONIC SUBSTRATES

This Doctoral thesis (from Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory) deals with the development of low
dielectric-constant alumina-based ceramics for use as
microelectronic substrates.  The performance of
high-speed computers depends not only on IC (integrated
circuit) chips, but also on the signal propagation
speed between these chips.  The signal propagation
delay in a computer is determined by the dielectric
constant of the substrata material to which the IC
chips are attached.  This work develops a ceramic
substrate having a low dielectric constant
(k = approx. 5.0).  When compared with traditional
alumina substrata (k = approx. 10.0), the new material
corresponds to a 37% decrease in the signal propagation
delay.

Glass hollow-spheres are used to introduce porosity
(k = 1.0) to the alumina matrix in a controlled manner.
A surface coating technique, involving heterogeneous
nucleation in aqueous solution, is used to improve the
high-temperature stability of these spheres.  After
sintering at 1400 C: the isolated spherical pores are
uniformly distributed in the almost fully-dense alumina
matrix; negligible amounts of matrix defects are seen;
and all of the pores are isolated from each other.
Detailed analyses of the chemical composition find that
the sintered sample consists of alpha-alumina, mullite,
and residual glass.  Mullite is the chemical reaction
product of alumina and the glass spheres.  Residual
glass exists because the current firing conditions do
not complete the mullitization reaction.

The dielectric constant of the sintered sample is
measured and compared with the predicted value, using
Maxwell's model.  Mechanical strength is evaluated by a
four-point bending test.  Although the flexural
strength decreases exponentially with porosity, samples
having 34% porosity (k = approx. 5.0) still maintain
adequate mechanical strength for the proper operation
of a microelectronic substrate.

Carbon Nitride: A
Designer Abrasive

Scientists at the Carnegie Institution (Washington, DC) have used
a combination of state-of-the-art physics, supercomputers, and
insight gained from the study of minerals to predict the first
feasibly synthesizable material that is more incompressible than
diamond. Their calculations show that this material, a cubic form
of carbon nitride, C3N4, should be significantly less compressible
than diamond at room conditions.

Inasmuch as low compressibility is correlated with hardness, it is
highly possible that the new material could be harder than diamond
and therefore of significant technological use as a superabrasive
material and for wear-resistant coatings.

These results, reported in the January 5 issue of Science , rest
upon state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical calculations. The levels
of speed and accuracy now attainable in such calculations enable
investigators to design materials by doing experiments on the
computer instead of in the laboratory. Scientists are thus
beginning to rationally design useful materials in a more efficient
manner than by the traditional "shake-and-bake" methodology of
finding new materials.

The investigators in the new work are David Teter and Russell
Hemley, both serving at Carnegie's Geophysical Lab and Center for
High Pressure Research. Teter and Hemley's work grew from
widespread interest in the possibility of finding new low
compressibility materials. Various forms of carbon nitrides had
been proposed as possible superhard materials potentially exceeding
diamond in hardness. Teter and Hemley identified several favorable
candidate C3N4 prototype forms and calculated their energetics,
structures and physical properties. They determined the cubic-C3N4
form to be the most incompressible.

Their calculations indicate that the cubic- C3N4 material can be
synthesized at pressures and temperatures now attainable in the
laboratory. (The material would be formed at high pressure and
temperature, and then quenched stably to ambient conditions.)
Scientists at the Carnegie institution and elsewhere are already
working to accomplish this, employing insights gained from the
theoretical work now reported. Conceivably, the material can
eventually be synthesized at an industrial scale using technology
similar to that now used to synthesize industrial diamond.

Teter and Hemley write that most experimental studies of carbon
nitrides have been carried out at ambient or low-pressure
conditions; their results indicate the importance of high-pressure
synthesis in the search for new carbon nitrides.

Fibrous Monoliths from
Powder Processing

Advanced Ceramics Research Inc. (851 E. 47th St., Tucson, AZ 85713;
Tel: 520/792-2616, Fax: 520/792 2635, email: acr@rtd.com) claims it
has developed a new generation of advanced composites with high
strength, toughness, and non-brittle fracture characteristics.
Called fibrous monoliths, this processing technology can be applied
to polymers, metals, ceramics, and hybrid composites.  The current
development efforts have mainly concentrated on advanced ceramic
composites, with certain hybrid composites being fabricated to
demonstrate the versatility of the processing technology.

The fibrous monolith concept produces--through ordinary powder
processing--dense fired ceramics with graceful failure
characteristics plus strength and toughness values typically
exhibited for more costly continuous fiber-reinforced ceramic
composites (CFCC's).  These composites have been expected to become
main load-bearing components for many lightweight, high-temperature
structural applications - such as gas turbine engine components.

As of this date, CFCC's have found only limited use although
research and development efforts are continuing. Currently CFCC's
major obstacles are limited formability and product repeatability,
although scientists working on CFCC's are confident that they could
solve these problems. However, the problems they consider difficult
to solve are achieving longer life for the components plus both
high starting material and high fabrication costs.

Advanced Ceramics Research believes fibrous monoliths have
commercial potential in applications now targeted for CFCC's
because of their ease of formability, as-fired damage-tolerant
behavior, and inherent low cost (processed entirely with
conventional powder starting materials).

Fibrous monoliths are multi-phase monolithic ceramics consisting of
a primary phase of high aspect ratio polycrystalline cells
surrounded by outer cell-boundaries of secondary and/or tertiary
phase(s) of different polycrystalline materials.  When engineering
design calls for multiple cell-boundaries, usually, the cell-
boundary adjacent to the cell represents regions of lower shear
strength interdispersed with cell regions of high strength.

The engineered micro architecture of a simple cell/cell-boundary
structure has the appearance, in the as-fired materials, of wood;
hence the apt description of "ceramic wood."  The cell-boundaries
of low shear strength will entrap a propagating crack, thereby
inducing crack deflection during fracture.  This process dissipates
large amounts of energy and leads to non-catastrophic failure
behavior.  It must be mentioned again that there are no dense
ceramic fibers incorporated as starting materials.

The fibrous, polycrystalline, micro architecture of an as-fired
body is an exact replica of the ceramic green body.  This green
body is in-turn formed from ceramic powder-loaded polymer fibers
arranged into a desired micro architectural array (uniaxial,
biaxial, woven fabric, chopped fiber) and then laminated into a
rectangular billet or complex-shape part.

"Green" ceramic fibers are the only building blocks of the fibrous
monolith, for they consist of a core of primary (cell)
polycrystalline powder in a polymer binder, surrounded by shells of
polycrystalline powders in a polymer binder.  Powders must be sized
so that they can be processed in standard thermoplastic extrusion
equipment, and they must be thermodynamically compatible.

Preparation of ceramic green bodies proceeds as follows: co-
extruded single filament is either chopped or cut to desired length
and then laid up into rectangular billets, or woven into 3-D mats.
These pre-shapes are then laminated into rectangular billets--a
typical shape in use for process development.

In another micro architectural configuration, co-extruded multi-
filament rods are cut to desired lengths, aligned inside the die
into either 0 uniaxial or 0-90 biaxial arrays, and then
laminated into rectangular billets.  The billets are then loaded
into a hot-pressing die, binder burned out in a controlled-
atmosphere furnace, and the billet(s) hot-pressed under 25 MPa
uniaxial pressure until ram compaction ceases.

After hot pressing, near full density is achieved and the billet(s)
are machined into various test configurations.  These 0-90
biaxial arrays, in the as-fired condition, have the microscopic
appearance of plywood.  Developmental work is under way to use co-
firing techniques (successfully utilized in the ceramic electronic
industry) to sinter both the cell compositions and the cell-
boundary compositions simultaneously. Limited fibrous monolithic
compositions have been co-fired to acceptable final densities. Co-
firing promises increased final shape complexity employing
sintering techniques versus hot pressing.

Government contracts are driving the development of this fibrous
monolith prototype manufacturing for producing small volumes at low
cost using a wide variety of ceramic compositions in a variety of
applications.  Advanced Ceramics Research, Inc. supplies green
fiber and billets, and can debond, hot press, and sinter a limited
number of shapes.

Ceramic Tapes in
Rapid Prototyping

Researchers at the University of Dayton's rapid prototype
development laboratory (RPDL) is one of the first in the country to
use ceramic tapes in rapid prototyping--an advancement because of
the ceramic's ability to withstand temperatures up to 2,000(C
without falling apart. The project is funded by a 3-year $3.54
million program sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency
(ARPA) and the Office of Naval Research.

"This method looks like it's going to be very successful," said
Richard Chartoff, UDRI senior research engineer and principal
investigator.  "There's no shape distortion or shrinkage of the
part when it's processed, but the main advantage is speed.  The
normal processing of high-temperature ceramics takes weeks."

Using a $200,000 laminated object manufacturing (LOM) machine
developed by Helisys Inc. (Torrance, CA), the researchers are
developing a special fabrication technology.  The LOM system
usually builds layered 3-D objects by stacking and fusing thin
layers of paper that are trimmed to shape by a laser.  Instead of
paper, UDRI has developed ceramic powders held together by a
polymer binder to form "tapes" slightly thicker than a sheet of
paper that are fed into the machine.

In the next stage of the project, researchers will reinforce the
ceramic matrix composites with fibers to increase strength, develop
a laser that is more suited to working with ceramics than paper and
help Helisys develop its next-generation LOM machine.

The research team already has used the technology to build ceramic
electrical components and miniature body armor, among other parts,
but Chartoff is most excited about its potential medical
applications. "There is interest in using this method to make bone
replacement shapes," he said.  "The ceramic forms a shell, which
would eventually be absorbed in the body when replaced by new bone
growth. This is an ideal way to make bone structures--particularly
if we are successful in putting fibers in the ceramic to make it
stronger," Chartoff continued.

Keeping the Troops
Safe in Bosnia

While ceramics are more often thought of as gifts for the holiday
season, ceramic technology and products are playing a vital role in
protecting U.S. peacekeepers in Bosnia.  From lightweight, easily
installed ceramic armor in aircraft and helicopters to protective
shielding used for tanks, personnel carriers and trucks to personal
body armor for troops in the field--the benefits of advanced
ceramics are quite evident in this important mission.

"Advanced ceramics have the double benefit of being harder than the
bullets and shells fired at them while weighing about half as much
as traditional steel armor," explained Robert Skaggs, a senior
materials scientist at Los Alamos National Lab and a member of The
American Ceramic Society (ACerS).

The ceramics advantage already has been demonstrated through a
creative application on numerous aircraft, including the Air
Force's C-141.  Previously unarmored, the C-141s were vulnerable to
small-arms fire from ground snipers.  A new, modular, lightweight
ceramic/metal ("cermet") composite armor was developed that can be
transferred from one aircraft to another, with a total installation
time of about two hours.

"The portability feature ensured that any plane could be armored
quickly and easily without having to armor all of the planes, a
project that would have been far too expensive and required too
much time," said Frank Gac, leader of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory's Ceramic Science and Technology Group and a member of
The American Ceramic Society (ACerS).

This new portable armor was developed by a team of workers from Los
Alamos National Lab, Foster-Miller Co. and Lanxide Armor Products,
Inc., an ACerS corporate member.  The armor consists of several
mats of 4 in. square tiles manufactured by Lanxide from a silicon
carbide/aluminum nitride ceramic composite.  Kevlar, a woven
polymer fabric manufactured by DuPont, is adhered to the back of
the cermet armor.  Foster-Miller then integrates the resulting mats
into a kit that is delivered to the Air Force.  The armor is
attached to the plane's interior using a heavy-duty hook-and-loop
fastening material.

Skaggs explained that the cermet and Kevlar combination acts as a
"catcher's mitt" for bullets fired at the plane.  "When a bullet
hits the cermet tile, the bullet essentially disintegrates, without
damaging the entire tile," Skaggs said.  "The energy from the
bullet is absorbed through the tile while the Kevlar catches the
bullet fragments, preventing injury to the occupants or further
damage to the plane or its cargo."

Ceramic-based armor also is used in Apache, Cobra and Blackhawk
helicopters.  Manufactured by ACerS corporate member Ceradyne Inc.,
(Costa Mesa, CA) and Cercom (Vista, CA), the armor is incorporated
into the seats, floors and wall panels of cockpits to protect the
pilots.

One of the more difficult challenges the peacekeeping force is
expected to encounter is the large number of camouflaged mines
placed throughout the Bosnian countryside by the warring factions
during the last several years of conflict.  Trucks, personnel
carriers and tanks use ceramic armor to provide a previously
unavailable degree of protection and safety.

The LAV-25, for instance, has used modular ceramic armor since the
Gulf War.  Designed to enhance protection against fragments from
152 mm artillery projectiles encountered during the war, the armor
now protects troops from exploding land mines in Bosnia.
Manufactured by Lanxide and by Coors Ceramics Co., a Golden, CO-
based ACerS corporate member, the LAV-25 armor can be applied in
single or multiple layers and can be repaired in as little as 20
minutes from the on-board battle damage repair kit.

Troops in the field also are protected by ceramics.  To increase
their protection from larger rounds, troops slip a ceramic plate
into special pockets in their bullet-proof vests, often made of
Kevlar. Manufactured by Ceradyne, Coors and others, the half-inch
thick ceramic plates protect troops from armor-piercing bullets by
adding about 20 lbs. to the vests' weight.

Laminated Matrix
Adds Toughness

Researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology have developed a new
type of material which they believe to be tougher and stronger than
conventional fiber-reinforced composites by applying alternating
thin layers of matrix materials to traditional reinforcement
structures.

These "laminated matrix" composites could replace metals in
aircraft structural components, heat engines, heat exchangers,
particulate filters and other applications requiring high-
temperature, high-strength materials.  By producing composites with
improved properties, the process may allow replacement of costly
reinforcing fibers with less expensive platelets or particles,
driving down the cost of composite materials.

"This idea offers the chance of improving materials properties--
particularly toughness--and lowering costs," said W. Jack Lackey,
a research scientist at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI).
"This gives us a wide range of possible new material systems we can
use."

Two conventional techniques exist for making mechanically tough
composites.  The first uses fiber reinforcement within matrix
materials such as ceramics or metals, while the other relies on
building up multiple bonded layers of different materials such as
copper and aluminum.

"We have combined those two approaches," explained Lackey.  "We
make a fibrous preform by stacking up layers of cloth, then
infiltrate a matrix into the preform one layer at a time.  We
infiltrate for a few moments with one material until we get a layer
of it around each fiber, then we infiltrate for a few moments with
another material, then we switch back to the first.  We keep
iterating until we have put down as many as 50 layers."

Sponsored by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the
work initially focused on infiltrating a carbon fiber preform with
alternate layers of carbon and silicon carbide matrix.  However,
the new process should also be applicable to silicon carbide or
aluminum oxide fibers, as well as to metallic, polymeric or ceramic
matrix materials.

Lackey notes that the matrix materials--which bind the
reinforcement fibers together and fill in the space between them--
must be carefully chosen to be chemically compatible and closely
matched in their thermal expansion properties.

"We need to consider how these materials will work together," he
said.  "Carbon and silicon carbide are a natural choice.  We knew
those materials were easy to infiltrate into a preform, and we also
knew that they were compatible chemically.  We want to be able to
study what kinds of materials do work well in this type of
composite."

The Georgia Tech research team, which also includes Sundar
Vaidyaraman and Shelli Godfrey, used forced-flow thermal-gradient
chemical vapor infiltration to apply layers ranging in thickness
from 0.02-0.5 microns.  The layers were formed by alternating the
precursor gases flowing into the chemical vapor infiltration
reactor.

Beyond improving the properties of fiber-reinforced composites, the
laminated matrix process could also allow the use of alternate
reinforcing materials that could lower the cost of making
composites.   That could open new applications for composite
materials.

Lackey believes the improved strength and toughness of the
laminated layers may allow the expensive reinforcing fibers--which
cost at least $300/lb.--to be replaced by particles or platelets
costing between $2-$30/lb.  Lackey's team has made composite
samples using silicon carbide grit instead of fibers.

"We have shown that we can make these laminated composites with
inexpensive particulates, replacing a costly reinforcing material
with an inexpensive one," he said.  "But we must demonstrate that
these materials have appropriate properties.  This is highly
speculative, but if it works, there would be a very significant
payoff."

If long-term testing shows that materials made with the laminated
process can provide the necessary properties at a lower cost, that
would allow composites to compete with metals in additional large-
scale applications.  If economically feasible in applications such
as jet engines, for instance, the lighter weight of the laminated
matrix composite components could allow significant performance
improvements in the aircraft using them.

"People are struggling to improve the mechanical properties of
ceramics and ceramic-matrix composites to the point that they can
replace metals," Lackey explained.  "If you can replace metals with
ceramics, you can operate at higher temperatures and get better
efficiency in a heat engine."

In addition to obtaining experimental verification of the new
materials' properties, Lackey must determine the optimal
combination of materials, appropriate thickness of matrix layers
and ideal reinforcing structures.  Finally, the process will have
to be scaled up from laboratory samples to full-sized components.

Georgia Tech has applied for a patent on the process. Georgia
researchers presented their work at the American Ceramic Society's
20th Annual Meeting on Composites and Advanced Materials in Cocoa
Beach, FL, January 7-11, 1996. This effort is sponsored by the Air
Force Office of Scientific Research, Air Force Materiel Command,
USAF, under grant No. F49620-92-J-0148.

Composite Shaped
for Furnaces

A new shaped ceramic composite material produced at 3M (St. Paul,
MN 55144-1000; Tel: 612/733-1110) is intended for use in
applications requiring good heat resistance and mechanical
properties, such as gas fired radiant burner tubes, gas burner
nozzle liners, heat exchangers, thermowells, core busters or flame
dispersers and other gas fired furnace components.  Robert G. Smith
reports that the composite includes ceramic oxide fibers, a coating
of a carbonaceous matrix which includes boron nitride particles,
and a silicon carbide coating.

Radiant burner tubes are used in high temperature, corrosive
environments such as are found in industrial heat treating furnaces
and aluminum melting furnaces.  The three most common types of
commercially available radiant burner tubes are metal alloy, e.g.,
nickel-based superalloy, tubes; ceramic, e.g., silicon carbide,
monolith tubes; and ceramic composite, e.g., ceramic fibers and
ceramic cloth in a ceramic matrix, tubes.  The upper use
temperature of such tubes is typically 900-1260(C.

Although monolithic silicon carbide radiant burner tubes with an
upper use temperature limit of about 1260(C are available, they are
generally brittle and prone to fail.  This is a common problem of
conventional shaped ceramic monoliths.  While it is possible to
select a conventional ceramic composite from which to prepare a
radiant burner tube which meets most of the requirements for use in
high temperature, chemically corrosive environments, it is only
possible by taking great care in the selection of materials and by
making some compromises in properties.

The carbon matrix or coating uses amorphous carbon is amorphous,
and has a thickness of up to one micrometer on an individual fiber.
The 3M product includes 20-50% by weight ceramic oxide fibers, 0.2-
20.0% by weight carbonaceous matrix, 0.2-15.0% by weight boron
nitride, and 50-75% by weight silicon carbide.  U.S. Patent
5,476,684 was assigned for this invention.

Building Insulation
That Takes the Heat

With a goal of becoming the largest "full line" supplier of high-
temperature insulation products, the Carborundum Co. (Fibers Div.,
P.O. Box 808, Niagara Falls, NY 14302; Tel: 716/278-2203, Fax:
716/278-2440) is readying a panel version of its Excelfrax product
line.  Other Excelfrax product forms, including Excelblok rigid-
board insulation, are in the development stage.

The developmental products, as well as the firm's commmercialized
flexible blanket form called the Excelflex Composite Systems, are
based on Excelfrax's core high-temperature insulation material.
This material blends ceramic (alumina and silica) powders and
fibers to produce a microporous structure.  The structure decreases
radiant heat flow, thereby making Excelfrax materials extremely
efficient insulation materials.  The core material can be
manufactured into a variety of product forms, including composite
systems, molded shapes, and rigid boards.

The firm's Excelflex Composite Systems are composed of a high-
temperature (1800(F) core material that has been placed between two
layers of a high-temperature textile.  The standard textile is a
1200(F S-Glass.  However, various high-temperature textiles can be
used in the composite to provide protection from 500(-2,300(F.  The
layers are compressed into a uniform thickness (ranging from 1/8-
inch to 1/2-inch) and density (both standard and lightweight).  The
layers are then quilted into a finished composite.  The Excelflex's
standard configuration is 36" x 36" pads that are lock-stitched
into one-inch squares.

Market manager of Carborundum's Fibers Div., Jim Olchawski (Tel:
716/278-2008, Fax: 716/278-2440), calls Excelflex's extremely good
thermal conductivity its main advantage.  Because of this excellent
thermal performance, Excelflex will provide the maximum amount of
insulation within the smallest amount of weight and space.  Stable
at high temperatures, Excelflex has low thermal diffusivity and
excellent material strength characteristics. Also, Excelflex's
flexibility and ease of fabrication are important considerations
for many applications.

Excelflex provides the best insulation (lowest thermal
conductivity) of all the insulating products currently provided by
Carborundum.  Olchawski recommends it as the material of choice
whenever high-temperature insulating materials are required and
space/weight savings are the primary consideration.  Excelflex
Composite Systems can reduce heat loss and reduce surface
temperatures in a variety of materials, including
aerospace/defense, industrial, and commercial markets.

Aerospace/defense applications for Excelflex include thermal
insulation/fire protection in aircraft engine struts, nacelles,
cowlings, and avionics.  Industrial applications can be found in
nuclear power plants, petrochemical facilities, and other
industrial areas (i.e. incinerators, heat-treatment furnaces,
insulation for kilns and furnaces, and other metal/glass processing
industries).  Commercial applications include commercial ovens,
night storage heaters, and many other appliance applications.

Olchawski explains that Excelfrax is a "natural," the direct result
of two principal factors: The company's technical capabilities,
developed over many years while working with Fiberfrax refractory
ceramic fibers in the same markets and the partnerships created
between the company's full-service applications engineering team

Supply Contract
for SiC Whiskers

Hughes Aircraft Co. will demonstrate the advanced process to
produce low cost aluminum metal matrix composites (MMCs) that can
meet the requirements for high-performance military structural
components under a recently awarded $6.2 million U.S. Army
contract.

Of this, ART has been given an award worth $480,000 for further
optimization of a low cost manufacturing process for SiC whiskers
(reinforcements for the metal matrix composites) and for supplying
several hundred kilograms of whiskers to the program.

These selectively reinforced MMCs have potential applications such
as tracked vehicle tread shoes, powertrain parts, like pistons, and
missile structures.  Current technologies to produce MMCs with
lightweight, high-strength properties for these types of components
are very expensive for high volume automotive applications.

The contract, awarded by the U.S. Army Tank Automotive and
Armaments Command (TACOM), is also sponsored by the North American
Technical Industrial Base Organization (NA.HEADLINEBO), which is
composed of U.S. tri-service and Canadian military representation.

Key partners on the Hughes team are the Advanced Materials
Development Center of General Motors' Powertrain Group and Advanced
Refractory Technologies (ART).  GM brings to the program the state-
of-the-art squeeze casting process, created as part of their
development and production of automotive parts.  ART, as part of a
GM-sponsored initiative, has been developing a process for making
the silicon carbide whiskers which are used as the reinforcement
material in this casting process.

3M Cleans Up
Coal Fired Plants

3M has introduced a high performance ceramic composite filter,
which features high temperature capability, resistance to thermal
shock, lightweight and resistance to catastrophic failure.

The Type 203 Ceramic Composite Filter is a rigid, candle-type
filter consisting of Nextel ceramic fibers which reinforce a
silicon carbide matrix.  The ceramic fibers toughen the composite
construction and result in a filter with excellent resistance to
thermal shock and catastrophic failure.  The filter is used to
remove particulate from high temperature gas streams up to 1850F
(1010C).  The collected particulate is removed by reverse pulse
jet cleaning.

The high temperature capability of this filter can eliminate the
need to cool the gas stream prior to filtration, which may increase
process efficiency and eliminate the cost and complexity of gas
dilution, air scrubbers, or heat exchangers.

The light weight (2 lbs.) of this filter reduces the strength
requirements of the tube sheet, and the excellent thermal shock
resistance provides protection during upset conditions. The 3M
Ceramic Composite Filter is designed for advanced coal-fired power
generation systems, such as pressurized fluidized bed  combustion
(PFBC), and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC).

Ceramic, Metal Bond
for Hot Gas Filters

Intumescent materials for joining ceramics to metals at high
temperatures in hot gas filtration systems have been formulated by
scientists at CeraMem Corp. (12 Clematis Ave., Waltham, MA 02154-
7035; Tel: 617/899-0467).  Other potential applications for the
materials include heat exchangers, high temperature vehicle
emission control systems, and heat protection and control systems
for new jet engines.

The cost effective sealing of ceramic components such as
particulate filters to high temperature metal alloys in advanced
coal-based power systems operating at temperatures of up to 1000C
is extremely difficult, reports Robert J. Higgins.  The problem
stems from the large disparity in thermal expansion coefficients of
these two types of materials.

This requirement to seal large gaps between ceramic and metallic
components, coupled with the need to maintain appropriate stress
levels on the ceramic components at all temperatures, places
extreme demands on the properties of the material used to seal the
ceramic-metal gap.  Similar systems operating at lower temperatures
utilize vermiculite-based intumescent mats for this purpose, but
such materials have limited lifetimes when used at temperatures in
excess of 500C and degrade at temperatures above 800C.

CeraMem scientists are investigating the use of multilayer,
biceramic composites that can reversibly expand and contract
between room temperature and 1000C.  These composites will include
various combinations of high temperature oxides fabricated by the
surface modification treatment of thin, tape cast ceramic sheets.

Heat Treatment for
PTCR Barium Titanate

Semiconducting barium titanate (BaTiO3) is of interest for a
variety of applications.  However, it is difficult to manufacture
due to the necessity of preferential distribution of dopants in the
titanate grains, and the sensitivity of the positive temperature
coefficient of resistance (PTCR) performance to the heat treatment
schedule used to sinter the microstructure of these electronic
ceramics.  Prof. Vasantha Amarakoon at Alfred University (New York
State College of Ceramics, Alfred, NY 14802; Tel: 607/871-2497)
reports in the Journal of the American Ceramic Society the effects
of heat treatment on PTCR behavior.

The PTCR behavior occurs as a result of either doping BaTiO3 with
an aliovalent ion or heating in a low oxygen atmosphere which
reduces Ti4+ to Ti3+.  Electronic conduction occurs up to the Curie
temperature (about 120(C) where the resistance increases by several
orders of magnitude.  The necessity of achieving uniform
distribution of liquid phase additives (excess barium, tin) is
dealt with by using a gel-coating process of the grains.  The PTCR
effect is seen to develop when the material is cooled to the
annealing temperature, as the grain boundaries rapidly oxidize when
the liquid phase there solidifies.  Oxygen diffusion continues
during annealing and cooling, which increases the PTCR response.

Optical Waveguides of
Alumina Thin Films

Alumina waveguides formed by reactive rf magnetron sputtering were
studied by researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Hanscom Air Force Base (Lionel O. Bouthillette, Optoelectric
Components Branch, Hanscom AFB, Bedford, MA 01731-2909) as a
candidate material for optical waveguides.  Use of sputtering to
form alumina films enables it to be deposited in the amorphous
state, removing the necessity of achieving a crystallographic match
with the substrate.  The researchers described in the Journal of
the American Ceramic Society amorphous alumina films deposited at
temperatures up to 800(C and varying oxygen flow rates in the
deposition chamber.

The refractive index of the amorphous alumina films averaged 1.65
over a transmission range of 200 nm to 7 microns with reproducible
losses of 1dB/cm at a 632.8 nm wavelength.  A refractive index of
greater than 1.4 is desirable for compatibility with silicon
technology and less than 1.8 for coupling with fibers.  The
chemical inertness, adherence, hardness, and wear resistance, and
mechanical durability of alumina films additionally makes these
materials suitable for waveguide applications.

Actuator Technology
Wins Patent Protection

Research Corp. Technologies (RCT) in Tucson, AZ, has received U.S.
Patent 5,471,721 for a process to transform standard piezoelectric
wafers into unique domed structures that demonstrate an
unprecedented increase in displacement and load capacity over
conventional piezoelectrics.

In 1993, RCT granted an exclusive license to Aura Systems Inc.
(NASDAQ: AURA) in El Segundo, CA to make, use and sell ceramic
actuators using the process. RCT commercialized the technology on
behalf of Clemson University and the inventor, Dr. Gene Haertling.

Dr. Haertling's RAINBOW (reduced and internally biased oxide
wafers) support moderate loads while achieving large displacements
with modest applied voltages.  RAINBOWs are rugged, reliable, cost-
effective, and easy to make and use.

Structurally similar to standard piezoelectric unimorphs, the
unique structures can support over 100 psi or displacements of 50
mils, depending on load, size and composition.  Moreover, this
performance can be augmented by stacking multiple RAINBOWs.

RAINBOWs have a broad range of potential applications including
speakers, microphones, pumps, actuators, sensors, relays, switches,
transducers, hydrophones, vibrators, accelerometers, positioners,
and pyroelectric detectors.  Aura Ceramics, Inc., a subsidiary of
Aura Systems, supplies component RAINBOWs to OEMs.

"RAINBOWs offer more than an order of magnitude increase in
displacement over existing piezo approaches," said Jim Sloane,
president of Aura Ceramics.  "It's an enabling technology that will
open up numerous applications to the simplifying solutions of
active ceramics."

State/Country: Japan

A novel crystallizable glass composition for producing a novel low
temperature co-fired glass-ceramic substrate having patterns of a
low electrical-resistance conductor such as Ag, Ag-Pd, Au, and/or
Cu is obtained. Being subjected to a firing process, the novel
crystallizable glass can precipitate mullite as main crystalline
phase, and at least one subordinate crystalline phase among
forsterite, spinel, sapphirine, and similar crystalline phases. And
also, the novel crystallizable glass powder composition with an
inorganic filler as external additive having a minimum of 1.4 m2/g.
of mean specific surface area can precipitate both mullite phase
and cordierite phase. The mixing weight ratio of the filler to the
crystallizable glass powder is from 0.1/99.9 to 20/80. The
crystallizable glass composition comprises following oxide
components expressed in terms of percent by weight on the oxide
basis; 45-58% of Al2O3, 20-35% of SiO2, 5-15% of B2O3, 5-20% of
MgO, and 0-4% of alkali metal oxide. The substrates produced from
the above compositions have high flexural strength, low dielectric
constant, low loss factor, and controllable thermal expansion
coefficient of ranging from approximately 30 to 70X10-7/C. As for
the substrate containing both mullite phase and cordierite phase,
as the substrate has a low thermal expansion coefficient, it can be
combined with AlN to produce a composite structure package.

HTS Filters for
Cellular Market

Illinois Superconductor Corp. (ISC, Mt. Prospect, IL) has been
installing and testing receivers that will substantially reduce
dropped calls and annoying static common in car phones.  The high-
temperature superconducting (HTS) filters, to be used in cellular
base stations, are designed to operate in the 825-850 MHz frequency
range.

The work has been partially supported by a 3-year, $3.5 million
project funded by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology's Advanced Technology Program.  Other partners in the
project include AT&T Bell Labs and Northwestern University.

To make these filters, ISC is using HTS thick-film material
developed by a team, now at the University of Birmingham
(Birmingham, England), that was funded in part by Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization (BMDO).  While the radio frequency (RF)
properties of HTS thick-film materials are not as good as competing
HTS thin films, they are much easier to make.  For example, thick
films can coat 3-D objects (thin films cannot), enabling the
fabrication of RF components designed to maximize performance.  In
addition, thick-film materials can be sprayed, dip-coated, or
brushed onto desired substrates. In contrast, thin films must be
made in clean-room facilities using a sophisticated laser process.

Hg-Based Materials
Challenge Researchers

A paper presented by Paul Chu, et al., (The Texas Center for
Superconductivity and Dept. of Physics, University of Houston,
Houston, TX 77204; Tel: 713/743-8212) at the fall meeting of the
Materials Research Society focused on research underway on mercury-
based high-temperature superconductors, the homologue series,
HgBa2Can-1CunO2n+2+d [Hg-12(n-1)n or HBCCO] with n = 1, 2, ...7.

They were first found by a Swiss team in Zurich to be
superconducting at temperatures up to 134 K.  Later, the Houston
group raised the superconducting temperatures of these compounds to
a record-high temperature of 164 K by squeezing the sample, making
it possible for the first time to achieve the superconducting state
by using household air-conditioning technology.

These materials exhibit an impressive current carrying capacity of
up to one million amperes per square centimeter at 100 K, observed
by the IBM group at Yorktown Heights after making the compound into
the thin film form.  The figures translate to a theoretical limit
of about 10 million amperes per square centimeter at the liquid
nitrogen temperature of 77 K.

Chu said that because of the simple and yet subtle crystal
structure of the compounds, specifically the linear Hg-O
coordination that allows a large cation-doping range, scientists
are given the opportunity to peer into the effects of atomic
arrangement and doping on the occurrence of superconductivity at
high temperatures.

Some of the experimental results on these compounds have
demonstrated the limits of and the modifications needed in some of
the prevailing models of high-temperature superconductivity.  A
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) was made from
this compound and operated at the unprecedentedly high temperature
of 114K by the IBM group.

However, he added that the mercury-based compounds are rather
unstable.  Usually, they are not easy to make in pure form, and
they decompose easily at the high temperatures required to shape
them into practical forms, such as wires for power transmission and
generators.   This is to say that Hg is lost at temperatures above
350(C.

Recently, progress has been made in this respect.  By doping the
compounds, the synthesis of the materials has been simplified and
the materials so prepared become more stable.  Preliminary success
has been achieved in wire-making.  Small single crystals of the
compounds have been obtained with high enough quality for
scientific study.  However, more material improvements are needed
before these new compounds can become a material of practice.  Dr.
Chu was not available to elaborate on these topics at press time.

Current Limiter
Prototype Tested

American Superconductor Corp. has successfully demonstrated a 2.4
kV high temperature superconducting (HTS) current limiter prototype
in partnership with Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT), Southern
California Edison (SCE) and Los Alamos National Lab (LANL).  The
project was funded by the Dept. of Energy, under their
Superconductivity Partnership Initiative program.  The
demonstration took place at SCE's Center Substation in Downey, CA.

The current limiter incorporates the world's largest HTS coil,
which was manufactured and delivered earlier this year by American
Superconductor.  Current limiters are devices that instantaneously
limit the flow of electrical current, and mitigate the effects of
short circuits, lightning or power fluctuations.  The devices
essentially act as giant surge protectors, which protects expensive
utility transmission and distribution equipment.  American
Superconductor expects to commercialize HTS current limiters in the
1998-1999 time frame.

"This demonstration is significant in that it shows that HTS wire
and coil technology is advancing rapidly to meet the needs of the
electric power industry," said Dr. Dean Peterson, Center Leader of
the Superconductivity Technology Center at Los Alamos National
Laboratory.  He added, "Development of high performance, low cost
current limiters will yield improved reliability, efficiency and
cost improvements for the electric utility industry.

Greg Yurek, president and CEO of American Superconductor,
commented:  "The successful demonstration of the prototype
utilizing our leading edge HTS coil represents another significant
technical milestone for American Superconductor and validates our
expected time line for commercialization of this product line.  Our
commercialization efforts in the area of current limiters will
continue with a number of global partners to meet the existing and
growing demand for HTS devices that overcome the limitations of
conventional copper-based technology."

Model for Complex
Vortex Behavior

One of the main obstacles in the development of practical high-Tc
superconducting materials is the dissipation caused by the motion
of vortices.  By using the speed and memory of parallel computers,
researchers at Argonne National Lab have numerically simulated,
using extremely fine temporal and spatial resolution, a model for
complex vortex behavior.

Resulting numerical simulations or vortex dynamics in a
superconducting sample show that, in the presence of a strong
magnetic field, the vortex lattice maintains a superstructure where
regions of varying vortex density are separated by stationary fault
lines.  Furthermore, the vortex lattice may have misoriented grains
that gradually "heal" when subjected to a weak current.  The
researchers also find that the orientation of the vortex lattice
depends on the strength of the transport current.

Argonne welcomes collaborations with industry to explore ways in
which computational models can be used for predicting the
performance characteristics of HTS superconducting wires and tapes.

chemical phenomena in sol-gel thin-film deposition by dip-coating
and used these phenomena to control such film properties as
refractive index, volume fraction porosity, and pore size.

Eleven researchers at Ames Lab won the Outstanding Scientific
Accomplishment Award for "Investigation of Single-Crystal RNi2B2C
Magnetic superconductors," The team has been investigating the
electronic and magnetic properties of the superconductors. The
experiments have revealed phenomena associated with the
simultaneous interplay of strong electron-photon interactions and
magnetic couplings.

A Pacific National Lab team with eight researchers won the Award
for Signification Implication for DOE-Related Technologies on
"Aqueous Deposition of Ceramics on Plastics and Complex Shapes."
The team developed a methodology to deposit ceramic films from
supersaturated aqueous solutions onto a wide range of substrate
materials. The technique provides conformal coatings on complex
shapes and can be used to deposit patterned coatings.

Brake Production
Facility Starts Up

Lanxide Corp., Nihon Cement Co., Ltd., Kanematsu Corp. and Lanxide
K.K. have announced the commissioning of a new automotive
manufacturing line for production of ceramic-reinforced aluminum
brake rotors and drums.  The new production line, located at
Lanxide Corp.'s facilities in Newark, DE, is a result of a
cooperative development program among the four companies.

The manufacturing line will be used to produce newly introduced
lightweight ceramic-reinforced aluminum brake rotors and brake
drums for the automotive industry.  The new rotors and drums are
less than half the weight of their traditional cast iron
counterparts, and respond to the widespread industry need for
weight reduction to meet ever tightening government emissions and
fuel economy standards. Initial capacity of the production line
will be approximately 15,000 rotors and drums per year, expected to
increase to 60,000 units per year within a year.

The world's first production automobile to utilize LANXIDE ceramic-
reinforced aluminum brake rotors, the new Lotus Elise sports car,
was introduced at the Frankfurt Auto Show last year. The Elise uses
four silicon carbide ceramic-reinforced aluminum brake rotors
manufactured by Waupaca Foundry, Inc., under license from Lanxide
Corp.

According to Marc S. Newkirk, president and CEO of Lanxide Corp.,
the ceramic-reinforced aluminum parts made by the Lanxide's PRIMEX
Pressureless Metal Infiltration Process will have an increasing
impact on the design and performance of automotive equipment.  The
capacity to provide the rigidity of iron and steel at less than
half the weight directly enables improved fuel economy and reduced
emissions in cars, trucks and buses, addressing a critical,
industry-wide need.

Tensile Properties
of CMCs Tested

A joint Korean and Japanese research effort studied the tensile
properties of ceramic matrix composites. Researchers Dong-Woo Shin
and Keun Ho Auh (Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea) and Hidehiko
Tanaka (National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials,
Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan) characterized the mechanical
properties of various 2D ceramic matrix fiber composites by tension
testing, using the gripping and alignment techniques. The woven
fabric composites used for the test had the basic combinations of
Al2O3, fabric/Al2O3, SiC fabric/SiC, and SiC monofilament uniweave
fabric/SiC.

Tension testing was performed with strain gauge and acoustic
emission instrumentation to identify the first matrix-cracking
stress and assure a valid alignment. The peak tensile stresses of
these laminate composites were about one-third of the flexural
strengths. The SiC monofilament uniweave fabric (14 vol%)/SiC
composites showed a relatively high peak stress of 370 MPa in
tension testing.

The full paper is available in the Journal of the American Ceramic
Society [78 (11), 1995].

Behavior of SiC
Fibers in a Matrix

This work was done by Hyunho Shin at School of Materials Science
and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA
30332. The full paper is published in the Journal of American
Ceramic Society [78 (11), 1995].

A Nicalon SiC fiber-reinforced Si-Al-Ca-O-N composite was
fabricated by a slurry infiltration process followed by hot
pressing at 1600C.  A carbon-rich interfacial layer (~100 nm) as
well as a crystalline silicon-rich layer (~15 nm) were observed
between the fiber and matrix. Based on this interfacial
phenomenology, the following behavior of SiC fibers in the matrix
was proposed:  fine SiC grains (diameter of ~1.7 nm in as-received
fibers) decomposed at fiber surfaces (SiC  C + Si), followed by
silicon migration into the glassy phase of the matrix.  The glassy
phase was interpreted to play a key role as a silicon consumer in
fostering the formation of the carbon-rich layer.  The presence of
silicon implied that the oxygen activity in the matrix was low
enough to avoid SiC oxidation.

Perspex for medical fluid diagnostic applications. The DP-356 UVT
product is a highly specialized acrylic polymer for disposable
medical devices where maximum degree of optical clarity is needed,
including blood cuvettes and products for blood and fluid analysis.
Tests show a luminous transmittance of 92%, a tensile strength of
10,000 psi, and injection-molding flow of 13 g/10 min.

Lustran ABS 266 Mediclear, from Bayer Corp. (100 Bayer Road,
Pittsburgh, PA 15205; Tel: 412/777-2000) offers clarity and
toughness with easy processing and resists deterioration caused by
chemicals commonly used in medical devices.  The high-clarity
material follows the trend toward increased use of medical devices
at home, which involves self-administration and monitoring of
performance by patients themselves.

Lustran ABS 266, containing methyl methacrylate, meets FDA USP
class VI requirements; after sterilization by gamma radiation,
samples of the new grade show negligible deterioration.  The
material, providing (for a 1/8-inch specimen) an Izod impact
strength of 3.25 ft-lbs/inch per ASTM D-256, has been qualified by
Burron OEM Division of Braun Medical Inc., a manufacturer of
components and assemblies, including valves, transfer and filter
devices, fluid-administration systems, balloon catheters, and trays
and kits.

A polyolefin resin recently introduced by Montell Polyolefins (2801
Centerville Road, Wilmington, DE 19850; Tel: 302/996-6000), KS-
029P, which is manufactured by the company's Catalloy multistage
gas-phase polymerization/special catalyst process, is suitable for
blown-film applications requiring toughness after autoclaving or
exposure to gamma radiation.  Other applications for polypropylene
resins in the medical industry reported by Montell include
syringes, labware, biohazard bags, laminated thermal blankets,
medical bags, surgical drapes and gowns, and other disposables that
utilize the material's sterilizability, contact clarity, moisture
barrier, chemical resistance, strength, and heat resistance.

New gamma radiation-resistant flexible PVC compounds from Teknor
Apex Co's Plastics Division (505 Central Ave., Pawtucket, RI 02801;
Tel: 401/725-8000) offer improved color stability for medical
applications.  The APEX 90-A471R-NT PVC products, formulated to
withstand up to 10 megarads of gamma radiation with minimum color
shifting, more effectively maintain their light blue tint. The
gamma radiation is generally used for one-time preuse sterilization
of disposable medical devices.  Applications for the new products
include infusion kits, drip chambers, kidney-dialysis kits, and
intravenous solution systems.

Standard Tests
on the Way

The Sterilization Packaging Manufacturers Council, working with the
Flexible Packaging Association (1090 Vermont Ave. N.W., Washington
D.C. 20005; Tel: 202/842-3880) is trying to clarify existing test
methods and create new versions to keep pace with the demands being
placed on flexible sterilized medical packaging.

The current test method on seal integrity does not differentiate
between energy required to destroy or open the seal. Test methods
are also being created to focus on differences between laboratory
and production tests.  The role pressure plays in seal quality is
also an issue receiving attention.

Several of the completed test methods are based on ASTM standards,
which include seal strength, inflation testing (burst and creep),
and peel strength. The Council is also working on test methods for
visual seal inspection, porosity, and coat weight determination.

Porosity of Nylon
Films Measured

Nylon 610 films show promise for use in drug encapsulation.  Ken
Phares, M. Cho, Keith Johnson, and James Swarbrick of the
Pharmaceutical Dept. at the University of North Carolina (Chapel
Hill, NC 27599-7360; Tel: 919/962-2211) have investigated drug
transport through artificial membrane films composed of Nylon 610.

Nylon 610 is a hydrophilic polymer.  The researchers synthesized
the polymer using an interfacial polycondensation reaction.
Hexamethylenediamine, which readily partitions into a good solvent,
and sebacoyl chloride were used.  The sebacoyl chloride was a
solvent blend of chloroform and trichlorotrifluoroethane in varying
ratios (1:1, 1:4, 4:1).  Phares and coworkers observed that the use
of hexamethylenediamine allows the formation of a high molecular
weight polymer before precipitation.

The films resulting from these synthesis variables were
characterized on the basis of porosity, thickness, molecular
weight, and crystallinity.  Transport of potassium chloride,
hydrocortisone, and m-creosol were measured for the different
films.  Chloroform concentration was found to be the most important
factor in the resulting molecular weight of the film.  With an
increase in molecular weight, increases were observed in film
thickness, porosity, and hydrocortisone permeability.  As the
molecular weight decreased, permeability to m-creosol increased.

Phares and colleagues published "Drug Transport Across Nylon 610
Films:  Influence of Synthesis Variables" in Pharmaceutical
Research [12(2), 248-256, 1995].  According to Phares, their
subsequent work with Nylon 610 microspheres will be published in
1996 in the International Journal of Pharmaceutical Advances. Since
the publication of the article, Ken Phares and James Swarbrick have
left UNC to work with Applied Analytical Industries (1206 N. 23rd
St., Wilmington, DE 28405; Tel: 910/251-6383). Phares continues his
research on drug transport, but focusing on concerns other than
Nylon 610.

ProCyte Moves into
Moist Dressings

ProCyte Corp. (12040 115th Ave., Kirkland, WA 98034; Tel: 206/820-
4548) acquired from Hymedix International (2235 Route 130, Dayton,
NJ 08810; Tel: 908/274-2288) worldwide rights outside of Asia to
five wound-care products that have received market clearance from
the FDA, broadening the company's planned entry into the moist-
wound dressing market.

The products include proprietary transparent thin-film wound
dressings, aquagel sheet dressings, exudate absorbers, and wound
moisturizers, all based on a multi-block copolymer structures that
are especially well-suited for wound-care applications, including
chronic and acute wounds, burns, and surgical wounds, according to
ProCyte.

The company said that the newly licensed products complement its
internationally-developed Iamin gel wound dressing, for which FDA
clearance to market is pending under the 510(k) pre-market
notification guidelines. ProCyte said it expects the first of its
wound-care products to be available to long-term care, hospital,
and home health-care professionals by mid-1996, following equipment
scale-up and design and validation of improved manufacturing
processes at its Redmond, WA, commercial manufacturing plant.

The U.S. market for moist-wound dressings, which include the
polymer-based products ProCyte acquired, is expected to reach $500
million by 1999.  Industry sources say market growth for moist-
wound dressings and all other wound-care products and systems is
being driven by an increasing incidence of wounds associated with
advanced age, during which surgeries and chronic wounds tend to
occur more frequently.

Centerpiece for ProCyte's newly-acquired products is a versatile
polymer technology, called HYPAN, manufactured by a patented method
to provide a uniquely variable number of structural aquagels,
useful in construction of synthetic moist-wound dressings and
related products. ProCyte also has the worldwide rights outside of
Asia for all future wound-care applications of HYPAN technology for
synthetic moist-wound dressings and related products.

As part of its agreement with Hymedix, ProCyte also gained
exclusive worldwide rights for drug-delivery applications of the
HYPAN technology for wound care.  ProCyte plans to continue its
research and development efforts in wound treatment and healing and
to study drug-delivery aspects of technology for enhanced delivery
of antibiotics, anti-infectives, and other compounds to wounds.

HYPAN polymers are synthetic materials that ProCyte believes can be
manufactured in a cost-effective manner. The products are believed
to provide maximum performance at low concentrations, to have
excellent biocompatibility profiles, and to be both stable and
sterilizable.  The structural flexibility of these aquagels is
expected to make them ideally suited to broad-based applications in
wound management and treatment, particularly since they address the
breadth of chronic and acute wounds.

Now Bioabsorbable
Elastomers Are Here

Elastomers have been extensively used in medical devices,
especially thermoplastic copolyesters (COPEs) and thermoplastic
polyurethanes (TPUs). The copolyester elastomers are polymers with
"hard" and "soft" segments. While commercial viability of
elastomeric polymers for medical applications has been established,
a need exists for certain properties that have not yet been met.

For numerous applications, especially for those requiring a
surgical device to be implanted in bodily tissue, the polymer from
which the device is prepared must be bioabsorbable.  Ethicon Inc.
(U.S. Highway 22, Somerville, NJ 08876; Tel: 908/218-0707) has
developed bioabsorbable elastomers made up of random copolymers as
reported in U.S. Patent 5,468,253.

These copolymers consist of:
    epsilon-caprolactone, trimethylene carbonate, an ether lactone
or a mixture of these; and
    the balance being substantially glycolide, para-dioxanone, or
a mixture of these.

The random copolymers surprisingly exhibit elastomeric properties,
and the copolymers are bioabsorbable.  Combination of physical and
biological properties of these elastomeric copolymers are
particularly well-suited for numerous medical and surgical
applications.

Complete bioabsorption should take place within 12 months, although
preferably bioabsorption will be complete within nine months and
most preferably within six months.  In this manner, the elastomer
can be fabricated into medical and surgical devices that are useful
for a vast array of applications requiring complete absorption
within the relatively short time periods set forth.

Biological properties of the bioabsorbable elastomer used to form
the device or part thereof, as measured by its absorption rate and
its breaking strength retention in vivo, can be varied to suit
needs of particular application for which fabricated medical device
or component is intended.  This can be conveniently accomplished by
varying ratio of components of the elastomeric copolymer chosen.

Dry Coating Improves
Implant Properties

Medical device manufacturers prefer using polymeric materials for
making implants, such as cannulae, needles, catheters, percutaneous
connectors, and the like. Polymeric implants have, however, brought
about several complications, especially thrombophlebitis and
sepsis.  Some workers in the field have investigated the use and
beneficial effect of an in-line filter in reducing infusion-
associated infection, in particular phlebitis.  However, others
have focused on the material of the cannula itself.

It has been shown that steel needles produce fewer infusion-
associated complications that do plastic cannulae.  The issue is
how to advantageously use the desirable bulk property of polymeric
implants -- flexibility, avoiding infiltration without adversely
affecting the patient by exposing him or her to increased risk of
infusion-associated phlebitis, and infection.

Spire Corp. (1 Patriots Park, Bedford, MA 01739; Tel: 617/275-7470)
recently won a patent (U.S. No. 5,468,562) for imparting a thin
metallic film to outside surfaces of polymeric implants. Apparatus
includes a vacuum chamber, an evaporator and an ion source mounted
in operative association within the chamber.

The patent claims improved biocompatibility between implant and
body.  Metal films include chromium and titanium with thicknesses
of 0.5 microns.  Claims are also made for use of other metals for
biomedical devices (implants) such as silver, zirconium, tantalum,
aluminum, nickel, molybdenum, platinum, gold, and stainless steel.

On-Line Plasma
Sampling Developed

Often a need exists to sample and analyze the plasma constituent of
blood without affecting other constituents.  For example, end-stage
renal disease ("ESRD") patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis
treatments at home presently send blood samples to laboratories for
analysis.

The blood sample is analyzed for general chemistry profiles (e.g.
electrolyte, plasma hemoglobin, total protein, albumin, and
immunoglobin concentrations).  Sending out blood samples is tedious
and involves a significant loss of the ESRD patient's blood cells.
Since ESRD patients are typically anemic, a further loss of red
blood cells compounds their anemic condition.

Presently, ESRD patients either ignore the problem of further
blood-cell loss altogether or endure a complicated procedure
whereby  blood cells withdrawn with a sample are salvaged.

Since for a large proportion of diagnostic procedures a plasma
sample is all that is necessary, a need exists for an inexpensive
means for collecting a plasma sample without contributing to
further blood loss of an ESRD patient.

University of Utah (Salt Lake City, UT 84112; Tel: 801/581-7200)
researchers have developed an extracorporeal plasm filter
comprising a housing, an inlet, an outlet, and a sampling port and
containing at least a hollow semi-permeable filter fiber through
which blood plasma, but not whole blood, may pass.

U.S. Patent 5,464,535 has been granted to Udipi Shettigar for this
filter, which is constructed so that a heterogenous fluid, such as
blood, entering the inlet passes into the first open end of the
hollow filter fiber and through the fiber.  A portion of the fluid
(e.g. a filtrate or diffusate) permeates the semi-permeable portion
of fiber to collect within the housing.  The collected portion may
then be sampled from the sampling port.

The filter will usually be structured with a plurality of hollow
fibers comprising a filter fiber bundle.  These fibers are attached
one to another near their respective ends, e.g. by gluing.

Lab-Grown Cartilage
Ok'd for Compensation

The Florida State Agency for Health Care Administration has
approved Carticel surgery, an innovative technique utilizing lab-
grown cartilage cells, for Workers Compensation benefits, according
to Dr. Douglas Stringham, the first orthopedic surgeon in Florida
and one of only 15 surgeons in the country to have performed the
specialized surgery.

"This procedure is supported in the medical literature by basic
scientific research, and we've concluded that it is not
experimental and that there are likely to be significant positive
benefits of this procedure to recovery and well-being of the
injured worker," said Suzanne Suarez, senior health policy analyst
for the agency.

"This decision sets a precedent for all of Florida," said
Stringham. "We invested a considerable amount of time and energy
investigating, evaluating, and establishing the procedure as a
recommended and appropriate treatment for a defined group of
patients suffering cartilage injury."

Bill Aliski, vice president of patient and product services at
Genzyme Tissue Repair (1 Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA 01239; Tel:
617/252-7500) the lab where the cartilage cells are grown,
responded, "We are very pleased with the decision of the Workers
Compensation Division.  The board has recognized the value of the
Carticel procedure and confirms the medical opinion of the surgeon.
While this is a first in Florida, other favorable coverage
decisions for Carticel are expected in the future."

The technique, pioneered in Sweden by Dr.Lars Peterson, involves
removing a very small piece of healthy cartilage, growing the
cartilage cells in tissue cultures for several weeks, and then
reinjecting them back into the damaged area.  In time, the
transplanted cells heal the defect with cartilage that is
essentially indistinguishable from the original normal cartilage.

Left untreated, significant cartilage defects progressively
enlarge, leading to career-ending injuries for athletes and loss-
of-job disabilities for workers.  Eventually, untreated defects may
develop into painful arthritis that often requires joint
replacement.

Engineered Heart
Valves Promising

Advanced Tissue Sciences Inc. (10933 N. Torrey Pines, La Jolla, CA
92037; Tel: 619/450-5730) announced preclinical data on tissue-
engineered heart valves at a recent session of the American Heart
Association.

Current therapy for valvular heart disease includes replacement of
heart valves with porcine xenografts, cryopreserved cadaver, or
mechanical valves.  Advanced Tissue Sciences is utilizing its core
technology to develop tissue-engineered heart valves with improved
function and durability in order to overcome disadvantages of
current therapy.

Dr. Shin'oka, a fellow in the department of cardiovascular surgery
at Boston's Children's Hospital (300 Longwood Ave., Boston, MA
02115; Tel: 617/735-6000) and a collaborator with Advanced Tissue
Sciences, presented data that demonstrated feasibility of utilizing
tissue engineering to create heart-valve replacement products.

Dr. Skin'oka reported that tissue-engineered valve leaflets were
made by seeding a synthetic biodegradable fiber matrix with
fibroblasts and endothelial cells.  Leaflets were then implanted in
large animals, which were followed for up to six weeks.  Total
protein and collagen analysis of tissue-engineered heart-valve
leaflets showed development of an extracellular matrix and
histologies of the constructs resembled native tissue.  Angiography
and echocardiography demonstrated no stenosis and a minimal
valvular regurgitation.

Dr. Zeltinger presented studies that characterized deposition of
human-specific extracellular matrix proteins in porcine heart
valves colonized with human neonatal fibroblasts and grown under
dynamic flow conditions.  Long-term growth studies indicated
excellent migration and viability throughout the newly deposited
matrix, demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing tissue-
engineering techniques to create heart valves.

Microsphere Drug
Device That Works

Currently systemic antibiotic therapy by intravenous or
intramuscular injection is the clinically accepted standard for
prevention and treatment of infected surgical and traumatic wounds.
Systemic administration of antibiotics is recognized as an
inherently inefficient method for delivering drugs because only a
small fraction of total dose actually reaches target area and most
of the drug is excreted unused.

Recently, microencapsulated antibiotics have been developed based
on lactic and/or glycolic acid-based biodegradable polymers. These
microcapsules are either injected or layered on to the wound.
Uneven drug distribution is often the result.  The injection route
is also only suitable for the area that the needle can traverse.

Jean Setterstrom, Elliot Jacob, and Walter Franz received U.S.
Patent 5,470,311 for apparatus and methods for dispensing
medicinals encapsulated in a biodegradable polymer in surgical and
other wounds. In this procedure, a microcapsule drug applicator
allows the caregiver to implant or spread measured and uniform
quantities of microencapsulated medicinals in or on surgical or
traumatic wounds to prevent or treat infections.

Specific examples where microencapsulated antibiotics may prove
useful include soft-tissue wounds, following debridement and
reduction or fixation of open fractures, onto osteomyelitic bone
after surgical debridement, after surgical insertion of prostheses
such as hip/knee replacements (arthroplasty), and following
vascular surgery or grafting.

Local implantation of microencapsulated antibiotics can provide a
significantly higher local concentration of medication at the wound
site then can be obtained using traditional systemic therapy and
offers the possibility of producing significantly reduced side
effects.

In addition to antibiotics, other drugs and biological agents may
be encapsulated and administered in a similar fashion.  Such
medicinals include  steroids, narcotic antagonists,  local
anesthetics, growth factors,  anti-cancer agents, and  non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

The microsphere application comprises two basic units: A drug
container or vial that contains microspheres, and a unit that
generates the nebulizing gas stream required to spray or propel
microspheres contained in vial (ital.???) onto the area to be
treated.

Oscillator Changes
pH to Release Drug

Scientists at the Ciba-Geigy Corp. (444 Saw Mill River Road,
Ardsley, NY 10502; Tel: 914/479-5000, Fax: 914/478-1201) are
developing a novel approach to drug delivery that uses a pH
oscillator.  Only the uncharged form of a drug can cross over
lipophilic membranes.  This device changes the pH of a solution to
charge or uncharge a drug.  In this way, the release of a drug can
be controlled.  An advantage of this system is that it does not
require external power sources or electronic controllers. For the
study, the scientists used a mixed Landoldt pH oscillator to study
diffusion of nicotine or benzoic acid across a membrane.

Probes Deliver
Drugs to Eyes

Drugs are unable to perfuse well from the blood into the eye, and
doctors must give patients very large amounts of systemic
medications in order to treat eye diseases.  With certain drugs,
such high concentrations in the body increase the risk of toxic
effects.  Scientists are trying to develop polymer devices that can
deliver drugs directly into the eye.  In this study, polycarbonate
and polyamide membranes were investigated for suitability.

Three classes of drugs were studied for their ability to perfuse
from the microdialysis membranes:  antibiotics, corticosteroids,
and cytostatic agents.  In addition, substances of varying
molecular weights were studied.  Earlier studies had shown that
some lipophilic drugs stick to polycarbonate polymer devices, but
this study did not reveal any differences between the two polymers.
All the study substances dialyzed through the implanted
microdialysis membranes.  The shape of the probe was found to
affect its dialyzing action.

University of Lund (Sweden) published "Passage of Drugs Through

Pulmonary-Flow Sensing
Technology Patented

Aradigm Corp. (26219 Eden Landing Road, Hayward, CA 94445; Tel:
510/783-0100) was awarded U.S. Patent 5,469,750 covering flow-
sensing technology used in its pulmonary drug-delivery systems to
ensure reproducible delivery of aerosolized drugs.  The patent,
"Method and Apparatus for Sensing Flow in Two Directions and
Automatic Calibration Thereof," further strengthens Aradigm's
patent portfolio, which protects methods and systems for efficient
and consistent delivery of a broad range of drugs.

Aradigm's microprocessor-controlled devices are capable of making
precise quantitative measurements of a patient's inspiratory flow
rate and volume in order to deliver consistent doses of aerosolized
medication to the lungs.  The system's flow sensors measure a
patient's inhalation characteristics and send digital signals to a
microprocessor, which selects the appropriate point to
automatically release an aerosolized drug dose for treatment of
respiratory disease or for systemic effect.

Aradigm is developing two aerosol drug-delivery platforms.  The
handheld, microprocessor-controlled devices are intended to deliver
reproducible doses of wide range of small and macromolecular drugs.

The SmartMist Asthma Management System was designed to deliver more
consistent doses of aerosol medications from standard metered-dose
inhaler canisters.  The AERx Pulmonary Drug Delivery System was
developed to deliver aerosols created from liquid drug
formulations, many of which currently are available only by
injection.

Channel Blocker
Dosage Automated

A prospective, randomized hypertension study will determine whether
a novel verapamil calcium channel blocker is as effective as the
"first-line standard of care" regimen (diuretic or beta blocker)
recommended by the Joint National Committee on Detection,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC V) in the
primary prevention of cardiovascular complications including heart
attacks, strokes, and death in 15,000 patients followed over a
four-to-six-year period.

Dr. Henry Black, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine
at Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center (1653 W. Congress
Pkwy., Chicago, IL 60612; Tel: 312/942-5000) and the trial's
principal investigator, announced the beginning of the study with
representatives from G.A. Searle Inc. (5200 Old Orchard Road,
Skokie, IL 60077; Tel:708/470-6728).

Cover-HS, the calcium channel blocker to be used in the Searle-
sponsored trial, incorporates a novel, controlled-onset, extended-
release COER-24 delivery system and is currently under review by
the FDA for treatment of hypertension and angina.

Taken at bedtime, Covera-HS is designed to lower blood pressure by
releasing active drugs in concert with the body's natural circadian
rhythms.  Since blood pressure commonly follows a circadian
pattern, dropping at night and rising in early morning, Covera-HS'
COER-24 delivery system was developed to deliver peak
concentrations of the drug when blood pressure tends to be highest
-- in the hours just before and after awakening.

"We know that as blood pressure rises, risk of suffering myocardial
infarction is generally highest within the six-hour period after
waking," Black explained.  "This large-scale trial will determine
whether treatment with Covera-HS, which delivers higher dosages of
calcium channel blocker at time of greatest risk, will be
equivalent to standard of care in decreasing risk of fatal and non-
fatal heart attack and stroke in patients with mild to moderate
hypertension," he said.

"This study could provide substantial new information on how we
should manage hypertension and perhaps change our way of thinking
with respect to which antihypertensives should be used and when,"
he said.

In addition to primary endpoint, the trial will look for treatment
differences in other endpoints associated with hypertension, such
as death from any cause and the development of congestive heart
failure requiring hospitalization.

Patch Alternative to
Hormone Replacement

SmithKline Beecham (1 Franklin Plaza, Philadelphia, PA 19101; Tel:
215/751-4000) and Theratech Inc. (417 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City,
UT 84108; Tel: 801/583-6023) announced that Androderm (Testerone
Transdermal System) is now available nationwide.  Adroderm is a
treatment for men suffering from hypogonadism, a condition in which
the body produces insufficient levels of testosterone.  The
product, available only by a doctor's prescription, was cleared for
marketing by the FDA.

Only about five percent of the estimated four to five million
American men of all ages with hypogonadism currently receive
testosterone-replacement therapy (TRT). "The currently available
choices given hypogonadal men in need of testosterone-replacement
therapy have been less than ideal," said Daniel Tasse, vice
president and director, endocrine and oncology products, SmithKline
Beecham. "Androderm will fill a distinct need in the area of
hormone-replacement therapy for men."

Overall, treatment with Androderm resulted in normalization of
morning testosterone levels in 92% of the 94 patients who completed
the trials.  In a key eight-week study of 29 patients who were
withdrawn from their previous testosterone-replacement therapy,
Androderm produced improvements in erectile function, libido and
mood, and decreases in complaints of fatigue.

Hypogonadism may be caused by conditions of the testes (such as
testicular injury, infection, or Klinefelter's syndrome, a
chromosomal abnormality), or disorders of the pituitary and
hypothalamus.

Metra Biosystems Inc. (265 N. Whisman Road, Mountain View, CA
94093; Tel: 415/903-9100) received FDA market clearance for its two
Pyrilinks urine-based assays that provide a quantitative measure of
excretion of pyridinium crosslinks as a indicator of type I
collagen resorption, especially bone collagen.  This provides
measurement of bone-collagen breakdown, which, when elevated, leads
to bone loss.

Bone is made up of a complex collagen matrix that is constantly
built up by cells called osteoblasts and broken down by cells
called osteoclasts.  In this process of bone turnover, osteoclasts
release pyridinium crosslinks (Pyd and Dpd) into urine that can be
quantitatively measured by Pyrilinks assays.

Alkphase-B, another Metra test previously cleared by the FDA,
measures alkaline phosphatase, a by-product of osteoblasts present
in blood.  When the rate of bone breakdown (loss) exceeds rate of
formation, total bone mass decreases.

Currently there are no commercially available products to rebuild
bone once it is lost.  For this reason, in diseases like
osteoporosis, it is exceedingly important to identify individuals
at risk and to act early and definitively.  Bone loss can be
controlled through use of a number of therapies including hormone
replacement, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin.

Pyrilinks values reflect level of bone-collagen loss as impacted by
such factors as low estrogen production, low calcium intake, low
physical activity, or diseases known to affect bone metabolism such
as osteoporosis, Paget's disease, hyperparathyroidism,
hyperthyroidism, and bone metastases.  As with all diagnostic
tests, Pyrilinks results should be interpreted in conjunction with
clinical findings and other diagnostic results. As the FDA has
stated, markers like Pyrilinks are needed if anti-resorptive
therapies -- such as those used to fight osteoporosis -- are to
increase in use and be used successfully," said George W. Dunbar,
president and CEO of Metra Biosystems.

Metra Biosystems has developed a panel of six biochemical bone
markers to help physicians more precisely assess a patient's bone
turnover.  Bone metabolism normally stays in careful balance,
maintaining healthy, strong bones.  Prolagen-C and NovoCalcin
assess bone and collagen formation.  Pyrilinks-D (currently under
review by the FDA), NovoCalcin, and Prolagen-C are available for
research use in the U.S. Metra's panel is available for clinical
use abroad.

Heart Attacks
Diagnosed at Bedside

Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics (9115 Hague Road, Indianapolis, IN
46250; Tel: 317/576-3914) received marketing clearance from the FDA
for a new rapid bedside assay that helps physicians diagnose
myocardial infarction.  The easy-to-use assay is based on the
company's proprietary marker--cardiac troponin T. It is located
inside cardiac muscle and is released into blood only when cells
are damaged.  In the U.S., Boehringer Mannheim has marketed an
ELISA version of the assay on its ES 300 immunoassay system since
June 1994.

The Cardiac T Rapid Assay is a self-contained, disposable unit
approximately four inches long, less than an inch wide, and only a
quarter of an inch thick.  Drops of blood are placed in a well on
the device and are quickly drawn into a sandwich assay impregnated
with two distinct types of monoclonal antibodies that link to
cardiac troponin T in the sample, resulting in a visible color
change.  A red control line appears to verify that the test is
working properly, and if the sample contains cardiac troponin T, a
second red line appears to alert the physician, nurse, or
laboratory specialist.

Meanwhile, researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital reported
that elevated levels of Cardiac Specific Troponin-I predict an
increased mortality risk and may play a role in identifying
patients appropriate for early invasive treatment.  The study is
the largest to investigate the role of Cardiac Specific Troponin-I
in predicting mortality risk.

Investigators examined multiple blood specimens from 1,470 patients
with unstable angina who were enrolled in the National Institute of
Health's Thrombolytic and Myocardial Infarction Study (TIMI-IIIB).
Cardiac Specific Troponin-I was measured to identify those patients
appropriate for early invasive therapy, such as early
catheterization and revascularization.

Results indicated that Cardiac Specific Troponin-I levels greater
than 0.4 ng/ml predicted a significantly increased mortality by 42
days.  Conversely, Cardiac Specific Troponin-I levels less than 0.4
ng/ml were predictive of a low risk of mortality.  The study found
that for every ng/ml elevation of cardiac troponin-I, a patient's
mortality risk increased 10%. Patients with an elevated cardiac
troponin-I level experienced a significantly improved survival rate
when they underwent an early invasive versus a conservative
strategy.

"For the first time, a blood test is available that identifies
patients with unstable angina who are an increased risk of
mortality," said Dr. Elliot Antman, lead investigator of the study,
director of Coronary Care, and associate professor of medicine at
Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School (25
Shattuck Ave., Boston, MA 02115; Tel: 617/495-1000).

Simultaneous Assay for
Chlamydia, Gonorrhea

Gen-Probe Inc. (9880 Campus Point Drive, San Diego, CA 92121-1589;
Tel: 619/546-8000) now markets PACE 2C, a new version of the PACE
2 assay for simultaneous diagnosis of the two most common sexually
transmitted diseases in the U.S.  PACE 2 and PACE 2C detect the
presence of ribosomal RNA for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, the organisms responsible for chlamydia and gonorrhea
infections.

According to Craig S. Hill, manager of scientific affairs at Gen-
Probe, infection with both diseases simultaneously is "quite
common"; as many as 50% of patients who have gonorrhea infections
are also infected with chlamydia.  The PACE 2 and PACE 2C assays
offer the advantage of diagnosing both infections as part of the
same procedure. Traditional laboratory tests for gonorrhea require
a bacterial culture, while chlamydia detection relies on cell
culture.  Both methods have limitations not experienced with the
PACE 2 and PACE 2C assays.  Immunoassays have also been used to
detect these sexually transmitted diseases, but they cannot detect
the presence of both infections in a single sample or assay.

First introduced in 1990, the PACE 2 assay relies on DNA probes
that are labeled with acridinium ester, which can detect the
ribosomal RNA of the disease organisms.  One sample from the
patient is all that is needed to test for both organisms.  If the
disease organism is present, the DNA probes hybridize to the target
ribosomal RNA, and the results can be obtained within 2.5 hours by
measuring the signal (measured in relative light units).

According to Hill, the PACE 2 assay is "the most widely used
nonculture [chlamydia and gonorrhea] assay in the U.S."  The PACE
2C assay can detect the disease organisms from a single sample, as
well as in a single test tube.  If a positive signal results from
this assay, a second assay can determine which of the organisms is
present.

In one investigation, sensitivity of the PACE 2C assay was 96.3%,
while specificity was 98.8%.  Sensitivity and specificity of the
PACE 2 assay for chlamydia are 93% and 99%, respectively.  The
sensitivity and specificity of the PACE 2 assay for gonorrhea are
95% and 99%, respectively.  By comparison, the sensitivity of
culture methods may be as low as 88.9%.

Hepatitis Serotyping
Test Launched

International Murex Technologies (3075 Northwoods Circle, Norcross,
GA 30071; Tel: 770/662-0660) has commercialized its second-
generation assay for serological genotyping of Hepatitis C (HCV).

The Murex HCV Serotyping (1-6) assay is a simple, enzyme
immunoassay that identifies whether a patient is infected with HCV
types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.  This second-generation test is the only
commercial assay to cover HCV types 1-6, according to the company.
The test will initially be marketed to clinicians and research,
clinical, and private laboratories outside the United States.  The
product has already been registered for in vitro diagnostic use in
France.

Murex launched its first-generation serotyping test identifying
types 1, 2, and 3 in November 1994.  Prior to that introduction,
HCV typing was restricted to certain laboratories where genotyping
could be performed by complex, laborious procedures involving DNA
amplification technology.  This seriously limited investigations
into the disease.  In contrast, the Murex HCV Serotyping (1-6) test
is suitable for use in any laboratory as no specialist skills or
facilities are required.

The launch of Murex HCV Serotyping (1-6) test will now allow
meaningful research into significance of different HCV types and
will greatly assist in development of appropriate patient-
management strategies. HCV type is a key factor in determining
patient response to antiviral therapy; it is critical to determine
HCV type so that the patient may receive the most appropriate
therapy.

The Murex HCV Serotyping (1-6) test utilizes synthetic peptides
representing variable antigenic regions from NS4 of HCV types 1
through 6.  Differential response of patient antibodies to these
regions of NS4 enables the test to identify HCV types in infected
patients.

Bladder Cancer
Test Available

Maritech Inc. (330 Nevada St., Newton, MA 02160; Tel: 617/928-0820)
received conditional approval from FDA's Immunology Devices Panel
of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee for its "Maritech NMP22
Test Kit."

The Panel voted that the FDA should approve the product for use in
identifying patients at risk of recurrence, with the condition that
the company provide data on an additional number of certain
subjects.  Another Panel hearing will not be necessary, but the
company must provide these data in order to obtain approval to
market from the FDA.

Maritech is presently studying the FDA's request for additional
data in order to provide it as promptly as possible.  NMP22 is the
first Nuclear Matrix Protein-based diagnostic product to be
reviewed by the FDA for sale in the U.S.

Now being sold in Europe, the "Matritech NMP22 Test Kit" is twice
as sensitive as urine cytology and is a painless, low-cost, highly
accurate tool for management of transitional cell carcinoma of the
urinary tract (TCC/UT), which accounts for more than 90% of bladder
cancer.

The Maritech NMP22 Test Kit's enabling technology is based on a
fundamental breakthrough in cell biology discovered at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where researchers
found that nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) in cancer cells differ
from those in normal cells.  MIT obtained patents covering the use
of NMPs to detect cancer and licensed their discovery worldwide,
exclusively, to Matritech.

While Lamm anticipates that other urologists will embrace a more
accurate and painless alternative to current testing options, they
also noted that Matritech's urine assay will offer patients
significant savings.  For example, invasive cystoscopy often costs
about $300.  Matritech estimates the NMP22 Test Kit will sell for
between $40 and $50 per test.

accepted by all 15 EU member countries.

Safety and effectiveness of Adcon-L was established based on
clinical data obtained from a European multicenter pivotal trial of
Adcon-L involving 254 patients at nine academic medical centers in
Europe.  Results of this study demonstrated that Adcon-L
signifiq9ntly reduced incidence of peridural fibrosis and related
clinical symptoms following lumbar discectomy surgery, according to
Gliatech.

Gliatech is currently marketing two Adcon products, Adcon-L and
Adcon-T/N, in France and The Netherlands, based on previous
national laws, prior to implementation of the present European
Union CE Certification process.  With Adcon-L certification
completed, Adlcon-T/N, which inhibits post-surgical adhesions
around tendons and nerves, will be the next focus for CE
Certification.  The Company is also conducting pivotal clinical
studies in the United States for both Adcon-L and Adcon-T/N.
Gliatech is also developing additional Adcon products to inhibit
surgical adhesions associated with abdominal, pelvic/gynecological,
and cardiac surgeries.

Pall Changes
IV Concept

A new concept in intravenous (IV) fluid filtration has been
developed by Pall Biomedical Products Co. (25 Harbor Park Drive,
Port Washington, NY 11050; Tel: 516/484-3600, Fax: 516/484-3637, E-
mail: custsvc@pall.com).  The Pall DUO96 Set Save Extended-Life
Disposable Filter incorporates a new dual-chamber design that is
for use with intermittent medications in oncology and intensive
care.  The smaller chamber (0.5cc) is ideal for fluid-restricted
patients such as neonates.

In addition to its clinical benefits, the DUO96 filter provides
cost savings.  When the Pall IV filter is used, the interval for
routine IV set change can be extended up to 96 hours, resulting in
a reduction in set use and costs.  Nursing time associated with
intravenous administration (set changes, restarts, and problem
resolution) is also reduced.

The DUO96 filter contains a Posidyne 0.2 micron Nylon 66 membrane,
a hydrophilic filter medium that is easily wetted and easily
primed.  Position-insensitive hydrophobic membranes automatically
vent air.

Toray Creates
Antithrombotic

Researchers at Toray Industries (2-1, Nihonbashi-Muromachi 2-chome,
Chuo-ku, Tokyo 130 Japan) have synthesized a hydrophilic material
and a formed a semipermeable membrane from that material (U.S.
Patent 5,480,953).

When membranes are used for medical care and brought into contact
with blood or body fluid, their components such as platelets,
leucocytes, erythrocytes, and fibroblasts inevitably adhere. There
are fears that these adhered components generate a thrombus on a
surface of a membrane coming into contact with blood and that the
components affect a complement. As a result, formation of a
thrombus or reduction of an immunity function is presumed to be
caused.

Various attempts to solve these difficulties have been made. In
synthesizing a hydrophilic copolymer containing a polyalkylene
oxide chain, copolymerized with an acrylic or methacrylic ester,
the content of polyalkylene oxide in the copolymer can be too high,
and there is a problem that the synthesized copolymer becomes a gel
in spite of the kind of the acrylic or methacrylic ester used. The
gel can hardly be dissolved in a solvent. In such a case, it cannot
be used as a coating material and cannot be formed as a fiber or a
membrane.

Even if the content of polyalkylene oxide is low, a satisfactory
anti-fouling property and antithrombotic property have not been
demonstrated. In research to improve the gel structure, a polymer
that can be easily dissolved in a solvent with a high water content
and a high affinity with acrylic ester or methacrylic ester was
synthesized by copolymerizing an acrylic ester or methacrylic
ester, polyalkylene oxide, and another copolymerizable component.

The material developed is characterized as a copolymer composed of
a monomer with a polyalkylene oxide unit and a polymerizable
carbon-carbon double bond in its molecule, a methacrylic ester
monomer or an acrylic ester monomer, and a monomer with a
polymerizable carbon-carbon double bond other than the first two
monomers. The content of the monomer is not less than 5% by weight
and not more than 90% by weight.

The hydrophilic material can be dissolved in a solvent and has
excellent antithrombotic and anti-fouling properties and provides
an antithrombotic semipermeable membrane. These materials can be
appropriately used in the medical field and as water-absorbent and
anti-fouling materials.

Medtronic Expands
Neurological Business

Medtronics (7000 Central Ave., Minneapolis, MN 55432; Tel: 612/574-
4000) signed an agreement to acquire Micro Interventional Systems
(680 Maud Ave., Sunnyvale, CA 94086; Tel: 408/481-4900). MIS is a
rapidly emerging provider of products for minimally invasive
treatment of stroke and for treating diseases in other parts of the
body accessible through small blood vessels.

MIS offers broad lines of catheters and guidewires used by
neuroradiologists and interventional radiologists to perform
procedures in blood vessels of the brain and elsewhere to treat
blockages and malformations of vessels, fistulas, clots, tumors,
and hemorrhages.  Use of these devices can often replace
destructive neurosurgery or address medical needs for which no
previous therapy was available.

William W. George, Medtronic president and CEO, noted that the MIS
acquisition would come shortly after acquisition of Medtronic PS
Medical, a world leader in neurosurgical implants, announced late
in 1995. "Acquisition of these innovative organizations, whose
product lines address critical  medical needs, represents
significant strategic expansion of Medtronic Neurological Business,
which now includes neurostimulation, site-specific drug delivery,
neurosurgical implants, and products for stroke therapy," George
said.

MIS participates in a worldwide inverventional neuroradiology
market of $100 million, expected to grow to more than $500 million
by the year 2000 as physicians and reimbursers emphasize catheter-
based therapies over open surgeries.

Rapid Change in
Device Market

Daphne Allen, assistant editor of Medical Device & Diagnostic
Industry, has analyzed the growth in the number of registered
medical device manufacturers in the U.S.  Data were obtained from
the FDA's Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance, which is a
part of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

During the period between August 1994 and August 1995, the FDA
recorded an increase of 1,737 registered medical device companies.
Overall, however, the total number of medical device establishments
has declined by 2%.  In addition to companies who leave the device
industry, the decline may be attributed to mergers, acquisitions,
consolidation of sites, and business failures.

The study indicated that six states provide the homes of nearly 47%
of the registered manufacturers.  California led the pack with
1,920 companies; New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Florida, and
Texas are also important locations for manufacturers.  The analysis
was published in Volume 17, No. 10

Medical Device Reuse
Still Unresolved

A reusable medical device, as opposed to medical disposables, is
intended for repeated use on either the same or different patients
-- with obviously requisite decontamination and other necessary
reprocessing between uses. Examples of reusable devices include
endoscopes and surgical instruments, which often do not have
directions and labeling for proper reuse.

Furthermore, although disposable devices such as dialyzers and
catheters are intended for single use, they are often reprocessed
without labeling or directions for safe reuse by manufacturers.

Therefore, there are two issues involved in the reuse of medical
devices: reusables and disposables.

According to some medical trade associations, the FDA has not been
able to establish a consistent reuse policy even though the agency
takes the position that device reuse is a potential safety problem.
Medical device industry associations also state that the FDA has
shifted responsibility for safe reuse to medical device
manufacturers rather than health-care providers.  Only recently has
the FDA provided guidance on how to label products for reuse.

A key ingredient of the FDA's policy on reuse labeling requires any
510(k) notice to contain a certificate of validation. Although the
responsibility for medical device reuse is still not clear, the FDA
appears to be getting tougher with service organizations that
assist hospitals in reprocessing.  But the agency still is not
willing to directly regulate health-care facilities.

The general consensus is that the FDA will continue to apply
pressure to manufacturers to justify and validate reuse of their
devices despite their single-use labeling. A critical question
remains as to whether the FDA's position will be upheld in
litigation or lead to voluntary compliance by industry.

Artificial Nose May
Have Medical Applications

By mimicking the impressive ability of the human nose to pick a
single odor out of a million, Tufts University (419 Boston Ave.,
Medford, MA 02155; Tel: 617/627-3250) researchers David Walt and
John Kauer have invented a fiber optic and computer "nose" that can
identify many substances by their smells.

One of many potential uses for an artificial nose includes
"detecting the signature odor of a human being, which can be used
not just for identification but also for diagnostic purposes.  We
may be able to test breath and sweat odors to detect diseases that
alter metabolism," said Kauer, professor of neuroscience and
anatomy and cellular biology at Tufts School of Medicine. "Smell is
the most sensitive, most flexible way to do chemical testing," said
Walt, professor and chairman of chemistry at Tufts.

Cells inside the nose house millions of receptors that send
messages to the olfactory bulb, a pea-sized structure between the
eyes.  The olfactory bulb pares these messages down to a few
thousand, which it relays to the brain.

A chemical sensor works in the following manner.  A hair-thin glass
fiber is tipped with chemical A, a combination of a polymer and a
dye, which is known to react with chemical B.  The fiber is exposed
to the substance to be tested.  A light beam travels down the
fiber, hits chemical A (if it's there), and bounces back.  A
computer analyzes the light for changes in color and intensity that
would occur if chemical A encountered chemical B.  Like litmus
paper that turns a brighter red in presence of increasing amounts
of acid, behavior of light tells chemists how much of chemical B,
if any, is present.

While Walt's optical sensors have proved useful for various
medical, environmental, and chemical testing processes, "you need
100 sensors to detect 100 substances," he said. However, "if you
built a system based on olfactory principles, then one sensing
system would detect many different odors," Kauer said.  "There
would be an array of sensors where each one is cross-reactive --
each one responds to some degree to some compounds and to some
degree to others -- to create patterns across the array."

Using Walt's knowledge of sensors and Kauer's knowledge of
neurological networks, they created a device -- for which they
received a patent -- that can tell the difference between alcohols
that differ by one carbon atom and can identify five-carbon esters
that smell like bananas.  In other words, their invention is, in
some cases, almost as good as a well-trained human nose.

worldwide by the Polaroid Medical Imaging Systems division (PMIS).

Konica will develop an image networking system that will provide
imagers with interfaces to a variety of medical imaging acquisition
devices.  Konica will be responsible for all sales, service and
technical support of products bearing its brand and sold in Japan.

Laser imaging systems are commonly used by radiologists to record
images generated by such digital diagnostic devices as computed
tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), applications
where Konica has a leading share of the market in Japan.  Konica's
new dry-process product line will include two models that produce,
respectively, 8x10-inch and 14x17-inch films.

Polaroid's revolutionary digital laser imaging and dry-process film
technology combines powerful lasers and a patented digital
rendering technique to generate consistently precise images onto a
unique carbon-based film in seconds.  Because the system is fully
digital, it enables hospitals and clinics to eliminate silver-based
film and wet-chemical processing, as well as costs and hazards
related to use of chemicals.

Energy Pumped
into MRI Diagnosis

Researchers are using high-power diode lasers from Opto Power Corp.
(3321 E. Global Loop, Tucson, AZ 85706; Tel: 520/746-1234, Fax:
520/294-3300, E-mail: opc_info@ix.netcom.com) in a new, gas-based
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure that may detect
emphysema, asthma, pulmonary embolisms, and other lung diseases
that have been difficult or impossible to diagnose with
conventional proton MRI.  Employing this experimental "laser-
polarized" gas MRI method, physicists at Princeton University and
scientists with Duke University's Center for In Vivo Microscopy
acquired the first high-resolution images of a human lung, reports
OPC's Merrill Apter.

Since they are filled with air and not water, a human lung is
difficult to image effectively using proton MRI because it lacks
the necessary hydrogen atoms to produce a resolute picture.  While
x-rays of the lungs can show some accumulation of fluid and scar
tissue, their exposures are too short to reveal porous lung tissue.

Other diagnostic procedures for imaging the lungs, such as
ventilation scans with radioactive isotopes, expose the patient to
significant levels of radiation and often fail to produce
sufficiently high-resolution images.  The noble gases used in the
laser-polarized gas MRI technique--usually helium (He) or xenon
(Xe)--are inert and nonradioactive and therefore are harmless
inhalants, posing no health risk to the patient.

Tuned to 795 nm, the diode laser stimulates an atomic transition in
the alkali metal rubidium (Rb), which is driven into a vapor in a
small oven heated to about 180C.  The Rb vapor becomes polarized
in the process and subsequently transfers some of the polarization
to the nuclei of 3He or 129Xe during gas-phase collisions in a 50-
100 cc sealed cell.  After sufficient polarization is generated in
the noble gas, it can be cooled to room temperature (condensing the
rubidium vapor) and inhaled into the lungs for imaging.

Physicist Hunter Middleton of Princeton University (223 Jadwin
Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544; Tel: 609/258-2843, Fax: 609/258-1124, E-
mail: midleton@princeton.edu) describes how the research team
relies on intense light from OPC's high-power diode lasers to
produce the required volumes of polarized gas.  "The highly
polarized state of the noble gas allows images taken with the new
MRI technique to be generated in seconds, compared to the minutes
often required for conventional MRIs," says Middleton.  When the
project began they were using five sets of large titanium:sapphire
laser systems pumped by argon ion lasers to achieve the required
levels of polarization, but those lasers were found to be too
expensive and inefficient.

Turning to diode lasers, they were able to dramatically lower their
operating costs. The compact 20 W open-heatsink diode laser
initially employed in the new MRI technique was priced at about
$4,000 and used less than 80 W of electrical input power.  By
comparison, the argon ion and titanium:sapphire lasers together
were priced in the neighborhood of $500,000 and used about 250 kW
of electricity to produce the same output power. "The
titanium:sapphire setup was so big it required a separate room,"
explains Middleton.  "The diode laser array, on the other hand, is
so small and efficient that it allows us to move the laser-
polarized gas MRI station easily from the laboratory to a hospital
environment equipped with only a standard 110 v wall outlet."

The 20 W array was more than adequate for imaging the lungs of a
guinea pig, but couldn't produce enough polarized gas necessary for
human tests.  For the first test of a human lung, a 120 W array
produced nearly 1 liter of polarized gas in four hours.  "Though
the spectral distribution, or emission bandwidth, of the diode
laser array (about 2.5 nm) is much broader than that of
titanium:sapphire lasers and exceeds the absorption line of the
rubidium as well, it's nevertheless extremely efficient in this
application," says Middleton.  "We believe that imaging the
function of the lungs and other organs and tissues filled with air
spaces using laser-polarized gas has vast potential and may evolve
into a nice complement to conventional proton MRI."

Syringe Prevents
Self-Puncture

Medisys Technologies Inc. (9624 Brookline Ave., Baton Rouge, LA
70809; Tel: 504/926-0420) has received a patent for a safety
syringe designed to prevent accidental "dirty needle stick" or
inadvertent self puncture.

According to the company, Softip is the only existing needle and
syringe that automatically encloses the needle in a protective
micro-thin sheath before the hypodermic is withdrawn from the
patient's body thereby eliminating exposure to a potentially
contaminated sharp needle point.

Edward Sutherland, the company's chief executive officer, stated,
"Needle sales in the United States are in excess of $1 billion
annually, and industry analysts project demand for safety needles
will grow dramatically as healthcare workers, hospitals, and home-
use patients demand products that offer safety from accidental
exposure to infectious diseases such as AIDS and Hepatitis."

The company is currently in discussions with a number of
manufacturers of needles and syringes.  The product is expected to
sell commercially for pennies more than the needles and syringes
currently available, as compared to the high cost of existing
safety needles.

Rotatable Heart
Valve Unveiled

St. Jude Medical (1 Lillehi Plaza, St. Paul, MN 55117; Tel:
612/483-2000) received FDA approval of its new rotatable heart
valve, the Mechanical Heart Valve SJM Masters Series valve.  The
FDA approved all aortic and mitral versions of the product.  Given
this approval, the SJM Masters Series valve will soon be available
to all U.S. customers.  The product has been available in Europe
since March 1995, with positive market reaction.

The SJM Masters Series valve is a system of enhancements of the St.
Jude Medical Mechanical Heart Valve, the industry's most preferred
heart valve, with more than 600,000 implants worldwide.  The SJM
Master Series valve was developed in consultation with more than
200 physicians and surgeons.

The product can be rotated for optimum valve-leaflet position after
it is sutured in place, providing additional flexibility for those
surgeons who desire rotatability.  It is also MRI compatible and
radiopaque for improved post-implant diagnostic capability features
requested by some surgeons.

Initial European implants of the SJM Masters Series valve occurred
in March, and the aortic version of the valve was awarded the CE
Mark in September.  To date, there have been more than 1,500
implants of the SJM Masters Series valves in Europe and Canada.
The company submitted a premarket approval (PMA) supplement to the
FDA for U.S. market approval in May 1995.  This FDA approval is the
culmination of a year-long rollout of this product by the company's
heart-valve division.

Commenting on FDA approval of the SJM Masters Series valve, Terry
L. Shepherd, president of the St. Jude Medical Division, said, "The
SJM Masters Series represents the continued enhancement of a
revolutionary design introduced in 1977, the St. Jude Medical
Mechanical Heart Valve."

Heart Pumps May
Replace Transplants

Continued improvement in left ventricular assist devices (LVAD)
have enabled doctors at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (New
York, NY 10032; Tel: 212/305-5587) to discharge patients awaiting
heart transplantation.

LVADs are devices that assist pumping function of the heart.  The
earliest models developed more than 20 years ago were quite
cumbersome, keeping patients tethered to large external pumps and
their pneumatic power systems.  Recent technology advances have
yielded a portable, battery-powered version, its power source worn
on a belt or shoulder holster.

The LVAD used at Columbia-Presbyterian is the vented electric
Thermo Cardiosystems HeartMate.  About four inches in diameter,
less than two inches thick, and weighing about one and a half
pounds, the pump is implanted in the abdomen.  It is attached to
the heart and receives and pumps blood into the circulation,
leaving the natural heart in place to perform other important
functions.

A cable from the pump extends out of the body and is connected to
a battery pack.  With proper care, this connection can be
maintained for long periods without infection. After discharge,
patients and their caregivers must provide simple maintenance for
the LVAD, including changing the battery pack every six to eight
hours, changing dressings daily around the cable exit, and keeping
it dry.

A major advance of these new LVADs is a textured internal surface
that reduces likelihood of blood clots that can lead to strokes, a
serious problem in earlier devices.  No anti-coagulation medication
other than aspirin is needed. No deaths, serious device
malfunctions, or infections have occurred among discharged
patients.  All have been able to maintain their LVADS safely.

Currently, LVADs are FDA-approved only as a "bridge to transplant";
i.e. they are implanted in people who are awaiting a donor heart
but who suddenly decompensate and cannot survive without extra
pumping help. Until recently, LVAD patients had to remain in the
hospital, waiting an average of three months for transplantation.
However, advances enabled Columbia-Presbyterian physicians to
discharge seven patients to await transplantation more comfortably
-- and far less expensively than in an intensive care unit -- at
home.

Eichrom's Diphonix
Shows Specificity

The Diphonix ion-exchange resin produced by Eichrom Industries Inc.
(8205 S. Cass Ave., Suite 107, Darien, IL 60561; Tel: 708/963-0320,
Fax: 708/963-0381) has metal-ion specificity that enables it to
remove radionuclides and metals selectively from aqueous solutions.
This high-performance, gel-type cation resin displays exceptional
ionic selectivity, tremendous capacity, and a rapid rate of
complexation.  The selectivity, capacity, and exchange kinetics of
the Eichrom resin allows performance enhancements in an array of
applications where selective separation is important.

In contrast to other commercially available ion-exchange resins,
Eichrom's Diphonix resin is polyfunctional, with two distinct
functional groups.  Each of these groups contributes to the resin's
performance.  The Diphonix resin is constructed of a
polystyrene/divinylbenzene matrix in a spherical bead form (in a
tightly controlled size range).

Chemically bonded to the polymer matrix are diphosphonic and
sulfonic acid groups.  The primary exchange group is geminally
substituted diphosphonic acid (with a content of 1.2-1.6 mmol of
phosphorus per dry gram of resin).  These unique ligands form
extremely stable complexes with a number of metal ions and are
responsible the Diphonix resin's metal ion specificity.
Incorporated into the matrix at the time of polymerization, the
diphosphonic acid functional group is physically stable over a wide
range of thermal and chemical conditions.

Resin activity is exceptional in acidic solutions where the
Diphonix resin's contains complexed metals under conditions that
for most ion exchangers would effect the resin regeneration.  The
diphosphonic acid ligand retains metals effectively at pH values of
2 and under, conditions that many resins would see as regenerating.
The resin can remove trace metals from acid solutions used in the
semiconductor industry for product washing and etching, allowing
the reuse of the solutions.

The secondary exchange sites in the Diphonix resin are comprised of
sulfonic acid groups.  Contained with the polymer matrix, these
ligands make the resin very hydrophobic.  As a result, they enhance
metal ion accessibility into the polymer network and significantly
improve the ion-exchange kinetics of the Diphonix resins.

The Diphonix ion-exchange resin is ideally suited for
ultrapurification, metallurgical processing applications, treatment
of radioactive effluents, industrial wastewater treatment, and
environmental remediation.  In these applications, the resin
preferentially interacts with metal ions in liquid solutions,
providing a cost-effective way of removing metals from process or
waste solutions.  Metal selectivity is maintained even in the
presence of a high concentration of competing cations, such as
sodium, calcium, and magnesium.  The Diphonix resin reduces the
metal concentrations to the level required, while rejecting
unregulated ions (i.e., the competing cations).  Metals can be
extracted via ion exchange instead of by alkaline precipitation.

By utilizing a bed of Diphonix resin, a sidestream arrangement,
contaminant residuals in process streams can be controlled.
Diphonix resin shows exceptional selectivity for a number of
radionuclide species.  In nuclear power plants, contaminated
radwaste can be treated at a reduced cost compared to conventional
ion-exchange resins.  The Diphonix resin's capacity is not spent on
non-regulated species.  Additionally, in soil or water remediation,
the resin's high reactivity achieves removal to the lowest possible
concentration.

The resin's preference for metal ions makes the effective capacity
for metals higher than non-selective cation resins.  On a total
exchange basis, the capacity compares with non-selective resins of
similar crosslink percentage.  Capacity values for all resin forms
(determined by bead size and percent crosslinkage) are available
from Eichrom.  The firm offers the Diphonix resin in a variety of
bead sizes and crosslinkage percentages that suit a number of
laboratory and process applications.

The Diphonix resin is the result of breakthrough technologies
developed by Argonne National Laboratory and the University of
Tennessee, where Spiro D. Alexandratos determined that
bifunctionality and intra-ligand cooperation played important roles
in ensuring metal ion selectivity when phosphorus acid ligands were
covalently bonded to polystyrene beads.

Building upon this technological base, Eichrom has developed a
significant array of new products that stem from three innovative
core technologies:  Selective ion-exchange resins, extraction
chromatographic resins, and specific extractants.  Sectors in which
Eichrom is involved include the following:

Increased productivity, waste minimization, and cost reduction for
environmental laboratories;

Extraction chromatographic resins for the selective separation of
radium, cesium, and tritium;

Enhanced analysis and removal capabilities for actinides,
strontium, and technetium;

Separation of ultrapure isotopes for radiopharmaceutical
applications; and

Advanced separations products for industrial and environmental
applications, including ultrapure reagents, hydrometallurgy, and
radioactive wastes.

System Reuses 95% of
Copper Rinse Water

A water-recycling system from the Engineered Systems Division of
Kinetico Inc. (10845 Kinsman Road, Newbury, OH 44065; Tel: 800/633-
5530) will enable West Coast Circuits (Watsonville, CA) to recycle
more than 95% of the copper rinse waters used in its printed
circuit fabrication process.  The unique design of the 20- to 30-
gpm system will produce high-purity deionized water that will
improve product quality and reduce water and sewer costs.

Ion-exchange technology is used to recover heavy metals and
minimize waste at West Coast Circuits facility, thereby reducing
its cost of hauling the wastewater discharge off-site.  The
Kinetico water-recycling system features countercurrent process to
regenerate the ion-exchange resins used.  The process regenerates
the resin columns with acid for the metal cations and caustic for
the anions injected from the opposite flow direction. This process
design uses up to 50% fewer chemicals, produces less waste
regenerant, and utilizes resin capacity more effectively.

The Kinetico division has also sold a Waste Minimization System to
Motorola Semiconductors Hong Kong Ltd. (Taipo, Hong Kong), an
international semiconductor manufacturer.  The system, which
combines ion-exchange technology with electrowinning, will provide
Motorola with high-purity water recycling, metal recovery, and
waste minimization.

The two-part Kinetico system consists of a rinse-water recycling
system and a metal scavenging system.  The 60 gpm rinse-water
recycling system will recycle rinse water from four Technic Plater
lines.  It will also treat the dragout rinses after process steps
in the manufacturing of semiconductors.  This design will improve
environmental performance, reduce water and sewer bills, and lower
operating costs.

The 12 gpm metal-scavenging system selectively removes metals to
lower discharge limits; therefore, minimal water treatment is
needed before discharge.  The system is integrated with a 25-
square-foot electrolytic metal recovery system and waste-acid
recovery system to recover copper and tin/lead in metallic form
from the dragout and flowing rinses.  This minimizes wastewater
flows to the existing treatment system and reduces the amount of
sludge produced, thereby lowering the waste-effluent quality.

For more information on Kinetico systems and the firm's line of
deionization, ion-exchange, electrowinning, and membrane systems
for process and wastewater treatment, contact Teresa Saloka.
Standard and custom systems are available for water recycling,
metal recovery, and waste minimization.  These systems are ideal
for applications in the metal finishing, electronics, printed
circuit board, semiconductor, groundwater remediation, and a
variety of other industries.  Kinetico is an authorized OEM for
Rohm & Haas pollution-control resins and Koch Membrane Systems.

Metal Recovered
from Residues

A two-phase process from Cabot Corp. (157 Concord Road, Billerica,
MA 01821-7101; Tel: 508/663-3455) recovers metal and acid values
from a metallic fluorides-containing source material.  Invented by
Robert A. Hard and protected by U.S. Patent 5,437,848, the process
digests the source material in sulfuric acid.  This digestion forms
a slurry that separates into two phases:

A fluoride-containing solid phase; and

A metal-containing first-liquid phase.

Hard writes that subjecting the solid phase to pyrohydrolysis
allows the recovery of sulfuric and hydrofluoric acids.

The liquid phase is then processed, via solvent extraction or ion
exchange, to recover the metal values.  A water-immiscible organic
extractant, such as methylisobutyl ketone, extracts the tantalum
values, and water strips it from the first organic phase.  The
process includes the additional steps of heating the separated
solid phase from ambient to elevated temperatures, in the presence
of water vapor, to evolve sulfuric acid and render the gangue
chemically inert.

When the source material contains uranium, the digestion step
reduces the amount of gangue present in the radioactive source. The
process can include the additional steps of removing uranium from
the liquid phase, by either an ion-exchange resin or by solvent
extraction.  This removal process also uses a water-immiscible
organic extractant to yield a uranium-depleted aqueous phase that
can be treated with an aqueous solution of calcium oxide.  Sulfuric
acid and the organic extractant for extracting uranium can be
recycled if desired.

Method Purifies
Crude Proteins

David Naveh and John C. Tang of Schering Nederland B.V. (Van
Houten, Industriepark 1, NL-1381 MZ Weesp, The Netherlands; Tel:
0031-2940-62424, Fax: 0031-2940-18336) have invented an ion-
exchange chromatography technique that purifies proteins.  The
crude protein mixture contains one or more undesirable proteins of
unknown isoelectric points.  Naveh and Tang use either computer
simulation or isoelectric focusing gels to determine the
isoelectric points of proteins in the crude protein mixture.

The pH for the ion-exchange chromatography is adjusted to a point
between the ranges of isoelectric points of the protein fractions
to be separated.  Separation occurs when contact is made between
the ion-exchange resin and the crude protein mixture.  Since the
proteins in the first and second fractions are oppositely charged,
only one of the fractions binds to the ion-exchange resin.  U.S.
Patent 5,451,662, which protects the technique, also discloses
details on the purification of GM-CSF using a cation-exchange
resin.

with Nomex Delta

The hot-gas filtration industry has been seeking technology with
higher filtration efficiency and greater air-pollution control. One
goal of the industry is dry-particulate filtration media with
efficiencies that approach zero emissions.

That goal moved closer to the realm of possibility with the
introduction of Nomex Delta Micro by E.I. Du Pont de Nemours and
Co. (1007 Market St., Wilmington, DE 19898; Tel: 302/774-1000). The
product combines high separation efficiency with low differential
pressure.  This combination results in significantly improved
surface filtration and reduced operating costs.

Based on the Du Pont's well-known Nomex fiber technology, Nomex
Delta Micro filters are composed of high-temperature-resistant
meta-aramid fibers.  The fibers measure only 0.78 dtex and have a
69% greater surface area than the 2.2 dtex aramid fibers used in
conventional aramid fibers.  These attributes enable users to
produce microporous needlefelts with more density and excellent
surface-filtration properties.

Most importantly, especially in filter cleaning and recovering
valuable production elements, the dense micropore filter surface
retains a greater proportion of dust particles than conventional
filters.  The microporous fleece structure of Nomex Delta Micro
filters causes the initial dust-cake phase to build up more
effectively.  Additionally, the structure prevents the dust-
particle penetration common to felts with larger, more open pores.

Launched worldwide, Nomex Delta Micro filters meet the new German
VDI Guideline 3926 that evaluates cleanable filter media.  Long-
term filtration behavior tests confirm that the dust-leakage values
of the new filters are significantly better than with standard
Nomex fibers or with other meta-aramid filter felts. The tests also
reveal that emission reductions with the Nomex Delta Micro filters
are comparable to (equivalent with) higher-priced laminated
filters.

Laboratory tests show that the new technology has a lower pressure-
drop value than standard filter felts.  DuPont reports that the
higher air-to-cloth capability of needlefelts composed of Nomex
Delta Micro filters allows more flue gas per square meter of felt
surface to be treated.  Therefore, the firm states that users need
to clean the filters less frequently. Another added benefit is that
the filters could make smaller, less expensive ventilation systems
feasible.  The lightweight capability of the ultrafine fibers could
potentially lead to reduced operating costs, without any loss any
filtration efficiency.

Du Pont  notes that the chemical resistance of filter felts
composed of the new fibers equals or excels that of standard (2.2
dtex) Nomex filter felts.  Both the standard and the new Nomex
filters perform well mechanically and demonstrate dimensional
stability at operating temperatures up to 200oC.  They provide an
extensive safety margin for temperature surges.

Information on Nomex Delta Micro may be obtained from Fleet Smith
(Tel: 302/999-3419), Nomex marketing manager for Du Pont.

Osmonics Holding
More of the Dirt

Increased dirt-holding capacity (DHC) or contaminant loading of
filters has been a continuous goal of filter manufacturers and a
continuous desire of filter users.  This is because increased DHC
results in more economical filtration.  However, it is difficult to
achieve higher DHC without compromising the efficiency of the
filter.

Most filter manufacturers have devised increasing DHC by improving
the filter media.  The amount any filter medium can hold is
directly proportional to the void volume or open area in the media.
Over the years, millions of dollars have been spent on developing
media that will hold more contaminant.  It is a difficult task
because in any given medium, if you increase the void volume, you
decrease contaminant-removal efficiency.

To increase DNC without compromising removal efficiency,
manufacturers have altered the structure of the media.  Despite
using finer fibers, greater loft, more entanglement, and multiple
layers, or by forming asymmetric pores and creating greater pore
density, filter media manufacturers have been able to achieve only
modest increases in DNC.

Spiraltek rolled-cartridge filters from Osmonics (5951 Clearwater
Drive, Minnetonka, MN  55343;  Tel: 612/933-2277,  Fax: 612/933-
0141) represent a new concept in filtration.  The filter was
developed using a knowledge of crossflow technology.  In crossflow
filtration, the media is continuously cleaned by the process fluid
that flows across the media surface.  The fluid flow is
mechanically restricted downstream, such that a portion of the flow
passes through the media, while the remainder passes beyond the
restriction. The portion that did not go through the media contains
a concentrated level of contaminant.

Spiraltek filters employ the basics of crossflow filtration, but
the downstream restriction is entirely closed.  The result is a
fluid flow that continuously cleans the media surface without a
secondary stream containing concentrated contaminant.  As
contaminant is pushed towards the sealed end of the filter, the
contaminant packs against itself in a non-porous section of the
filter.  Restriction to flow increases very slowly, and the filter
operates steadily for a longer period of time.  The end result is
less dependence on the void volume of the media for increased DNC
and a quantum increase in DNC based on the filter construction.

The new filters have been successfully applied in the field, and
subjected to unbiased, head-to-head comparison testing.  Test
results show that Spiraltek filters hold three to six times more
contaminant per square foot of filter media when compared to other
pleated filters.

ECC Merges North
American Units

As part of its strategy to become the leading supplier of
technology-based, value-added minerals and chemicals to the
industries it serves, English China Clays (1015 Arlington Business
Park, Theale, Reading RG7 4SA, England; Tel: 01734-304010, Fax:
01734-309500) has merged its North American paper business units.
The merged units will operate as ECC International Inc. AmPac Paper
Group.

The merger enables ECC, the world's leading supplier of pigments to
the paper industry, "through a single organization, to deliver
improved levels of service and products," says Andrew Teare, ECC's
executive director.  Teare notes that the merger furthers a
transition begun in the early 1990s from ECC's "being a minerals
and construction business into a specialty minerals and chemicals
company.  A major step in the strategy was the acquisition in 1993
of the specialty chemical company Calgon Corp."

Teare adds that "within Europe, it is expected that as Calgon
expands it services to the paper industry, a similar combined
minerals and specialty chemicals structure will also be an
effective means of serving the paper industry."

For more information on the merger, contact Harriet Bowen (Tel:
404/303-4396) at ECCI AmPac or Perry Colosimo (Tel: 412/494-8485)

Close-Out Sales
Affect Revenues

Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Advanced Polymer
Systems Inc. John J. Meakam Jr. (3696 Haven Ave., Redwood City, CA
94063; Tel: 415/366-2626, Fax: 415/365-6490) cites large close-out
sales of an older version of its Take-Off product as a reason for
its 1995 third-quarter revenues ($3,057,000) being slightly lower
than its 1994 third-quarter revenues ($3,398,000). During the third
quarter of 1994, APS replaced its Take-Off make-up remover with an
updated version that incorporated its Microsponge systems.  Close-
out sales of the older version moved rapidly and created a slight
jump in 1994 third-quarter sales.

Meakam attributes the decrease in revenues to low sales of
unlicensed suncare products, which do not include Advanced
Polymer's delivery-system technology.  Licensing revenues for the
third quarter were down, primarily due to variations in the timing
of payments from Ortho Pharmaceuticals.  However, licensing
revenues were up for the first nine months of 1995 ($12,939,000)
compared to the same period in 1994 ($12,870,000).

Even though APS has experienced overall revenue decreases in the
1995 third quarter, Meakam adds that "it is important to note that
revenues from products that incorporate our delivery-systems
technology were up 36% for the quarter.  This growth was due to
increased sales of established products and the introduction of new
products.  Most notably, third-quarter 1995 sales of the Exact line
of acne products were up 94% compared with the same period in 1994,
due partly to the introduction of our four new Exact line
extensions."

Operating expenses for the quarter were down 7% overall to last
year.  Reduced spending for now-completed clinical studies of two
ethical pharmaceutical products decreased R&D expenses by $725,000.
At the same time, selling, marketing, advertising, and promotion
expenses for the quarter increased by $469,000 due to the
introduction of the Exact line extensions.

To gain operating cash without diluting its stock, APS completed
two financing arrangements, during the third quarter of 1995. The
firm switched from current to long-term debt and raised extra cash.
Certain assets and the operating cash flows of a subsidiary secure
these loans.

With its strong delivery system platforms and expanding technology
applications, Meacham feels that APS is in a position to focus on
opportunities that offer the greatest potential for increasing
shareholder value (its stocks decreased to $0.12 in the third
quarter 1995 from $0.17 in the same period of 1994).

The firm's objective is to use its technology base to form new
strategic alliances and licensing agreements that offer the
potential to increase its commercial opportunities significantly,
both in the near term and the long term.  Recent discussions with
prospective partners has increased APS' appreciation for the
breadth of its technologies and the potential that lies ahead.

Partial Resolution of
Enflurane with TOT

The preparative resolution (asymmetric synthesis) of current
inhalation anesthetics (i.e. enflurane, halothane, and isoflurane)
via inclusion complexes presents a challenge to researchers.  The
challenge lies in the how to produce inclusion complexes of the
anesthetics that consist of small, apolar molecules These molecules
lack the functional groups normally used for inclusion complexation
or for attachment of a chiral auxiliary. Producing chiral-inclusion
compounds with inhalation anesthetics could offer pharmaceutical
companies a means of obtaining large amounts of enantiomerically
pure (highly enriched) products.

Toward this end, a multinational research effort between Israeli
and German chemists, with funding coming from an Israeli-U.S.
foundation grant and from German industries, has been working on
cage-type clathrate-inclusion complexes.  The chemists believe that
enclathration may serve as a means of obtaining sufficient
quantities of pure enantiomers, especially of the two kinds needed
to conduct chiroptical and biological studies.  The availability of
such enantiomers could allow researchers to determine whether they
undergo a different metabolism, another problem that plagues
anesthesiology.

Israeli chemists involved in the effort include Jallal M. Gnaim
(The Institutes for Applied Research, Ben-Gurion University of the
Negev, P.O. Box 653, Beer-Sheva 84105, Israel) and Bernard S. Green
(Dept. of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The School of Pharmacy, The
Hebrew University of Jerusalem, P.O. Box 12065, Jerusalem 91120,
Israel).  The two Germans, Volker Schurig and Heiko Grosenik, are
chemists at the Institut fr Organishe Chemie, Universitt
Tbingen, Auf der Morgenselle 18, D 7400, Tbingen 1, Germany).

The team's efforts have resulted in cage-type clathrate-inclusion
complexes of tri-o-thymotide (TOT) that yield partial preparative
resolution of enflurane.  The partial preparative resolution occurs
after a single crystallization step of TOT from solutions of
enflurane in 2,24-trimethylpentane.  Gas chromatography (a column
coated with polymeric chiral-phase Chirasil-Dex) reveals that the
single crystals contain 38% ee of enflurane.  Further
crystallization of TOT-enflurane clathrate crystals enhances the ee
level.  The chemists have found that, in some cases, the first
enantiomer eluted predominates, while, in other cases, the
enantiomer eluted last predominates.

To prepare the clathrates, the chemists obtained a solvent-free TOT
by synthesizing and crystallizing a TOT-ethanol complex, which was
warmed to 130oC at 0.2 mm/g for 24 hours and recrystallized.  They
dissolved 0.2 g of the TOT in 1.0 ml of boiling enflurane and added
9.0 ml of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (TMP).  Addition of the TMP
facilitated cage-type clathrate nucleation and lowered the
solution's density, in order to prevent the growing crystal from
floating on top of the solution.  The team then filtered and slow
cooled the complex, prior to filtering and washing the resultant
crystals with 1 ml of cold methanol.  This latter step yielded 0.08
g of large, colorless cubic crystals with a TOT:enflurane ratio of
2:1, with no TMP present.

In Tetrahedron: Asymmetry [6(7), 1499-1502, 1995], the research
team describes the TOT molecules as homochiral in each crystal;
therefore, enclathration produces an enantiomerically enriched
enflurane.  Measurement of the TOT optical rotation occurs prior to
full racemization and once again if the concentration is sufficient
to warrant it.

Activator Prepared
from Snake Venom

A method from Pentapharm AG (Buros: Engelgasse 109, Ch-4002, Basel,
Switzerland; Tel: 061-312-9680, Fax: 061-311-2049) prepares a
phospholipid-dependent prothrombin activator from the venom of
snakes belonging to the Elapidae family.  The venom is adsorbed on
a water-insoluble barium, magnesium, calcium or aluminum salt.  The
activator is eluted from the venom with an aqueous solution of
alkali-, ammonium-, or organic amine salts to form insoluble salts,
complexes or chelates with alkaline earth or aluminum ions.  The
eluted salts are removed, and the activator is recovered.

Developed by Douglas A. Triplett and Kurt Stocker and protected by
U.S. Patent 5,453,370, the activator increases plasma clotting
activity in the presence of phospholipids and calcium ions. In the
presence of Lupus Anticoagulant, the activator exhibits reduced
activity.  The activator facilitates clotting in a normal clotting
time in the presence of platelet-poor plasma. The plasma has normal
or decreased levels of factor V, VII, VIII, IX, or X and a major
band with a molecular weight of 40,000 to 60,000 daltons on an SDS
gel.

Suction-Type Filter
Neutralizes PVC Gases

Kenro Motoda of Motoda Electronics Co. Ltd. (17-11, Kamitakaido 1-
chome, Suginami-ku, Tokyo 168, Japan; Tel: 03-3303-8491, Fax: 03-

gases generated in the treatment of hydrogen and polyvinyl chloride
wastes.  The method utilizes a suction-type solution filter
container to neutralize and dissolve the chlorine gas. The filter
contains activated carbon or other materials with excellent
adsorbability to post treat residues of the wastes.

U.S. Patent 5,449,398 describes how the hydrogen and polyvinyl
chloride wastes are put in the sealed container and heated at 400oC
or less, without oxygen or with air-blocked condition. Heating
extracts the chlorine and hydrogen chloride gases from the wastes.
The extracted gases are then put into the suction-type solution
filter container.  The container also contains liquid filtration
agents through which the gases pass.  The chlorine is removed and
reduced in volume from the wastes in the sealed container.

VARA's Says Its
Record's Proven

For over 20 years, VARA International (1201 195th Place, Vero
Beach, FL 32960; Tel: 407/567-1320, Fax: 407/567-4108), a division
of Calgon Carbon Corp., has created, tested, and installed the most
technically advanced and successful pollution-abatement systems.
Based on proven carbon adsorption and distillation technology,
these systems meet the unique requirements of clients in many
different countries.

The VARA solvent-recovery system enables users to recycle and reuse
up to 99+% of their solvents.  The system consists of an activated
carbon-adsorption unit with a minimum of two adsorber vessels and,
if required, a liquid air-stripping or distillation unit.  Solvent-
laden air passes through the adsorber vessel where its solvent
vapors are adsorbed by specially selected activated carbons.  The
amount and depth of activated carbon in the adsorber vessel is
determined by the users' system requirements.

The sequencing of adsorption and regeneration cycles is alternated
to ensure that each carbon adsorber is on-line for an equivalent
period.  The result is a continuous and automatic processing of
solvent-laden air.

During the regeneration cycle of the VARA solvent recovery system,
low-pressure steam strips the solvent vapors from the carbon.
After the steam/solvent mixture is condensed and cooled, it passes
through a decanter where the solvents and water separate by
relative solubilities and specific gravities into a water phase and
a solvent phase.  Generally, water-insoluble solvents can be reused
directly.

If required, water-soluble solvents and complex solvent blends are
further separated, dehydrated and/or purified through liquid
distillation.  VARA offers complete extractive and azeotropic
multi-component distillation systems for the separation and
purification of solvent mixtures.  Depending upon customer and
process requirements, these systems can be designed for either
continuous or batch operations.

VARA's custom-designed units can handle solvent-laden air stream
flows from 500 to 1,000,000 cfm.  Packaged vertical or horizontal
solvent recovery units handle 1,000 to 20,000 cfm.

Selective Coated
Powders for PSA

Over the past 20 years, adsorptive gas separation, especially in
pressure-swing adsorption (PSA), has been the focus of considerable
research.  Many researchers believe that coated adsorbents would
expand the applicability of PSA to the separation of a wider range
of gas mixtures.  Based on the premise that coated absorbents
enhance selectivity, R. van der Vaart and his cohorts at the
University of Twente (Faculty of Chemical Technology, P.O. Box 217,
7500 AE Enschede, The Netherlands) have taken a first step in the
development of coated adsorbents for PSA.

The scientists coated a dense cellulose acetate membrane on the
outer surface of a porous tablet of compressed activated-carbon
powder.  A powdered Norit Americas (RB1) activated carbon was
pressed to a diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 1.2 mm, using
bentonite as a binder.  The tablet was pyrolyzed at 1073 K in a
nitrogen atmosphere, and it was then dipped on side with a 14%
cellulose acetate solution (from Eastman Kodak) in a DMF from
Merck.  The tablet's pores were blocked with a filler that
evaporated during the coating process.  The coated tablet was then
dried in a pure nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature.

Since permeability was found to be independent of pressure, the
investigators concluded that a defect-free membrane was prepared
and could be used in a limited test of their model.   They observed
uptake times that corresponded to cycle times of kinetic PSA
applications. Preliminary calculations indicated that the coated
adsorbents show promising viability in these applications. The
scientists are conducting an extensive experimental program to
substantiate their preliminary results.  The focus of that program
is highly permeable silicone rubber coatings rather than the low-
permeable cellulose acetate coatings.

Nonwovens Add
Mechanical Strength

Semipermeable membranes have no mechanical strength and need to be
supported during the filtration process.  Support can be provided
via perforated tubes or channelled plates (i.e. porous, non-
compressable support materials).  These types of support materials
come in the form of PVC or stainless steel tubes or plastic plates.
The high pressures (e.g. 1-140 bar) often necessitated by the
process mean that the distance between the holes or channels must
be relatively large to retain the mechanical strength of such
support materials. A porous, non-compressable supporting layer is
used between the semipermeable membrane and the supporting element
to provide a drainage layer.

Produced by Freudenberg Nonwovens L.P. (20 Industrial Ave.,
Chelmsford, MA 01824; Tel: 508/454-0461, Fax: 508/256-6214),
Viledon nonwovens add mechanical strength and provide custom-made
support and drainage layers for semipermeable membranes.  Viledon
Nonwovens meet the demands of industry by offering the following
advantages:

  high homogeneity and thus uniform porosity;
  smooth surfaces;
  no projecting fibers; and
  good processability during the demanding membrane-coating
process;

Used for reverse osmosis, microfiltration, and ultrafiltration,
Viledon nonwovens are usually coated directly with the membrane
solution.  When used in the various module systems, the nonwoven
provides direct support for the delicate membranes.  An equally
important factor is uniform distribution and drainage of the
permeate, for which the porous structure of the nonwoven is
advantageous.

Viledon nonwovens are successfully employed plate, spiral-wound,
and tubular configurations.  In the plate module, the permeate
passes through the membrane and is drained off in a drainage layer
or in drainage channels.  In the spiral-wound module, a nonwoven
sheet is laminated on one side with the membrane and sealed at the
edges to a second sheet, thereby forming a virtually continuous
"bag."

Especially for tubular modules, Viledon nonwovens meet high demands
with respect to rigidity and mechanical strength.  The nonwovens
are initially welded to form a tube and them laminated on the
inside with the membrane.  This tube is inserted into a perforated
metal or plastic pressure tube, which provides the support.

Marketing questions on Viledon nonwovens should be directed to
Shari Fowler-Hutchinson at Freudenberg's Chelmsford location.
Technical requests should be directed to Volker Haendler (Tel: 011-

Oxygen Selection on
Carbon Substrate

A method developed by Timothy Golden et al for Air Products and
Chemicals Inc. (7201 Hamilton Blvd., Allentown, PA 18195; Tel:
610/481-4911) makes an oxygen (O2)-selective adsorbent with a
porous substrate, such as carbon molecular sieve, activated carbon,
carbon black, coal, or petroleum coke.  The substrate is
impregnated with an acidic solution and then dried.  The oxygen
selective adsorbent, which is protected by U.S. Patent 5,447,557,
can be used in a pressure-swing adsorption process for the
separation of oxygen from nitrogen, for example, in air.

Another R&D effort at Air Products has resulted in U.S. Patent
5,451,385 for a process that controls exhaust emissions from
methane-fueled internal combustion engines.  Developed by James G.
Hansel et al, the process utilizes a crystalline zeolite to remove
nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide from the exhaust emissions.
The zeolite catalyst causes the carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides,
and oxygen in the exhaust gas to react with methane.

The catalyst has a silicon-to-aluminum ratio of equal to or greater
than about 2.5.  It is prepared by ion exchange of a non-acid
sodium or ammonium form of crystalline zeolite with one or more
cations selected from cobalt, nickel, iron, chromium, and
manganese.  The zeolite is exchanged with from 0.1 to about 15 wt
% of the cation, based on the total weight of the exchanged
zeolite.  The metal-exchanged zeolite is impregnated with from 0.1
to 23 wt % alumina, based upon the total weight of the impregnated
metal-exchanged zeolite.

Material Combines
Ceramic and Fibers

With a goal of becoming the largest "full line" supplier of high-
temperature insulation products, the Carborundum Co. (Fibers Div.,
P.O. Box 808, Niagara Falls, NY 14302; Tel: 716/278-2203, Fax:
716/278-2440) is readying a panel version of its Excelfrax product
line.  Other Excelfrax product forms, including Excelblok rigid-
board insulation, are in the development stage.

The developmental products, as well as the firm's commmercialized
flexible blanket form called the Excelflex Composite Systems, are
based on Excelfrax's core high-temperature insulation material.
This material blends ceramic (alumina and silica) powders and
fibers to produce a microporous structure.  The structure decreases
radiant heat flow, thereby making Excelfrax materials extremely
efficient insulation materials.  The core material can be
manufactured into a variety of product forms, including composite
systems, molded shapes, and rigid boards.

The firm's Excelflex Composite Systems are composed of a high-
temperature (1800oF) core material that has been placed between two
layers of a high-temperature textile.  The standard textile is a
1200oF S-Glass.  However, various high-temperature textiles can be
used in the composite to provide protection from 500oF to 2,300oF.
The layers are compressed into a uniform thickness (ranging from
1/8-inch to 1/2-inch) and density (both standard and lightweight).
The layers are then quilted into a finished composite.  The
Excelflex's standard configuration is 36" x 36" pads that are lock-
stitched into one-inch squares.

Market manager of Carborundum's Fibers Division, Jim Olchawski
(Tel: 716/278-2008, Fax: 716/278-2440), calls Excelflex's extremely
good thermal conductivity its main advantage.  Because of this
excellent thermal performance, Excelflex will provide the maximum
amount of insulation within the smallest amount of weight and
space.  Stable at high temperatures, Excelflex has low thermal
diffusivity and excellent material strength characteristics. Also,
Excelflex's flexiblity and ease of fabrication are important
considerations for many applications.

Excelflex provides the best insulation (lowest thermal
conductivity) of all the insulating products currently provided by
Carborundum.  Olchawski recommends it as the material of choice
whenever high-temperature insulating materials are required and
space/weight savings are the primary consideration.  Excelflex
Composite Systems can reduce heat loss and reduce surface
temperatures in a variety of materials, including
aerospace/defense, industrial, and commercial markets.

Aerospace/defense applications for Excelflex include thermal
insulation/fire protection in aircraft engine struts, nacelles,
cowlings, and avionics.  Industrial applications can be found in
nuclear power plants, petrochemical facilities, and other
industrial areas (i.e. incinerators, heat-treatment furnaces,
insulation for kilns and furnaces, and other metal/glass processing
industries).  Commercial applications include commercial ovens,
night storage heaters, and many other appliance applications.

Olchawski explains that Excelfrax is a "natural," the direct result
of two principal factors: The company's technical capabilities,
developed over many years while working with Fiberfrax refractory
ceramic fibers in the same markets and the partnerships created
between the company's full-service applications engineering team
and Carborundum customers in developing critical design solutions
for any application.

Molecular Diffusion
in a Single Crystal

Both industry and the scientific community are paying attention to
zeolites as novel adsorbents and catalysts.  Significant attention
has been paid to the measurement of diffusivity in zeolites, but
there has been little attention paid to applications based on
differences in the rates of transport of molecules in zeolite
micropores.  However, microscopic methods that measure molecular
diffusion are beginning to surface.

One of these methods has been investigated by Orhan Tula, D.B.
Shah, and Shaozhuang Sun of Cleveland State University (Dept. of
Chemical Engineering, Cleveland, OH 44115).  Their method involves
modifying a single-crystal zeolite membrane.  The modification
consists of incorporating a high-sensitivity Mass Selective
Detector (MSD) into the membrane.  The MSD determines the
concentration of the diffusing species on the receiving side.  It
measures the small increase in concentration that occurs as a small
amount of substance diffuses through the crystal.

Tula et al report that the modification yields a more accurate
measurement.  Modifying the membrane with the MSD also enables the
research to use a setup that measures directional diffusivity, as
well as concurrent and countercurrent diffusion.  To test the
efficacy of its modification, the investigators measured the
intracrystalline diffusivities of normal alkanes through silicates.

The scientists results show a corresponding increase of the
diffusivities of the hydrocarbons as the carbon number rises, due
to critical diameters being almost the same.  However, the length
of the molecules affect diffusion.  Ethane with a length double
that of methane exhibits a significant decrease in diffusivity over
methane.  Therefore, the team asserts that with carbon numbers less
than six, the critical diameter is the major influence on the
diffusion process.  With numbers larger than six, the hydrocarbons
exhibit a more relative diffusion decrease.

Some difficulties need to be overcome before the full potential of
MSD modification can be realized. Problems with MSD calibration at
low concentration need to be solved.  The zeolite membranes need to
be made from larger crystals.  Researchers need a good embedding
method, one that can withstand high temperatures, in order to
measure diffusivities at elevated levels.

Solid/Solid Reaction
Prepares Redox V

E.M. El Malki and a host of researchers from the University of
Pierre and Marie Curie (Laboratoire de Reactivite de Surface,
Paris, France) have prepared redox molecular sieves by solid-solid
reactions, using a thermally pretreated vanadium (V)/beta-molecular
sieve mixture.  Measurement techniques indicate that thermal
pretreatment at intense temperatures (900oF) reduces only 6% of the
vanadium in the mixture.

Calcination causes the solid-solid reaction to disperse the
vanadium ions inside the zeolite channels.  Tests indicate that, in
dehydrated samples, superhyperfine interactions occur between the
unpaired electron of vanadyl cations and the aluminum nuclei. In
hydrated samples, though, evidence exists of intraporosity in
vanadium tetrahedral species, which are difficult to rehydrate. The
researchers surmise this evidence from the persistence of a band
260 nm at long hydration periods (about 8 days).

X-ray diffraction reveals the beta-molecular sieve to be unaltered
by the intraporosity vanadium species, even after pretreatment.  It
is cautioned that weakening of the zeolite framework could occur
since BET tests indicate a porosity decrease in the presence of the
vanadium species.  The researchers present their conclusions in the
Proceedings of the American Chemical Society, Division of Petroleum
Chemistry [40(1), 114-18, 1995].

Adsorption Isotherms
Determined, Modeled

Much research has gone into aluminophosphate molecular sieves,
particularly in the area of their water-adsorption characteristics.
Citing a lack of literature on the single and/or multicomponent
adsorption of permanent gases (i.e. nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and
methane) at room temperature by these adsorbates, a trio of
University of Ottawa (Dept. of Chemical Engineering, 161 Louis-
Pasteur, P.O. Box 450, Stn. 4, Ottawa, Ontario K1N 6N5, Canada)
researchers headed by F.H. Tezel have conducted an investigation.

Their investigation has resulted in a determination of adsorption
isotherms for a number of the permanent gases.  The determination
comes from studying adsorption on three molecular sieves (AlPO4-11,
AlPO4-17, and AlPO4-18) at temperatures between 23oC and 40oC and
pressures up to 120 kPa.

A decrease in the slope of the AlPO4-11's isotherms as the
temperature rises indicates the lower adsorptive capacity of this
molecular sieve at high temperatures.  This adsorbate exhibits its
greatest capacity with methane and its lowest with nitrogen. Tezel
et al attribute this to the "equal access" offered by this medium-
pore molecular sieve to all gaseous adsorbates smaller than those
of its pore aperture (3.9 x 5.1 in pore dimensions).  Methane,
being the largest molecule (4.2 ), is easily trapped within the
3.9 x 5.1  of the AlPO4-11.  Nitrogen, being the smallest molecule
(3.0 x 4.1 ), easily leaves the adsorbed phase and is less easily
retained than the other gases.  The molecular sieve features
intermediate capacity values for carbon monoxide (3.7 x 4.2 ).

Tezel recognizes that AlPO4-11 adsorbs methane more readily than it
does nitrogen and carbon monoxide at 40oC.  He attributes this to
its larger molecular size and its energetic homogeneity and adds
that the nitrogen isotherm lies about the carbon monoxide isotherm.
He explains this latter condition as a result of neighboring
quadrupolar nitrogen molecules that repel each other to a lesser
extent than do neighboring polar carbon monoxide molecules.  The
smaller nitrogen molecules enter the molecular sieve pore openings
more easily than the larger carbon monoxide molecules.

For AlPO4-18, Tezel gives the following adsorptive capacity
decrease order at 40oC and 120 kPa: Carbon monoxide, methane, and
nitrogen.  He explains that the researchers noticed a slight S-
shape behavior for the carbon monoxide isotherm within the very low
pressure range.  The other isotherms of the other two gases exhibit
linear tendencies for the entire pressure range.

Based on their data, Tezel and his colleagues have been able to
model the adsorption isotherms, using Langmuir, Flory Huggins-
Vacancy Solution Theory, and Freundlich equations.  Tezel reports
that the team has  been able to predict binary adsorption
equilibria for the permanent gases and that stearic effects
regulate the adsorption mechanism in all three adsorbents.

Solid-Phase Extraction
Isolates and Purifies

Solid-phase extraction (SPE) is a powerful tool for chemical
isolation and purification.  From trace-level sample preparation to
industrial-scale chemical isolation, SPE plays an increasingly
important role in a broad range of applications, including
pharmaceutical, clinical, fine chemical, biomedical, food analyses,
organic synthesis, environmental, and many others.  SPE utilizes
the same analyte/sorbent interactions that are exploited in the
powerful separation technique of high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC).

Varian Sample Preparation Products (24201 Frampton Ave., Harbor
City, CA 90710; Tel: 310/539-6490 or 800/421-2825, Fax: 310/539-
4270), formerly known as Analytichem International, pioneered
solid-phase extraction technology with the introduction of the Bond
Elut SPE extraction cartridge.  Normally, the cartridge is packed
in straight-walled syringe-barrel tubes of ultraclean medical-grade
polypropylene and polyethylene or stainless steel frits.  Packed
within each tube is a surface-modified bonded-silica sorbent.

The sorbent selectively retains specific classes of chemical
compounds within a given matrix.  As an example, the Bond Elut
strong cation exchanger (SCX) can be used to retain the cationic
drug, amphetamine, from urine.  The more specific the interaction
between the sorbent and the analyte, the cleaner the final extract.

Bonded silica sorbents are in many ways the ideal materials for
chromatographic isolation.  This attribute comes primarily from the
number of different functional groups that can be readily bonded to
the silica surface.  Bonded silicas are rigid supports that do not
shrink or swell and form a clean, non-leachable substrate upon
which the bonded functional groups are attached. They also are
stable in a wide range of aqueous and organic solvent conditions
and possess very large surface areas due to their porosity.

Solid-phase extraction works via three general extraction
mechanisms:  Non-polar, polar, and ion exchange.  Each sorbent
within a given extraction mechanism exhibits unique properties of
retention and selectivity that may be quite specific for a given
analyte.  So even in an extraction calls for a non-polar extraction
mechanism, it may be necessary to test several sorbents within a
given category to find the optimal balance between high recovery
and good clean-up.

Both C18 and C8 give acceptably high recoveries for non-polar
analytes from an aqueous matrix.  The slightly increased polarity
of C8 may allow many matrix contaminants to pass through the
cartridge unretained.  Otherwise, it would be retained on the more
non-polar C18 sorbent.  The end result would be a cleaner final
extract with the C8 sorbent.

Bond Elut cartridges come in a variety of sizes, ranging from 50 mg
to 10 g of sorbent.  Smaller cartridges are useful when a sample
size is very small or when the ability to elute the analyte in a
very small volume is needed for maximum concentration.  For sample
or rinse volumes greater than the volume of the standard Bond Elut
cartridge, Varian recommends its Bond Elut LRC configuration as an
alternative.

The flared shape of this cartridge allows users to pour up to 10 ml
in it, without having to use additional adapters or reservoirs.
The wide opening of the Bond Elut LRC also makes alignment and
sample introduction easy for automated sample-processing robots.
The cartridge's tubes have a sturdy, double-ridged lip that
provides a consistent seal for reliable performance when used with
these robotic work stations.

The Bondesil sorbents and sorbent-bed geometry of Bond Elut LRC
cartridges are the same as the standard straight-barreled Bond Elut
cartridges. This means that any method used on a standard cartridge
may be immediately transferred to a Bond Elut LRC with little or no
modification.

Maximum retention capacity for polar and non-polar sorbents is
approximately 5% of the sorbent mass (i.e. 5 mg for a 100 mg
sorbent bed).  However, this value must take into account
additional compounds present in the sample matrix that are also
retained by the sorbent.  Thus, for the compound users wish to
extract, the effective capacity may be much less.  Varian
recommends testing the cartridge capacity for each specific
application.

Larger sorbent amounts provide greater capacity (the amount of
compound that can be retained on the column).  Larger sorbent
masses also require more solvent to elute the compound from the
column.  Consequently, the analyte may be more dilute than if a
smaller sorbent bed was used.

Minimum elution volume for a cartridge is defined as two bed
volumes of elution solution.  Bed volume is 120 l per 100 mg of
sorbent.  In some cases, less than two bed volumes can be used.
Such extractions are often very sensitive to flow rates and other
variables and are not recommended because irreproducible results
may be generated.

Information on Varian's extensive sorbent cartridge line is
available from Nigel Simpson, their Product Manager.

Reduction of Food
Radiostrontium

Radiostrontium contaminates foods and, once digested, accumulates
in the skeleton, where it is difficult to withdraw.  Scientists are
seeking ways of preventing the consumption of radiostrontium in
foodstuffs via the use of various adsorbents (mainly zeolites and
mixed oxides of titanium, silica, or manganese). This isn't a large
problem in the U.S., but is in much of the former USSR.

Results obtained by A.M Puziy (Institute for Sorption and Problems
of Endoecology, Palladin prospect 32/34, 252142 Kiev, Ukraine), G.
Bengtsson [MATFORSK (Norwegian Food Research Institute), Osloveien
1, N-1430 s, Norway], and H.S. Hansen (Dept. of Animal Science,
Agricultural University of Norway, 1432 s, Norway), indicate that
the use of adsorptive materials may be regarded as promising for
reducing foodstuff radioactivity.  The results come after testing
of strontium binding by various sorbents in a number of different
water solutions.

The researchers have found that strontium adsorption from all
studied solutions depends upon pH, with a rise in pH resulting in
steady adsorption increases for the titanium-silicate and the
titanium-manganese sorbents, in particular.  Adsorption on zeolites
remains almost constant.  The existence of either weakly or
strongly acidic groups explain these phenomena. All of the
adsorbents exhibit high selectivities for tracer strontium in 0.1
M of sodium chloride above a pH level of 6. However, in an
artificial flood fluid (AFF), the zeolites (P and A4) exhibit
higher selectivities than the mixed oxides above a pH level of 3.

The research team have ascertained that the strontium binding in
AFF fits well to a model of non-ideal competitive adsorption of 1:1
stoichiometry.  The kinetics of AFF follow a biphasic manner with
a rapid initial phase for all adsorbents. The second slow phase
reveals a decrease for the zeolites and an increase for the mixed
oxides.

For reducing radiostrontium in liquid foodstuffs,  granular forms
(titanium-silicate bound to activated carbon or titanium-manganese)
for continuous flow through deep beds are recommended.  For batch
applications, they suggest powder forms of titanium-silicate or
zeolites.  They caution that the toxicity of these promising
strontium adsorbents warrants more detailed investigation,
especially in the area of the relatively high release of aluminum
and silicon in AFF.

Better Flow Rates
in Extraction Disks

The Empore Extraction Disks, a hybrid membrane technology from
Varian Preparation Products (24201 Frampton Ave., Harbor City, CA
90710; Tel: 310/539-6490, Fax: 310/539-4270), are designed to
provide high sample flow rates.  Better flow rates are valuable for
environmental liquid/solid extraction procedures that require
extraction of large sample volumes.  Formulated for maximum flow
through the membrane, the disks effectively adsorb organic analytes
form aqueous samples and avoid many of the drawbacks associated
with liquid/liquid extraction, such as emulsion formation, labor
intensiveness, delicate expensive glassware, and excessive solvent
usage.

Based on a combination of 3M's Teflon processing technology and
Varian SPP's sorbents, the Empore Disk cartridge consists of a
membrane that contains either embedded polymeric or silica-based
sorbent particles.  The particles are tightly bound in and
individually suspended in a web of inter-micro PTFE fibrils. This
leaves the surface of each particle free for maximum interaction
with the sample during separation.  The result is a very high
efficiency SPE device with superior purity and outstanding flow
characteristics.

Since the sorbent is held in place by the inert PTFE matrix, the
Empore disk is compatible with virtually all organic and inorganic
solvents.  The physical and chemical properties of the Empore
disks, with their silica-based Bondesil sorbents and a new expanded
range of HPLC-grade polymeric sorbents, present practically
unlimited possibilities for the separation scientists.

Empore disks are available in a number of bonded phases.  Disks are
available in three diameters: 25, 47, and 90 mm.  By increasing the
diameter of the disk used, the disk surface area available for
sample passage increases dramatically, resulting in better solvent
flow rates through the disk.

For more information on Empore Extraction disks, contact Nigel
Simpson, product manager, or customer service (Tel: 800/421-2825).

Thin-Film Zeolite
Readied for Market

Zeolite membranes can  separate nitrogen from natural gas deposits
and remove hydrogen from hydrocarbons, such as benzene or methane.
They have proven effective in removing noxious chemicals (i.e.
carbon tetrachloride) from pollution sources. Research, especially
on the academic level, is underway that could yield commercial
benefits.

Researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder (Boulder, CO
80309-0009; Tel: 303/492-6100, Fax: 303/492-5894) have developed a
thin-film zeolite membrane.  The new membrane can withstand high
temperatures and harsh (chemical) environments.

The technology for the membrane involves growing ultrathin layers
of zeolite crystals on the interior walls of small ceramic and
stainless steel tubes. Formation of the membranes occurs with
placement of a zeolite-forming gel inside the small tubes.  After
each end is capped, the gel is heated to a temperature until
crystals form around microscopic octagonal pores.

The resultant zeolite crystals contain very small uniform-sized
pores about the size of a small molecule. This uniformity and small
pore size allows smaller gas and vapor molecules to pass through
the zeolite membrane and rejects larger molecules.  The researchers
are extending their technology through a project for designing
zeolite membranes for use in environmental sensing devices that
will detect minute quantities of pollutants.

RO Separation with
Clay Investigated

Building upon the knowledge that pure clay membranes reject ionic
solutes and desiring to broaden the scope of membrane separation
technology beyond salt rejection, scientists from Japan and Canada
have investigated the solute separation characteristics of
montmorillonite membranes in reverse osmosis.  Investigators
include T. Matsuura (Dept. of Chemical Engineering), C. Detellier
(Dept. of Chemistry) of the Industrial Membrane Research Institute
(University of Ottawa, 161 Louis-Pasteur, P.O. Box 450, Ottawa, K1N
6N5, Ontario, Canada), and M. Ishiguro of the National Research
Institute of Agricultural Engineering (2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba,
Ibaraki 305, Japan).

In the Journal of Membrane Science (107, 87-92, 1995), the
scientists draw the following conclusions from their experimental
data:

  A montmorillonite layer works well as a reverse-osmosis membrane
in rejecting electrolyte solutions;
  The montmorillonite membranes exhibit similar characteristics to
charged membranes;
  The montmorillonite membranes exhibit lower separation of non-
ionized organic solutes than polymeric membranes; and
  The separation of amino acids with the montmorillonite membrane
depends upon the net charge of the amino acid.

The scientists base these conclusions on experiments with Smectites
that come in two-dimensional arrays of silicon-oxygen tetrahedra
and aluminum or magnesium oxygen-hydroxyl octahedral. The clay (in
the form of a paste) is coated on (until all of the paste is
transferred into the cell) and sandwiched between two millipore
filters of 0.1 m pore diameter.  The filters are placed on a
porous stainless steel surface.  The scientists advise placing a
filter paper between the millipore filter and the porous stainless
steel.  Doing so minimizes potential damage when applying high
pressures of various non-ionized organic solutes.

Photoluminescence
in Thin Films

Photoluminescence has been detected in thin films of partially
oxidized silicon (Si) nanoclusters by scientists at the Lawrence
Livermore National Lab (Livermore, CA 94550; Tel: 510/422-1100).
The scientists, reports Lloyd L. Chase, synthesized Si nanoclusters
with average diameters of only a few nanometers (nm) using thermal
vaporization of Si in an argon (Ar) gas background.  The first
monolayer of Si nanoclusters was deposited directly onto the basal
plane of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, and the layer was
exposed to oxygen (O2) for five minutes.  Although, additional
monolayers were added until the film thickness reached about 250
nm, no photoluminescence was observed.

Post annealing the film in O2 produced a white photoluminescence,
which peaked at about 600 nm.  The photoluminescence increased in
intensity as a function of annealing time and temperature up to
850(C without any accompanying shift in wavelength.  The decay time
was less than five nanoseconds.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed extensive oxidation of
the film, and the photoluminescence excitation spectrum of the film
showed a strong resemblance to the optical absorption curve of bulk
Si, except for an increase in absorption at wavelengths longer than
375 nm.  The scientists attribute the photoluminescence to the
recombination of carriers in localized defect centers in the
silicon oxide layer.

Optronics Improves
Reflectance, Durability

Optronic Labs, Inc. (4470 35th St., Orlando, FL 32811; Tel:
407/422-3171 or 800/899-3171, Fax: 407/648-5412) has commercialized
its line of Optolon diffuse reflectance coatings.  William A.
Schneider, VP and director of sales and operations, says, "Unlike
other sprayable coatings, Optolon materials are extremely rugged
and washable."  The products are claimed to have a higher
reflectance and better mechanical properties than competitive
products.

Optolon products are available for a wide variety of custom and OEM
applications requiring highly reflective, diffuse, durable
coatings.  Uses include integrating spheres, diffuse reflectance
standards, diffuse reflectance targets, uniform radiance sources,
lamp cavities and reflectors, diffusers and high efficiency
coatings for lamp fixtures and baffles.

Two versions of Optolon coatings are manufactured.  Optolon 1
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based coating is useable at 250-
2,500 nanometers (nm), and Optolon 2 is a barium sulfate-based
coating useable over the more limited 300-1,100 nm range.

AT&T Develops
Stable Facet Films

Silicon oxide (SiOx) films suitable for use as nonhermetic laser
facet coatings have been produced by researchers at AT&T Corp. (600
Mountain Ave., Murray Hill, NJ 07974; Tel: 201/582-3000).  Naresh
Chand relates, in U.S. Patent 5,440,575, that the new films have
low levels of cracks, voids and particulate contamination and that
they are stable in ambient atmospheres.

The surfaces of nearly all semiconductor lasers must be protected
and/or modified.  Although dielectric films suitable for some
devices are widely used, e.g., silicon dioxide (SiO2) on silicon
(Si), there is a need for a dielectric that is mechanically and
chemically stable and free of pinholes, cracks, particulates and
voids.  It should also have good adhesion, be highly resistant to
moisture penetration and be adaptable for use as a semiconductor
laser facet coating regardless of emission wavelength.

A number of materials, including yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ),
have been proposed, but end up with shortcomings, including poor
reproducibility with respect to refractive index and/or mechanical
stress and contamination with particulates.  In addition,
conventional facet coatings are not normally stable in the ambient
atmosphere, causing changes in laser properties and premature laser
failure.

Because of the problems associated with conventional facet
coatings, nearly all such devices are packaged in hermetic, gas-
filled enclosures.  These hermetic lasers are widely used in
optical fiber communications, optical interconnects, sensors, and
printing.  Hermetic enclosures add to the complexity of
manufacturing processes, reduces yield, and increases the cost of
the devices.  The AT&T researchers sought a highly reliable laser
facet coating stable in the ambient atmosphere.

The AT&T scientists discovered that under the right processing
conditions, high quality silicon oxide (SiOx) films suitable for
use as laser facet coatings could be produced.  The key to their
work was the use of a deposition by molecular beam technique
instead of conventional thermal evaporation processes.  The surface
layer of the film is nearly always SiO2, but this layer normally
represents only about 10% of the entire film in most cases.  If
particular reflectivities are needed, the SiOx film can be combined
with layers of other dielectric or semiconductor materials
deposited using the same technique.

Energy Pumped
into MRI Diagnosis

Researchers are using high power diode lasers from Opto Power Corp.
(OPC, 3321 E. Global Loop, Tucson, AZ 85706; Tel: 520/746-1234,
Fax: 520/294-3300, email: opc_info@ix.netcom.com) in a new, gas-
based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure that may detect
emphysema, asthma, pulmonary embolisms, and other lung diseases
that have been difficult or impossible to diagnose with
conventional proton MRI.  Employing this experimental "laser-
polarized" gas MRI method, physicists at Princeton University and
scientists with Duke University's Center for In Vivo Microscopy
acquired the first high resolution images of a human lung, reports
OPC's Merrill Apter.

Since they are filled with air and not water, a human lung is
difficult to image effectively using proton MRI because they lack
the necessary hydrogen atoms to produce a resolute picture.  While
x-rays of the lungs can show some accumulation of fluid and scar
tissue, their exposures are too short to reveal porous lung tissue.


Other diagnostic procedures for imaging the lungs, such as
ventilation scans with radioactive isotopes, expose the patient to
significant levels of radiation and often fail to produce
sufficiently high-resolution images.  The noble gases used in the
laser-polarized gas MRI technique--usually helium (He) or xenon
(Xe)--are inert and nonradioactive and therefore are harmless
inhalants, posing no health risk to the patient.

Tuned to 795 nanometers (nm), the diode laser stimulates an atomic
transition in the alkali metal rubidium (Rb) which is driven into
a vapor in a small oven heated to about 180C.  The Rb vapor
becomes polarized in the process and subsequently transfers some of
the polarization to the nuclei of 3He or 129Xe during gas phase
collisions in a 50-100 cubic centimeter (cc) sealed cell.  After
sufficient polarization is generated in the noble gas it can then
be cooled to room temperature (condensing the rubidium vapor) and
inhaled into the lungs for imaging.

Physicist Hunter Middleton of Princeton University (223 Jadwin
Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544; Tel: 609/258-2843, Fax: 609/258-1124,
email: midleton@princeton.edu) describes how the research team
relies on intense light from OPC's high power, diode lasers to
produce the required volumes of polarized gas.  "The highly
polarized state of the noble gas allows images taken with the new
MRI technique to be generated in seconds, compared to the minutes
often required for conventional MRIs," says Middleton.  When the
project began they were using five sets of large titanium:sapphire
laser systems pumped by argon ion lasers to achieve the required
levels of polarization, but it was found that they were too
expensive and inefficient.

Turning to diode lasers, they were able to dramatically lower their
operating costs. The compact 20-watt open heatsink diode laser
initially employed in the new MRI technique was priced at about
$4,000 and used less than 80 watts of electrical input power.  By
comparison, the argon ion and titanium:sapphire lasers together
were priced in the neighborhood of $500,000 and used about 250 kW
of electricity to produce the same output power. "The
titanium:sapphire setup was so big it required a separate room,"
explains Middleton.  "The diode laser array, on the other hand, is
so small and efficient that it allows us to move the laser
polarized gas MRI station easily from the laboratory to a hospital
environment equipped with only a standard 110 volt wall outlet."

The 20-watt array was more than adequate for imaging the lungs of
a guinea pig, but couldn't produce enough polarized gas necessary
for human tests.  For the first test of a human lung, a 120-watt
array produced nearly 1 liter of polarized gas in 4 hours.  "Though
the spectral distribution, or emission bandwidth, of the diode
laser array (about 2.5 nm) is much broader than that of
titanium:sapphire lasers and exceeds the absorption line of the
rubidium as well, it's nevertheless extremely efficient in this
application," says Middleton.  "We believe that imaging the
function of the lungs and other organs and tissues filled with air
spaces using laser polarized gas has vast potential and may evolve
into a nice complement to conventional proton MRI."

DOE's Nonproliferation
Program Uses Device

Tunable infrared (IR) lasers under construction at Deacon Research,
Inc. (2440 Embarcadero Way, Palo Alto, CA 94303-3313; Tel: 415/493-
6100) will be used in Dept. of Energy (DOE) nuclear
nonproliferation program.  Douglas Bramford believes that such
devices are essential because of their ability to remotely detect
effluents resulting from the processing of nuclear material.
Conventional devices are tabletop laboratory models not easily
adaptable to deployment on an airplane or in an inspector's
briefcase.

The Deacon Research project will involve the building of a compact,
tunable IR laser source based on the diode laser pumping of a new
nonlinear optical material, periodically poled lithium niobate
(PPLN).  The pump laser and nonlinear crystal can be integrated
into a small package with no mechanical tuning elements.

A device with the required spectral properties--a narrow bandwidth
and a wide range--can then be manufactured.  Applications outside
the nuclear field may include environmental monitoring,
manufacturing process control, medical diagnostics and analytical
chemistry.

Fuji Photo Film Co.
Improves Accuracy

A highly accurate laser diode pumped solid laser has been built by
engineers at Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. (2-26-30 Nishi-Azabu,
Minato-Ku, Tokyo 106, Japan; Tel: 3/34062111, Fax: 3/34062395).
Hisashi Ohtusuka reports that the temperature in the region inside
the case housing the optical module is kept constant, preventing
the output power and the wavelength of the produced beam from
fluctuating.

Laser diode pumped solid lasers include a solid laser medium to
which a rare earth metal, e.g., neodymium (Nd) is added.  The
medium is pumped by a semiconductor laser, or laser diode.  In
order for a laser beam from such a device to have as short a
wavelength as possible, a crystal of a nonlinear optical material
is located in the resonator of the laser.  The nonlinear optical
material alters the wavelength of the laser beam.

The temperature of the optical module of such a device is
ordinarily kept at a constant level in order to keep the output
power of the laser diode and the wavelength of the laser beam from
fluctuating.  This temperature is normally maintained by placing
the optical module on the surface of an electronic temperature
adjusting device.

The temperature in the vicinity of the laser diode or nonlinear
optical crystal is detected and adjusted as needed.  The problem is
that when both the optical module and the cooling device are housed
in the same case, the temperature adjustments are often not
accurate enough to keep the laser diode output and the laser beam
wavelength from fluctuating.

The optical module of the Fuji Photo Film laser includes a laser
diode, a solid laser crystal which is excited by the beam produced
by the laser diode, and a resonator.  All three components are
placed in an inner case.  An outer case contains the temperature
adjustment device, temperature sensors, control circuitry and the
inner case.  The new construction makes it easier to maintain an
accurate temperature in the optical module, which in turn increases
the accuracy of the laser diode output and the laser beam
wavelength.  U.S. Patent 5,446,750 details the Fuji Photo Film
work.

LiNbO3 Improves
Disk Drives, Printers

A waveguide layer has been formed on the surface of a lithium
niobate (LiNbO3) electrooptical material by scientists at Hitachi
Koki Co., Ltd (1060 Takeda, Katsuta City 312, Ibaraki, Japan; Tel:
292/738111, Fax: 292/741730).  Keiji Kataoka reports that the layer
is incorporated in a light control device that includes a light
diffraction device mounted on the surface of the electrooptical
material and electrodes on the front and back surfaces.  The new
device, described in U.S. Patent 5,444,567, is intended for use in
laser printers and optical disk drives.

Some conventional light control devices take advantage of an
electrooptical effect in which the refractive index of a
transparent medium is altered by applying an electric field.  In
one type of these devices, light is directed through an
electrooptical material.  In the other type, light is directed
through a waveguide layer formed on an electrooptical material.

In devices of the first type, an electrooptical material is formed
in the shape of a triangular prism, and electrodes completely cover
the opposite major surfaces.  When a voltage is applied to the
electrodes, an electric field is generated.  Ingoing light is
applied to the prism, and outgoing light is deflected by the
electric field.

In devices of the second type, a waveguide layer on the upper
surface of the electrooptical material.  Electrodes are formed on
an exposed surface of the waveguide layer, and when a voltage is
applied between the electrodes an electric field is generated along
the exposed surface.  Light passing between the electrodes is
deflected.

To produce a large deflection of the outgoing light in the first
type light control devices, the electric field must be increased,
and the beam diameter of the incoming light must also be increased.
Also, in order to obtain a large electric field with a small
applied voltage, the thickness of the electrooptical material must
be reduced.  As a result, in order to produce a large deflection of
the outgoing light, a transversely extended oval shaped light must
be made to enter a relatively thin electrooptical material.  The
problem is that it is difficult to attain this configuration.

To cause a large deflection of the outgoing light in the second
type of light control devices, the electric field intensity must be
increased and the width of the light must also be increased.  In
order to increase the electric field intensity, the interval
between the electrodes is decreased.  The problem here is that when
the width of the light is increased, the electrode interval should
also be increased.  As a result, it is very difficult to produce a
large deflection of light.

The goal of the Hitachi scientists was to build a light control
device in which a large deflection angle or a large change in the
light focusing position can be achieved with only a small applied
voltage.  The waveguide laser was formed by titanium (Ti) diffusion
on the surface of the LiNbO3.  Incoming light is led by a grating
into the waveguide layer and becomes directed light.  Since the new
light deflection device is effective in controlling the light path,
it can be applied to a wide range of devices.

In a laser printer the size of dots recorded on the recording
material must be rapidly changed so that half tone recording can be
accurately performed.  New light control devices can increase the
number of gradations from black to white, improving half tone
pictures.

Achieving Stability
Over Longer Times

Optical waveguides with improved stability over extended periods of
time have been constructed by scientists at NEC Corp. (5-7-1 Shiba,
Minato Ku, Tokyo 100, Japan; Tel: 3/34541111).  Naoki Kitamura and
Hiroshi Nishimoto disclosed that one of the new NEC devices
includes two optical waveguides formed in lithium niobate (LiNbO3)
substrate.  A blocking layer is formed on the device to block the
diffusion of lithium (Li) ions from the substrate, and a silicon
dioxide (SiO2) buffer layer is formed on the blocking layer.  The
electrodes, from which operating voltages are supplied, cover each
coupling part of the two waveguides via the blocking and buffer
layers.

Conventional waveguide optical switches fabricated on a LiNbO3
crystal substrate have low light absorption, low loss, and good
efficiency due to their high electrooptical effect.  In such
devices, a buffer layer is formed on an LiNbO3 substrate, which
includes two titanium (Ti)-diffused waveguides.  Metallic
electrodes are formed on a coupling portion of each waveguide via
the buffer layer.

The buffer layer prevents light propagating along the waveguides
from being absorbed by the electrodes.  SiO2 is used for the buffer
layer because its refraction index of 1.45 is smaller than the 2.2
refractive index of the LiNbO3 substrate and because SiO2 exhibits
low light absorption.  When the buffer layer's refractive index is
small, it is more feasible to reduce its thickness to prevent the
absorption of light than it would be for a material with a large
refractive index.

When switching voltages are applied to the electrodes, an external
electric field concentrates on the buffer layer because the
dielectric constant of the buffer layer is smaller than that of the
substrate.  The electric field in the substrate is relatively
small.  The magnitude of the switching voltages needed for
switching and modulation becomes higher for larger thicknesses of
the buffer layer.

The small refractive index and extremely low absorption of light of
SiO2 makes it the best known material for the buffer layer.  The
problem is that when a DC voltage is applied between electrodes, Li
ions, diffused from the substrate into the buffer layer during
fabrication, are pulled by the electric field and collected under
the electrodes.  As a result, an electric field counter to the
external electric field is generated between the electrodes.

The magnitude of the counter electric field increases as the total
number of ions increases because SiO2 has a high ion conductivity
despite its relatively high electric insulating property.  If the
externally applied voltages are kept constant, the resultant
electric field applied to the waveguides is reduced by the
generation of the counter electric field, causing a deterioration
of the device characteristics.  This shift in operating voltage
point for switching or modulating operation, or DC drift, becomes
a problem when putting the device into practical use.

The key to the NEC device, disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,479,552, is
the blocking layer formed to block the diffusion of lithium (Li)
ions from the substrate.  Suitable materials for the blocking layer
include silicon (Si), silicon (tri-) tetranitride (S3N4), and
magnesium fluoride (MgF2).

Interactive Holography
Will Be Evaluated

American Propylaea Corp. (555 S. Woodward, Birmingham, MI 48009;
Tel: 810/642-7000) has been awarded a $100,000 research contract by
the U.S. Air Force to evaluate the integration of interactive
holography in manufacturing.  James Fischbach, president and CEO,
reports that the contract represents Phase 1 of a projected 15-
phase $200 million project if Phase 1 is successful.  Phase 2 would
involve $750,000, and Phase 3 would be worth $5 million.

American Propylaea, which developed the world's first full color
commercial hologram in 1993, scored a major breakthrough in 1994
when it achieved a 42 inch x 45 inch, full motion, true color
holographic display system, the largest yet developed.  Fischbach
predicts that holography will be a $5 billion per year business
within 10 years and identifies the automotive, entertainment,
medical, and retail markets as those with the greatest potential.

Fischbach says that interactive holography could make it possible
for automakers to cut design and development time by 50%, enabling
them to bring new car models to market in under 20 months, compared
with the present 42 months in the U.S. and 36 months in Japan.
Holography could also reduce the need for exploratory surgery and
assist in the training of surgeons, enabling them to view 3-D
information in free space in front of a monitor screen to help them
detect and locate abnormalities and rehearse operations.

Jose, CA 95134; Tel:408/434-1800).  Under the terms of the license
agreement, Uniphase obtained a limited, nonexclusive sublicense for
fundamental solid state laser technology.  In exchange, Coherent
acquired the assets of Uniphase's diode laser operation in
Torrance, CA.

"This license gives us access to a critical technology, which will
allow Uniphase to move forward more aggressively with its solid
state laser programs," says Kevin Kalkhoven, president and CEO of
Uniphase.  "Uniphase can now better focus its resources on its core
businesses, our newly acquired telecommunications operation,
Uniphase Telecommunications Products; our semiconductor equipment
subsidiary, Ultrapointe; as well as our green and blue micro solid
state laser program."

"This is an important strategic acquisition for Coherent," says
Bernard Couillaud, VP and general manager of the Coherent Laser
Group.  "The addition of semiconductor laser technology to our
diode pumped solid state business, which has been strengthened by
the acquisitions of Adlas GmbH and the nontelecommunications part
of Amoco Technology, will allow Coherent to expand its leadership
position, especially in the medical and OEM markets.  Development
of an internal capability will enable us to move very quickly into
some proprietary laser diode applications."

Coherent's product lines will be directed toward supplying the OEM
and medical markets with a broad range of laser diode devices, and
the company says that it intends to continue buying laser diodes
from outside suppliers.

Laser diodes are made from aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) and
indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) using semiconductor manufacturing
technology.  They operate at 600-1,000 nanometers (nm) with up to
15 watts of power.  Because of their small size and high
efficiency, laser diodes are ideal for certain types of OEM and
medical applications and are incorporated into other laser devices
as well.

Growth Predicted
to End of Decade

The U.S. market for laser materials and components, currently
believed to be $551.3 million, is forecast to grow at an annual
rate of 9.8% and reach $879.4 million in 2000, says a new BCC
business opportunity report.  As diode lasers experience rapid
growth in a variety of applications, components for these lasers
are expected to show the greatest gains in sales.  Laser materials
and equipment such as chillers and power supplies should also
experience substantial growth through the end of this decade.

The world market for laser materials and components is estimated by
BCC to currently stand at $1,059.3 million.  The world market is
projected to grow at an average annual growth rate of 9.1% to
$1,637 in 2000.  The U.S. dominates the world laser materials and
components market, accounting for some 40% of total sale, followed
by Europe and the Pacific region.  Countries in the Pacific region
are expected to experience the highest average annual growth rates
in sales, 10.3%.  In the next few years, the Pacific region is
expected to replace Europe as the second largest market.

Growth in sales of laser materials and components is highly
dependent on the sales of the laser systems with which they are
used.  Laser markets that are expanding rapidly include material
processing, medical therapy and telecommunications.  The research
area, traditionally a major consumer of laser components, is in a
period of flux.

While some research areas are being slashed due to military
cutbacks, research into lasers is expected to continue at a steady
pace.  Lasers have become key components of advanced weapons
systems, and military spending in this area should not decline as
rapidly as in other areas.  Nevertheless, sales of laser materials
and components for research applications are expected to grow at a
rate significantly slower than those for other applications.  As a
result, component manufacturers will have to more aggressively
target industrial customers in the future.

The report analyzes five major market segments: laser materials,
optical components, equipment, instruments, and diode laser
components.  Laser materials include laser crystals, gases and dyes
used in solid state lasers, as well as optical substrates and
coatings which form the basis of optical components.  Sales in each
of these areas should experience average annual growth rates of
about 8% as demand for solid state lasers and their associated
optical components continues to expand.  Particular strength should
occur in sales of tunable laser materials which have made
considerable inroads into the scientific market.

Optical components include lenses, mirrors, prisms and beam
splitters, windows, filters, fiber optics, and modulators and
deflectors.  As key elements of laser systems, lenses, mirrors, and
fibers are the largest markets in this segment.  Sales of these
components should match sales of the lasers in which they are used
and should see healthy growth in the years ahead.  Fiber optic
waveguides, while only a small part of this market segment, should
experience an average annual growth rate of nearly 13% due to a
rapid rise in medical application sales.

Equipment covers power supplies and cooling systems, which should
both see strong gains.  Sales of power supplies will be paced by
demand from carbon dioxide lasers used in material processing.
This application should also generate significant demand for
cooling systems.  Instruments include beam analyzers, detectors,
vibration isolation systems, and positioning equipment.  These
instruments are generally used in research applications, and this
market is not expected to grow rapidly. The average annual growth
rate for this market segment is expected to be 5.8%.  The lone
bright spot in this area is beam analyzers, which are expected to
see much greater use in the fast growing diode market.

Diode laser components include diode laser drivers and diode laser
optics.  Sales in both of these areas should continue to be robust
since the use of diode lasers is expanding rapidly in may
applications.  The new study, Growing Markets For Laser Materials
And Components, is available from BCC for $2750.

Diffuser/Condenser
Improves Process

In an effort to overcome undesirable variations in brightness and
light uniformity, Kulicke & Soffa Industries, Inc. (K&S2101 Blair
Mill Rd., Willow Grove, PA 19090-1795; Tel: 215/784-6000, Fax:
215/659-7588), a producer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment,
has incorporated a holographic diffuser/condenser lens assembly
from Physical Optics Corp. (POC, 20600 Gramercy Place, Building
100, Torrance, CA 90501; Tel: 310/320-3088, Fax: 310/320-8067) in
the machine vision system of its model 1488 turbo wire bonder.  The
wire bonder relies on ultrasonic technology to bond gold or
aluminum wire to a silicon chip, or die, preparing it for
installation into a printed circuit board.

The new lens assembly helps the wire bonder's machine vision system
locate reference points on the die during the semiconductor
manufacturing process.  Prior to adopting this new optical
component, K&S manually glass bead blasted and lacquered a diffuser
surface to one side of an off-the-shelf condenser lens, a time
consuming and unpredictable technique that, combined with the
inherent problems of the light emitting diode (LED) light sources,
often diminished the performance of the machine.

The new optics assembly in the computerized K&S wire bonder
integrates two complex optical elements, a POC holographic
trademarked Light-Shaping Diffuser (LSD) epoxy replicated to the
plano side of a standard glass condenser lens.  Epoxy replication
is a precision process used in the fabrication of high performance
optics, from optical flats to diffraction gratings.  LSDs are
surface relief holographic elements that shape light by precisely
controlling the energy distribution along the horizontal and
vertical axes, allowing engineers to match the light source with
the area requiring illumination.

The LSDs--which can be mass produced using a variety of surface
relief manufacturing processes, including injection molding--
homogenize and shape the LED light before feeding it through the
focusing condenser lens, allowing the wire bonder's pattern
recognition system to easily locate reference points on the die
pad.  The diffuser/lens component works with fewer surfaces, is
prealigned, and possesses the ability to perform tasks that are
either difficult, impossible or very expensive to do separately,
says POC.

The lens assembly takes advantage of the uniform light distribution
and high diffusion rate of LSDs to overcome some of the problems
common among LED light sources, including variations in brightness,
structure, light distribution and alignment.  By doing this, it
enables the wire bonder to attach the tiny wires--typically about
0.001 inch in diameter--with more precision and accuracy than was
possible with the manually applied diffuser surface.

POC manufactures holographic optical elements used in machine
vision, LCD backlights, inspection lighting, and auto displays.
The company works closely with product designers to pursue new
industrial, military, and commercial applications for its
technologies.  Rick Shie is the POC contact.

Possible Reduction
of Passive Losses

A new laser crystal, chromium:lithium strontium gallium fluoride
(Cr3+:LiSrGaF6) is under evaluation by scientists at Lightning
Optical Corp. (431 E. Spruce St., Tarpon Springs, FL 34689-4015;
Tel: 813/938-0092).  Potentially superior to chromium:lithium
strontium aluminum fluoride (Cr3+:LiSrAlF6), the new crystal is
being considered for use in tunable laser systems which can operate
in the 250-400 nanometer (nm) range, reports Arlete Cassanho.

Cr3+:LiSrAlF6 is presently the only crystal that can challenge
titanium:sapphire as a broadly tunable, near infrared (NIR) laser
source.  The Cr3+:LiSrAlF6 materials and their isomorphs have an
advantage for use in rugged, compact, solid state lasers because
they can be efficiently pumped by diode lasers.  So far, though, it
is not clear that the Cr3+:LiSrAlF6 is the best choice.  Negligible
passive loss, coupled with its potentially superior
thermomechanical and thermooptical properties make Cr3+:LiSrGaF6
worthy of consideration.

Initially, Lightning Optical will work with previously grown
samples of Cr3+:LiSrGaF6 to characterize its benefits.  The crystal
can be grown with practically zero passive loss, and in a large
boule size when the company's proprietary synthesis process is
used.  The same synthesis will be used for Cr3+:LiSrAlF6 to reduce
its passive losses to the same level as that measured in the
Cr3+:LiSrGaF6 crystals.

The project also calls for the development of other critical
components, antireflection coatings, capable of withstanding the
rigorous temperature cycling required for the tunability and
frequency conversion, while maintaining a high damage threshold.

NIST Finds That
Disorder Is Useful

Scientists using x-ray diffraction crystallography know that few
crystals have ideal diffraction patterns. Most materials exhibit
diffuse scattering caused by a number of factors grouped under the
name "disorder."  These disorders result in a variety of physical
properties useful in optoelectronics, semiconductors, and high
temperature superconductors.

A new paper from the Thermophysics Div. of the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) Chemical Science and Technology
Laboratory, in collaboration with the Australian National
University, presents a broad overview of the many areas where
diffuse x-ray scattering has been important in understanding the
structure and function of crystalline materials.

Topics covered include alloy systems, simple inorganic systems such
as mixed oxides or halides, low-dimensional conductors, inclusion
compounds, molecular crystals, macromolecular crystals, and quasi-
crystals.  To obtain a free copy of Report 5-95, Diffuse X-Ray
Scattering From Disordered Crystals, contact Sarabeth Moynihan

Low Temperature
Growth Method

A chemist at Washington University in St. Louis (St. Louis, MO
63130) has discovered a new method to grow semiconductor crystals
at temperatures far lower than ever reported.  The method is the
first to use solution phase chemistry to grow the micrometer-sized
crystals at low temperature.  The semiconductors made by the new
method may be used in devices such as light emitting diode (LED)
displays, laser pointers, grocery scanners, compact disc players
and computer components.  The breakthrough offers intriguing
possibilities of developing integrated devices consisting of
semiconductors and polymers, plastics or composites.

Present ways of growing semiconductor crystals prohibit combining
other materials with the semiconductors because of the very high
temperatures required to grow the crystals.  Crystals are currently
produced at temperatures of 500-1,200(C, but the method William E.
Buhro (Tel: 314/935-4269, email: buhro@wuchem.wustl.edu), associate
professor of chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis, has
discovered allows growth at 200(C.  Buhro's technique, the
solution-liquid-solid (SLS) growth method, is similar to the vapor-
liquid-solid (VLS) gas phase growth method which has been used for
some 30 years.

Buhro and other materials chemists had been stymied by the
nonmolecular structures of the semiconductor materials, which do
not allow crystal growth from conventional solvents at low
temperatures.  Buhro made a solution suspension of indium and
indium-gallium nano-sized metal droplets.  The droplets are the
sites from which the semiconductor crystal compounds indium
phosphide, gallium arsenide and indium arsenide (type III-V
semiconductors) nucleate and grow.

Buhro explains, "We refer to this as the solution-liquid-solid
mechanism, a three phase system where the chemistry occurs in
solution, then elements of the semiconductors are deposited into
the liquid--the molten metal droplets--and the product crystallizes
out as a solid."  An important goal in materials chemistry is to
turn down the heat on solid state synthesis.  This new method
expands the range of possibility for these semiconductors.

Building a New Flat
Panel Video Screen

A researcher at the Dept. of Energy (DOE) Brookhaven National Lab
(Box 5000, Upton, NY 11973-5000) has invented a flat panel video
screen that uses lasers as a light source.  Uses of the device may
include video advertising displays, television, computers,
automotive dashboard and aircraft cockpit displays, as well as
portable military maps and wall-sized displays for home
entertainment.  Since the Brookhaven device has advantages in
brightness, contrast, and viewing angle over the new generation of
liquid crystal cockpit displays, the U.S. Air Force is funding
development of the flat panel device for use in its new planes.

In another project involving the new technology funded by the Dept.
of Defense (DOD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA),
Brookhaven also is working on a 5 ft. plastic television screen for
military use.

The Clinton Administration has identified developing flat panel
displays as vital to the economic future of the U.S.  Brookhaven
engineer James Veligdan (Tel: 516/282-5400) invented the device and
developed the display screen prototype, which is 9 in. wide by 5
in. high and approximately 1 in. thick.  The new flat panel screen
has several advantages over current technologies.

Many video display systems now on the market use cathode ray tubes
(CRTs).  Although reliable, they are very large, heavy, and not
easily transportable.  Other than CRTs, the major current video
display technology is limited to liquid crystal displays (LCDs),
which are comparatively difficult and expensive to manufacture.

The Brookhaven technology works by directing light from a miniature
laser to a scanner, which guides the light beam into the proper
sector of laminated wave guides.  Composed of multiple sheets of
laminated borosilicate glass or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)
plastic, the waveguides direct the light to the screen to display
the video image.

"The system is totally eye safe, high-contrast, and offers
exceptionally wide viewing angles.  Also, the screen can be used in
cold weather, whereas liquid crystals thicken and freeze as
temperatures dip below freezing.  The technology can be adapted to
display 3D images if the viewer wears polarized glasses.
Maintenance is easy and inexpensive," says Veligdan.

The ORUs focus the laser light into free space and are available
with working distances of 20-68 millimeters (mm).  Equipped with
antireflective coated lenses that transmit up to 97% of the laser
light to the target, OPC's ORUs also help protect the diode lasers'
fiber bundles from harsh environments.  All ORUs are housed in
rugged cylindrical aluminum enclosures 37 mm in diameter and have
thread patterns standard in the industry.

Advances in
Quantum Wire

Advances in the production of quantum wires is reported by a
research group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
(Urbana, IL 61081).  The team, headed by Keh-Yung Cheng (Tel:
217/333-6642, Fax: 217/244-6375, email: kcheng@uxl.cso.uiuc.edu),
have used molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and strain induced lateral
layering ordering (SILO) techniques to build quantum wires,
nanoscale atomic structures believed to dramatically increase the
efficiency and reliability of light emitting devices such as laser
diodes.

Many of the advances in computing, data storage and
telecommunications have come as a result of the evolution of
semiconductor materials.  While silicon has been utilized to
stretch the bounds of computer processing power and speed, other
semiconductors have been applied to create photonic devices.  Such
devices can emit or detect light; for example, semiconductor laser
diodes can be used to read data from compact disks.

Over the past 30 years, the techniques for creating these
semiconductors have been refined.  Using a MBE method, scientists
can grow semiconductors in layers as thin as one atom.  By
selecting the types of semiconductor material, properties such as
the color of its light emissions can be engineered.

An ultrathin layer, or quantum well, has done much to improve the
reliability and efficiency of light emitting devices.  This quantum
well is the center of a semiconductor sandwich that is only a few
dozen atoms thick.  When structures approach this nanoscale,
electrons begin to change their characteristics and exhibit quantum
size effects.  Such changes can affect and improve the overall
performance of optical devices, such as achieving more light
generation for a laser diode.

The next step in quantum devices are structures that utilize
quantum wires.  Similar to quantum wells, quantum wires have atomic
scale thickness in two dimensions instead of one.  With this
additional degree of quantum confinement, it is theorized that even
higher levels of efficiency and reliability can be observed in
practical optical devices.

The color of a standard laser diode's output light can vary with
time and temperature.  Quantum wire lasers, though, are thought to
maintain uniform characteristics over a broader range of
environmental variables.  Until now, very little success has been
achieved in preparing such quantum wire structures.

In the Illinois work, the SILO process used MBE to grow
alternating, ultrathin layers, less than two atoms thick, inside
semiconductor structures.  The number of atoms in each layer is
slightly different, either lesser or greater, than would normally
be required.  The resulting atomic imbalance creates a strain force
inside the growing crystal.  The strain force, in turn, causes
certain atoms to group together along lines on the growing surface.
When the SILO process is combined with quantum well fabrication
techniques in MBE quantum wire regions are formed almost
automatically.

Cheng's group has demonstrated laser devices emitting in the
visible and infrared (IR) spectra range using quantum wires.  The
devices, showed various new and unexpected optical characteristics,
are the subject of further research at the university.  Eventual
end uses may include improved supermarket checkout scanners and
home fiber optic communications.

Miniature NIR
Spectrometer

Ocean Optics, Inc. (OOI, 1237 Lady Marion Lane, Dunedin, FL 34698-
5314; Tel: 813/733-2447, Fax: 813/733-3962, email:
75461.2007@compuserve.com) has introduced its PbS-256 miniature
fiber optic near infrared (NIR) spectrometer system designed to
record spectral data from 1-3 microns at 256 wavelengths
simultaneously.  Engineered to meet the needs of the broad-based
NIR spectroscopy marketplace, including applications in
telecommunications, biomedicine, chemistry, microelectronics and
environmental monitoring, the new PbS-256 complements OOI's
existing family of small ultraviolet (UV) and visible (VIS) fiber
optic spectrometers.

The PbS-256 features a 256-element lead sulfide linear charge
coupled device (CCD) focal plane array with an on-board
multiplexer.  User adjustable integration times of 1.0 microsecond
to about 100 milliseconds provide essential dynamic range and
sensitivity for measurements at low and high light levels.  The
dynamic range of the new NIR spectrometer is further enhanced,
reports OOI's Rob Morris, by detector-based dark current
subtractors that utilize global and individual pixel adjustments
via digital to analog converters (DACs).  This minimizes unwanted
current that flows in a detector's pixels when no photons are
hitting the detector.

The PbS-256, like Ocean Optics' other miniature spectrometers,
employs special optics designed for use with single strand optical
fibers.  The light from the fiber is dispersed by a fixed grating
across the detector.  Spectra are captured in milliseconds and
brought into a Microsoft Windows-based data acquisition and
processing software program that allows the user to set and control
a host of functions, including sensor integration time, auto dark
current correction, signal averaging and optical measurement
technique.  The system's operating software provides users with the
ability to view full spectra in real time as voltage or as percent
transmission or absorbance, and to store them as ASCII files.

At $15,000 per unit, the PbS-256 is believed to offer NIR spectral
coverage for a fraction of the cost of scanning devices such as
fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectrometers.  The system has no
moving parts and is dramatically smaller, more durable and easier
to transport for field work than bulky mechanical scanning systems.
OOI also offers a line of optional fiber optic light sources,

Chemical Monitor
under Construction

Engineers at Inrad, Inc. (181 Legrand Ave., Northvale, NJ 07647-
2498; Tel: 201/767-1910 are building a mid infrared (IR) laser for
the remote sensing of chemicals.  Sergei Govorkov reports that many
environmentally sensitive chemicals, including chemical warfare
agents, have signature absorption lines in the mid IR spectral
region.  A differential absorption light (DIAL) detection and
ranging system, if it were continuously tunable in the fingerprint
IR wavelength region, would serve as the basis for an accurate,
real time chemical monitor for a wide range of gases.

The Inrad project will involve the construction of a solid state
optical parametric oscillator (OPO)-based transmitter for a DIAL
system.  The engineers will design and build a zinc germanium
phosphide-based OPO pumped by a Q-switched, flashlamp pumped,
erbium-doped yttrium scandium gadolinium garnet laser.  The
performance of the system will be evaluated with respect to
conversion efficiency, tuning range and emission linewidth.  Based
on the results, a conceptual design for an OPO-based DIAL system
will be developed.

The successful completion of the Inrad project could lead to the
remote sensing of stack gases, greenhouse gases, chemical warfare
agents and precursors for chemical used in the manufacture of
illegal drugs.  The technology may have some defense applications
in target designation and countermeasures.

Reflectance Control
Method Discovered

An optical recording media which permits manufacturers to more
accurately control light reflectance has been constructed by
researchers at Pioneer Electronic Corp. (1-4-1 Meguro, Meguro-Ku,
Tokyo 153, Japan; Tel: 3 3494111, Fax: 3 34954428).  Fumio Matsui
reports that the new medium includes a transparent substrate, a
metal phthalocyanine-based optical recording film, a metal
reflective film, and a protective layer.

Optical recording media normally have advantages over competitive
materials in memory capacity with respect to write-in or read-out
operations. Operations do not involve contact of components.  There
is a trend to standardize such media, e.g., optical disks, with
respect to optical and mechanical characteristics.

The reflectance or reflectance ratio, one of the optical
characteristics of a recording film, must be 10-90% before
recording and 27-90% after recording, and the uniformity of
reflectance must be less than 12%.  Conventional techniques for
controlling this reflectance call for either mixing different kinds
of materials or producing films with variable thicknesses.

There are several problems with existing techniques.  First, when
different materials are mixed, some internal reactions may occur.
In such cases, it is extremely difficult to control the resulting
reflectance.  Second, it is difficult to manufacture films with
uniform thicknesses.  This also makes control of reflectance
difficult.

The Pioneer Electronic scientists built an optical recording medium
that includes a transparent light transmission substrate of
polycarbonate (PC), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or amorphous
polyolefin (APO) resin.  The substrate, formed by a
photopolymerization technique, has a thickness of 1.0-1.5
millimeters (mm).  A recording film is formed on the substrate by
heating a metal phthalocyanine and circulating it in toluene for
12-24 hrs.  The aggregated portion, obtained by removing the
toluene, is then dissolved in tetrafluoropropanol.

The solvent fractions containing the aggregated and nonaggregated
fractions were applied to the substrate using a spin coating
technique at a thickness of about 130 mm.  A gold, aluminum, silver
or copper reflective film is then formed by vacuum evaporation,
sputtering, or ion plating techniques.  An epoxy, acrylic,
silicone, or urethane resin is then used to provide a protective
layer on the reflective film.  The improved control of the medium's
reflectance stems from the ability to mix the aggregated and
nonaggregated portions of the solvent in precise ratios.  U.S.
Patent 5,439,778 covers details of the Pioneer Electronic
invention.

Improved Near
Infrared Absorbers

Phthalocyanine-based near infrared (NIR) absorbers formulated by
scientists at Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc. (3-2-5 Kasumigaseki,
Chiyoda-Ku, Tokyo, Japan; Tel: 3/5937111, Fax: 3/5924267) are
intended for use in optical recording media, NIR absorption
filters, and liquid crystal display devices.  Hisato Itoh reports
that the advantages of the new absorbers include light, weather and
thermal resistance, as well as high molar extinction coefficients.

NIR absorbers play an important role in optoelectronic applications
such as information recording media, display media, sensors, and
goggles.  Conventional absorbers, based on cyanine, anthraquinone
or naphthoquinone dyes or dithiol complexes, suffer from several
disadvantages.  Cyanine dyes do not have sufficient light and
thermal resistance.  The absorption wavelength of phthalocyanine
dyes is 600-700 nanometers (nm), extremely short.  Anthraquinone
and naphthoquinone dyes have low molar extinction coefficients.
Dithiol complexes are not thermally stable, and they also have low
molar extinction coefficients.

The Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals formulation is based on phthalocyanine
derivatives in which each of the 4 benzene rings contained in the
molecule have 1-4 substituent groups.  The intermediates are
reacted with a metal halide, acetate, or sulfate by heating in a
solvent such as urea.  The absorber is coated onto a transparent
substrate using a spin coating process.  The Mitsui Toatsu
Chemicals discovery is covered in U.S. Patent 5,446,141.

New FOTP
Standards

The Telecommunications Industry Assn. (TIA, 2500 Wilson Blvd.,
Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22201; Tel: 703/907-7700, Fax: 703/907-
7727) has published the American National Standard Interconnection
Device Insertion Loss Test, or TIA/EIA-455-34A.  Originally
published as EIA-455-34, the revised standard defines the procedure
by which the optical insertion of a complete fiber optic
interconnection can be measured.  This fiber optic test procedure
(FOTP) was formulated under the guidance of TIA's engineering
subcommittee on fiber optic connection devices.

TIA has also published American National Standard Measurement of
Fiber Strain in Cables Under Tensile Load, or TIA/EIA-455-38.  This
FOTP is intended to provide an accurate method for measuring
changes in the average longitudinal strain on a cabled optical
fiber.  The document, which outlines a method for measuring changes
in strain from one loading condition to another, was formulated
under the guidance of TIA's subcommittee on fiber optic cables.

BOOKS

Every Aspect
of VCSELs

Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers, by Terence Edward Sale of
the U.K.-based University of Sheffield, covers the principles,
theory, design and operation of vertical cavity surface emitting
lasers (VCSELs).  Semiconductor lasers have advanced a long way
since their first demonstration in the early 1960s and have a large
impact on many devices today.

They act as sources for optical fiber systems and permit the
reading of data from compact discs and barcode labels.  VCSELs have
many advantages over conventional semiconductor lasers.  The most
obvious is the possibility of very large arrays and a narrow
circular output beam, which can be efficiently coupled into the
core of a fiber.  As a result, the author believes that the time
for a book devoted to VCSELs has come.

The first chapter of the volume describes the history and prospects
of VCSELs and the choice of material systems for emission in
different wavelengths.  The second chapter concerns the optical
properties of short vertical cavities, and the quantum mechanical
processes facilitating optical gain and spontaneous emission
processes are the focus of the third chapter.  Concepts are
developed from basic principles, and the effect of strain on the
optical processes in quantum wells is also covered.  Readers are
introduced to techniques for epitaxial crystal growth and the
fabrication of VCSEL devices in Chapter 4, and Chapter 5 explores
the resistance problems that can arise due to the many
heterojunctions in dielectric reflector stacks.

Chapters 6 and 7 are case studies which describe measurements made
on 2 VCSEL structures, one grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
and the other by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).
In Chapter 8, experimental data from these case studies are
analyzed using models, and the final chapter describes other
aspects of VCSELs such as modulation response, arrays and noise
performance.

The book does a good job of covering the VCSEL field and should be
of value to those experienced in the optics field, as well as to
novices and students.  Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers is
published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (605 Third Ave., New York, NY
10158; Tel: 212/850-6336). 1995.  Price: $89.95

FIBERITE TO BUY HERCULES
Industry Consolidation Continues as Weaver/Prepregger
Signs Letter for $135-Million Buy of Carbon Fiber Maker

Consolidation in the advanced composites
industry continues at breakneck pace as
Tempe, Arizona-based Fiberite -- itself
freshly spun off from Britain's ICI -- has
signed a letter of intent to acquire the Utah
carbon fiber and prepreg activities of
Hercules.
    The combined company would have sales
in excess of $300 million per year, says
Fiberite CEO Jim Ashton.
    "This announcement should come as no
surprise," Hercules chairman Thomas Gossage
said in a statement. "In light of declining
defense spending, our strategy has been to
couple Composite Products with another
composites business to create a major
supplier for growing commercial markets."

Carbon to be Separate

    The sale nonetheless marks the end of
an era of Hercules in aerospace, as the
company sold its composite structures
business to Alliant Techsystems last year.
The various Hercules Composite Products
operations have annual sales of about $100
million, some 80 percent of which is believed
to be in fiber.
    "We view the graphite fiber business
effectively as a separate business and will
run it that way," Ashton told PM. He notes
that a chronic overcapacity situation in
carbon fiber has largely evaporated, with
some grades of material now in short supply.
    Fiberite already holds license rights
to some Hercules prepreg, notably 3501-6, a
high-volume epoxy with applications on U.S.
Navy aircraft.
    Fiberite, which last year absorbed the
former U.S. Polymeric business of BP
Chemicals, will be the second largest U.S.
weaver-prepregger if the pending merger with
Ciba Composites boosts Hexcel to the $600-
million annual sales level. But Fiberite will
have a clear edge in vertical integration if
it is able to acquire Hercules and its AS-4,
IM-7, and other carbon fiber lines. Hercules
is basic in carbon fiber precursor too,
making white polyacrylonitrile material at a
plant in Decatur, Ala. that is to be part of
the Fiberite buy. Hexcel and Ciba have no in-
house fiber-making capability.
    [Ciba once held just shy of 25 percent
of the Akzo-Tenax PAN-based fiber operation
in Wuppertal, Germany, relinquishing its
share when Japan's Toho Rayon took a
controlling interest in the European venture
with Akzo Nobel as a minority partner.]
    Besides Decatur and the Hercules carbon
fiber operation in Magna, Utah, Fiberite will
acquire a Hercules prepreg unit in Spain.
Hercules Composite Products employs some 470
people counting the three plants and
headquarters staff in Wilmington, Del.

SMARTweave for RTM
The U.S. Army and Delaware Institute
Have an RTM Cure-Monitoring Method

The Center for Composite Materials (CCM) at
the University of Delaware is promoting a new
process for controlling resin flow in resin
transfer molding part fabrication. The
process was developed via a collaboration
with the U.S. Army Materials Directorate.
    Dubbed SMARTweave, (SMART is an acronym
for sensors mounted as roving threads), the
process is described as "a patented system
for sensing the existence and state of cure
of the resin in RTM manufacturing. The sensor
grid, which comprises two orthogonal sets of
conductive filaments separated by one or more
preform layers, is placed within the
composite mold.
    As resin fills the mold, the gaps
between the filament planes are filled with
conductive resin, which completes an
electrical circuit. Associated
instrumentation detects the signal and can
infer resin location and, in some resins,
cure state."
    The SMARTweave process was initially
developed in the late 1980s but work has been
revived due to "the recent rise in popularity
of RTM." Recent improvements have included an
increased number of sensors and better
instrumentation.
    The process is related to smart
structures technology, too, as CCM notes that
the sensors embedded in the parts can
continue to function during the service life
of the parts.

GOETZ MASTS
Change in Racing Rules Spurs Demand
For Composite Masts for Sailing Yachts

Last year's change in IMS standards governing
the use of carbon fiber on racing yachts has
spurred demand for the material, reports
Goetz Marine Technology of Bristol, R.I.
    "For years this rule has prohibited
carbon material in masts and spars," says
Goetz marketing manager Ben Sprague. Now the
company has a new opportunity to move the
lightweight masts, which it builds via
"proprietary fiber compaction techniques"
which maintain fiber alignment and minimize
voids.
    "The parts we build at Goetz Marine
have a void content of less than 1 percent,
equal in strength yet without the
complication of an autoclave," the firm says.
Goetz claims a perfect performance record for
over 100 carbon fiber masts it has placed in
service.

CULVER CITY
New Products Key Former SP Gameplan;
Parent AMP Seeks to Buy More, Go Public

A new epoxy for large jet engine parts and a
fire-safe phenolic for transportation system
interiors are key to the business plan of
Culver City Composites Corporation, a new
company formed following the acquisition of
Los Angeles' SP Systems.
    The former SP prepreg operations were
bought by The American Materials &
Technologies Corporation, which is headed by
Paul Pendorf, formerly of Fiberite and XXsys
Technologies.
    The SP sale, which had been pending
since at least last summer (PM, July 17), was
wrapped up in Boston on December 20.
    The purchase price was not disclosed.
    Pendorf is acting president and general
manager of Culver effective January 1
following the resignation of SP president
John Shoemaker. Pendorf plans to recruit a
new Culver chief as he returns his attention
to the acquisition entity AMT.
    Plans are to take AMT public by mid-
year while pursuing further advanced material
acquisition opportunities, Pendorf told PM.
    Culver City hopes to capitalize on its
position in high-temperature (primarily PMR-
15) composites for jet engines with a new
epoxy, CE-9013, said to combine advantages of
250F-cure self-adhesive and 350F-cure
structural materials, says Culver R&D chief
Jerry Hartman.

'Not Autoclave-Oriented'

    The material boasts 30-day tack
retention at ambient temperatures, says
Hartman, and SP has achieved void contents as
low as 3 percent on woven fibers using
straight vacuum bagging. Many jet engine and
nacelle manufacturers use subcontractors for
relatively large parts, he says, and "a lot
of them are not autoclave-oriented."
    Culver's new phenolic, designated CPH-
2400, draws on the company's experience in
materials for aircraft interiors, says
Pendorf, but the new company plans to tackle
bus, subway, intercity train "and even cruise
ship" markets.
    The product's distinction is its fire
performance, as it has been tested for 20/20
OSU peak/total heat release as compared to
the current Federal Aviation Administration
standard of 65/65.
    "There's a crying need for this type of
material" if advanced composites are to
seriously penetrate mass transit markets,
Pendorf says.
    Both the CE-9013 epoxy and CPH-2400
phenolic will be formally unveiled this year.
One venue will be the big spring SAMPE
meeting in late March, where Culver will
abandon SP's "hospitality suite only" policy
and mount a full display.

FROM PUFFS TO PUTTS
Cobra Golf and its Shaft Lines Bought
By American Brands After Tobacco Sale

American Brands has formed a new golf
powerhouse by acquiring the Cobra Golf line
of clubs as a complement to its Titleist ball
line. The overall $700-million acquisition
includes the West Coast Composites carbon
fiber autoclave shaft operation at Carlsbad,
Calif. that was bought by Cobra in 1991.
    "Together, the Cobra and Titleist
brands will strengthen American Brands'
position as the world leader in the estimated
$4 billion golf industry," said Standard &
Poor's, which noted that American Brands
bankrolled the purchase with proceeds from
divested tobacco and life insurance
businesses.

Competitor Callaway Supports the Deal

    "As a very small owner of Cobra stock,
Callaway Golf Company will vote in favor of
the proposed merger," said a statement by the
rival clubmaker. "We see strong positives
developing long term for Callaway Golf, and
for golf in general" behind the Cobra-
Titleist marriage, Callaway said
    Cobra-West Coast makes upwards of 8,000
shafts a day at Carlsbad, primarily with
carbon fiber prepreg with a limited amount of
glass in the shaft tips, says West Coast
Composites GM Rich Bayer. For 1996, "It's
going to be Newport getting the bulk of our
business," Bayer says, although West Coast
also buys from Fiberite and Toray Industries.
The company uses standard, medium and high-
modulus fiber grades from a variety of
suppliers.
    "We're one of the few companies that's
autoclave-curing graphite shafts," Bayer
says. The process yields stronger clubs
containing less material per unit, and allows
West Coast to avoid the cell-wrapping that
necessitates extra sanding and finishing
steps.

Independent in Shafts

    "We're very close to a net part out of
the autoclave," Bayer says.
    The West Coast GM also notes that Cobra
Golf is one of the few manufacturers to be
successful in full sets of golf clubs,
manufacturing and marketing both woods and
irons. Cobra also makes all its own shafts,
at West Coast: "We don't go to anybody else,"
Bayer told PM.
    Callaway, which is also based in
Carlsbad, took the opportunity of media
attention on the American Brands-Cobra deal
to talk up its own clubs, including the "Big
Bertha" line with shafts from Aldila.
    "Significant expansion in the world's
golf club markets occurs only when one
creates truly innovative golf clubs which
prove to be especially rewarding to the great
majority of golfers, Callaway said, citing
the example of Aldila graphite shafts in the
early 1980s.
    "As for the expected commercial
possibilities in enlarged metal wood club
heads made of titanium," Callaway said, the
"Great Big Bertha" driver with a Ruger
Titanium head "has already achieved 25
tournament wins this year, and is now being
used regularly by approximately 150
professional golfers on the five major
tours."

It's Not the Metal

    But, "We believe the success of Great
Big Bertha is more related to the S2H2 design
concept in conjunction with the War Bird
soleplate and the ultra-light Great Big
Bertha shaft, than with the use of any
particular metal.
    "Unless a truly superior shaft and a
unique club head with truly great design is
used, the metal itself is not the answer,"
Callaway said. "This has been true with
stainless steel and we think that this will
be equally true with titanium."

ALDILA ACTION, TOO
Premiere Shaftmaker Has New President
And a Highly Automated Finishing Line

Former Hillerich & Bradsby Powerbilt golf
president Ed Abrain took over as Aldila
president last week as Gary Barbera assumed
the position of chairman of the board.
    San Diego-based Aldila has also
instituted a 100-foot-long, 140-second,
automated shaft finishing inspection line at
its Poway facility . The line has 10
interchangeable modules and will help provide
"greater consistency and repeatability for
our customers," Barbera said in a statement.
    Also new at Poway are an automatic
shaft wash/dry system, an automatic mandrel
clean/release system, and two conveyorized
paint curing systems.
    The Poway enhancements were engineered
by an Aldila team headed by Lisa Burgett
(manager of manufacturing engineering) and
Kevin Egelhoff (product design manager).
Their two-year project included "three months
of production testing prior to full
implementation," the company says.
    "The consistency of the blank shafts we
have been producing is impressive," Burgett
said in a release.
    Aldila says it's invested some $7
million in automation over the past three
years.

THIOKOL -- THE PREPREGGER
Present Posture Can Be Traced to Amoco's
Exit;
Rocketmaker Offers Wovens on All Fiber Types

Thiokol's new presence as a prepregger is
based in large part on technology it
developed in the wake of Amoco's departure
from the prepreg business, when Thiokol was
forced to step up development of its own
matrix material for the Castor 120 solid
rocket motor.
    Thiokol replaced Amoco's ERL-1908 epoxy
with its own UF-3323 material for the Castor
120, which is filament wound with premium T-
1000G carbon fiber from Toray Industries. The
change was made some two and a half years
ago.

Tailored Properties, Room-Temperature Storage

    UF-3323 is now the basis for a family
of prepregs available both as towpreg for
filament winding or as woven broadgoods, says
Thiokol's Rolf Johns. Prepregs are made at
Brigham City, Utah.
    The company works with several
suppliers of dry woven fabric, and has
prepregged aramid, carbon (both PAN- and
pitch-based) and glass fiber from nearly all
of the fiber suppliers, including vendors of
large-tow carbon fiber material such as Akzo
Fortafil and Zoltek.
    As for resin, "We will tailor the
formulations to what people need processing-
wise," Johns says. The original UF-3323
required a 24-hour cure at 270F, he says by
way of example; now Thiokol offers UF-3325
with a four-hour cure. Another key selling
point is a product line that requires no
refrigeration, with room-temperature shelf
life "measured in years, not weeks" (PM,
December 18).
    Besides the UF-3323 towpreg for case
filament-winding, Thiokol now employs its own
woven prepreg for the Castor 120 skirts. It
also supplies prepreg as the cosmetic outer
layer for ski poles.
    The company hopes to mount a display at
this year's SAMPE spring meeting in Anaheim.

NOW IT'S ITALY
Lanxide Has Another Deal for Brakes,
This Time it's MMCs for Italy's Brembo

Delaware-based Lanxide, a specialist in
ceramic-reinforced wear materials, has
notched another licensing deal with an
automotive brake manufacturer. Brembo, a
$200-million company in Curno, Italy, will
use Lanxide knowhow to make metal-matrix
composite brake disks and drums in Europe.
    Lanxide late last year publicized a
deal allowing several companies to make
ceramic-reinforced brake components at the
Lanxide facility in Newark, including Japan's
Nihon Cement and Lanxide affiliate Kanematsu.
Ceramic-reinforced aluminum rotors using
Lanxide material are on Britain's Lotus Elise
sports car. The Lotus parts are made by
Waupaca Foundry, a Lanxide licensee in
Waupaca, Wisc.
    Lanxide has a pressureless metal
infiltration technology, dubbed "Primex," it
says "has enabled it to engineer a new class
of high performance materials which offer
superior combinations of properties tailored
to meet specific customer needs."
    Brembo's license allows it to make
Lanxide-style silicon carbide or alumina
particulate-reinforced aluminum components
via the Primex process or by conventional
casting, says Lanxide corporate development
VP Mike Hollins. Brembo makes brake parts and
systems for cars, trucks and motorcycles,
supplying both OEMs and the aftermarket.
    Lanxide also said last month that A.P.
Green Industries had acquired a 51-percent
interest in its high performance refractory
materials business, Lanxide ThermoComposites,
Inc.

'PURGE'
Past Mistakes Done, Mistakemakers Gone,
Says Quadrax: 'Basics Have Been Rebuilt'

Quadrax is still losing money, but revenues
are up dramatically, and the yearlong
president of the Rhode Island thermoplastic
specialist says the turnaround "reflects the
impact of actions taken to bring to an end
the effects of the decisions made by those
who previously controlled the company."
    Quadrax lost just under $7.04 million
for the first nine months of 1995 compared
with a loss of $5.96 million for the first
nine months of 1994. But sales were up to
$3.49 million for the nine-month period last
year as compared to sales of just $521,000
for the first nine months of 1994.

Cannondale Bicycles and Bicycle Parts

    Most of the Quadrax loss -- $4.12
million -- thus far for 1995 is from the
third quarter as the company made payments
related to loans and stock obligations
leftover from previous management, and paid
compensation to departed executes and
consultants, president Jim Palermo has
advised stockholders. "We have purged the
problems of the past," he said.
    The company has shifted away from high-
end thermoplastics, employing nylon-matrix
composites for sporting goods applications
and even more economical materials like
polypropylene where warranted.
    Quadrax has a heavy emphasis on tennis
racquets, but is also involved in lacrosse
sticks, athletic protective gear, and, more
recently, in bicycles, where it is working
with Cannondale on a monocoque composite
bicycle frame. Quadrax is also gearing up to
supply such bicycle parts as thermoplastic
composite seat posts, handlebars and wheels.
    Quadrax has licensed its manufacturing
process to Taiwan's Topkey for tennis
racquets in what Palermo calls the first of
"a limited number of licensing arrangements."
The Topkey license may be expanded from
tennis racquets to other "rolled tube"
products.

RECOVERY
A Better Market Situation for Graphite
Prompts 14-Percent Soficar Expansion

Soficar, an affiliate of Japan's Toray
Industries that makes carbon fiber in Abidos,
France, is expanding its production
capability by just over 14 percent, from 700
to 800 metric tons (from 1.42 to 1.62 million
pounds) per year.
    Soficar (Societe des Fibres de Carbone)
cites an international carbon fiber market
recovery and forecasts for increased
industrial use of the high-strength material.

No New Investment

    The carbon fiber company further says
that it will effect the expansion "due to an
optimized working organization ... without
any new investment, and without any process
modification."
    "This additional capacity enables
Soficar to reaffirm its leadership [of the]
European carbon fiber market and consolidate
the number one position in this field of
Toray Industries," says a statement.
    The expansion will give the Toray group
a worldwide production capability for 3,700
metric tons per year of carbon fiber, just
under 7.5 million pounds.

35,000 LAKHS
Owens-Corning Teams with Mahindra
For $100-Million Fiber Plant in India

U.S.-based Owens-Corning disclosed plans last
month for a glass fiber reinforcements plant
in India via a joint venture with the
Mahindra Group.
    The plant is planned for Taloja, north
of Bombay, with a total investment of some
3.5 billion Indian rupees, or $100 million
U.S. Initial capacity upon completion in 1998
will be 30,000 metric tons, or more than 66
million pounds of glass fiber per year.
    The plant will be expandable to 90,000
metric tons of material per year. The
Mahindra partnership and the plant at Taloja
mark O-C's first direct participation in the
Indian market.
    "We have targeted India as a strategic
growth segment and intend to be a long-term
direct participant in this important and
growing economy," O-C chairman and CEO Glen
Hiner said in statement.
    "It is important to partner with the
right local firm in India, and the Mahindra
Group is an excellent choice. We look forward
to working closely with them to develop our
business," Hiner said.
    Financial details were not disclosed.
    About 25 percent of the production from
the Taloja plant will be sold in India, the
partners say, "and the rest will be available
for the global composites market." Most of
the production from India will be sold in
Southeast Asia and the Middle East, with the
automotive industry singled out by Madhusudan
Dewan, managing director of Owens-Corning's
operations in India.

Marketing in '95, a Tech Center in '96

    O-C earlier last year established
offices in the south-central Indian city of
Bangalore and secured land rights for the
Taloja plant site near Bombay.
    "Owens-Corning will establish an
Application Development Center in Bangalore
in 1996," Dewan said, "to help companies
operating in India develop new end-use
products using building and glass composite
materials and technology."
    The announcement last month was O-C's
third during the quarter detailing plans to
increase capacity for glass fiber over the
next three years. In early October, the
company unveiled plans to add 45,000 metric
tons of capacity to existing facilities in
Brazil and South Korea. Later that month,
Owens-Corning reported plans to add 135,000
metric tons of capacity to existing
facilities in Western Europe and North
America.
    The three total well over 460 million
pounds of new production capability.

Capacity Seen Stimulating Use

    "We expect the use of composite
materials to continue to grow and we are
actively developing plans to support that
growth with additional capacity. The
expansion plans being developed now are over
and above the increases we announced earlier
this year," said Carl Hedlund, Owens-Corning
president for Asia Pacific. "We are committed
to supporting the growth of the global
composites business."
    The market for composites is expected
to grow by about 5 percent per year in North
America and Western Europe, and by more than
10 percent per year in Asia and the Pacific,
Hedlund said, predicting that O-C's
commitment will encourage new advanced
materials applications.
    O-C has annual sales of some $3.4
billion with 17,000 employees in more than
100 facilities in 30 countries around the
world.

BUILDING BRIDGES
Getting Composites Approved for Structures
Poses Material Durability Database Challenges

The infrastructure, both new construction and
seismic retrofits, represents an almost
infinite market for composite materials,
where boosters feel they can bring bottom
line and life cycle advantages into play, and
even, largely because of weight savings,
effect significant reductions in overall
project costs.
    But infrastructure markets have been
slow to develop and engineers are learning
that a systems approach involving materials,
processes and application mechanisms, as well
as committed construction industry partners,
is the only way that advanced materials will
be accepted.
    "It's the total system that's going to
be qualified," says Fiberite's Ray Williams,
who has been pursuing the infrastructure
market for composites for eight years.
"That's the material, and the process used,
and the apparatus. It's the total system."

Composites Seen Process-Dependent

    "Composite materials can strengthen
structural elements, such as columns or
beams, and may possess economic potential in
retrofitting deficient structures," Mohsen
Sultan of the Engineering Services Center of
the California Department of Transportation,
or Caltrans, says in a paper delivered at a
federally sponsored seismic retrofit
conference last month in San Diego (the paper
was co-authored by Gary Hawkins of The
Aerospace Corporation). "Unfortunately, the
physical properties of composites are
extremely process dependent and may change
from batch to batch and from contractor to
contractor.
    "As a result, composites cannot be
procured like steel, which has very well
known and reproducible properties," Sultan
said. "Even though the [composites] industry
is rich in data related to aerospace and
marine applications, the data we need,
relevant to civil engineering applications,
is very limited."
    Caltrans, accordingly, has devised a
testing scheme aimed at developing standards
for composite building applications with an
initial focus on seismic retrofits. The
overall framework includes a $180,000 federal
grant for column testing at the University of
California at Irvine, the first-ever
administration of testing fees by SAMPE (the
Society for the Advancement of Material and
Process Engineering), and the active
participation of The Aerospace Corporation to
evaluate materials, particularly with an eye
to their long-term durability.

Five Organizations in Testing

    The five organizations that have thus
far contracted with SAMPE for $25,000 worth
of testing by The Aerospace Corporation are

 --> Mitsubishi/Obayashi,

 --> Tonen/Niccho Iwai,

 --> Newport Adhesives & Composites,

 --> Hexcel-Fyfe, and

 --> The American Materials & Technologies
Corporation.
    "The reproducibility and durability of
these systems does exist," says SAMPE
technical director Charlie Hamermesh. "We
just want to confirm it."
    The process is slow, but the stakes are
high. "We don't want to have a mistake made
and ruin it for everybody," says The
Aerospace Corporation's Gary Hawkins. A
highly visible bridge disaster would be the
worst possible thing if linked in the
public's eye with composites, but even a less
obtrusive mistake that required a building
job to be repeated could cast a pall over
composites in the eyes of the civil
engineering community.
Caltrans is Critical
    Another concern is that standards be
developed that encompass the whole range of
composite seismic retrofit techniques. "We'd
rather see a performance spec than a process
spec," says Hamermesh.
    "The State wants to do this and push it
through," Hawkins says of the Caltrans
effort. "We just want to do it carefully."
Hawkins notes too that if the composites
industry can convince Caltrans of the worth
of advanced materials, then other markets
will fall into place. Once Caltrans gives its
nod, he says, "not only do all the other
states fall into line, but a lot of countries
follow too. They really do lead the way."

BAYER FINALIZES ACQUISITION OF MONSANTO ABS

     Executives at Pittsburgh-based Bayer Corp. were busy over
the holidays preparing for former Monsanto employees to return
to work today as Bayer Corp. employees.  Bayer has finalized
the acquisition of Monsanto's ABS business and plans to mark
the occasion with a Bayer sign unveiling and reception at the
Addyston, Ohio plant.

     The acquisition moves some 1,400 Monsanto employees
worldwide to Bayer's rolls today.

NEW TALC ANTIBLOCK CONCENTRATE FOR LDPE/LLDPE FILM

     A new talc antiblock concentrate for LDPE (low density
polyethylene) and LLDPE (linear low density polyethylene)
blown and cast film reportedly does not contain residual
silica and therefore does not need the hazardous labeling
required for products that contain diatomaceous earth.
Product 100520 from Ampacet Corp., Tarrytown, N.Y., is a 20%-
active concentrate in an LDPE carrier.  At typical use levels
of 2.5%, the product can provide 5000 ppm of active antiblock
in films exhibiting 96^ light transmission and 12.8% haze,
Ampacet says. The antiblock is also said to combine the
properties of silica with those of magnesium silicate.

NEW STACK MOLD DOUBLES OUTPUT

     A novel stack-mold concept for a wheel-type blow molding
machine permits twice the output of a dual-parison machine
while using no more clamp force than is required for a single
parison.  The original version of this stack mold from
Wilmington Machinery, Inc., Wilmington, N.C., used a
stationary center platen.  In the newest version, the center
platen moves, providing better parison positioning, according
to Wilmington president Russ LaBelle.

     Although the machine concept was first discussed at NPE
'94, Wilmington delivered its first stack-mold rotary machine
in the second quarter of 1995.  The machine has an output of
20,000 bottles/hr., the company says.

DAVIS-STANDARD INTRODUCES TWIN-SCREWS FOR PVC

     Davis-Standard Corp., Pawcatuck, Conn., will soon launch
its first parallel twin screw extruders for PVC windows,
siding, and pipe.  The screw technology was developed by
Repiquet of France, which Davis-Standard acquired last year.
An all-U.S.-made 90-mm extruder designed for 1200 lb/hr. will
be available by the end of February and a 115-mm model will be
offered later this year.  Both will have approximately 25:1
L/D  .A. 135-mm model for over 2000 lb/hr is due to come out
in 1997.  Davis-Standard previously offered 40-65 mm conical
twin-screws.

BRAZIL TO SEE FOUR MORE CAN PLANTS

American National Can Co has announced plans to open four more factories in
Brazil by 2000, even before completing its first factory in Extrema, Minas
Gerais. ANC plans to invest $310-mil in the four units. Each factory will
have a 1.5-bil unit/year capacity on its first two production lines and an
additional 800-mil to 900-mil cans with the installation of a third
production line.

Intalco buys more power: Intalco Aluminum Corp of Ferndale, Wash., said it

Intalco buys more power: Intalco Aluminum Corp of Ferndale, Wash., said it
has agreed to buy 770 GWh of energy and up to 145 MW of capacity per year
for five years from Powerex, the export arm of BC Hydro of Vancouver, to
diversify its power supply from the Bonneville Power Administration. The
deal went into effect Nov 22 and will continue through Sep 30, 2000, with
the power moving over BPA lines. Intalco has a 460 MW load when at full
production. It signed a new five-year power supply contract with BPA this
fall which goes into effect Apr 1 for 360MW for 12 months a year. From Apr
15-Jul 15, BPA is selling Intalco 450 MW. BPA already had given its
directly served industrials permission to buy a portion of their power
starting Oct 1, 1995 from other suppliers. The price for power was not
disclosed, but Powerex said it is competitive with current markets and
BPA's price of 2.26 cents/kWh.

KRASNOYARSK FACING LOSSES

The Krasnoyarsk Metallurgical Plant (KraMZ), one of Russia's biggest
processed aluminum producers, could post year-end losses of around
Rb100-bil ($215-mil), a senior company official told the Interfax news
agency. KraMZ financial manager Alexander Bocharov said output in October
and November was down by half on the previous year, resulting in losses of
Rb42-bil by the start of December. The downturn had been caused mainly by
an imbalance between domestic and world prices for primary aluminum,
Bocharov said. Costs inside Russia had soared to $2,500/mt against
$1,600/mt for the London quoted price because of rising electricity, rail
and other charges, he said. In 1994, KraMZ produced 67,660mt of aluminum
ingots and 21,570mt of rolled aluminum products, of which 23.4% and 33.1%
respectively were exported.

INDIAN AL EXPORTS UP, EARNINGS DOWN...

India's aluminum exports will rise to about 105,000mt in the current fiscal
year ending in March 1996, from 91,000mt in the previous fiscal year, but
earnings are unlikely to rise because of a fall in international prices,
according to Chemicals and Allied Products Export Promotion Council
executive director D Kar. Kar said exports in the previous 1994-95 were
valued at Rupees 3.87-bil (about $112.2-mil), but this fiscal year's
increased export volume is only expected to earn Rupees 3.9-bil. Although
the aluminum industry is keen to expand its existing capacity on optimistic
views of the future, an uncertain electricity supply and volatile aluminum
prices on the LME have defied financial projections. Indian Aluminium Co,
which had been slowly putting its Belgaum smelter in Karnataka back into
production, has again run into acute power cuts, Kar said. A recent
decision by National Aluminium Co to stop all sales because of its problems
with excise authorities will also affect India's exports, he said.

 ...ALUMINUM OUTPUT RISING

Kar also said that India's aluminum industry stood a good chance of earning
more from alumina exports in the current fiscal year. This year's alumina
exports will total about 500,000mt, flat from the previous fiscal year, but
earnings might jump to Rupees 3-bil, from Rupees 2.3-bil a year before
because of this year's soaring prices. Meanwhile, India's aluminum metal
output during November 1995 was 41,362mt, below the official target of
43,583mt, according to the latest data from the federal mines ministry. The
total output from April to November in the current fiscal year was
340,480mt, compared with 308,644mt for the corresponding year-earlier
period. State-owned National Aluminium Co Ltd reported April-November 1995
output of 123,480mt, up from year-earlier levels of 112,026mt. Bharat
Aluminium Co Ltd, another state-run company, reported April-November 1995
output at 61,194mt, up from 60,678mt for the same 1994 period. The two
private-sector producers--Hindalco and Indian Aluminium Co Ltd--also
reported higher output. Hindalco's April-November 1995 output was 112,924mt
compared with 106,684mt for the corresponding period last year, while Indal
reported a sharp increase to 42,814mt from 29,256mt.

JAPAN'S ALUMINUM IMPORTS DECLINE

Japan's customs-cleared unwrought aluminum imports reached 202,878mt in
November, down from 220,680mt in October, and down from 247,622mt in
November 1994, the Ministry of Finance announced. Slow domestic demand, as
well as seasonal factors, reduced the imports, one trader said. Of the
total, imports of standard aluminum (Al max. 99.9%) reached 143,185mt in
November, up from 141,881mt in October, but down from 179,896mt in November
1994. High-grade aluminum imports were 10,085mt in November, down from
16,185mt in October, but up from 8,645mt in November 1994. Imports of
unwrought aluminum alloy were 49,608mt in November, down from 62,614mt in
October, and down from 59,081mt in November 1994, MOF said.

ORMET CLOSE TO POWER DEAL

Ohio Power is ``making some pretty good progress'' in negotiating a power
supply contract extension with Ormet's Hannibal, Ohio, aluminum complex and
is expected to sign an agreement soon, according to Henry Fayne, controller
for American Electric Power, Ohio Power's parent company. Ohio Power's
30-year contract to supply 536MW of electricity to the 255,000mt/year
primary aluminum smelter at Hannibal is scheduled to expire in March 1997.
Earlier this year, Ormet issued a request for proposals to find a long-term
replacement for Ohio Power, saying it was shopping around for less
expensive power. The two companies are believed to be close to an agreement
to extend the 1997 contract by an additional two or three years. Fayne
declined to comment on whether the extension will include rate concessions.
He told Platt's his company also is working with Ormet on a second front.
``We're trying to see how a third-party supply agreement would work,'' he
said.

HC FECR PRICES SOFTER AGAIN

In a generally quiet week for the US bulk alloys markets, high-carbon
ferrochrome prices weakened further on the news that a US consumer had
bought a bargeload of material at a price below 62 cents/lb. The Platt's
Metals Week dealer price was lowered to 62-65 cents/lb, as the sale in
question also included a prompt payment discount. Elsewhere, prices were
generally static, with low-carbon ferrochrome prices continuing to hold up
relatively well; 0.15% C material reportedly changed hands at prices around
$1.10/lb FOB.

JAPAN BUYS TRANSALLOYS SIMN AT $750/MT

Japanese traders have contracted to buy a total of 1,750mt of
silicomanganese from South Africa's Transalloys at $750/mt CIF Japan, up
from the current $650/mt, provided the shipments are made in time to meet
Japan's GSP duty free customs-clearance deadline, traders said. ``Since the
1996 [GSP] applications will start Apr 1, the cargo must be ready at a
Japanese port by the end of March,'' said one trader. If they fail to meet
the deadline, buyers would have to pay a 3% duty, or $22.50/mt, on top of
the agreed price. Transalloys apparently offered 3,000-4,000mt of the
metal, but only succeeded in finding buyers for 1,750mt. ``Prices of
$750/mt are still too high for us, duty unpaid or not,'' said one consumer.
Meanwhile, Samancor has yet to settle its Q1 price talks with Japanese
buyers; the company is also looking for a $100 price hike to $750/mt.

JAPAN COBALT IMPORTS DOWN ON 1994

Japan's customs-cleared unwrought cobalt imports reached 444mt in November,
up 20.7% from 368mt in October, but down 1.3% from 450mt in November 1994,
the Ministry of Finance announced. Imports for January-November totaled
4,950mt, down 3.9% from 5,149mt for the same period in 1994. Of the total,
imports from Zaire rose 20.8% to 1,220mt from 1,010mt. Imports from Canada
also increased 20.2%, to 876mt from 729mt. However, eleven-month imports
from Zambia fell 37.7% to 712mt from 1,143mt for the same 1994 period.

COBALT TO STAY AROUND $30/LB NEAR TERM--DRI

DRI-McGraw-Hill has revised upward its projection for 1996 cobalt prices to
some extent, but remains bearish for the longer term. While DRI states that
markets now appear to remain in deficit through most of 1996, for the
longer term, it expects African production will rebound. New production
from a number of sources will impact the markets slowly, in all likelihood
not until 1998, with the strongest effect in 1999. ``This additional
material will close the gap between production and consumption and could
throw markets into a surplus,'' DRI said, adding: ``As a result of the new
supplies, prices are now forecast to fall across 1998 and 1999.''

CODELCO SERVES WRIT ON SOGEMIN METALS

(London, Santiago)
Chilean state-owned copper-molybdenum producer Codelco has launched its
first formal overseas legal action in response to the company's 1994
futures trading losses. London-based lawyers Herbert Smith, acting on
behalf of Codelco, confirmed Friday that a writ was served on LME
ring-dealer Sogemin Metals Ltd on Dec 21, alleging conspiracy to defraud
the Chilean company. Both Sogemin Metals Ltd and US subsidiary Sogemin
Metals Inc--which acted as introducing broker--are named in the action,
together with two Chilean companies who acted as Sogemin agents in Chile,
and individuals dealing with former Codelco trader Juan Pablo Davila. No
specific financial claim is made in the writ.
Codelco's losses in the 1994 copper futures trading debacle are estimated
at $174-mil, and the claim is expected to cover ``a significant part of
Codelco's losses'', according to Tim Parkes, partner at Herbert Smith.
   He said he expected further legal proceedings to be instigated by
Codelco against other trading companies in both London and New York as the
investigation into the losses continues, but could not give a timescale for
these actions. Sogemin, a subsidiary of Belgium's Union Miniere, now has 14
days from the serving of the writ to decide whether it will defend the
action, and a further two-to-three weeks to lodge a defense.
   Sources close to the company said the matter is now in the hands of its
lawyers. Sogemin chairman Michel Moser could not be reached for comment.
   Judge Jose Benquis, who is conducting the international investigations
into Codelco's losses, said earlier in the week that the next order of
business will be a summons to testify issued to Juan Marcelo Avendano,
Davila's brother-in-law and a Sogemin employee. Benquis said Avendano is
not currently living in Chile, and that his whereabouts are still unknown.
   Also under investigation, said Benquis, is whether Davila's sizable
private accounts in Caribbean banks, valued at over $1-mil, are linked to
the Sogemin payments. Davila has thus far failed to satisfactorily explain
the origin of the funds, charged Benquis: ``In fact, the situation, in my
opinion, has worsened.''
   Meanwhile, Chilean Deputy Luis Valentin Ferrada, of the Renovation
Nacional party and a member of the Congressional investigating committee,
said Codelco's case against Sogemin only confirms the commission's original
contention that Davila could not have acted without the collusion of
brokers and intermediaries. Ferrada is calling for a beefed-up
investigation in the US, where Codelco suffered losses in gold and silver
speculation.
   On Dec 26, when the presidentially appointed joint State Defense
Council-Codelco commission investigating Codelco's losses announced at a
press conference in Santiago that a suit had been filed against Sogemin,
Council president Luis Bates said that the commission must act
``cautiously'' and ``with reserve'' in disclosing details in the case to
comply with confidentiality restrictions mandated by foreign courts. ``It
is not our intention to be close-mouthed. Reserve and caution are demanded
by foreign legislation, namely US and British, that prevents us from
providing more information and jeopardizing progress in the case,'' said
Bates. While internal investigations abroad are ``very advanced, we must
proceed at a different pace at the level of coordinated international
inquiries,'' he added.
   Codelco CEO Juan Villarzu, who was also present at the conference,
conceded that Codelco will have to abandon hope of recovering the lion's
share of financial losses, as they were incurred by financial
``mismanagement'' at the hands of one of its own employees. Nevertheless
Codelco aims to recover some of the loss by exacting damage payments from
third parties involved. ``Our goal is to learn the truth, punish those
responsible, and to recover costs for Codelco and the country,'' said
Villarzu.
   The commission, headed by Bates, launched its investigation abroad in
December 1994 to determine whether foreign operators were linked to
Codelco's 1993 futures trading losses. Until now only Davila had been
formally charged.

ZALDIVAR PREPARES FOR EXPANDED PRODUCTION

(Santiago)
While other mining companies scour the Chilean Andes hoping to find their
own Escondida, Compania Minera Zaldivar has gone into production with a
somewhat more modest deposit located in the same neighborhood.
   Owned in equal parts by Outokumpu and Placer Dome, Zaldivar produced
its first copper cathode in June 1995 and estimates total 1995 production
at 23,000mt. The plan is to boost production to 85,000mt in 1996, and hit
full capacity of 125,000mt/year in 1997.
   Zaldivar has been blessed with a deposit that allows it to get into
production with very little capital cost. Before moving on to the main zone
it will first extract the primarily oxide ore that lies almost exposed at
the surface of the Pinta Verde zone. Although this segment, with an average
of 0.75%, is lower-grade ore than the 0.86% main zone, it has a low
stripping ratio making for quick cheap extraction with little waste.
   ``From a cash flow point of view, it is ideal to develop this type of
mine,'' said Tapani Jarvinen, Zaldivar's general manager.
   A short leaching cycle for the oxides from the Pinta Verde section was
an added bonus that could not be ignored when Zaldivar engineers designed
the production schedule. The Pinta Verde oxide leach cycle is about 150
days. For comparison, Quebrada Blanca, controlled by Cominco Ltd and Teck
Corp, has a leach cycle of 210 days.
   Zaldivar will be ready to begin working the high-grade main segment of
its deposit by the middle of 1996. While Zaldivar's reserves of 316-mil mt
grading 1.14% don't compare to Escondida's 1.8-bil mt or Collahuasi's
3.1-bil mt, it is still a hefty deposit.
   Jarvinen said Zaldivar uses standard heap leaching technology with the
addition of some novelties like water flushing in the tertiary crushing
process. Even though the mine is located at a high enough altitude to
warrant special precaution for humans, who lose 20-30% of their cognitive
ability, and specially designed diesel engines, the bacteria, it seems,
don't suffer from the effects of the altitude.
   Zaldivar has the largest solvent extraction and electrowinning complex
in the world built in one stage on an undeveloped site. It is also the
first large-scale use of Outokumpu's Vertical Smooth Flow technology, first
used at a cobalt/nickel plant in Finland in 1991. The system has been
tested on a pilot plant scale at Codelco's Chuquicamata since 1992, and
will produce 90% recovery from pregnant leach solution.
   The first productive phase--called ``Stage 0''--consists of extracting
the oxides, which have some secondary sulfides mixed in, in order to feed
the SX-EW operation. While this is happening, stripping will begin in the
main zone. When the oxides are depleted, extraction will start at the Stage
1 pit while the Stage 2 pit is being stripped and so on. Seventeen years
later, Zaldivar expects to be finishing up on Stage 5.
   The acid leaching will use about 200,000mt of sulfuric acid annually,
and slightly more at the beginning. Like most new mines that see their
productive lives extending into the 21st century, Zaldivar uses a
Geopositioning Satellite realtime dispatch system, allowing one central
office to monitor all equipment movements and optimize their use.
   Zaldivar and Escondida have decided to make the best of their physical
proximity, turning the lack of elbow room into an advantage for both of
them, particularly Zaldivar. The ``synergy factor,'' as Jarvinen calls it,
consists of cooperative infrastructure development, property leasing, and
some old-fashioned gentlemen's agreements. The two jointly built a 170km
access road connecting both sites to the Pan American Highway junction
outside Antofagasta. The double circuit 220 kilovolt transmission line that
runs from the Zaldivar SX-EW plant substation to the El Crucero substation
was also a joint venture and serves both mines.
   Zaldivar has signed an agreement with Escondida, giving it rights to
incur on Escondida property when digging some of its pits, to obtain the
required slope grade. Zaldivar's processing plant is even located on
Escondida property, through a special leasing agreement.
   Zaldivar pumps process water from Negrillar, 100km to the east. In the
case of a hypothetical future water shortage by either mine, Zaldivar
considers that the good neighbor policy it has sustained thus far with
Escondida, which has rights to a closer well, would lead the two companies
to draw up an agreement for water sharing.

WARBURG SAYS COPPER HAS PEAKED

Illustration(s):
Illustration: Graph: Newly released research from S.G Warburg estimates
that copper's $1.325/lb price in the second half of 1995 is as high as it
will go for the next three years. Their research shows a steady decline
right on through the second half of 1998 when the price will be 80
cents/lb. Basic to this price is the easing concentrate markets, increasing
production of refined copper, and a falling rate of consumption growth.

JAPAN TI SPONGE EXPORTS UP...

Japan's customs-cleared titanium sponge exports reached 574mt in November,
up 47.2% from 390mt in October and up 38% from 416mt in November 1994, the
Ministry of Finance reported. Exports to the US rose to 345mt, up 72.5%
from October's 200mt and 205% from 113mt a year ago. The November mean
export price to the US averaged Yen 825/kg ($3.68/lb) FOB in November, up
from Yen 722/kg ($3.25/lb) the previous month, and up from Yen 706/kg
($3.28/lb) a year earlier, MOF said. Japan's titanium sponge exports to the
European Union totaled 228mt in November, up 20% from 190mt in October, but
down 24.8% from 303mt in November 1994. Meanwhile, Japan's titanium sponge
exports during January-November reached 4,790mt, up 18.5% from 4,042mt for
the same period a year earlier. Exports to the US rose 30.4% to 1,490mt
from 1,143mt, and those to the EU increased to 3,136mt, up 8.7% from
2,884mt, MOF said.

Indonesian tin producer PT Tambang Timah expects an increase in its tin

(Hong Kong)
Indonesian tin producer PT Tambang Timah expects an increase in its tin
production next year, given strong market fundamentals and expectations of
firmer prices, President Director Erry Riyana Hardjapamekas said last
week.
   ``We expect world tin prices to firm with both a reasonable
international economic outlook and stronger tin market fundamentals,''
Hardjapamekas said, describing the year of 1996 as ``a good year for tin
prices.'' He said that Timah is planning to raise its tin metal production
by 18.3% in 1996 from 1995's planned production.
   Timah now has an installed tin production capacity of 42,400mt/year at
its Mentok smelter, with planned production in 1995 of about 37,000mt. All
the tin concentrates produced by the country's two producers, Timah and
Koba, are smelted at the Mentok smelter. Hardjapamekas also said that Timah
is now planning to add another furnace next year at the Mentok smelter to
boost production.
   At the end of 1994, Timah added its sixth furnace at Mentok to increase
production capacity from 33,500mt/year to the current 42,400mt/year. He
said Timah's tin production and exports are forecast to rise over the next
few years, anticipating a demand growth worldwide, helped by a current
shift in demand to less-costly metals. ``Timah is still strongly focused on
reducing its own cost of production and we intend to consolidate our
position as the lowest-cost producer in the world over the next few
years,'' he said.
   For 1996, Indonesia is expected to export 40,000-45,000mt of tin, up
from an estimated 34,000mt of exports in 1995, a government official said
earlier.

ZINC PRODUCTION DOWN IN NOVEMBER--EZI

Total primary zinc production fell to 452,100mt in November from 458,600mt
in October, the European Zinc Institute said last week. European production
fell to 179,900mt from 180,200mt, while outside Europe, production fell to
272,200mt from 278,400mt.Year-on-year figures show total production fell
from 455,000mt in November 1994. Outside Europe, year-on-year production
fell from 279,900mt, but within Europe, it rose from 175,100mt. Total
producer stocks were 323,300mt, down from 341,500mt in October but up from
315,200mt in November 1994. European stocks were 110,400mt, down from
122,200mt in October and 131,200mt a year earlier. The EZI announced its
statistical deprtment at Obertshausen in Germany will shut down Jan 1. The
EZI said it had decided to close the department and to stop all statistical
reports. It gave no reason for the decision.

JAPAN ZINC OUTPUT DOWN, SALES UP

Japan's zinc production reached 52,779mt in November, down 9% from October,

Industry announced last week. Shipments reached 53,058mt, up 2.9% from the
previous month, but down 9.7% from year-earlier levels. Inventories at the
end of November fell to 78,744mt, down 5.7% from end-October, and down
11.4% from a year earlier, MITI said. With Mitsubishi Materials gradually
winding down output at its Akita smelter in preparation for the plant's

Japan's zinc imports reached 6,604mt in November, up 23.6% from 5,341mt in
October, and up 100% from 3,300mt in November 1994. January-November zinc

METALEUROP SEES IMPROVED TURNOVER

Franco-German lead-zinc producer Metaleurop posted a loss of FFr122-mil for
the financial year ending Sep 30, 1995. However, consolidated turnover for
the group saw a 16% increase on year-earlier levels at FFr4.133-bil, thanks
to higher metals production and--particularly in the case of lead--higher
metals prices. Parent company Metaleurop SA showed a net profit for the
year of FFr200,000. Over the year, Metaeurop invested FFr354-mil--twice as
much as in the previous year--mainly at its zinc refinery in
Noyelles-Godault, the new lead plant in Nordenham and the smelting reactor
in Oker. In the current business year, Metaleurop said it will focus on
cost-cutting and productivity programs. The new lead smelter at Nordenham
will start up in spring 1996, with production costs nearly 20% below the
cost of the old plant which was closed at the end of November.

ECONOMIC GROWTH TO CONTINUE IN 1996 WITH LOW INFLATION

(New York)
For much of 1996, economic growth in the US, Japan, and much of Europe will
largely maintain its current pace, with no major surprises expected. The
dollar will decline slightly against some currencies, the inflation rate
will move higher, and both short-and long-term interest rates will continue
trending lower.
   This is the prognosis of many economists despite the current
less-than-rosy economic picture. Economic growth has slowed in recent
months, with the index of leading US indicators--the barometer of economic
growth about nine months ahead--slumping 0.5% in October, the steepest drop
in six months. October's fall followed a 0.1% decline in September. In
other bad economic news, the unemployment rate rose to 5.6% in November
from 5.5% in October, new home sales fell 2.7% in October from September,
and 10-month sales were running at 2% below 1994 levels.
   But these declines tempered by a surge in spending for new construction,
which the Commerce Dept said rose 2.7% in October, the second consecutive
monthly increase and the largest in more than three years.
   According to Anirvan Banerji, economist with the International Business
Cycle department at Columbia University in New York, the leading indicators
point to a continuation of relatively slow growth through the first half of
1996 for the current US economic expansion, which began in March 1994. He
noted that the slow growth stems from a backlog of inventories due to weak
retail sales. Inventories are ``having a drag on production,'' he noted.
   ``Once the inventory correction is over, there will be a slight pickup
in the economy some time in the first half, but it will be not robust,''
Banerji said. Beyond the second quarter, his crystal ball becomes blurred.
He does not rule out a mild recession, but notes: ``For the second half of
1996, the indicators are not yet giving us a clear signal.''
   The Conference Board's chief economist Gail Fosler is more optimistic.
She said that with long-term interest rates remaining low, economic growth
will be much stronger during the first half of 1996 than it was in the
first half of 1995. ``By heightening financial market expectations and
pushing long-term interest rates lower than economic fundamentals warrant,
the Fed has unwittingly set the stage for the next phase of the
expansion,'' she said.
   Fosler noted that the budget now under debate in Washington will more
likely help US economic growth than hurt it, because about one-third of the
$90-bil in proposed spending cuts in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 shifts
program responsibility to the states and may not ``materially affect total
government activity.'' The remaining two-thirds represent Medicaid and
Medicare reform. The economic effect of these reductions will be very
different from defense cuts in the 1980s, she claims, since they represent
decelerations in spending growth, not outright reductions.
   ``This will still leave the growth in federal health care spending at
twice the rate of growth in business spending or non government health care
costs,'' Fosler said. She added that the accompanying tax cuts will boost
consumer income as well and further stimulate the economy.
   Charles Schultz, an economist at the Brookings Institution, also
believes the economic expansion will continue. ``I don't see any great
dangers of a recession in 1996, but I think it [growth] will be a bit
soft,'' he said.
   Similar views were expressed by Cynthia Latta, senior financial
economist with DRI-McGraw-Hill. ``GDP growth will depend on what happens in
the budget talks,'' she said. But she noted that GDP will increase by
2-2.5% in 1996. Third-quarter GDP growth was unchanged from the Q2 level at
3%. She does not anticipate a decline in the economy and noted: ``I think
the Federal Reserve has made anticipatory moves, to a greater degree than
it did in the past, and preempted a downward move in the economy.''

Low interest rates
   Economic growth in 1996 will get a further boost from low interest
rates. The Fed recently lowered its Federal Funds Rate by 0.25% to 5.5%,
its first reduction since July. Most observers believe the Fed might be
willing to make further cuts to nudge the economy along, once there is an
agreement on the budget.
   But interest rates must eventually rise with any boost in economic
growth. While higher interest rates may be delayed by ``excessive
optimism'' about this year's budget package, the longer this ``necessary
adjustment'' takes, the higher interest rates will ultimately rise, the
Conference Board's Fosler said.
   The Brookings Institution's Schultz noted that the budget outcome will
play a key role in determining future economic growth and also the level of
interest rates. ``If there is some compromise, I would expect interest
rates to remain in the same general area where they are now. I don't seen
any particular reason why they should move up or down significantly from
where they are,'' he said. Schultz added: ``The likelihood is that any
changes over the short term will be down rather than up.''
   However, further economic growth will accelerate the increase in the
inflation rate, according to Fosler. ``The Federal Reserve Board's recent
success in curbing inflation may prove to be its own undoing,'' she said.
And although inflation is currently running at a rate of 2-3%, it is more
likely to rise than decline, even though prices of consumer goods are still
rising at a 2% annual rate at the producer level and discounting appears to
have ended at the retail level. Fosler noted that prices respond quickly to
changes in demand and, therefore, a reacceleration in consumer demand will
raise prices.

Inflation under control
   According to Schultz, inflation ``has been behaving very well and is not
getting out of hand.'' He added: ``I don't see any pressure being built up
in the economy.'' He noted that raw materials prices and wages remain
subdued. DRI's Latta agrees, saying: ``I would not expect inflation to come
in at over 3% next year. We could get a spike up in food and energy prices,
but I would not expect the CPI core rate to go above 3%.'' The November CPI
remained unchanged at 0.1%.
   Further evidence that the US will not face any serious economic shocks
in 1996 are the states of affairs in Japan and Europe, where economic
growth remains anemic at best. One economist described Japan as ``a basket
case,'' but Latta said: ``I think the Japanese economy will remain fairly
weak but will slowly come out of its slump, because the government is
beginning to handle the banking problem.''
   Economic problems facing the major US trading partners will help keep
the dollar from skidding against the major foreign currencies. David
Abramson of the Bank Credit Analyst believes the dollar will ``go higher
because the European economy is weaker than the US economy,'' adding: ``We
are not going to be too worried about the dollar until we see signs that
the US economy is strengthening.''
   Based on the assumption that Japan keeps interest rates low and expands
bank reserves to keep its stock market strong, Abramson forecasts the yen
at Yen 108 to the dollar for much of 1996. Latta pegged it at Yen 100-105.
As for the Deutschmark, Abramson said, ``Europe needs to do more to turn
its economy around, and the pressure on the German economy will keep its
currency at about DM1.55 to the dollar.''

CHINA FACING 1-MIL MT ALUMINA DEFICIT IN 1996

(Hong Kong)
China is likely to have a 1-mil mt deficit in the domestic alumina market
in 1996 despite a projected 9% increase in output from 1995 levels, Chinese
alumina and aluminum producers said. The main hope of redeucing the deficit
would be restricted output from aluminum smelters as a result of power
shortages, they added.
   China's alumina output is expected to rise to 2.5-mil mt in 1996, from
an estimated 2.3-mil mt in 1995, according to alumina producers. The
deficit in the alumina market will have to be covered by imports, they
said. And a 6% import duty cut in January may force alumina producers to
lower prices to the domestic market and to long-term contractors, or
aluminum smelters will boost alumina imports, they noted.
   Major alumina producers offer at Yuan 3,230/mt ($389) to the domestic
market and Yuan 2,999.88/mt ($361) to long-term contractors. But the rise
in alumina output in 1996 is not expected to keep pace with strong aluminum
demand. With an easing in the tight power supply situation, aluminum output
is projected to rise to 1.7-mil to 1.8-mil mt from an estimated 1.65-mil mt
in 1995, aluminum producers said.
   Many aluminum smelters, particularly those located in northwestern and
southwestern provinces, hope to be able to operate at full capacity in 1996
after power shortages in 1995 forced production cuts, the sources said.
Their heightened output is likely to marginally cover the moderate growth
of domestic consumption, they said.
   The producers' plans for 1996 hinge on electricity supply. As a result
of rapid economic growth for the past decade and slow growth of electricity
generating capacity, electricity supply is insufficient to meet demand in
many Chinese provinces.
   Most of the aluminum smelters in China's northwestern Gansu province
have failed to operate at full capacity in 1995, with insufficient
electricity in the area forcing these smelters to cut 10-30% of production
throughout the year, a local official said. Total aluminum production
capacity in Gansu is estimated at 300,000mt/year, the official said, and
may be achieved in 1996 as the electricity supply is likely to increase. In
Qinghai province, adjacent to Gansu, inadequate electricity supplies
limited Qinghai Aluminum Smelter's production to only 110,000mt in 1995
compared with its capacity of 200,000mt/year, a company source said.
Although Qinghai Smelter is hoping to boost its production in 1996, the
necessary increase in power availability is still uncertain, he said:
``Local authorities have been unable to promise a supply rise.''
   Meanwhile, in China's southwestern Guizhou province, an electricity
shortage forced the 190,000mt/year Guizhou Aluminum Smelter to cut 1995
output to 150,000mt, a smelter source said. ``We were able to produce
enough alumina to support our full aluminum capacity production, but no
electricity,'' said the source. Guizhou Aluminum is planning to run at full
capacity in 1996 despite uncertain electricity supply, the source added.
   Alumina producers will try to keep up with the increased aluminum
output. In 1996, China Great Wall Aluminum Corp, China's largest alumina
producer, plans to run at full capacity of 800,000mt/year after failing to
reach its target capacity in 1995 because of continual technical problems,
a company source said.
   Shanxi Aluminum Smelter, China's second-largest producer, also plans to
operate at its full capacity of 800,000mt/year in 1996, with hopes that the
firm will fully utilize its new facilities after completing a capacity
expansion earlier this year, a company source said. Shanxi Aluminum is
expected to produce about 700,000-720,000mt of alumina in 1995, the source
added.
   Meanwhile, Shandong Aluminum Corp and Guizhou Aluminum Smelter will also
lift their alumina production to 540,000mt and 310,000mt, respectively,
company sources said. But production at Guizhou will also depend on the
power supply in the province. 1995 production totaled around 470,000mt for
Shandong and 300,000mt for Guizhou, company sources said.

PLENTY HAPPENED IN THE WORLD OF METALS

Having started production in October this year, Pingguo Aluminum will be
able to produce only 40,000-45,000mt of alumina in 1995, but the firm is
hoping to boost its alumina output to 100,000-150,000mt in 1996 to cover
its aluminum production demand, a company source said.

RHODIUM PRICES PLUNGE TO 22-YEAR LOWS

(New York)
Much to the dismay of dealers and producers alike, rhodium prices have
continued to decline, plunging to a low of $256/oz early last week before
bouncing back slightly by week's end. Prices are currently at their lowest
levels since 1973.
   The rebound came when a European buyer, believed to represent a Swiss
banker, sought to take advantage of the low prices by placing several buy
orders. Even though the total purchase was about 50kg, the price shot up
into the $270-$290 range. ``The buying seems to emanate from a Swiss
bank,'' one London dealer noted. ``The metal was readily available at $245
to $250 yesterday [Dec 28], and this guy came in this morning and took out
some cheap metal and that pushed the price up.''
   The market has been at a virtual standstill in recent weeks, and one
trader noted that last week's burst of activity was the first real buying
since October, when Johnson Matthey was believed to have been a major
player. ``I won't be surprised if it [the price] goes to $200,'' one trader
said.
   One London dealer noted that ``there's plenty of metal around,'' adding:
``Consumers are still working off their stocks, and there's no additional
demand to soak up the metal that is available.'' He said the increased
supplies have been coming from recyclers while mine supplies have been
holding steady.
   The state of the market has confused most analysts, who believed that
consumers would be attracted by the relatively low prices of the metal and
take the opportunity to build their inventories. But so far that has not
happened.
   One analyst explained that the major auto manufacturers, who are the
largest end users of rhodium, already have their cupboards full.
``Consumers are locked in with long-term contracts from the producers and
there is not enough additional demand to soak up the supplies,'' he said.
   Another analyst noted that when rhodium prices hit $7,000/oz in 1990,
auto manufacturers began making improvements in both their engine designs
and catalyst technology with the aim of reducing rhodium consumption. ``The
switch away from rhodium is a one-way street, and it has not turned around
once prices began to fall,'' he said.
   In recent years, Ford Motor Co and the major Japanese auto manufacturers
have made big strides in increasing engine efficiency to reduce the need
for heavy loadings in catalytic converters. For many car models,
palladium-based catalysts can do the job of meeting antipollution
standards, because of cleaner-burning engines.
   Another blow to rhodium is that demand from the European auto market has
not panned out as anticipated, and smaller quantities of the metal are
being used there. On top of that, mine supplies are up and more is on the
way.
   According to Johnson Matthey's Interim Review of the PGM markets,
Zimbabwe's Hartley PGM mine will produce 11,500oz/year of rhodium when the
mine gets up to speed by early 1997. For 1995, rhodium supplies rose to
438,000oz from 426,000oz in 1994, outstripping demand, which rose to
422,000oz in 1994 from 386,000 oz in 1993.
   Producers are in the unenviable position of not being able to curtail
supplies, even though prices are falling. Rhodium is a byproduct of PGM
refining and producers depend on their chief products (platinum and
palladium) to make a profit. Rhodium is frosting on the cake, but in recent
years the layer of frosting has been getting thinner.

US GROUP BUYS MAGMA SHARES

Australian mining giant Broken Hill Proprietary may have to lift its bid
for takeover target Magma Copper after an aggressive New York fund
management group grabbed an 8% stake in the US company, according to an
Australian newspaper report. The Sydney Morning Herald said records filed
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission shows Gabelli Funds spent
$95.41-mil acquiring shares in Tucson-based Magma after BHP made its
A$3.28-bil ($2.39-bil) takeover bid on Dec 1. The newspaper said most of
the shares were purchased for about $27.80, just short of BHP's $28 per
share cash tender for Magma. BHP made no comment on the move by Gabelli,
but noted its offer has the support of Magma's long-time major shareholder,
investment group Warburg Pincus, which has a 26% stake.

SPCC INVESTING $600-MIL IN ILO SMELTER

Southern Peru Copper Corp is planning to construct a new smelting facility
at its Ilo complex on Peru's southern coast over the next six years at a
cost of $600-mil, a company source told the Santiago daily newspaper El
Mercurio Dec 26. The new plant will use continuous anode casting
technology--an upgrade from the current remelting and refining methods--to
reduce energy consumption and minimize sulfuric acid emissions. The
facility will also include a sulfuric acid plant that will help SPCC keep
emissions within permissible international standards.

PRINCETON MINING GETS OKAY FOR BC MINE

Canada's Princeton Mining has announced that the development of its
Huckleberry copper and molybdenum mine has been approved by the British
Columbia government. Copper production is forecast to average 65-mil
lb/year during the first five years and total 1-bil lb over the life of the
mine. Molybdenum production is expected to average more than 1-mil lb/year.
The mine will cost $137-mil to develop with construction starting in
January and lasting 18 months. A strategic alliance has been formed by
Princeton with a consortium of Japanese companies--Mitsubishi Materials
Corp, Marubeni Corp, Dowa Mining Co, and Furukawa Co--who will take a 40%
stake, senior finance a $60-mil project loan, and buy the mine's total
copper concentrate production.

US SILICON IMPORTERS WIN TEMPORARY ASSURANCE ON DUITES

(Washington)
US importers who brought in silicon metal from Silarsa of Argentina during
the period Sep 1, 1993, through Aug 31, 1994, have received assurance that
their antidumping duty will remain 24.62%, following the completion of a
Commerce Dept administrative review. In addition, the deposit rate for
Silarsa silicon remains 24.62% for future imports, until the completion of
another review, or unless a court appeal causes it to change. Commerce Dept
officials completed the review prior to the US government shutdown.
   Commerce decided to keep the rate unchanged, despite the fact that US
producers American Silicon Technologies, Elkem, Globe, and SKW argued that
the duties should be increased punitively because Silarsa did not cooperate
in this review or a previous one. Silarsa asked to be excused from
responding to Commerce's questionnaire because it exported only 331mt
during the period of review, in October 1993, and it stopped manufacturing
silicon metal in January 1994 and has no near-term plans to resume
production.
   The US companies urged Commerce to increase the rate to the average of
the petition rates, 81.31%, or, at a minimum, to the lowest petition rate
of 49.35%, because they said the current rate is not sufficiently adverse
to induce Silarsa's cooperation.
   Silarsa dismissed the US industry's claim, saying the 24.62% margin
constitutes an insurmountable barrier which precluded it from participating
in the US market and precipitated its decision to cease production. US
trading company Hunter Douglas also submitted comments, arguing that an
increase in the rate would have punished unrelated US importers who must
actually pay the antidumping duties even though they have no control over
foreign exporters or their decisions about whether to cooperate in Commerce
reviews. Commerce agreed with Silarsa that ``there is no evidence to
indicate that, if Silarsa resumes production, the current rate is
insufficient to ensure Silarsa's cooperation in a subsequent review.''
   However, US importers are not in the clear retroactively yet; the US
industry still has several appeals pending before the US courts, and it has
the option of appealing this review as well.

BRAZILIAN MERGER WILL PRODUCE MINING GIANT

(Sao Paulo)
Brazil's Eluma, Caraiba Metais, Paranapanema, and Paraibuna mining groups
were merged Dec 22 into a new company, Companhia Brasiliera de Metais Nao
Ferrosas (CBMNF), after several months of negotiations. A group of
Brazilian pension funds, headed by Bank of Brazil pension fund Previ--which
already controlled Eluma--will pay $300-mil for control of the other
companies. The new company will be set up officially in one month after an
audit performed by the pension companies on Caraiba, Paranapanema, and
Paraibuna.
   CBMNF's shareholders' equity is $900-mil, with yearly sales of $1.1-bil.
The new company has plans to invest $600-mil and increase yearly income to
$1.8-bil. CBMNF will be one of the world's largest tin companies, the only
Brazilian producer of electrolytic copper, and the second-largest
Brazilian producer of zinc. Daniel Birmann, president of the Arbi
Group--which sold its shareholding in Caraiba Metais--commented, ``a large
megacompany was an old idea of the Arbi Group, but we weren't able to
achieve it.''
   The funds will control 98% of the voting capital of Paraibuna, 71% of
Paranapanema, and 66% of Caraiba. Previ's partners in the new company are
Petros (Petrobras' pension fund), Aeros (the Brazilian airline companies'
pension fund), and Sistel (Telebras' pension fund). $30-mil of the $300-mil
price tag was paid on the signing of the protocol. Previ president Jose
Valdir Ribeiro dos Reis said that other groups are interested in buying
into the newly-merged group, though no definite commitment has been made;
potential Brazilian partners include CVRD pension fund Valia, CVRD itself,
Companhia Siderurgica Nacional, and BNDES, the national development bank.
   Foreign groups have also expressed an interest, Ribeiro dos Reis said,
citing Australia's BHP plus another unnamed company. ``We have discovered
many synergies among these mining companies in Brazil and we believe that
the new holding will be competitive internationally,'' he added.
   Analyst Roberto Vinhaes of Investidor Profissional noted that ``since
the mining sector has not gone through significant technological
improvements, one of the ways out is to gain economies of scale.'' He added
that, among other advantages for large companies in the mineral sector,
``if the price of tin drops, the company could offset it, for example, by a
rise in the price of copper.''
   Caraiba Metais produces 170,000mt/year of electrolytic copper for the
internal market and exports what it does not sell in Brazil. Paranapanema
owns one of the world's largest tin mines, the 18,000mt/year Pitinga mine
in the Amazon, and also controls the operations of the Bom Futuro reserves
in Rondonia through its Ebesa subsidiary. Pitinga's 1995 output was
expected to reach 11,000mt, up 2,000mt from 1994. Production at Bom Futuro
was projected at 3,500mt for 1995, giving a total of 14,500mt for the
Paranapanema group.
   Zinc producer Paraibuna is currently heavily in debt, and is looking to
invest in hydroelectric energy generation to reduce costs. The company
currently produces 70,000mt/year of primary zinc. Eluma, which produces
copper products and copper/zinc and copper/tin alloys, recently underwent a
restructuring process using technology from Italy's Europa Metalli group.

US COMMERCE DEPT AMENDS INTERLINK MAGNESIUM DUTY ORDER

(Washington)
The US Commerce Dept has amended its final antidumping duty order for
magnesium from Russia to clarify that Interlink has a zero dumping margin
when importing from either of the two Russian producers. The recent
decision answers a complaint stemming from the end of the investigation
earlier this year.
   Commerce published its final determination in the antidumping case on
Mar 30, and the final duty order was published May 12. Interlink alleged on
May 11 that a ministerial error had been made in that Commerce incorrectly
assigned a margin for its sales of magnesium supplied by Russian producer
Solikamsk Magnesium Works. Commerce found the allegation constituted a
ministerial error, but because the US industry had already appealed the
decision to the US Court of International Trade, Commerce was unable to
correct the error and publish the amended final determination.
   Subsequently, the court granted Commerce leave to correct the
ministerial error, which it did in a Dec 20 Federal Register notice, which
was prepared prior to the latest US government shutdown. The notice
clarifies that Interlink has a zero antidumping deposit rate for magnesium
from Avisma and from Solikamsk, but faces 100.25% from any other Russian
producer. Avisma and Solikamsk are the only Russian producers currently in
operation.
   Six other trading companies also have zero duty rates: Gerald Metals,
AIOC, Greenwich Metals, Hochschild Partners, Hunter Douglas, and MG
Metals.

EAGLE MINING POURS FIRST GOLD

Australia's Eagle Mining said last week the first gold has been poured at
its Nimary gold mine near Wiluna. The mine--in the Yandal Greenstone belt
of Western Australia--is expected to produce approximately 100,000oz/year
of gold for five-and-a-half years at an average cash operating cost of
A$260/oz. The mine's construction and development took less than five
months, with operations beginning Dec 14 when low-grade ore was introduced
into the mill. The plant was expected to reach its full design capacity of
650,000mt/year by the end of the month.

MK GOLD WRITES OFF JEROOY PROJECT

US miner MK Gold said last week it will to write off $6-mil of its $14-mil
investment in the Jerooy gold project in Kyrghyzstan. The company said the
gold recovery from first underground mine and mill and then heap leach test
results suggest Jerooy is unlikely to become an economically viable project
as originally designed. The company has asked Kilborn Engineering to
prepare a new engineering and cost study, to be completed by March 1996,
based on a design that includes open pit mining and milling of the gold
ore. MK Gold will evaluate the new study and discuss the outcome with the
Kyrghyzstan government to determine whether there are viable project
alternatives.

US EPA UNCONCERNED OVER LEAD-ACID BATTERY COMBUSTION

(Washington)
The US Environmental Protection Agency continues to maintain that it does
not need to prohibit the combustion of lead-acid vehicle batteries in
municipal waste combustors. EPA decided in 1991 that it would not prohibit
the combustion of lead-acid vehicle batteries, but the decision was
challenged in the US Court of Appeals, which remanded the issue back to EPA
in June of 1992.
   In a published notice prepared prior to the current partial US
government shutdown, EPA stated that it concludes it is unnecessary to
include lead-acid battery combustion restrictions because additional
efforts to remove batteries from municipal waste combustors would have
little impact on the amount of lead entering the waste combustors and
little effect on controlled lead emissions.
   EPA cited tests and studies showing that the facilities typically have
only one battery per 300 megagrams (Mg) to 700 Mg of municipal solid waste,
and that a significant percentage of batteries do not make it to municipal
combustors. EPA assumed a lead-acid battery recycling rate of 94.4%, so
that only about 5-mil out of 87.8-mil batteries generated were not recycled
in 1992. It noted that 37 states have battery recycling laws based on the
Battery Council International model rule, with mandatory take-back and
deposit requirements.
   As many as 45-mil batteries may be stored in individual households, EPA
maintains, so ``battery storage by households, therefore, may represent a
significant reservoir of automotive-type lead-acid batteries that do not
immediately enter the municipal solid waste stream or the recycling
system.''
In addition, a test program conducted at the Burnaby, BC, municipal waste
combuster found that ``lead-acid batteries do not appear to be a measurable
source of stack gas Pb emission,'' EPA said.

From The Editor's Desk

This month's issue of Surface Modification Technology News includes
a wide variety of topics.  Although there is no "lead" or special
article on a particular process or new material, several items are
key to the future of surface modification.

We review a new process called Jet Vapor Deposition.  Its
co-founders claim that this evolutionary procedure has several key
advantages in thin film deposition: low cost, uniformity, and high
throughput.  According to all reports, it bears watching in the
future.

Following on our feature in the April issue, we again discuss the
use of the laser for surface modification.  A short but important
article features laser chemical vapor deposition for
microelectronic packaging operations.

Continuing our efforts to keep on top of various diamond film
developments, we describe the epitaxial growth of diamond on a
nickel substrate accomplished by researchers in Japan.  In addition
we include another article on the use of diamond coating for
erosion protection.

We are continually searching for new developments in surface
modification and materials.  Again, we welcome any input our
readers have on these subjects.  Please let us hear from you.

Modelling of Chemical Vapor Deposition

Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New
Mexico, are working on the modelling of isothermal deposition in
single fiber bundles.  They believe this will aid in producing
high-quality ceramic-matrix composites.  A model has been developed
that takes into consideration the growth, and eventual overlap, of
deposition fronts about individual fibers.  In addition, a
mathematical model for woven fiber bundles has been developed.
With these models, the effects of changes in operating conditions
and weave architectures can be investigated through simulation.
Spatial variations in composite density can also be estimated.

New Thick- and Thin-film Coating Method

Through the use of supercritical fluids, researchers at the
University of Colorado in Boulder have developed a new method of
applying a variety of thin- and thick-film coatings.  The process
consists of mixing a coating compound with the supercritical fluid
and then spraying the mixture onto a heated surface where a
chemical reaction forms a stable coating.  Carbon dioxide or
nitrous oxide are the supercritical fluids used.  The mixture is
sprayed through a nozzle onto a heated surface.  The pressure and
temperature of the surface depend on the coating.  The ratios of
the metal precursors can be controlled somewhat precisely to form
films such as mixtures of metal oxides.

New Low-Temperature CVD Process for TiN Coatings

Injection molding dies for plastics is one of the leading
applications of a patented low-temperature CVD process developed by
Liburdi Engineering of Canada.  The lubricity of the TiN coating
improves plastic flow and reduces sticking during the injection
molding process.

The even coating of complex shapes, deep crevices, and runner
passages in the dies is a major advantage of this new method. In
addition, the low coating - temperature (500-650 Degree C)
maintains tool hardness and minimizes distortion which can occur
with conventional CVD at 1000 degree C.  No postcoating heat
treatment is needed.

The low coating-temperature is achieved by using a subchloride of
titanium, TiCl3, to produce the TiN.  The TiCl3 is made in the
reaction chamber by chlorination of Ti pellets in a reducing
atmosphere.  The coatings can be made more adherent as well as more
corrosion- or wear-resistant by controlling the gas flow rates, the
total pressure, and the chlorinator and coating temperatures.

Other applications for these adherent and wear-resistant coatings
are carbide inserts, stainless steel turbine compressor blades, and
dies used in metal forming operations.  An investigation to
establish correlations between coating parameters, composition,
structure, and properties is now going on with the objective of
improving the ability to tailor the coatings for specific
applications.  The company is interested in providing coating
services to the plastic-molding and metal-forming industries and
are also looking at joint development of new applications for these
TiN coatings.

Highway 6 North, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada L9J 1E7.  For coating
services information, contact Liburdi at 23565 Outwood Drive,
Southfield, MI 48034.

Jet Vapor Deposition Ready to Compete with CVD, PVD

Jet Process Corporation, New Haven, Connecticut, was started in
1984 by two Yale University graduates.  Co-founders Richard E. Hart
and Jerome J. Schmitt claim that the jet vapor process brings many
advantages to thin film deposition.  They include low cost, great
uniformity and high throughput.  Unlike CVD and PVD, jet vapor
works in a rough vacuum at low temperatures, and doesn't use toxic
gases.  The largest part of the JVD system is a standard,
fan-cooled mechanical pump.

An R&D model is expected to cost about half as much as other
deposition methods, according to Mr. Hart.  Right now, they are
working with a small group of companies and are acting as custom
fabricators.  It took four years to get the first JVD patent and an
R&D unit should be ready this year.  Production units may be
several years away.

In addition to CVD and PVD, the jet system may compete with e-beam
systems used for evaporation.  Compared to e-beams, JVD can operate
at much higher pressure, but in a low vacuum, and still produce
good results.  Mr. Schmitt added that since JVD doesn't need high
vacuums, it also doesn't require long pump down times.

JVD works with a mix of known principles of compressible gas
dynamics, fast flow systems, high temperature processes, plasma
chemistry and film deposition.  A supersonic jet flow of inert
carrier gas is formed by a nozzle.  This flow is directed into a
low vacuum chamber.  This chamber is continuously evacuated by a
high-speed mechanical pump.  Depositing vapor molecules are seeded
into the jet flow from a vapor source positioned within the nozzle.

Finally, the jet transports the vapor species to the prepared
substrate's surface, where a hard, dense, adherent coating is
formed.  This process is distinct from plasma spray methods where
droplets of molten metals or various ceramics are deposited.

The founders say that JVD offers important advantages for the
fabrication of integrated circuits and to the broad applications in
optics and aerospace.  Whether this process can obtain sufficient
market share from the current entrenched deposition methods remains
to be seen.

More on Lasers for Surface Modification

Several issues ago we featured the use of lasers for surface
treatment.  Although a small part of the overall picture at the
present time, this technology is expected to increase in volume in
the near future.

We were recently attracted to a discussion about laser chemical
vapor deposition. It is one way of depositing metals on substrates
and is being used in microelectronics packaging.  In a reaction
chamber containing gaseous precursors that are inert at room
temperatures, a focused laser beam is introduced to selectively
heat regions of the substrate.  Only in these heated regions will
the gaseous precursors react with each other.  The precursors are
carefully chosen so that the desired metal is the only solid
reaction product.

For packaging applications, some metals are of particular interest.

They include aluminum, copper, gold, and tungsten.
Tungsten is an attractive choice because it is compatible with many
other metals and dielectrics, does not corrode, and is
cost-efficient.

Even though laser CVD requires placing the workpiece in an
exhausted environment, as it usually involves hazardous gases, it
can be a cost-effective solution for some applications.  IBM, for
example, recently disclosed that it is using laser CVD of metals in
the manufacturing of its System/390 computers.  IBM researchers at
Almeden, California, had previously developed laser CVD processes
for several metals including gold.

Ceramic Coatings Possible for High Temperature Auto Parts

Automobile manufacturers are becoming more interested in using
thermal-barrier coatings (TBCs) on engine components that are
subjected to high exhaust temperatures, as well as excessively
abrasive conditions.  TBCs have been used for many years on
aircraft gas-turbine engine components.  Plasma-arc thermal
spraying is used to apply coatings of zirconium oxides containing
various stabilizers such as calcia, magnesia, yttria, ytterbia, and
ceria.

Diesel engine applications are very attractive to auto makers.
Zirconia TBCs offer many advantages including:

 Retaining heat in the combustion zone to improve efficiency.

 Reducing component surface temperature for protection from
 thermal shock and oxidation.

 Controlling heat loss to temperature-sensitive components.

 Providing improved wear-resistance.

Ceramic coatings can provide wear resistance, depending on the type
of mechanical loading involved.  Sliding wear, typically found in
valve stems and piston rings, requires a coating having  a low
coefficient of friction, such as aluminum, bronze or titanium
dioxide.  On the other hand, cam lobes and crankshafts need a
coating with a combination of high compressive strength and bond
strength, such as tungsten-carbide and chromium-carbide coatings.
The advent of higher exhaust-gas temperatures has led to research
of other types of ceramic coating methods.  A two-layer ceramic
coating for the inner passages of the ductile-iron exhaust
manifolds of diesel engines has been developed by researchers at
Hino Motors Ltd. and Hitachi Metals Ltd.  Coating is done by
passing a ceramic slurry containing a water glass binder through
the manifold.  Good adhesion between the iron substrate and the
coating is ensured by a layer of magnetite (2Fe0-Si02), which is
formed on the coating prior to coating.

The two-layer coating applied to the manifold is designed to
withstand cracking and peeling caused by the thermal shocks of
high-temperature exhaust gases. Testing of coated diesel-engine
manifolds confirms that oxidation is reduced and reliable operation
is obtained without cracking or peeling at temperatures to about
800 degree C.  But higher temperatures cause the coating to shrink.

This limits use of the coating to the temperature range experienced
by conventional, uncoated iron manifolds.  Coatings capable of
higher operating temperatures are needed if iron manifolds are to
compete successfully with stainless steel parts.

Additional research and development efforts are needed if auto
makers are to realize the protection from high temperatures
afforded by ceramic coatings.

Researchers Grow Diamond on Nickel Substrate

The epitaxial growth of diamond on a nickel substrate has been
accomplished by Japanese researchers at STA's National Institute
for Research in Inorganic Materials (NIRIM) and Onada Cement Co.,
Ltd.

The researchers used a nickel single-crystal substrate, over which
they circulated a 0.5 percent methane gas mixture at a temperature
of approximately 880 degree C.  This produced epitaxial growth of
diamond crystal on the substrate crystal and is claimed to be the
first hetero-epitaxial growth of diamond on a substrate material
other than cubic boron nitride.

According to both organizations, the researchers have yet to
produce a single-crystal film of diamond, but NIRIM confirmed that
epitaxial growth is indeed possible on a cobalt single-crystal
substrate.  In addition, reports indicate that a copper single-
crystal substrate may be used because of its suitable crystalline
structure.

Diamond Coating for Erosion Protection

The Science and Technology Center of Westinghouse Electric Corp.
has developed a diamond coating process for the protection of zinc
sulphide and zinc selenide soft windows, used in infrared sensors,
from erosion caused by rain, dust, or sand.

It should be noted that previous attempts to deposit diamond
directly onto optical surfaces have been unsuccessful due to
diamond's chemical and mechanical incompatibility with the
substrate material, and to the fuzzy image created by the
unevenness of the grown film surface.  The Westinghouse method
eliminates these problems by first depositing a diamond film onto
another material using microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor
deposition.  The diamond-coated material is embedded in a
chalcogenide glass bonding layer, and the glass is sandwiched
between the zinc compound and diamond film.  The outer surface,
which is the original substrate, is removed and exposes the diamond
nucleation surface.  The bonding process is independent of the
method used to deposit the diamond film. An immediate application
targeted for this process is the protection of infrared optics.
Quality optics in the visual range requires further work to reduce
a slight residual fuzziness caused by scattering, but visual image
distortion has been almost eliminated.  The company has filed for
a patent on its optical brazing technique.

Westinghouse researchers have coated windows up to about 40 mm (1.5
in.) in diameter.  Work on coating larger windows and curved
surfaces is under way.  The program is funded by the U.S. Naval
Weapons Center, China Lake, California, and Westinghouse.

According to the company, future applications could include
multispectral windows that pass both visual and IR wavelengths, for
missles and spacecraft, protection of photovoltaic cells in space,
shatterproof plastic eyeglasses, and scratch-free watch crystals
and mirrors.

For more information, contact Westinghouse Corp., Science and
Technology Center, 1310 Beulah Road, Pittsburg, PA 15235.
Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel for Producing Process Equipment

The Kemira Engineering Company of Finland has developed a technique
for bonding ordinary carbon steel and special metals together to
produce a fully corrosion-resistant coated steel.  The major
application for this kind of steel is the production of pressure
vessels and other types of process equipment.  The coating may be
a layer of acid-resistant or stainless steel, zirconium, titanium,
or tantalum.

The technique is called Chemface cladding.  Cost reductions of 30
to 50 percent are estimated over conventional designs using
expensive metals.  The company claims that the properties imparted
by this technique include absolute adhesion, vacuum integrity of
linings, and good mechanical strain resistance.

Depending on the temperature, the bond strength is estimated to be
ten to twenty times that needed for operation under vacuum.
Another application being considered for Chemface linings is the
replacement of vitreous enamel and other more conventional linings
to reduce maintenance costs.

Toyota Develops Material with Controlled Hardness

A material that can be stimulated by an external voltage to
increase its hardness without increasing its volume has been
developed by the Toyota Motor Company.  The new material is
composed of cobalt polymethacrylate particles dispersed in a matrix
of isoprene rubber.  When the external voltage is applied, the
binding forces between the entangled chains of particles increase,
reducing the elasticity of the chains and hardening the material.
There are no visible external changes and the volume of the
material remains constant.

The hardness of a 1 mm-thick film of this material can be adjusted
from 0.1 to 1.0 MPa.  Since the changes do not involve the
absorption or release of water, the material could be used in the
elctronic suppression of irregular vibrations in car engines and
bodies.

Research and Development Laboratories, 1 Toyota-CHO, Toyota City,

Zinc Coating On Site

Zinc coating can now be done on site without having to dismantle
structures, according to Galvatech Ltd. of the United Kingdom.
Described by the company as a "unique" anticorrosion product, Zinga
zinc coating can be applied by brush or spray.  It is a liquid
component which when dry contains at least 95 percent electrolytic
zinc that bonds to steel or iron, even if mildly rusted, to provide
maximum corrosion protection.

Zinga actually provides cathodic protection.  The zinc coating
rusts instead of the steel or iron base.  If the zinc coating is
scratched, the rust cannot creep under the coating and cause
bubbling.  Worn hot-dip galvanizing can be recoated.  It is not
necessary to dismantle structures like barriers, fencing or pylons.

Existing coatings of Zinga can be renewed and the new surface will
resemble its original condition.  There will be no separation
between the layers.  The company says that structures do not have
to be grit-blasted again after coating.  Mildly rusted structures
can be recoated without grit-blasting.

INDUSTRY NEWS - Spire Corporation Announces First Quarter Sales and
Earnings

On May 14th, Roger G. Little, President and Chairman of the Board
of Spire Corporation, announced sales and revenues of $4,136,000
for the quarter ended March 31, 1991.  This compared to $4,836,000
recorded for the first quarter of 1990.  Results of operations
showed a profit of $1,000 or $0.00 per share, compared to net
earnings of $155,000 or $0.04 per share for the first quarter of
1990.

Mr. Little stated, "The decline in revenue that we experienced was
due primarily to reduced government R&D funding, principally
because of procurement delays.  This was anticipated.  We took
steps to cut nearly $2,000,000 per year in indirect expenses during
the latter half of 1990.  These cuts allowed us to break even for
the quarter with reduced revenues."

Mr. Little also said, "Our backlog has grown to $11 million.  We
have booked $5 million in new business since the beginning of 1991.

Included are major new government programs for optical component
and laser diode development as well as significant commercial
contracts.  With this increased backlog, we hope to be able to
improve quarterly revenues throughout the remainder of the year.
Improved revenues with continued cost containment could be
reflected in the Company's overall performance."

Spire produces unique epitaxial wafers, offers production ion
implantation processing services, and sells photovoltaic and
semiconductor processing equipment and related technology.  Spire's
customers span the biomedical, electronics, aerospace, defense and
energy industries worldwide.

Spire Wins Army Research Contract for Advanced Surface Texturing

In late May, Spire Corporation and the U.S. Army Materials
Technology Laboratory signed a $5 million research and development
contract, the largest in Spire's history.  It supports a three year
program to explore uses of SPI-TEXTTM surface texturing technology
for stray light suppression in advanced Army sensor systems.

Optical sensors are of vital importance to the next generation of
Army interceptors, designed to guard against ballistic missiles.
Since their mission requires extreme sensitivity and
discrimination, these sensor systems must have exceedingly dark
interior surfaces, or optical baffles, to achieve adequate stray
light rejection and pointing accuracy.  Baffle materials must
maintain their optical performance in the face of the shock loads
of interceptor launch and maneuver.  In addition, baffle materials
cannot introduce contamination which would compromise the sensor
system's signal-to-noise performance.

Today's commercially available baffle materials consist of either
black paints or acid-bath anodized metals.  The best baffle
materials have highly textured surfaces to create low reflectivity.
But these surfaces are fragile and easily damaged by incidental
contact during handling.  They also shed particles under flight
vibration.  A critical examination of failure mechanisms in current
materials suggested an innovative approach to producing superior
baffle materials.  Essentially, this approach is to texture the
metal surface directly, creating millions of light-trapping pores
and cones per square centimeter.

This leaves a sturdy metal surface without minute, fragile
interfaces subject to mechanical failure.

In an earlier research program with the Army Materials Technology
Lab, Spire developed SPI-TEXT ion beam texturing technology to
produce extremely dark surfaces which are immune to damage from
ordinary handling.  This program, sponsored by the U.S. Army
Strategic Defense Command and the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative
Organization, produced textured aluminum surfaces as dark as the
best commercial baffle materials without compromising mechanical
hardness.  In simulated launch vibration tests, this material
produced no detectable contamination on adjacent catcher plates.
Accoring to Dr. Edward A. Johnson, Spire program manager, "SPI-TEXT
offers a technological breakthrough to meet the stray light
suppression needs of advanced sensor systems."

Roger Little, President of Spire, said, "Spire is extremely proud
of the progress made to date in this important technology
development effort and of our contribution to the Army strategic
defense program.  We believe that our approach to hardened baffle
materials technology development has provided the Army with
substantially improved materials quickly and cost effectively.  We
are eager to continue our cooperation with the U.S. Army Materials
Technology Laboratory to develop advanced material solutions to
meet the stray light suppression requirements of present and future
Army strategic defense systems."

U.S. Navy Chooses American Cyanimide Aluminum Core

Aluminum honeycomb core from American Cyanimide in Wayne, N.J. has
been chosen by the Navy to replace the present core material
because of its superior corrosion resistance.  The honeycomb core
is phosphoric-acid anodized and primed.

Test samples were exposed to 100 percent relative humidity, and 6
to 8 percent salt spray at 140 degree F for a period of 30 days.
They were then subjetced to various kinds of damage such as dents,
cuts and holes that went through the core.  After being exposed for
an additional 60 days, they still showed no corrosion.

The PAA-Core is fabricated by laminating aluminum sheets and
expanding to form hexagonal cells.  With corrosion eliminated,
lighter structures are possible.  The end-results include extended
service life and reduction in repair costs and downtime.

Spray Deposition: A Fundamenatl Study of Droplet Impingement,
Spreading and Consolidation.

Prepared by D. Apelian, A. Lawley, and P. Mathur.  Drexel
University Department of Materials Engineering, Philadelphia, PA.

This report summarizes the objectives, approach and salient results
of a program on spray casting.  Spray casting via the Osprey<191>
process is emerging as a promising technology to produce
near-net-shaped components of advanced materials.  The process
involves the sequential stages of gas atomization and droplet
consolidation on a substrate to produce a disk, billet, tube,
and/or strip.  The major advantage of spray casting is the ability
to produce uniform, fine grained materials at deposition rates in
the range 0.25-2.5 kg/s in a single operation from the melt.
Composite materials can be manufactured by injecting second phase
particles into the spray of droplets, or by in-situ reactions
between the droplets and the gas during flight.  The objectives
were to develop a scientific understanding of the physical and
thermal phenomena that are active during spray casting and which
govern the shape and microstructural integrity of the preforms and
to evaluate the Osprey process for processing bulk high-strength
low-alloy steels.

Laser Assisted Cladding of Refractory Materials

Prepared by R.D. Creehan, Physical Sciences Inc., Andover, MA.

The objective of the study is to establish the feasibility of using
high-power lasers in a novel thermomechanical process for cladding
of high-melting substrate alloys without producing excessive
melting or thermal damage to the underlying substrate or cladding
foil.  By heating the interface of the clad material and substrate
alloy to the eutectic temperature of the binary alloy, a superior
metallurgical bond is produced with minimal melting and heating.
With the process, only a very narrow region of the clad-substrate
interface is actually fused and the clad surface retains a smooth
texture which does not require subsequent machining.  The coverage
rates which can be obtained with the process are one to two orders
of magnitude higher than reported in the literature for laser-
assisted fusion cladding processes in which the entire clad layer
is fused.

Chemical Cleaning of Aluminum Alloy Surfaces for Use as Vacuum
Materials in Synchrotron Light Sources

Prepared by N. Kaufherr, A. Krauss, D.M. Gruen, and R. Nielsen,
Argonne National Laboratory, IL

Photon and electron desorption from the vacuum chamber walls of
electron storage rings such as the proposed Advanced Photon Source
(APS), are sometimes responsible for the production of large gas
loads during operation even in systems with very good static
vacuum.  The gas released by beam-induced desorption results in
scattering of the beam electrons, and a consequent reduction in the
beam lifetime.  In extreme cases, the beam-induced outgassing may
cause so much scattering that it is not possible to obtain the
design goals with regard to obtainable beam current.  Consequently,
it is important that the surfaces which are exposed to the electron
beam and photon fluxes contain as little trapped gas as possible,
and that the gas burden during operation be kept as low as
possible.  The current study investigates the effectiveness of a
chemical cleaning tratment developed at CERN for the LEP storage
ring, as applied to the 6063 alloy to be used in APS.
Additionally, depth profiling of the chemically cleaned samples and
samples which were vapor-degreased only, provides new insight on
the cleaning process as it applies to the alloy proposed for use in
APS.  14 refs., 8 figures.

Diamond Swings
into Sensors

The Fall Meeting of the Materials Research Society (MRS) included
several highlights on diamond technology.  Of particular interest
is research being done in diamond sensing applications at
Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN 37235) by J.L. Davidson (Tel:
615/322-3479, Fax: 615/322-7996) and W.P. Kang.

Sensors used to be simple mechanical springs or thermometers, but
electronic control and processing demand more sensitive and
interfaceable devices.  The area of optic sensors has become
sophisticated, led by demands for missile guidance and clearer TV
images.  The area of mechanical and chemical sensors has lagged
behind because of the lack of an appropriate semiconductor material
to meet the requirements.

The entrance of diamond as a deposited layered film is changing the
picture.  Diamond's attractive properties such as very fast charge
carriers, high electric breakdown, and heat conductivity result in
the best estimated performance for speed and power of any material.


Recently the discovery and development of what might be called
sophisticated secondary effects in diamond are opening interesting
sensor applications.  For example, diamond containing boron becomes
a semiconductor like silicon and will change electrical resistance
with strain, called piezoresistance.

This means it can be used as a strain gauge on rugged electronic
microsensors for pressure and acceleration sensing.  CVD
polycrystalline diamond films have been applied in radiation
detectors, photodetectors and thermistors.  They have the
properties of wide bandgap, low thermal coefficient of expansion,
and high thermal conductivity.

The paper presented at the MRS Meeting by the Vanderbilt
researchers discusses some critical issues about diamond for
microelectromechanical sensing applications such as the stress
limits and high temperature responses of a diamond pressure sensor.
The authors describe an all diamond pressure microsensor that
measures pressures when the temperature exceeds 600(F.  This means
that miniature electronic sensors can be used in critical places
not previously possible, such as the end of oil well drill bits and
in power plants and engines near the combustion zones.

The researchers have also observed that layered diamond films can
behave as chemical sensors measuring oxygen, hydrogen, and many
other chemicals.  For example, a diamond-based chemical gas sensor
using layers of metal and diamond which acts directly as an
electronic device has been made and its behavior as a gas sensor
has been studied.  The adsorption of gases such as those found in
automobile exhausts by the diamond sensor causes changes in its
electrical current behavior similar to altering the sensitive
properties of a transistor. Thus, an electronic change arises from
the presence of a chemical.

This kind of input, coupled to amplifying and computing
electronics, provides sensitive, fast and accurate chemical
measurements which can be very useful in emission control.  Because
the sensor is diamond, it can perform these functions in
environments and at temperatures that would not support monitoring.
Additional information on this research can be obtained by
contacting the authors at the address and number above.

Diamond for Electron
Field Emitters

Another application for diamond technology highlighted at the MRS
Fall Meeting was presented by Wei Zhu (AT&T Bell Labs, Tel:
908/582-7659, Fax: 908/582-2783) and involved the electron field
emission properties of diamond.  Field emitters may be a potential
replacement for hot cathode tubes, because emitters are smaller and
use less power.  Diamond is a preferred field emission material due
to its durability, long lifetime and the low wattage it needs to
perform electronic tasks.

Field emitters are useful for a number of applications including
microwave power amplifiers, flat panel displays, ion guns and
electron sources for microscopes.  Typical field emitters use
metals or semiconductors like silicon with sharp tip geometries.
But the control voltage required for emission from these materials
is relatively high (about 100 V) because of their work functions.


The high voltage operation increases the probability of damaging
instabilites due to ion bombardment and surface diffusion of the
emitting tips, so high power densities have to be supplied from an
external source to produce the required emission current.  In
addition, the fabrication of uniform sharp tips over a large area
proves to be a difficult and expensive process.

Diamond has recently emerged as a desirable field emission material
because of its negative electron affinity and good mechanical and
chemical properties.  To induce stable electron emission from
diamond, however, either the bulk or the surface of diamond must be
made conductive.  And to take advantage of diamond's negative
electron affinity for low voltage emission, diamond must be doped
as a n-type semiconductor.  Unfortunately, effective and reliable
n-type dopants for diamond are not available at the present time.


The AT&T researchers have investigated the emission properties of
a variety of undoped and p-type doped diamond samples, including
CVD deposited diamond and commercial diamond produced by the
traditional high pressure, high temperature method.  They found a
strong correlation between the electrical field required for
emission and the density of defects introduced in diamond.

Low emission fields have been consistently demonstrated for
appropriately processed diamond emitters.  The present status and
future prospects of field emitters for various potential
applications with respect to the availability of suitable materials
was also discussed in the presentation.

Diamond Like Materials
in Flat Panel Displays

A specific presentation on diamond and diamond-like materials for
flat panel displays was presented at the MRS meeting by Keith
Jamison and others  of SI Diamond Technology (Houston, TX; Tel:
713/529-9040, Fax: 713/529-1147).  The next generation of flat
panel displays for computers, personal digital assistants, and
other portable displays may rely on field emitted electrons
striking phosphor as the light source.

This design is essentially a flat CRT where each pixel has its own
electron gun.  Recent experiments have shown that diamond and
diamond-like materials may make robust field emission electron
sources for this application.  Diamond has a high thermal
conductivity, relative insensitivity to contamination and, when
grown under certain conditions, can emit electrons at relatively
low electric fields.

SI Diamond Technology has constructed a prototype 50 x 50 pixel
display using diamond like carbon as the electron source as a proof
of concept for diamond field emission displays.  The company is
currently building a 1/4 VGA display that can be used in commercial
applications.

The electron emission properties of SIDT's diamond like carbon
cathode was presented and compared to other diamond and diamond-
like carbon emitters.  The emission properties were determined
using a number of novel analytical techniques that simulate a field
emission flat panel display and measure the emission uniformity of
the material and emission site density over a given area.  The
cathode requirements for SIDT's flat panel display was also
presented along with current performance of the diamond like carbon
cathode presently used by the company.  For more information,
contact SIDT.

New CVD Dielectrics
Series from Lam

Lam Research Corp. (Fremont, CA; Tel: 510/572-6692, Fax: 510/572-
2935) announced two next generation CVD systems that answer
production level dielectric film requirements on leading edge
devices with 0.35-micron and below design rules.

The Deep SubMicron (DSM) 9900 deposits superior quality insulating
films between metal layers for intermetal dielectric (IMD)
applications, while the DSM 9800 performs premetal dielectric (PMD)
applications by depositing dielectric films prior to first
metallization.  In addition, the 9800 does a number of other
applications including Si02 spacers and Ta205 storage capacitors
for 256 megabit dynamic random access memories (DRAMs).

Together, these systems provide comprehensive dielectric film
solution for chipmakers adopting 0.35-micron and below technology.
Both systems are enhancements to Lam's prior generation systems
tradenamed Integrity PMD and Epic CVD tools introduced for advanced
development efforts in 1990 and 1993.

Lam's chairman and CEO Roger D. Emerick noted that the 9000 series
reflects Lam's intensified focus on the CVD market.  "We first
entered the market in the early 1990s with leapfrog technology.
Once the market demand caught up with our technical innovations, we
needed to prepare these tools for production proliferation," stated
Emerick.

He added that the systems were designed with technology
extendability in mind--both the DSM 9900 and the DSM 9800 have
deposited films on devices with 0.18-micron feature sizes, and the
DSM 9800 has successfully deposited high quality films on 300 mm
wafers.

To meet production requirements, the new 9000 series CVD tools
incorporate features and benefits developed over the last year in
cooperation with several leading chipmakers and SEMATECH.  Specific
changes include reduced footprint, increased throughput, lower cost
of ownership, and the development of process solutions for specific
film types.

Smoother Films for
Machine Tool Coatings

Researchers at Argonne National Lab (Argonne, IL 60439; Tel:
800/627-2596) have developed a new process for growing thin diamond
films from C60 molecules, known as buckyballs or fullerenes.  The
process, which uses fullerenes as precursors for diamond film
growth, produces nanocrystalline films with unique properties.

Very rough films are produced by conventional methods and to make
them smoother would slow the growth rate and interject graphitic
phases into the finished product.  The Argonne films can be made as
rapidly as the rough films but they are true diamond with very
small grain size and are exceptionally smooth (as much as 17
nanometers rms) even at film thicknesses greater than 10
micrometers.  They do not need the expensive post-deposition
polishing required for conventionally grown diamond films.

In this new process, diamond film is grown from fullerene molecules
instead of from hydrocarbons such as methane.  The buckyballs
collide and fragment into highly energetic carbon dimers (C2).  The
dimers then insert into the diamond lattice to form a new diamond
layer.  Since little hydrogen is added in the process compared with
conventional methods, the resulting films have very low hydrogen
content and are high quality.

Because of their smoothness, these films could be used as coatings
for machine tools and bearings.  The films have been deposited on
substrates such as silicon, silicon carbide, silicon nitride,
tungsten and tungsten carbide.  Friction coefficients are as low as
0.05 and, because of their smoothness, the wear rates of the
counterface material have been found to be as much as 100 times
lower than for conventional diamond thin films.  In addition, under
a cooperative R&D agreement funded by the Dept. of Energy's (DOE)
Office of Energy Research, Laboratory and Technology Transfer
Program, Argonne and SI Diamond Technologies (Houston, TX) are
evaluating the films as candidates for filed emission displays.

Another Diamond
Patent for GE

A microwave or flame-assisted method of depositing CVD diamond was
revealed in U.S. Patent 5,464,665, issued November 11, 1995.  The
inventors are Thomas R. Anthony and James F. Fletcher and the
assignee is General Electric in New York.

Broadly, the present invention is directed to improving a chemical
vapor phase deposition (CVD) method for synthesis of diamond
wherein a hydrocarbon/hydrogen gaseous mixture is subjected to a
combustion flame in the presence of oxygen to at least partially
decompose the gaseous mixture to form CVD diamond. The improvement
in process comprises subjecting said combustion flame to one or
more of dielectric heating, d.c. discharge, or a.c. discharge.

Dielectric heating can be accomplished by subjecting the combustion
flame to microwave (MW) frequency discharge or radiofrequency (RF)
discharge. By superimposing dielectric heating or d.c./a.c.
discharge plasma generation on combustion flame process, the carbon
utilization rate of the combustion flame process should improve
substantially. As noted above, given the low carbon utilization
rate for combustion flame techniques already, small percentage
improvements in the carbon utilization rates translate into
substantial cost savings in generation of CVD diamond by such
combustion flame technique.

Diamond Nucleation by
Gas Phase Seeding

Diamond films have been deposited on substrates without
pretreatment by placement of a nickel wire above the substrate by
a group in Germany, led by Ch. Woll (Institut fur Angewandte
Physikalische Chemie, Universitat Heidelberg, INF 253, 69120
Heidelberg, Germany; email: cc1@ix.urz.uni-heidelberg.de), reported
in Applied Physics Letters.  The nickel wire was seen to increase
the nucleation density by five orders of magnitude.  Electron
microscopy showed continuous diamond films to be produced with
Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showing the
presence of Ni in the diamond phase.

The diamond was grown in a standard hot filament CVD chamber with
a tungsten hot coil and a resistively heated substrate holder.  The
substrate (100 or 111 silicon or Cu) was heated to 800-850oC, 5 mm
from the filament.  Growth rates of 0.5-1 micron/hour were attained
in a 0.5% methane, 95.5% hydrogen at a 100 sccm flow rate.  When
the Ni wires were placed 0.5-1 mm from the substrate diamond was
seen to grow preferentially in the area in line with the Ni wire
and the coil.

Carbon-Coated
Metal Particles

Researchers at Northwestern University (Evanston, IL, Tel: 708/491-
3115) have discovered a way to cover tiny pellets of metal with
graphite in an airtight fashion.  Electron microscope pictures of
the pellets, which measure less than a millionth of an inch across,
show layers of single atoms of graphite running around them.  The
pictures resemble bucky tubes, a relative of buckyballs.  Instead
of being hollow tubes, however, the spherical layers totally
encapsulate the round metal pellets.

The pellets, called encapsulated nanoparticles, form spontaneously
when graphite is present during the process of vaporizing the metal
particles using a tungsten-based electric arc, according to the
researchers.  They believe the pellets could be used in a wide
range of applications such as medicine, since they could travel
through the human bloodstream without exposing the body to the
metal contained inside.  They would be useful in MRI giving greater
clarity to images inside the body, and in anti-cancer therapy and
cell separations which currently use larger magnetic particles.

The discovery was described at the Fall Meeting of the MRS in
Boston by graduate student Jon Host.  The research team was headed
by D. Lynn Johnson and Julia Weertman, Walter P. Murphy professors
of materials science and engineering; Vinayak P. Dravid, associate
professor; and Thomas O. Mason, professor of materials science and
engineering at Northwestern's Robert R. McCormick School of
Engineering and Applied Science.

The pellets have other possible uses such as magnetic strips on
credit cards, magnetic ink on checks, and in cassette tapes.  The
finding was unexpected.  The original goal of the research was to
manufacture, analyze and utilize the tiny metal particles, which
measure 10 nanometers in diameter.  When a batch of nickel
particles was soaked in acid so it could be analyzed for any
possible contamination from the tungsten, it was discovered that a
black residue remained at the bottom of the container which
continued to be magnetic.

When analyzed with the transmission electron microscope, the
researchers realized that the nickel particles had been insulated
from the surrounding acid by the layers of carbon atoms surrounding
it.  The original findings were reported in the journal Nature.

Photoluminescence
in Thin Films

Photoluminescence has been detected in thin films of partially
oxidized silicon (Si) nanoclusters by scientists at the Lawrence
Livermore National Lab (Livermore, CA 94550; Tel: 510/422-1100).
The scientists, reports Lloyd L. Chase, synthesized Si nanoclusters
with average diameters of only a few nanometers (nm) using thermal
vaporization of Si in an argon (Ar) gas background.  The first
monolayer of Si nanoclusters was deposited directly onto the basal
plane of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, and the layer was
exposed to oxygen (O2) for five minutes.  Although, additional
monolayers were added until the film thickness reached about 250
nm, no photoluminescence was observed.

Post annealing the film in O2 produced a white photoluminescence,
which peaked at about 600 nm.  The photoluminescence increased in
intensity as a function of annealing time and temperature up to
850(C without any accompanying shift in wavelength.  The decay time
was less than five nanoseconds.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed extensive oxidation of
the film, and the photoluminescence excitation spectrum of the film
showed a strong resemblance to the optical absorption curve of bulk
Si, except for an increase in absorption at wavelengths longer than
375 nm.  The scientists attribute the photoluminescence to the
recombination of carriers in localized defect centers in the
silicon oxide layer.

MRC Targets
Win Certification

Materials Research Corp. (Orangeburg, NY), a leading supplier of
thin film manufacturing equipment and materials for the worldwide
semiconductor and magnetics industries announced that it has
received certification from Applied Materials, Inc. as an approved
supplier of aluminum alloy targets tradenamed Monobloc for the
Applied Materials Endura PVD system.  To support chipmakers, MRC
has also acquired an Endura 5500 physical vapor deposition system
for its Advanced Materials Division's (AMD) Thin Film Lab--making
it the first target supplier to make this equipment investment.

The certification from Applied means that MRC's Monobloc targets
meet Applied's stringent standards for reproducibility, thus
offering consistent performance over the life of the target.
According to Ken Barry, VP and general manager of MRC's Advanced
Materials Div., MRC worked with a major U.S. captive chipmaker to
obtain the certification.  "The certification is particularly
significant because it demonstrates the consistent performance of
MRC's Monobloc targets in a 200 mm production environment--between
wafer runs and across manufacturing sites.  Targets from three
different MRC facilities were tested, and all met certification
criteria," stated Barry.

When tested, the Monobloc targets achieved Rs uniformity of <5% 3
sigma over the life of the target.  In addition to Monobloc
targets, MRC manufactures targets for its own sputtering systems
tradenamed Eclipse, Primus, and Solarus.  MRC is also an
established supplier of refractory and precious metal targets for
the Endura system.

World's Largest
System Underway

Implant Sciences Corp. (107 Audubon Rd., Wakefield, MA 01880, Tel:
617/246-0700, Fax: 617/246-1167) introduced the world's largest
system for ion implantation and ion beam-assisted deposition.  The
ISC ion beam processing system will be installed in Spring, 1996,
at the Environmental Technology Facility of the National Defense
Center for Environmental Excellence, operated by Concurrent
Technologies Corp. in Johnstown, PA.

NDCEE is a national demonstration facility dedicated to the
development of clean manufacturing techniques for the Dept. of
Defense (DOD), and transfer of environmentally sound process
technology to DOD contractors and American industry.

The system will be used, among other applications, to develop ion
beam-assisted evaporation of chromium and nitrogen ion implantation
as clean replacement processes for toxic hexavalent chrome
electroplating.

The stainless steel vacuum chamber is 6 ft. in diameter and 12 ft.
long, including extensions and a gantry/trolley system for
accepting large cylindrical parts up to 6 ft. long and one ton in
weight.  A 24 in. diameter rotary substrate table holds smaller
parts for ion beam processing, and may be tilted, heated or
electrically biased.  A planetary rotation fixture is also
included.

Multiple sensors measure substrate temperature, deposition rate,
beam current density, and analyze residual gas.  Two 20 in.
cryopumps, an 8 in. cryopump, a 245 CFM roughing pump, and a 30,000
liter/sec cryopanel comprise the pumping system, which is
supplemented by a UV lamp array to expedite outgassing of water and
organics.  An optional load lock for continuous processing is
available.

Three gas ion sources ranging from 30 eV to 100 keV are included in
the basic system, which has provisions for adding another ion or
deposition source.  Called the ISC-5000, the system has a high
current 100 kV bucket type ion source which provides a very high
nitrogen ion current of over 50 mA.  The system also features a
large low energy ion source and a medium energy ion source with
beam currents of 2.5 A and 1 A respectively.

Two electron beam evaporators allow the deposition of up to five
materials.  PVD evaporation combined with ion bombardment can
improve important coating properties such as adherence, hardness,
lubricity, and resistance to wear and corrosion.

Operation of the pumping system, ion sources and evaporators are
computer controlled.  Processes that are routinely performed
include ion implantation, ion beam precleaning, PVD using electron
beam evaporation, ion beam-assisted deposition, and ion beam mixing
of deposited coatings.  Ion beam polishing and etching can also be
done in the basic system.  A metal ion source can be added.  For
more information, contact A. J. Armini at Implant Sciences.

Applied Materials
Offers New Implanter

Applied Materials (Santa Clara, CA, Tel: 408/727-5555) introduced
its Precision Implant xR80 ion implanter which is targeted to the
low-energy implant market.  The energy range is capped at 80 KeV
but the system performs the delicate task of forming the
transistors on chips with deep submicron design rules.

The new implanter is capable of generating a beam at relatively
high current levels (5 milliamps at 5 KeV).  This boosts throughput
when forming the shallow junctions, as opposed to deep wells, of
DRAM and logic devices built with 0.25- and 0.18-micron line
widths.  The xR80 is tailored to the formation of transistors and
differs from the recently announced Genus implanter which is more
of a general purpose system.

Focused Ion Beams
Make Smaller Chips

Los Alamos National Lab (New Mexico) researchers are trying to make
smaller computer chips using technology first developed for the
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization's now defunct Neutral
Particle program.  Ion beams used in microlithography are focused
by magnetic optics.  This technology offers narrower linewidths
than now possible which makes more compact and powerful circuits.

According to Dr. Tom Mottershead (Tel: 505/667-9730.) of Los
Alamos, this technology can achieve a 25-to-1 reduction in beam
diameter.  A sharp focus such as this allows the beam to deliver
high current densities for etching the fine lines of microchip
circuitry.  The technology is also useful in probing the surfaces
of high density microcircuits, inspecting the patterns of
photomasks, and checking for defects.  Data storage is another
possible application as focused beams of gallium ions could read
and write data in media more durable than today's CD-ROM.

Dr. Mottershead has proposed experimentation on an in-house basis
at the Lab's Accelerator Operations and Technology Div. using an
existing tandem electrostatic accelerator, and is interested in
possible collaborations with industry.

Advances in
Quantum Wire

Advances in the production of quantum wires is reported by a
research group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
(Urbana, IL 61081).  The team, headed by Keh-Yung Cheng (Tel:
217/333-6642, Fax: 217/244-6375, email: kcheng@uxl.cso.uiuc.edu),
have used molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and strain induced lateral
layering ordering (SILO) techniques to build quantum wires,
nanoscale atomic structures believed to dramatically increase the
efficiency and reliability of light emitting devices such as laser
diodes.

Many of the advances in computing, data storage and
telecommunications have come as a result of the evolution of
semiconductor materials.  While silicon has been utilized to
stretch the bounds of computer processing power and speed, other
semiconductors have been applied to create photonic devices.  Such
devices can emit or detect light; for example, semiconductor laser
diodes can be used to read data from compact disks.

Over the past 30 years, the techniques for creating these
semiconductors have been refined.  Using an MBE method, scientists
can grow semiconductors in layers as thin as one atom.  By
selecting the types of semiconductor material, properties such as
the color of its light emissions can be engineered.

An ultrathin layer, or quantum well, has done much to improve the
reliability and efficiency of light emitting devices.  This quantum
well is the center of a semiconductor sandwich that is only a few
dozen atoms thick.  When structures approach this nanoscale,
electrons begin to change their characteristics and exhibit quantum
size effects.  Such changes can affect and improve the overall
performance of optical devices, such as achieving more light
generation for a laser diode.

The next step in quantum devices are structures that utilize
quantum wires.  Similar to quantum wells, quantum wires have atomic
scale thickness in two dimensions instead of one.  With this
additional degree of quantum confinement, it is theorized that even
higher levels of efficiency and reliability can be observed in
practical optical devices.

The color of a standard laser diode's output light can vary with
time and temperature.  Quantum wire lasers, though, are thought to
maintain uniform characteristics over a broader range of
environmental variables.  Until now, very little success has been
achieved in preparing such quantum wire structures.

In the Illinois work, the SILO process used MBE to grow
alternating, ultrathin layers, less than two atoms thick, inside
semiconductor structures.  The number of atoms in each layer is
slightly different, either lesser or greater, than would normally
be required.  The resulting atomic imbalance creates a strain force
inside the growing crystal.  The strain force, in turn, causes
certain atoms to group together along lines on the growing surface.
When the SILO process is combined with quantum well fabrication
techniques in MBE quantum wire regions are formed almost
automatically.

Cheng's group has demonstrated laser devices emitting in the
visible and infrared (IR) spectra range using quantum wires.  The
devices, showed various new and unexpected optical characteristics,
are the subject of further research at the university.  Eventual
end uses may include improved supermarket checkout scanners and
home fiber optic communications.

AT&T Develops
Stable Facet Films

Silicon oxide (SiOx) films suitable for use as nonhermetic laser
facet coatings have been produced by researchers at AT&T Corp. (600
Mountain Ave., Murray Hill, NJ 07974; Tel: 201/582-3000).  Naresh
Chand relates, in U.S. Patent 5,440,575, that the new films have
low levels of cracks, voids and particulate contamination and that
they are stable in ambient atmospheres.

The surfaces of nearly all semiconductor lasers must be protected
and/or modified.  Although dielectric films suitable for some
devices are widely used, e.g., silicon dioxide (SiO2) on silicon
(Si), there is a need for a dielectric that is mechanically and
chemically stable and free of pinholes, cracks, particulates and
voids.  It should also have good adhesion, be highly resistant to
moisture penetration and be adaptable for use as a semiconductor
laser facet coating regardless of emission wavelength.

A number of materials, including yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ),
have been proposed, but end up with shortcomings, including poor
reproducibility with respect to refractive index and/or mechanical
stress and contamination with particulates.  In addition,
conventional facet coatings are not normally stable in the ambient
atmosphere, causing changes in laser properties and premature laser
failure.

Because of the problems associated with conventional facet
coatings, nearly all such devices are packaged in hermetic, gas-
filled enclosures.  These hermetic lasers are widely used in
optical fiber communications, optical interconnects, sensors, and
printing.  Hermetic enclosures add to the complexity of
manufacturing processes, reduces yield, and increases the cost of
the devices.  The AT&T researchers sought a highly reliable laser
facet coating stable in the ambient atmosphere.

The AT&T scientists discovered that under the right processing
conditions, high quality silicon oxide (SiOx) films suitable for
use as laser facet coatings could be produced.  The key to their
work was the use of a deposition by molecular beam technique
instead of conventional thermal evaporation processes.  The surface
layer of the film is nearly always SiO2, but this layer normally
represents only about 10% of the entire film in most cases.  If
particular reflectivities are needed, the SiOx film can be combined
with layers of other dielectric or semiconductor materials
deposited using the same technique.

Single Crystal Films for
High Frequency Uses

Another paper of interest to the thin film business was presented
at the Fall Materials Research Society Meeting.  It was part of the
epitaxial oxide thin films symposium and was given by Y. Suzuki and
colleagues from AT&T Bell Labs in New Jersey (Tel: 908/582-4633).
Others involved in this research include R.B. van Dover, E.M.
Gyorgy, V. Korenivski, Julia M. Phillips, D. Werder, C.H. Chen, and
R.J. Felder.  The basic thrust of this work follows.

High frequency filters that can be incorporated into integrated
circuits would ease design problems where power dissipation is
tightly budgeted.  In mobile communications, integrated filters
could have an impact on increasing performance while reducing size
and cost.  These filters are composed of capacitors and inductors.
While capacitors have been easily incorporated into integrated
circuit technology due to their planar geometry, inductor
components have not.

The solutions have been either to use discrete inductor components
or to simulate an inductor with a capacitor in an active circuit.
The former solution raises size and cost, while the latter possibly
reduces performance and reliability.  Therefore, a high performance
integrated inductor would be an excellent solution.

To fabricate an inductor with a large inductance, a significant
field has to be generated over a large volume.  The researchers can
increase the inductance of a thin film device material by using
high permeability material.  There are other requirements for the
materials to be used in these thin film inductors.  To reduce
dissipative losses due to eddy currents, a magnetic material with
low conductivity has to be used.

Other requirements include high saturation magnetization values at
room temperature and low magnetic losses.  Sinel structure ferrites
are good candidates.  The successful growth of single crystal
ferrites in thin film form is an important step towards their
future incorporation into integrated circuits operating at
microwave frequencies.

The AT&T researchers have successfully grown high quality single
crystalline spinel ferrite thin films of (Mn,Zn)Fe204 and CoFe204
on SrTi03 and MgAl204 substrates at low temperature.  These ferrite
films are buffered with spinel structure layers that are
nonmagnetic at room temperature.  Ferrite films grown on SrTi03 and
MgAl204 buffered with CoCr204 and NiMn204 exhibit excellent
crystallinity and bulk saturation values, thus indicating the
importance of lattice match and structural similarity between the
film and the immediately underlying layer.

X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, atomic
force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy analysis
provide a consistent picture of the structural properties of these
ferrite films.  The researchers have also incorporated these single
crystalline ferrite thin films into device structures to take
advantage of their high permeability.

Diffusion Barrier
Method Patented

AT&T, NJ, was issued U.S. Patent 5,468,689 on November 21, 1995,
for a method for preparing a silicon nitride gallium diffusion
barrier for use in molecular beam epitaxial growth of gallium
arsenide (GaAs).  The inventors are John E. Cunningham, Keith W.
Goossen, William Y. Jan, and James A. Walker.

The technique involves reacting nitrogen and silane in a ratio of
less than 300:1 in a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
apparatus to form a silicon nitride layer.  This layer is deposited
on a reflowable glass layer previously deposited on a (100) silicon
substrate oriented 3 degrees off axis and bearing a thin film of
silicon dioxide.  Finally, GaAs is deposited by molecular beam
epitaxial growth on the silicon nitride layer.  The technique is
said to be of interest for use in the monolithic integration of
interconnected GaAs/AlGaAs double heterostructures, modulators and
silicon MOSFET structures.

Mid-IR Laser
Likes It Warm

A team of scientists from the Naval Research Lab (NRL) and the
University of Houston Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center (SVEC) has
developed a mid-infrared (IR) solid state laser which operates near
room temperature.

According to Shin-Shem Steven Pei, SVEC's associate director for
research (Tel: 713/743-3621; email: spei@uh.edu), lasing was
observed at temperatures up to 285 K (54(F). "This is by far the
highest operating temperature for an interband transition laser at
this wavelength," he explained. "We now have a device which works
with a compact thermoelectric cooler instead of a unwieldy
cryogenic system, and room temperature operation is just around the
corner."

The new laser is an optically-pumped InAs/GaInSb/AlInSb type-II
quantum well structure producing light at a wavelength of 4
microns. The device was fabricated from materials produced by SVEC
and then tested at the NRL. The NRL/SVEC team is now optimizing the
material growth and device design for diode lasers that can produce
sufficient power at 3-5 microns without cooling. Currently, SVEC
scientists are also testing a more advanced quantum- cascade laser
design, which should produce higher-intensity light with less
electric current, while emitting within either of two atmospheric
transmission windows at 3-5 microns and 8-12 microns.

Lasers emitting in these windows have many important industrial,
medical, and military applications, such as IR radar for vehicle
and air traffic control, medical diagnosis, eye-safe covert
illumination for night vision, free space communications, and IR
countermeasures.  Further, since many gases absorb strongly in
these windows, these lasers are ideal for remote chemical sensing.
This large class of applications includes pollution and greenhouse
gas monitoring, drug and explosives detection, chemical process
control, and leak detection.  The projected market for these IR
systems will approach $1.5 billion by 2001 if efficient and compact
IR sources are available.

The semiconductor lasers used in most consumer devices emit at much
shorter wavelengths. Long distance telephone networks use 1.3 and
1.5 micron lasers in their optical-fiber systems, and a 0.8 micron
beam reads music and data from CDs.  (By comparison, visible light
ranges from about 0.4 to 0.7 microns.) However, water vapor readily
absorbs light with wavelengths outside the atmospheric transmission
windows, restricting its range.  Gas lasers operating within the
windows are too bulky and expensive for most commercial
applications.

Photodetectors
Set a Record

A record low dark current operation of InGaAs (1.55 micron) p-I-n
Photodetectors on silicon and GaAs has been reported in Applied
Physics Letters.  The authors, led by  F. E. Ejeckan (School of
Electrical Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853;
email: felix@ee.cornell.edu), fabricated the photo conductors by
first bonding the p-I-n epitaxial layers, followed by chemical
removal of the host InP substrate from the p-I-n structure, after
which the photodetector was fabricated on top of the exposed p-I-n
layers.

Bonding of the photodetector to the substrate is done as efforts at
heteroepitaxial growth have not met with success due to the
inherent material defects present in devices grown by this method.
Bonding eliminates these material defects but the films often are
mechanically weak and thermally unstable.  The technique employed
by the authors of bonding by atomic rearrangement (BAR) avoids this
weakness and obtains a covalently bonded interface free of defects
other than crystallographic misfit.

Under 5 volt reverse bias, dark currents down to 57 pA on GaAs and
290 nA on Si were measured.  A external quantum efficiency of 80%
was deduced from the responsivity at 1.55 microns of 1 A/W, and the
series resistance across the bonded interface was 17 ohms for GaAs
and 350 ohms for Si.

Laser Ablation
of Diamond

Thin, electron-transparent layers of diamond for examination in the
transmission electron microscope (TEM) can be fabricated from
thicker diamond substrates by using a laser beam to ablate the
surface of the substrate according to work done at Caltech and the
Research Triangle Institute for NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab
(Pasadena, CA, Tel: 818/354-2240).  Those involved include Thomas
George, Marc C. Foote, Richard P. Vasquez, and Edward P. Fortier of
Caltech, and John B. Posthill of RTI.

An older method of laser ablation involved the use of photon energy
above the gap between the valence and conduction electron-energy
bands of the diamond substrate, but this method involves the use of
photon energy below the band gap.  The growing interest in the use
of diamond as a bulk substrate and as a coating material has
increased the need for TEM for characterization of diamond-based
materials.  The below-band-gap laser ablation method may help to
satisfy this need, and it could also be applied in general to
cutting and etching of diamonds.

The basic idea is that below-band-gap radiation should not be
absorbed in the bulk of the substrate.  As a result, damage to the
bulk of the substrate should be minimized and the major part of
absorption of radiant energy should take place on the surface on
which the laser beam impinges.  In experiments to test the
feasibility of the method, a pulsed, focused beam from a KrF
excimer laser was used to thin substrates of a type 1a natural
diamond at normal and glancing (22() incidence.  The laser
wavelength was 248 nm, whereas the band-gap wavelength of pure
natural diamond is about 226 nm.

The surfaces of the laser-thinned substrates were examined by use
of scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  The diamond substrates
thinned at glancing incidence could be examined in this way without
further treatment.  However, to render the substrate thinned at
normal incidence transparent to electrons, it was necessary to
perform argon-ion milling to remove a layer of graphitic and
amorphous carbon that had formed on the ablated surface.  (This
layer apparently forms early in the laser ablation process and
enhances the absorption of radiation at the surface).

feedback from this installation and subsequent beta sites, we are
now preparing to move toward product manufacturing," he said.

Aurora will provide OnTrack access to the growing market for CMP
polishing tools, which enable production of devices with multiple

Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI), the
global market for CMP polishers is projected to reach $290 million
by 1997, a more than threefold increase from $84 million in 1994.

Cutini added that the beta unit recipient is a CMP user with
extensive process knowledge.  "This customer will use the polisher
for pre-production research and development of advanced integrated
circuits,  The customer already has an installed base of OnTrak's
DSS-200 cleaning systems for post-CMP cleaning, which will be used
in conjunction with the Aurora polisher to obtain process and
manufacturing feedback," he noted.

OnTrak is a leading provider of semiconductor capital equipment for
CMP.  In a separate announcement, the company said it has relocated
to a larger facility in San Jose, CA (1010 Rincon Circle, 95131,
Tel: 408/577-1010, Fax: 408/952-5645) to accommodate demand for its
DSS-200 cleaning systems.

closely together to ensure that customers' requirements are met.
Both Ultratech and Photronics are known for forging strong
relationships with their customers.  This formalized agreement will
provide the vision and perspective necessary to pursue a unified
effort to address industry's demands."

Photronic's chairman and CEO Constantine "Deno" Macricostas added,
"Lithography technology has emerged as an important factor in
achieving success at the sub 0.35 micron level.  Now, more than
ever, it is important for equipment and photomask makers to work
together so that we are in a position to support our customers as
they begin to produce products with increasingly tighter design
rules."

In a separate announcement, Ultratech said it has teamed with
government and industry partners to develop a technology that could
produce ultra shallow transistor junctions for use in sub 0.25-
micron technology.  The proposed method is expected to reduce the
number of process steps currently used, potentially providing users
with a lower manufacturing cost.  The new technology is termed P-
GILD, an acronym for Projection-Gas Immersion Layer Doping, and
merges photolithography, doping and annealing technology into a
single tool.

Briefly Noted:

    DuPont has joined the Semiconductor Research Corp. (SRC) in a
research partnership focusing on Materials and Bulk Processes
Sciences, which deals with front-end manufacturing processes,
starting materials for mainstream integrated circuit fabrication
and thermal processes and deposition of active film above the
interface.  The partnership will also emphasize research in
Environment, Safety and Health Sciences.

    Lam Research (Fremont, CA) announced that Way Tu, 38, has been
appointed president, effective January 1, 1996.  Reporting to Roger
D. Emerick, chairman and CEO, Tu is chartered with overseeing the
daily operations of the company and ensuring that Emerick's vision
for Lam's future business operation is realized.  Most recently VP
of Lam's oxide etch business unit, Tu has been with the company
since 1983.

    3M Co. (Minneapolis, MN) has joined the Austin-based
SEMI/Sematech consortium of majority U.S.-owned and controlled
equipment, materials, software, and service suppliers to the
semiconductor industry.  And the 3M Electronics Div. has opened the
$43 million expansion of its Columbia, MO plant.

    Silicon Valley Group Inc., (San Jose, CA) has completed a
public offering of 3.5 million shares of common stock at
$32.75/share.  According to the company, the proceeds, estimated at
$109.7 million, will be used to buy capital equipment, expand
manufacturing facilities, and finance working capital requirements
and R&D activities.

    SEMATECH may establish a separate entity for the qualification
and characterization of 300-mm process tools.  Although the yet to
be named group will have more freedom to establish international
ties,  the top 10 Japanese semiconductor makers appear to want
membership instead in a new joint venture, tentatively named the
Semiconductor Equipment Evaluation Center.  While there is
excellent U.S.-Japanese cooperation on wafer standards and other
competitive matters, tool qualification is viewed as too sensitive
a topic to be shared between the two countries.

Tencor & Uniphase
Combine Technology

Tencor Instruments (Mountain View, CA) and Uniphase Corp. (San
Jose, CA), completed a three year agreement under which Tencor will
become the exclusive OEM reseller for the laser imaging defect
review station and automatic defect classification (ADC) software
developed and manufactured by the Ultrapointe subsidiary of
Uniphase.

These products are used to analyze defects on wafers during the
semiconductor manufacturing process.  Tencor designs and makes
wafer defect inspection and thin film measurement and metrology
systems used in the semiconductor and related industries.

The ability to review defects using ADC software is becoming
increasingly important to semiconductor manufacturers as it
facilitates defect classification without direct operator
evaluation at each defect site.  This facility improves reliability
and consistency by eliminating operator-induced variations.  This
kind of automation also helps speed analysis of the vast amounts of
defect data and classifications necessary for yield enhancement
programs.

There are several microscope technologies currently in use within
the semiconductor industry including white light, laser confocal
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  The Ultrapointe imaging
system uses a laser confocal microscope and Silicon Graphics
workstation to provide integrated 3-D images of defects on
semiconductor wafers.  These 3-D displays are similar to those
produced by an SEM but can be obtained at a considerable lower
cost.

The new agreement will not effect Tencor's ongoing efforts towards
completion of the ADC joint development project with SEMATECH, the
government/industry consortium semiconductor manufacturing
research, announced in early 1995.

New Defect Data
Management System

Tencor Instruments (Mountain View, CA; Tel: 408/654-2926)
introduced a defect data management system tradenamed SwiftAccess
that performs fast, in-line analysis of defect data from a variety
of sources, including the company's new Surfscan inspection system.

Identification of defects and their significance is becoming more
critical to the inspection process.  Although current inspection
systems generate large amounts of defect data, the info is only
valuable if device makers can use it to improve their manufacturing
process.  Therefore, they need a fast, reliable means of viewing,
analyzing and acting on the defect data generated during
inspection.  SwiftAccess is designed to meet this need.

The system collects and analyzes defect data as it is gathered from
inspection systems, scanning electron microscopes (SEMs), review
stations, and probe and test systems, and then uses the information
to monitor the process, identify process excursions and provide
critical process control information.  It can distribute data over
mulitple networked nodes, independent of the hardware platform, and
can collect data from the majority of inspection systems.

Designed for ease of use, SwiftAccess features an X-Windows
architecture and Unix operating system that enable smooth
integration into a fab's existing network.  The system offers high
reliability and robustness, as well as scalability for next
generation applications.

Every Aspect
of VCSELs

Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers, by Terence Edward Sale of
the U.K.-based University of Sheffield, covers the principles,
theory, design and operation of vertical cavity surface emitting
lasers (VCSELs).  Semiconductor lasers have advanced a long way
since their first demonstration in the early 1960s and have a large
impact on many devices today.

They act as sources for optical fiber systems and permit the
reading of data from compact discs and barcode labels.  VCSELs have
many advantages over conventional semiconductor lasers.  The most
obvious is the possibility of very large arrays and a narrow
circular output beam, which can be efficiently coupled into the
core of a fiber.  As a result, the author believes that the time
for a book devoted to VCSELs has come.

The first chapter of the volume describes the history and prospects
of VCSELs and the choice of material systems for emission in
different wavelengths.  The second chapter concerns the optical
properties of short vertical cavities, and the quantum mechanical
processes facilitating optical gain and spontaneous emission
processes are the focus of the third chapter.  Concepts are
developed from basic principles, and the effect of strain on the
optical processes in quantum wells is also covered.  Readers are
introduced to techniques for epitaxial crystal growth and the
fabrication of VCSEL devices in Chapter 4, and Chapter 5 explores
the resistance problems that can arise due to the many
heterojunctions in dielectric reflector stacks.

Chapters 6 and 7 are case studies which describe measurements made
on 2 VCSEL structures, one grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
and the other by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).
In Chapter 8, experimental data from these case studies are
analyzed using models, and the final chapter describes other
aspects of VCSELs such as modulation response, arrays and noise
performance.

The book does a good job of covering the VCSEL field and should be
of value to those experienced in the optics field, as well as to
novices and students.  Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers is
published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (605 Third Ave., New York, NY
10158; Tel: 212/850-6336). 1995.  Price: $89.95

'94 CTD cases continue trend, jump 10 percent
CTDs as a percent of all injuries and illnesses also increase.


Cumulative trauma disorders continued to ravage U.S. workplaces by
growing 10 percent in 1994, refuting predictions by private industry
that CTDs would slow or decrease.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in December "repeated
trauma" cases logged by private industry in 1994 totaled 332,000, up
from 302,400 in 1993. The BLS numbers are collected from the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration 200 logs, which employers
are required to complete when an injured or ill worker requires more
than cursory medical treatment.
Not only did the number of repeated trauma cases increase, but so did
their percentage of the overall injury and illnesses recorded by U.S.
business. CTDs now account for about 5 percent of the nation's 6.8
million nonfatal injuries and illnesses in 1994, up from 4.5 percent in
1993.
George Brogmus of Liberty Mutual Research Center for Safety and Health
had predicted the rate of increase for workplace CTDs would slow down or
decrease. His findings were based on Liberty Mutual numbers and BLS
statistics showing the CTD claims and CTDs cases as a percent of all
claims and cases.
"They aren't in the same pattern I reported," said Brogmus. "However,
the growth rate (the change from one year to the next) is still not as
high as it has been in previous years." 
Three-fifths of all the new repeated trauma cases come from the
manufacturing sector, according to the Survey of Occupational Injuries
and Illnesses, 1994. Meatpacking and knit underwear plants recorded the
highest incidence rates while motor vehicles and car bodies and poultry
slaughtering and processing logged the most repeated trauma cases.
(The incidence rate represents the number of injuries and illnesses per
100 full-time employees times 200,000.)  
Repeated trauma also accounted for nearly two-thirds of the workplace
illnesses. Skin diseases and disorders ranked second with 13 percent.
"We are gravely concerned about the growing number of new cases,"  said
Cheryl Bryne, OSHA's spokesperson. She would not speculate on what the
new numbers meant to the agency's attempt to produce an ergo standard.
Congressional conservatives have stymied attempts by OSHA to publish and
conduct research on a proposed ergonomics standard. This effort has been
part of an overall antiregulatory agenda that has been successful in the
House but mixed in the Senate.
In the spring, the BLS will release survey results detailing the
worker's occupation, nature of the injury or illness and how the injury
or illness happened.

Big, small firms show how ergo programs make cents
2nd 'Best Practices' issue stresses cost savings, CTD cuts


Now, more than ever, the efficacy of ergonomics and ergonomics programs
is being scrutinized by company presidents and financial officers.
Ergonomics efforts not showing measurable savings often are frozen or
cut.
As a result, practical information detailing ergonomics interventions,
costs and savings continues to be a commodity in high demand and the
basis for CTDNews' 2nd Annual Best Practices issue.
Once again, we chose the featured companies after surveying U.S. and
Canadian corporations, ergonomics consultants, labor organizations and
health and safety associations and researchers.
This year, CTDNews' ergonomics honor roll includes Ford Motor Co. of
Dearborn, MI; Charleston Forge of Boone, NC; Holloman Air Force Base
near Alamogordo, NM; and Avenor Inc. of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada.
The variety of problems addressed and savings realized should be useful
for an equal variety of businesses. Through these four companies, the
value of formalized ergonomics programs to homemade quick fixes
illustrates the impact of ergonomics on the workplace.
Each of these companies agreed to provide information about the genesis
of its ergonomics programs and the pitfalls they encountered while
implementing and maintaining the program. They also volunteered some
details on the health and safety costs of doing business.
While the thirst for program costs and savings is great, many companies
generally do not provide complete financial information for many
reasons, including fears that some details could be used against them in
workers' compensation lawsuits or that it would give their competitors
an advantage in the marketplace.
In any case, company officials quoted have agreed to share their
experiences and results with anyone interested in more information.
Telephone numbers are provided.

California expects heated debate over new ergo rule


Although the newly proposed California ergonomics standard is only 1 1/2
pages, there apparently is plenty to talk about as state officials
prepare for two public hearings later this month.
This is the second attempt at a standard since the state Occupational
Safety and Health Standards Board unanimously turned down Cal/OSHA's
proposal in November 1994. 
The new proposal would take effect when a musculoskeletal injury to more
than one employee has been "diagnosed and objectively identified" within
the last 12 months. Worksite evaluations, hazard control and training
are included in an ergonomics program.
The proposal also includes three simplified worksheets to assist in the
program's development.
Scaled down from the original 26-page proposal, the Standards Board's
effort will impact about 14,000 businesses. No financial impact was
given since "costs can vary widely and are dependent on the steps that
have already been taken to reduce repetitive motion injuries."
Public hearings for the first proposal drew more than 1,000 comments and
public demonstrations by organized labor. 
Hearings are scheduled for Jan. 18 at 9 a.m. at the Airport Marina
Resort Hotel in Los Angeles and Jan. 23 at 9 a.m. at the Sacramento
Convention Center.
-  For more about the hearings or proposal, contact the OSH Standards
Board at 916-322-3640.

Charleston Forge welds homemade approach


Charleston Forge doesn't have a textbook ergonomics program. However,
its approach works in reducing cumulative trauma disorders and in
increasing worker productivity without sacrificing the company's
finances.
By conducting basic workstation surveillance and consulting with local
medical and physical therapy experts, the manufacturer of decorative
home and office steel furniture dramatically reduced ergonomic-related
injuries  --  and increased workers' productivity and efficiency.
The firm's lost days from carpal tunnel syndrome, back strain and other
CTDs have been cut to zero this year, down from as many 176 lost
workdays in 1991.
"Some of the fixes, specifically equipment purchases, have been very
high dollar," said Jo Spiceland, Charleston Forge's human resources
director and safety and environmental compliance officer. "But, we
didn't make the changes just for ergonomics reasons. Increased
productivity played a major role."
Spiceland said the company's productivity increased by about 25 percent
in three years.
Charleston Forge of Boone, NC, employs about 150 people and is located
about 85 miles west of Winston-Salem. 
In manufacturing steel furniture, employees must carry, shape and cut
20-foot lengths of steel in various shapes and sizes, weld the pieces
into products and pull or carry the finished products that weigh as much
as 150 pounds to finishing, painting and the shipping area.

Carpal tunnel main CTD

Because of the fine and repetitive handwork involved in many of the
plant's jobs, Spiceland said carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis had
become serious problems. "The company's owner saw the inefficiencies of
the old (manufacturing) system and knew about the carpal tunnel problems
we were having.
"So the decision to make changes wasn't difficult," continued Spiceland.
"Also, money has not been a big roadblock due to the success of the
company. We knew we had to improve the process to decrease CTDs and to
increase productivity."
In addition, many workers throughout the plants have suffered back
strains from handling the products.
The problem-solving approach in the early 1990s included encouraging the
"buddy system," according to Spiceland. Employees were told not to lift
anything beyond their capability. Limited job rotation was used. The
company also provided back belts to interested employees, conditional
upon the worker attending a seminar on proper body mechanics and lifting
techniques. Spiceland said back belts are rarely used now.
With cases of CTDs and lost workdays due to CTDs failing to decline,
Charleston Forge enlisted the help of a local physical therapist and
loss-control representatives from the company's workers' compensation
insurance carrier. After several walk-through visits, they recommended
fixes for specific jobs.

Changes start in 1993

"In 1993, we began to make specific fixes, without really forming a
formal program," said Spiceland, who spends only about 10 percent of her
time addressing ergonomics concerns. "We were a small company with
managers wearing many hats. A formal program will come, but there
haven't been the human resources or time available to devote to it yet."
Spiceland said her knowledge of job evaluation came from seminars and
from becoming familiar with OSHA's proposed ergonomics standard.
The finishing area was one of the first to be fixed. For example, once a
baker's shelf made of steel has been welded together, employees with
pneumatic wire brushes removed burn marks and welding splashes and then
washed the product. At one point, 25 people spent eight hours a day
wire-brushing and washing them.
The risk of carpal tunnel and tendinitis has since been eliminated by
automating the process through the purchase of an enclosed shotblaster
machine, which is similar to a sand blaster, to polish the steel. The
company also purchased an automatic washing system. Now, only three
people spend two hours a day brushing. Exposures to carpal tunnel
syndrome and back injuries (from awkward postures) were greatly reduced.
Also, in this and other areas in the plant, improved lighting placement
and brightness has decreased many of the awkward postures required to
inspect and brush the products. These combined to greatly reduce
exposures to CTS and back injuries.
Spiceland said automating this part of the process did not cause the
company to lay off anyone. Instead, these employees now operate the
washing and shotblaster machines or work in other departments.
The consulting physical therapist also targeted the welding operation.
Employees placed parts in a fixed jig or template for each of the
company's products. Many workers had to stretch, turn and assume awkward
positions to place all the parts into the jig and then remove them after
welding.
As a result, Charleston Forge made many of the jigs adjustable. Some
tilt to make the product easier to remove. This change reduced many of
the back problems for the company's 20 welders. Even though workers use
a handheld welder, Spiceland says it has not posed any problems because
it is light and without vibration.
"The welders were purchased before we had a real awareness of CTDs. We
were just fortunate that the welders had these features," Spiceland
said.
Ergonomic changes, aside from the shotblaster and washing systems, have
cost the company about $3,500. This includes the training and purchase
of back belts and labor and materials for jig adjustments and lighting
improvements.

Problems still present

While the company has made significant gains in many areas, others such
as packaging and moving the product out the door still pose challenges.
The product is pulled along the floor to several stations by hand. There
are no wheels on any of the products. 
Currently, employees lift the products into cardboard boxes and those
boxes are then moved to trucks by way of hand trucks.
The physical therapists and physicians, who provided their ergonomics
consultations free of charge, have recommended the company buy hoists to
eliminate the problem. But, Spiceland said, the cost for hoists is
prohibitive because of the large area involved.
Instead, they're trying a less costly approach. "We tried a
propane-powered shrink wrap system that would have reduced the amount of
lifting involved in packing our products. However, the results were
disappointing.
"Shrink wrapping slowed our packaging time from about 1 1/2 minutes per
item to almost seven minutes," Spiceland said. "We're experimenting with
other interventions now."
Spiceland said the company also has the capabilities to make a lot of
tooling, and tends to look to homemade solutions.

Informal problem solving

She uses an informal team approach to resolving problem jobs.
Spiceland, an engineer, the employees and supervisor put their heads
together when the need arises to come up with the interventions.
Charleston Forge's approach is even more unique because employees
undergo almost no ergonomics training. But, Spiceland admitted, when the
company added another shift in 1994 and hired about 40 new workers, "We
learned the hard way that we didn't do enough training and supervision,
and we're paying for it in workers' compensation premiums."
The company is developing a thorough training program for supervisors
and employees of which ergonomics and basic safety will be major
components.
For small companies wanting to encourage a healthier and more productive
workforce, Spiceland strongly recommends developing a working
relationship with local health professionals and utilizing their
expertise. 
Because the physical therapists and physicians were local health
professionals, they already were aware of Charleston Forge. Their
services had been used numerous times to treat workers' compensation
injuries.
"I simply asked them if they could help us reduce our CTD risk. I didn't
really ask for anything beyond specific interventions," said Spiceland.
"When I approached our local health professionals, they were eager to
share their knowledge and experience to improve our workers' health and
comfort," she said.

Ford: Where quality, ergonomics combine
Automaker's program suited for even small,financially strapped companies


There's a recurring theme in the occupational safety and health
community: larger companies  --  like Ford Motor Co.  --  are more successful
at eliminating workplace CTDs than many smaller companies with limited
resources.
With billions in resources, unfortunately, "bigger doesn't mean better,"
according to Bradley S. Joseph, Ph.D., a Ford corporate ergonomist. 
"As a practice, we cannot throw resources and people at a problem. We
believe in transferring technology and information to people who can use
it best. Smaller companies can do the same," said Joseph, whose company
has spent about $35 million in industrial ergonomics interventions in 60
manufacturing and assembly plants since 1990.
Despite what Ford is spending on ergonomics interventions, the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics reports motor vehicles, car bodies and
vehicle part and accessories record the most "repetitive trauma" cases.
Instead, Ford's size requires considerable advanced preparation for a
standardized ergonomics program for all of its U.S., Canadian and
Mexican plants. This strategy   --  including devoting considerable
resources to planning and recordkeeping  --  has its long-term rewards.

Commitment the key

"Much of an ergonomics program's success is based on the plant's
commitment  --  everyone from the plant manager down to hourly workers,"
said Joseph. "Without the time and effort to determine who you are and
what you want to do, the results cannot be as good."
By that, Joseph means securing the support of management and labor to
ensure the ergonomics program's and committee's legitimacy. If the top
officials from both sides cannot be full-time committee members, then
invite them to all meetings, ask for their help and let them be the
first to hear about successes.
Beyond the management and labor commitment, Joseph emphasized the
importance of making the ergonomics process inclusive and plantwide.
"A program is likely to be more successful if the ergonomics process is
a team effort. Don't outsource (the ergonomics decision making) to third
parties like consultants or put it into the hands of a plant ergonomist
only. This focuses the responsibility on an individual, not a team,"
said Joseph.
But what about the small company that doesn't have the expertise or
money to hire an ergonomist to help with the program?
"Some of the best programs are run by people without traditional, formal
ergonomics and health and safety knowledge. They know  --  better than me  -- 
how the plant works," Joseph said. "But they do need training, knowledge
of ergonomics and to know when to seek help." 
Ford's ergonomics process, developed by the United Auto Workers-Ford
National Joint Committee of Health and Safety and the University of
Michigan, recommends an ergonomics committee of eight people  --  four each
from labor and management. These members receive basic training in
ergonomics principles, techniques for job evaluation, recordkeeping and
monitoring and refining the process.
Once assembled, the committee members must write a mission statement to
ensure each member understands the goal(s) and has the same purpose. In
addition, the ergonomics process guide also recommends committee members
be released from regular assignments to attend ergonomics committee
meetings and accomplish tasks. There should be meeting agendas and
minutes to emphasize the work's importance.
(See "Making the mission possible" on this page for key elements to a
mission statement.)

Not just costs

"Money is very important for plant operations. Cost-benefit analysis
must be used to justify changes," said Joseph. "Ergonomics can be
implemented using traditional cost benefits. But you have to balance it
with the social aspects of health and safety and what's correct to do."
On average, the committee solves 20-30 ergonomics problems a year. Of
the 60 plants the company currently is tracking, about 7,200
ergonomics-related problems have been fixed since 1990  --  1,067 between
January and June 1995.   
Standardized recordkeeping includes detailed ergonomics concerns logs,
intervention tracking and follow-up worksheets. Joseph said, "We don't
want one plant to differ greatly from another even though they are
hundreds of miles apart."
(See examples of Ford's worksheets)
"That way if one Taurus assembly plant is having a workstation problem
on the assembly line, they could check with another Taurus plant to see
if its ergonomics concern logs showed a similar problem and how it was
resolved," continued Joseph.
 Ford's preparation is illustrated best at its new Cleveland engine
plant. Eighteen months ago, the company finished rebuilding an engine
assembly plant designed with ergonomics in mind.
For example, the local committee designed machine tools to allow easy
access to metal cutting blades. Articulating arms were added when the
machines were designed to eliminate exposure to extended reaches and
back and shoulder stress.
Another example was installing a roller conveyor system to bring parts
closer to operators. The new system eliminated lifting and carrying of
parts.
To date, there have been no ergonomics-related injuries. The local
ergonomics committee has responded to four concerns logged in the first
six months of 1995 and spent about $17,000.

Benefits of proactive changes

Compare those numbers to Ford's other Cleveland engine plant, where
changes have been made to the existing assembly processes. The logs show
seven concerns, costing about $200,000 over the same time period. This
shows how much more cost effective it is to make change during the
planning stages.
Although the company has dramatically reduced its cost for ergonomics
intervention in the modern plant by being proactive, problems still
exist. Joseph said the local ergonomics committee is responding to them.
The committee is examining how workers install spark plug and
distributor wires. Workers are exposed to repetitive, high-force pinches
with awkward wrist postures. The company has joined forces with the
University of South Florida to resolve the problem. 
But few companies have the wherewithal to gut factories and redesign
manufacturing processes. For those, Ford often has relied on homemade
solutions. In the Sharonville Transmission Plant in Sharonville, OH,
employees were having to carry a 35-pound clutch about 10 steps to the
assembly line and insert it into the transmission housing. They also
were required to walk back to parts bins and pick up several other
components to be installed in the housing.
Outside equipment vendors recommended hoists or articulating arms, but
because the clutch mechanism easily separated, it really had to be
installed by hand.

Homemade remedy

As a result, the local ergonomics committee developed a portable
workstation on wheels that would carry all the parts  --  for more than one
transmission  --  on a tray with rollers and Lazy Susans. The workers then
would bring all the transmission components to the assembly line and
avoid the repetitive lifting and walking back and forth.
The company also has utilized plastic part kits in the assembly process
to reduce excessive reaching, bending and turning. At Ford's Van Dyke
Plant in Sterling Heights, MI, transmissions move through some of the
assembly process on a pallet with these plastic kits  --  which hold about
20 parts  --  atop the assembly fixture. The kits are made of molded
plastic so each part is separated  --  like the plastic packing in a
multipart child's toy  --  and easy to reach. Workers no longer turn around
and reach for parts in bins behind them.
In addition, to make the assembly process more comfortable, the assembly
line was raised about nine inches and a composite floor of recycled
tires was installed to provide cushion and relieve strain and stress on
the back.
At some Ford plants, the decision to change a job depends on analysis of
existing data, informal reports from workers or proactive
identification. For example, workers' compensation costs and lost work
time are calculated for specific health hazards and then multiplied by
four to cover any hidden costs.
"Many times, that number is more than the cost of the change and is
approved," said Joseph. "Other changes are harder to justify and other
methods of analysis or justification may be required."
Ford's accomplishments are attributed to the partnership between labor
and management and the preparation and experience of the local
ergonomics committee, according to Joseph.
The keys to building a similar process are not proprietary information.
Indeed, Joseph said, "There's no need for other companies  --  big or small
 --  to try and reinvent the wheel."

Holloman's effort defies expectations


Defying a perception that the federal government can do nothing
inexpensively, Holloman Air Force Base has successfully implemented
ergonomics changes on a shoestring budget.
The changes, instituted over two years, dramatically cut the number of
CTD-related injuries through assessments, job modifications, some new
equipment and training.
"The administrative and engineering changes represent the 'gold
standard' OSHA was looking for," said Major Alan Berg, commander of the
49th Aerospace Medicine Squadron and base ergonomics manager. "We got
rid of our injuries and showed that the civilian industry doesn't have
to worry quite as much" about the prospects of an ergonomics standard.
The improvements started after Holloman Air Force Base, near Alamogordo,
NM, was inspected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
in August 1992. An employee reported the base to OSHA. Four months
later, Berg and the base received a 22-page citation under the general
duty clause and an order to fix a variety of ergonomic hazards within
one year.
The base employs over 6,000 military and civilian personnel in support
of the F-117A "Stealth" aircraft and associated training requirements.
The shop inspected by OSHA performs survival equipment maintenance,
sewing operations and parachute packing. Parachutes were either for
personnel, aircraft braking systems (drag chutes) or heavy equipment
(drone chutes), which can be up to 120 feet in diameter and weigh over
150 pounds.
In the parachute shop, OSHA noted ergonomics hazards related to
inadequate lighting, poorly designed workstations and awkward, forceful
body positioning affecting the back and arms. Specifically, OSHA focused
on tasks that required excessive lifting, bending and repetitive arm
motions.
"Over a four-year period (1990-1993), we had 15 people with confirmed
CTD cases. And the shop employs only 25," said Berg. "These were not
weak or small people. At one point (spring of 1993), 11 out of 19 people
were on limited duty because they couldn't do the more stressful jobs."
But more than just fixing the one shop that OSHA had inspected, Berg
wanted to be proactive and develop a program that would address
ergonomic stresses throughout the base.
"To address all those problems and set up a base-wide ergonomics
program, I needed more than a year," Berg told CTDNews. "OSHA agreed to
postpone the deadline so long as the base was pursuing a comprehensive
ergonomics program."

Where to find help

Without a national ergonomics standard, Berg found the assistance and
direction to create an ergonomics program from OSHA's "Guidelines for
Establishing Ergonomics Programs in Meatpacking Plants." "I had no
problem convincing my superiors that we needed to make changes," Berg
quipped. "I just used the four-letter word, O-S-H-A."  
Seriously, he added, "When I showed them the impact of ergonomic
problems in this one shop, I received full support from the commander on
down to the workers to make changes happen."
So in 1992, Holloman established an ergonomics committee to identify
workplace ergonomics stresses from injury logs, evaluate high-risk work
areas and prevent future injuries. The committee consists of
representatives from civil engineering, aerospace medicine, maintenance,
ground safety and others.
It operates with no annual budget, but used safety and health promotion
funds to purchase literature and video training programs. Actual
improvements in the shop, including tool purchases, came out of the
shop's operating funds.
Focusing first on the parachute shop, Berg set into motion a series of
workplace changes that would reduce dramatically the CTD-related
injuries. Many of the interventions in the shop's sewing operation were
basic and low cost.

Basic, low-cost changes

Traditional scissors were replaced with spring-loaded models to reduce
some repetitive motion. Electric scissors that cut through five layers
of the heaviest fabric were purchased to reduce repetitions. Sewing
tables and table edges were padded. Task lighting was provided with
adjustable arm desk lamps. And to address OSHA's recommendation to
provide adjustable table heights, Berg directed that tables be raised to
accommodate taller workers and that inexpensive, plastic stair-step
platforms be bought to make the job easier for shorter workers. 
Storage space was moved from underneath work tables to separate shelving
units, eliminating some bending and lifting.  To reduce lifting and
hauling, they relocated some packing operations closer to where the
chutes are stored. Electric lift tables with wheels were added to permit
easier movement of parachutes and to eliminate the vertical component of
lifts and carries.
Electric hoists replaced a hand-over-hand pulley operation used to hang
wet parachutes in a drying tower. Workers had been experiencing shoulder
and back discomfort that was totally eliminated by the mechanization of
the job. 
Yet, the actual chute repacking remains Berg's most daunting
intervention. Employees with steel bats weighing over 20 pounds must
repeatedly pound the folded chute into its container. A worker took
about 45 minutes to pack a single chute, with the entire shop packing
about 500 per week. With the limited duty of many shop workers, the
remaining workers had to pack as many as 50 in a week.
Attempts at reducing the pounding operations included pneumatic tools
and complex overhead suspension systems. But efforts either damaged the
parachute material or failed to pack it properly. Job rotation was
nearly impossible with the limited number of workers physically able to
perform the packing operation.
With no real alternative to the packing process, Berg decided to reduce
the workload and convinced supervisors to limit the employees to packing
no more than 20 per week.  
Additional parachutes were purchased to buffer the need to repack them
quickly during surge flying operations. The workers also found relief as
a change in aircraft landing procedures halved the number of drag chutes
used. The shop now packs about 250 chutes per month.
Berg hasn't given up on the idea of mechanizing the pounding operation
which he calls, "ergonomic enemy number one." However, with the packing
limit, he now has all but one worker returned to full duty.
Considering that some of these workers had performed these jobs for over
twenty years, many of them were resistant to the changes. Some claimed
the changes would make the job harder. "But I asked them to go along
with the changes for two weeks," said Berg, "after which the workers had
the option to go back to the old way. But they liked the new ways, once
they got used to them, and reported less leg and back soreness at the
end of the workday." 
The changes in the parachute shop cost about $25,000. 
The Holloman Ergonomics Working Group's program includes an educational
component to teach workers that awkward posture plus forceful
repetitions equals risk of CTDs.

A positive message 

"The message was delivered in settings that encouraged worker
participation," said Berg. "And once trained, we found that the workers
who know their job best are the greatest resource for simple ways to
improve the workplace."
The training takes two to three hours and focuses on giving workers the
ability to identify ergonomic stresses in their workplaces, share their
findings with their supervisors, and work together to fix them
themselves. High- and moderate-risk workers are required to attend the
training, but it is open to all base personnel.
Supervisors can request the Holloman Ergonomics Working Group to visit
their shop to help in assessing and resolving ergonomically stressful
jobs.
The base program also includes an occupational medicine program to
monitor workers in high-risk jobs. Workers are examined at least
annually by a physical therapist who can suggest ways to modify how
workers do their jobs and can develop individualized exercise programs
to build up a worker's strength.
For the parachute shop, active-duty military personnel are mandated and
civilians are invited to participate in an exercise program as part of
their duty day.
"The biggest concern in U.S. business and industry is that an ergonomics
standard will close businesses," said Berg. "I tell people that ideal
ergonomic solutions come when you don't think of Fred Flintstone with a
hammer and chisel, but instead you think of George Jetson, whose total
job is to a push a button.
"But it could cost millions," continued Berg, "to totally mechanize a
workplace, so the goal is to find reasonable solutions in a
cost-effective manner."
Other ergonomics problems addressed around the base included letting
each of the base telephone operators pick out ergonomically designed
seating and giving aircraft maintenance workers sit/stand workstations
and adjustable chairs.
In all, Holloman AFB spent about $50,000 to implement its program over
three years, according to Berg.  As a result of these efforts, the base
dramatically reduced its CTD exposure. An unexpected benefit was a
series of certificates from the U.S. Department of Labor acknowledging
it for valuable contributions in the promotion of occupational safety
and health programs in the field of ergonomics.

Avenor's fitness a warm-up to ergonomics


Avenor Inc. sees its 10-year-old employee fitness programs as the
important warm-up to its newer ergonomics campaign. The two work in
concert, much the way cardiovascular exercise goes with a stronger and
healthier heart.
The results: The pulp and paper mill in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada,
reduced direct costs of injuries, including workplace CTDs, by 94
percent, when the ergonomics improvements began.
 The fitness program has involved an on-site fitness facility, daily
warm-up exercises, employee fitness challenges between divisions,
exercise rehabilitation and special educational efforts. While the
ergonomics improvements have meant substantial educational efforts, job
modification and workstation adjustments have been picking up momentum
since 1992.
The fitness center, which is attached to the plant's health center to
facilitate referrals, includes a universal weight machine, free weights
and exercise bikes. 

The ergonomics evolution

"The fitness program evolved into ergonomics because we needed to. You
can only get so much benefit out of increasing employee resistance to
wear and tear until you have to reduce the load of the job and help
employees work smarter, not harder," said Francis Puchalski,
kinesiologist for Avenor. 
Avenor, which was named the safest mill by the Canadian Pulp and Paper
Association last year, employs about 1,500 people who produce newsprint,
magazine stock and tissues from wood chips. It also converts recycled
paper into a variety of products.
One of the company's ergonomics successes involves the recycle
warehouse, where injuries to wrists and elbows were a concern. In the
area where large bails of recycled paper are loaded off trucks,
employees have to cut off heavy wire wrappings with bolt cutters, pull
the wire off the bails and use a fork truck to push the paper onto
conveyor belts.
The wire wrappings were of various hardness and strength, so the number
of repetitions and the amount of stress the hand absorbed varied.  In
the fall of 1993, according to Puchalski, the wrist and elbow problems
had reached a "virtual epidemic."
About 20 percent of the 20 employees were reporting CTD-related symptoms
while many others were experiencing pain but not reporting it. 
The employees and supervisors pointed to the bolt cutters as the main
problem. However,  further analysis quickly revealed that it was the
required firm gripping and pulling of the wires, often in difficult
positions, that was the more serious issue. The wire wrapping also got
caught on the bails and transferred the sudden stop force to the
employee's hand, wrist, elbow shoulder and back.
As a result, Puchalski and his colleagues instituted a number of
actions:
-  Education sessions covering CTD issues and avoiding awkward postures
were held at the worksite.
-  On-site interviews and job analysis were conducted.
-  The work process was reviewed and some modifications were made.
-  Suppliers of the recycled paper bails were encouraged to reduce the
number of wires per bale and some were able to accommodate the request.
-  Different cutting systems and fully automated bail handling systems
were investigated.
-  The bolt cutter handles were padded.
-  Upper limb range of motion and strengthening exercises were
recommended.
-  Wrist supports with palm padding were made available to interested
employees.
 In a six-month follow-up to the interventions in the recycle warehouse,
surveys and worker and supervisor interviews showed that the issue of
wrist and elbow problems was gone, according to Puchalski. To date,
there have been no additional CTD-related claims.
In the pulp and paper industry, there are plenty of physical jobs in the
maintenance department, which is responsible for keeping the pulp and
paper machines  --  some old and new  --  in good running order. Like many
manufacturing industries, back problems have been an issue over the
years. In the last few years, more safety and educational efforts have
been yielding good results, according to Puchalski.

Attention to back injuries

Morning exercises, fitness initiatives and extensive educational efforts
within the department have gone a long way toward reducing the number of
back injuries. Providing better lifting devices, increased training on
equipment use and better body mechanics as well as ensuring that all
employees know they are responsible to get help when necessary have
contributed to the improved situation.
Maintenance employees used to work on the three large paper machines.
Now, workers are assigned one machine in order to become familiar with
its operation and quirks.
Machine maintenance occurs at specific intervals and for a limited time.
Workers often must assume awkward positions to replace parts in confined
spaces. In dealing with the older paper machine, some of the risk
exposures cannot be designed out of the job. Therefore, Avenor's program
emphasizes ongoing training and education to work better and smarter in
restricted conditions.
The maintenance department also has developed a successful job-approach
program that reminds employees of nine different questions to ask
themselves each time they approach a job.
Not all of Avenor's efforts have been reactive. "We try to be proactive.
If we are aware of some changes coming to an operation, we will try to
get in there to make some recommendations," Puchalski said.

Getting in on the design

Avenor currently is building the latest, state-of the-art control room
for one of its pulp operations. The employees assigned will be operating
digesters, bleach plants and a chemical plant on VDTs in an office-like
environment.
Puchalski, along with an optometrist, made recommendations on the screen
size, icon and warning signal coloring on screens, location and type of
display units, data entry tools and workstation layout. They recommended
trackballs over mice, a C-shaped workstation large enough to seat two
people and quality adjustable ergonomics chairs. Color and eye acuity
testing will be an ongoing program.
There also have been some discussions regarding an exercise bike in the
control room and a satellite wellness center to help with employee
alertness, fitness and exercise maintenance.
Puchalski would not reveal the cost of the new control room.

When to investigate jobs

Signals to investigate jobs for ergonomics risks come from a variety of
sources, including employees, supervisors and the on-site nurse. But the
decision to pursue ergonomic changes rests with department heads.
"Our company has moved to a business division style of operation, and
occupational health and safety is increasingly looked at as a service
provider to these divisions," said Puchalski. "If we are involved in
recommendations for an exercise program or ergonomic changes, the OK
must come from division heads."
Employee education and training also is determined by the department.
While everyone receives instruction in occupational health and safety,
employees in jobs where there are higher CTD risks get more information
on ergonomics, injury prevention and self-management. 
Puchalski said the company also is considering a more formalized
ergonomics program, including more employee training and creating a
mill-wide ergonomics team to do job analysis and interventions.
So far, said Puchalski, "Senior management has been supportive of all
our efforts to help employees, including the budgeting to expand the
on-site fitness facility."
Ten years ago, Avenor Inc.'s chief executive officer wanted to do
something to help employees with back injuries. He decided to provide a
fitness center. Over the years, said Puchalski, it has become more
apparent that employee wellness and ongoing safety efforts including
ergonomics have much to offer to provide the workplace with the
healthiest employees.

Mass General Pharmacy Slashes Zofran Costs,  May Drop Drug From Its
Formulary


To Harold Demonaco, pharmacy director for Massachusetts General Hospital,
there's no real question that Glaxo's Zofran (odansetron) effectively
combats the nausea associated with chemotherapy. But it's such a good drug
with so few side effects that oncologists have been prescribing it for
almost every cancer patient in the hospital since its introduction in 1991.
And that's busted Demonaco's pharmacy budget.

In fiscal 1993, Mass General spent $900,000 on Zofran, making it the
costliest item in its medicine cabinet. Facing a potential outlay of $1.4
million in FY94, Demonaco took action.

First, he and his staff sat down with the oncologists and hematologists who
typically prescribe the anti-emetic and showed them that there were less
expensive, equally effective drugs available.

Next, they focused on getting doctors to use an appropriate amount of the
drug.  Most patients were getting between 30 and 40 mg a day, which
wasn't very cost-effective because the drug came in a 30-mg vial.

Mass General did its own studies and determined that anything beyond 24 mg
a day would not create any additional response. In late 1993, Demonaco
issued guidelines calling for a 24-mg daily dosage.

Since the dose is being cut by almost a quarter, Demonaco predicts that
Mass General's Zofran expense should be equally reduced -- savings of
about $250,000.  That's impressive, but costs may come down even further.
A competitor has hit the market, and is making things attractive enough
that Mass General is "seriously considering dropping Zofran from the
formulary," says Demonaco.

SmithKline Beecham's anti-emetic drug Kytril (granisetron) was launched in
late March. Demonaco says that according to Mass General's reading of the
data, "these two drugs are exactly equal."

However, Glaxo disagrees that the two drugs are the same, and has refused
to enter into a contract with Mass General. SmithKline, however, is
offering a discount.  Although Demonaco won't divulge that price, he says
the hospital expects a 50 percent reduction in costs for each chemo
patient.

PBM Mania Erupts


As fashionable as cafe lattes, pharmacy benefit management firms (PBMs)
have become the rage among drug manufacturers looking to expand market
share and pharmaceutical distributors hoping to add to their service line-
up. In the last six months, the sector's been abuzz as new PBMs were
created and many were bought by or entered into strategic alliances with
drug makers.

Witnessed so far: Cigna buying a PBM; the drugstore chain Rite Aid forming
a PBM; the National Assn. of Chain Drug Stores forming its own PBM; and
Caremark allying with three major drug makers. Last week, two more drug
makers took the plunge. For details, see the story below and other stories
on page 4.

Diversified To Go Global With SmithKline


Following in the footsteps of Pfizer, Merck, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, and
Bristol-Myers Squibb, SmithKline Beecham has marched into the pharmacy
benefit management arena in the hopes of gaining market share for its
products in the short term and steering R&D in the long term. SmithKline
says it will pay $2.3 billion for Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, in a
move that will more closely emulate the Merck-Medco merger than strategic
alliances favored by the other drug makers getting into the area.

For Diversified, a pioneer in the management of drug costs and in the
outcomes research area, the link with a global drug manufacturer gives it
the opportunity to offer its expertise worldwide, says Diversified
President Henry Blissenbach.  SmithKline "has a real appetite to see if the
[pharmacy management] concept is applicable in Europe," says Diversified
COO Terry Wills. In fact, DPS and SmithKline have already gotten started on
that project. Blissenbach sees the deal as having long term strategic reach
-- in gaining new clients and strengthening the sales and marketing of
SmithKline and Diversified products and services, and in managing the
overall cost of disease.

Diversified, a division of the HMO United Healthcare, currently manages
pharmacy benefits for 11 million people and has a 30,000-pharmacy
network; its clients -- the majority being United-owned HMOs and other
managed care entities -- spent about $2 billion in 1993 on drugs.
SmithKline had sales of about $6 billion in 1994, half from
pharmaceuticals. The firm is also a player in the generic field.

NO DRAWBACK SEEN

Many see selling out to a drug company as a competitive disadvantage, but
Blissenbach disagrees. Even though he was among those initially warning
about the conflict a Merck-Medco merger entailed, he says "we did not gain
one client because they left Medco because of the arrangement with Merck."
In fact, in a DPS survey of employee benefits managers, the firm found that
most didn't know that Merck owned Medco; once they found out, most were
pleased to know that Medco could draw on Merck's assets and R&D know-how,
says Blissenbach.

Now he's a believer that it is possible to be owned by a drug maker and
still give the client the best deal. However, Blissenbach does say that
drug makers are using the acquisitions to buy market share. "Merck
purchased Medco and SmithKline [bought] us for our ability to market
pharmaceuticals.  They fully expect us to market SmithKline drugs in
preference to others when everything's equivalent," says Blissenbach.

But that conflict is not as troublesome as it might appear; in reality SKB
only makes about 5 percent of the drugs currently on the DPS formulary.
"There's an enormous amount of drugs that are needed to put a competitive
formulary on the street," says Wills. "It's foolish to think we'd push them
off in favor of SKB products." He also notes that DPS has no control over
its HMO clients' formulary committees.

ACCESS TO HMO DATA

The HMO element will be key in the SmithKline/DPS deal; SmithKline will
have exclusive access to medical data of the 1.6 million members of United
HMOs. DPS already has the ability to link the information from the HMO
medical claims to the HMO pharmacy claims. In that way, DPS can tell
SmithKline what impact its drug therapy has on cutting the cost of
hospitalization or other treatment.

The two will also pursue outcomes research and disease management.
Blissenbach thinks that no PBM will turn away a chance to work with non-
affiliated or non-owner drug makers, and he says that DPS will work with
others. But he thinks that PBMs will be extra attentive to owners or
partners. "There will be very preferred and less preferred -- that's where
you'll see different formulary concessions and different research
priorities," he says.

However, until the dust settles from all the earthshaking activities in the
drug sector, it will be hard to tell where everyone stands exactly.
That's okay with DPS. "A deal like this is made looking futuristically,"
says Blissenbach. But, he adds jokingly, "the "future" in this business
is only two or three years."

Risk Sharing a Tough Proposition, Says Fallon Exec


Many drug companies say they want to help large drug buyers keep costs down
through risk-sharing contracts, but at least one HMO executive says that
hasn't worked for his health plan. According to P. David Jarry, MD,
clinical director of pharmacy for the Fallon Clinic, his HMO has been
approached numerous times by pharmaceutical companies to enter into
capitated contracts or other risk-sharing agreements. There have been lots
of negotiations, but no one's ever signed on the dotted line, he says.

Fallon is one of the more innovative HMOs in the country. With 165,000
enrollees, a 483-bed hospital, and 23 clinic locations, the Worcester MA-
based HMO doesn't have a huge nationwide presence but is often cited as an
example of what the future will look like. Fallon is a perfect lab for
contractual arrangements. As a group model HMO, its physicians are
employees, which gives it a lot more control over its doctors' prescribing.
It also uses a closed formulary and buys directly from drug makers.

Explaining Fallon's inability to come to terms with any drug companies,
Jarry cites terminology as a major stumbling block; everyone's definition
of capitation is different, he says. Drug makers have approached Fallon
with deals to give Fallon a price for a drug based on the number of HMO
enrollees and the expected use by that population. Or they have suggested
"capitating" an entire therapeutic class. The idea is that both parties
would reap savings for lower-than-expected utilization and conversely
would pay a penalty for higher-than-anticipated utilization.

But, Jarry says, "with a changing market, people are reluctant to commit to
price or volume for any long period of time." From the purchaser's point of
view, "for this to work you have to have some kind of time factor that's
reasonable." A short term contract doesn't give the HMO time to analyze or
adjust utilization.

For now, Jarry says, "I don't think we'll see good capitation arrangements
too quickly because there are so many variables that have to be worked
out." In the meantime, he expects buyers and sellers to "stick to the old
standards": direct discounting, rebates, bundling, direct buying, and use
of generics.

Turf War Brewing Over Federal Role In Cost-Effectiveness Data


Action in Congress on the health reform plan may create a turf battle over
which federal agency should dispense quality and cost information on drugs,
medical devices, and procedures. In its health reform mark-up, the House
Commerce Committee is likely to propose an expanded federal role in
planning, assessing, and implementing guidelines. Chairman John Dingell (D-
MI) is likely to include a bid by Rep. Ron Wyden (D-OR) that would give
more power to the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR).
Dingell is also considering a proposal by four outcomes gurus that would
create a new federal agency for quality, panel sources said last week.

Wyden's bill would steal a lot of FDA's fire by having AHCPR or some other
federal agency set national research priorities and give prior approval for
cost-effectiveness studies. The bill also would expressly limit FDA's power
to regulate cost-effectiveness claims made by manufacturers in advertising.

An even more aggressive agenda is being pushed by RAND's Robert Brook, MD,
Dartmouth's John Wennberg, MD, Duke's David Eddy, MD, and Harvard's Paul
Cleary.  In late April, they outlined for congressional staffers what one
attendee called an "FDA for guidelines." Under the policy, the new agency
would identify wasteful spending and establish national clinical trials.

FDA staffers however, are bristling at the notion that their agency can't
be the source of outcomes and effectiveness data for the public since it is
likely to begin getting that from manufacturers who will submit it
with applications for FDA approval on devices and drugs.

A Hopes To Develop Cost-Effectiveness Policy by Year's End


While drug makers use more and more cost-effectiveness claims in
advertisements for their products, FDA is still struggling to develop
guidelines on the use of such data in promotions. Drug makers often claim
their products cut hospitalization days or reduce need for additional
therapy, but usually the claims are based on comparisons to placebos, not
other drugs in the class. For now, such claims will continue to be reviewed
on an ad hoc basis, say FDA staffers.

FDA has put on hold its plans to hire an economist to help develop cost-
effectiveness claims guidelines. Drug advertising division people say they
have talked to some outside experts, but "our scheduling needs and
expectations didn't jibe with theirs." So agency personnel will write the
guidelines themselves; they hope to have a preliminary policy in place by
year's end.

That doesn't mean there won't be a lot of "outside input," the agency
notes.  FDA staffers have been meeting and talking to many interested
groups -- drug manufacturers, managed care representatives, and others.
Officials have also attended conferences and industry meetings and held
small seminars at which experts in the field presented information.

FDA is finding itself in the midst of a storm of confusion over who can
give out what information to whom in the cost-effectiveness arena.

At a recent meeting of the National Health Lawyers Assn., an attorney
warned that FDA may be considering regulation of the pharmaceutical
information disseminated by HMO pharmacy & therapeutics committees to
their doctors. The information often makes superiority claims for one
therapy in a class over another.  However, an agency official says, "We
haven't even been talking about this internally." But, he says, if drug
companies prepare the material for distribution to HMO doctors -- in
particular if it mentions unapproved uses of the drug -- "we would look at
it."

Value Health and Pfizer Alliance: A Powerful Attack on the Outcomes Front


While other drug companies talk about developing outcomes studies and
treatment guidelines in their alliances or acquisitions of pharmacy benefit
companies, Pfizer hopes to be acting. Hooking up with Value Health will let
Pfizer take the short cut, says ValueRx president and COO Steve Linehan
(see profile). The ability to have cost-effective data in hand and to
eventually manage the cost of disease will be the key to thriving long term
in the drug industry.

The Pfizer deal with Value Health has several components: ValueRx will
aggressively promote Pfizer products on its formulary in exchange for
discounts; Value Health Sciences, a pioneer in outcomes research and
guidelines, will develop such data on Pfizer products; and Value Health and
Pfizer will set up a $100 million joint venture to manage care in certain
disease states.

Value Health has long been respected in utilization management, outcomes
research, pharmacy benefits management, and managed care for mental
health.

Other PBMs, such as Caremark or Medco, while having sophisticated data
collection capabilities, do not have lengthy experience in developing
treatment protocols, says Linehan. That gives his company, and Pfizer, an
edge, he claims.

Linehan says ValueRx has another edge in that it, unlike DPS and Medco,
won't be owned by a drug company. ValueRx will aggressively push Pfizer
drugs to its clients but only where and when it is appropriate, he says,
adding that ValueRx is likely to ally with several drug makers.

ValueRx isn't alone in trying to forge multiple alliances, as many see it
as the best way to guarantee the drug buyer that it will get the widest
selection of pharmaceuticals at the best cost and with the best range of
value-added services.  But Linehan says that "it will require finesse to
put together a multiple alliance of manufacturers."

Pfizer, for its part, is satisfied with partnerships, as it has also struck
one with Caremark. "Acquiring a PBM is a huge cash outlay," says a Pfizer
spokesman.  "We think our strategy allows us to be very flexible; it's a
highly complex, fluid marketplace, and if it does change tomorrow we're
in a better position."

FoxMeyer Aims To Play With the Big PBM Boys


FoxMeyer Corp., which claims to be the nation's fourth largest
pharmaceutical distributor, is beefing up its PBM operations, with a buy of
Scrip Card Enterprises, a Salt Lake City firm that has managed prescription
benefits for small to medium-sized employers. Pharmacies that participate
in Scrip Card will get a complete marketing package that they can present
to the managed care buyer that includes competitive prices, generics, and
utilization review, says FoxMeyer VP Bob Davis.

Also in April, FoxMeyer launched FoxCare Network, aimed at giving the
company's 4,500 independent pharmacy customers wider exposure to managed
care. The network, says Davis, will also let pharmacists use "the medical
outcomes management programs developed for [FoxMeyer's] existing pharmacy
benefit management company, Health Care Pharmacy Providers." No mail order
services are planned for FoxCare, but it may be provided through Scrip
Card. FoxMeyer will offer its help free to pharmacists, but hopes to get
more pharmacists to buy more drugs from FoxMeyer.  "I can assure you we'll
be more supportive of those who buy from us," Davis says.

Caremark To Add Fourth to Alliance


A few weeks ago, drug makers struck their first blow against the Merck-
Medco powerhouse, when several teamed up with Caremark's Prescription
Service division.  In the war to maintain and gain market share, drug
makers have come to realize that prescription drug management firms can be
potent allies. "Our goal with Caremark is to become a bigger player faster
in this emerging health care arena," says a spokesman for Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer, one of Caremark's partners.

Caremark, which covers 28 million people through its pharmacy management
programs, has also snagged Pfizer and an unnamed company assumed to be
Bristol-Myers Squibb, and says it is about to announce an alliance with a
fourth drug maker.

In the short term, Caremark will have an incentive to shift market share to
partners' drugs, says Caremark Prescription Service corporate VP Kris
Gibney.  Caremark will give partners' products preferential treatment on
its formulary in exchange for discounts. The more lives switched and the
greater market share gained, the better pricing Caremark gets, says Gibney.
Long term, the goal is to steer data on patient utilization and outcomes
back to the partners.  The Caremark partners will have exclusive access to
Caremark information.  Caremark has just hired former MediQual CEO John
Kordash to head information strategy.  Caremark will also collaborate with
its drug partners on developing treatment guidelines. Eventually, Caremark
will offer capitated arrangements, but Gibney says that the deals are so
complex that none have been successfully put together yet. Caremark will
rely on drug companies to supply educational material and guidance on
therapy and, most importantly, financial backing. But the firm will
continue to act as the middleman -- the "Chinese Wall," as Gibney likes to
say -- between employers and the drug maker. Caremark, like other PBMs,
will profit from that arrangement.

Makers and Shakers --
ValueRx's Stephen Linehan:  Putting Politics To Work


Being the head of the nation's third largest drug benefits management
company has its headaches, but it beats being a small-town politician. At
least that's what Stephen Linehan, president and COO of ValueRx, has
concluded now that he's taken a stab at both. With $300 million in sales
and 500 clients, ValueRx has Linehan racking up the frequent flyer miles
and constantly chatting on the cellular phone. Linehan, who was named to
run ValueRx's day-to-day operations in November 1993, has no regrets about
ending his foray into politics. In fact, his experience should come in
handy when it comes to implementing ValueRx's goals, which include
brokering strategic alliances with drug makers.

In the late 1970s, Linehan was on the board of aldermen in Lake Saint Louis
MO.  At first he was content in that role, but like every politician, he
thought he could do a better job than the guy in office. He won his race
for mayor his first time out in 1980, and stayed in for a second term.

Looking back, he can't point to any major disappointments in his mayoral
career, and unlike many short term politicians he doesn't harbor much
bitterness over the experience. He proudly notes that while mayor, he
helped bring the town its first hospital and helped settle a lawsuit that
paved the way for more growth in the community. But he eventually decided
that "over the long run I'd rather be successful in business than in
politics."

Armed with undergraduate and graduate degrees in business administration,
he moved in 1985 to MetLife Health Care Networks, where he became CEO.
After five years with MetLife, he spent a year as senior VP for Managed
Care at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kentucky. Then, in early 1991, he
moved to Value Health's American PsychManagement unit in Washington DC.

When Value Health merged American PsychManagement with another provider,
Preferred Health Care, Linehan was offered the presidency at Bloomfield
Hills MI-based ValueRx. He was happy to move away from the politics-
infested DC area. Value Health, based in Avon CT, is a pioneer in the
management of mental health and substance abuse costs, workers' comp costs,
and in the field of outcomes research through its Value Health Sciences
unit. However, the company was initially built around ValueRx, which was
established in 1985. By 1990, ValueRx accounted for 70 percent of the
firm's revenues, says Alex. Brown managed care analyst Eleanor Kerns.

But in the interest of diversification -- thereby cutting risk for
investors -- Value Health has expanded and continues to expand into other
businesses.  Kerns gives the firm high marks for lowering its exposure on
the prescription drug side. But ValueRx still accounted for a little more
than half Value Health's revenues in 1993.

A Perfect Fit

Despite Linehan's lack of direct experience in the prescription drug
management area, he feels that his background in managing health plans and
mental health care costs prepared him well for dealing with pharmaceutical
cost containment.  As a managed care executive trying to hold down
expenditures, "typically, there were two costs that stuck out -- mental
health and prescription drug benefits." That meant that he had to "become
expert in those areas," says Linehan.

At American PsychManagement, he was given the opportunity to hone his
skills at managing the tricky area of psychiatric care and substance abuse
treatment. Large self-insured employers and insurers came to American
Psychanagement expecting to see costs in those areas reduced. Linehan and
his crew delivered. According to Value Health, while Linehan was in charge,
revenues at American PsychManagement grew from $30 million in 1990 to $90
million when he left in late 1993. Also under his tenure, Value Health
successfully negotiated a merger with another huge player in the field,
Preferred Health Care Ltd.

Linehan says that demand for prescription drug management carve-out
programs is being driven by the same dynamic that led to contracting for
mental health benefits management. Purchasers "want more cost-efficiency
and better care," he says. Already familiar with that desire, Linehan
thinks it will be short work to apply the lessons he learned at American
Psych to helping ValueRx clients.

Riding the Crest

Linehan is taking over at a time of explosive growth for the drug benefits
management industry. Once, there were only a few major players: Medco was
the king of mail order, United Healthcare's Diversified Pharmaceutical
Services was tops in the HMO sector, and ValueRx was among the leaders in
contracting with Fortune 500 self-insured employers. Drug costs were an
annoyance, but not enough of a concern for many employers to spend the
money on a separate benefits management program. But the demand for such
services has grown as drug costs have risen, leading to a vastly changed
marketplace.

There are hundreds of players now, from small private firms to subsidiaries
of HMOs to wholesaler-owned benefits managers. Even Rite Aid, a chain
drugstore, has thrown its hat into the ring. Now, with drug costs in the
news and employers getting more accustomed to hiring experts to help in
problem areas, drug benefits management has become trendy, if not
essential. Not all benefits managers will survive; consolidation has hit
health services and will soon make its mark on the drug benefits management
sector.

Making A Mark

It will be Linehan's job to assert ValueRx's role as a full-service
provider and ensure that it grabs a leadership position in this
increasingly sophisticated market.

ValueRx itself has been growing by leaps and bounds. In 1991, Value Health
bought a drug benefit management and a mail-order company, and added more
management businesses in 1993. Revenues skyrocketed in the ValueRx division
from $177 million in 1992 to $364 million in 1993. Clients include Allied
Signal, American Express, Federal Express, Rockwell, Tenneco, and United
Technologies. In August 1993, the firm won a contract from the state of New
York to manage the benefits of 700,000 employees, retirees, and dependents.

One of ValueRx's biggest coups so far was winning a contract for
Ford/United Auto Worker employees in January. Medco and PCS also had been
bidding on the contract, which covers 275,000 workers, retirees, and
dependents. ValueRx expects the deal to add about $90 million a year in
revenues.

As part of the contract, ValueRX will develop a formulary, offer concurrent
and retroactive drug utilization review and profiling of physician
prescribing patterns. The Ford pharmacy network is closed -- meaning
workers can only go to the designated pharmacies. More importantly, Ford
will be the first major employer that has signed a capitated agreement with
ValueRx. "We're delighted to have their business," says Linehan, who calls
the contract a "win-win for us, Ford, and the UAW."

However, ValueRx will assume a great deal of risk. The firm assured Ford
the auto maker would only be liable for fixed costs involved in delivering
pharmaceuticals and managing the use of drugs to the workers. The downside
for ValueRx: It will have to absorb any overutilization or variability in
drug pricing.

Linehn says the way to beat that is through strategic alliances with drug
makers, such as the one it just signed with Pfizer. And ValueRx will be
working directly with Ford and UAW on getting workers to be better
educated drug consumers.  "Ford's not just interested in controlling costs
for the three-year agreement, but extending it into the future," says
Linehan, who adds that ValueRx is "doing what we can to ensure quality and
to work together to contain costs. The recognition is that they're not just
dumping off risk; it's all three parties working together."

Focus on Outcomes and Alliances

As Linehan well knows, the future of prescription benefit management is
entangled with the interests of drug manufacturers. Thus, ValueRx, like
many other PBMs, is focusing on developing its data and outcomes research
capabilities.

Although he still thinks there's a lot of ground to be gained with the many
employers and payers that still do not carve out drug benefits, once they
are under a plan, those payers are going to want to see continuous
improvement in their savings, says Linehan. The key to eking out further
savings will be effective alliances with drug makers.

ValueRx, however, will only strike deals with drug makers if it can
maintain control, says Linehan. "We feel we have to represent employers'
interest first because they're the ones paying the tab," he says, noting
that Merck's ownership of Medco has created the concern among buyers that
the focus for Medco will be to push Merck therapies.

And he says that it will be hard to give clients a full range of
therapeutic options if the company is owned by one drug maker. ValueRx
will forge alliances with several drug makers "and get the best drug
available for the person at the most cost-effective rate," says Linehan.
"No drug should be dispensed or prescription switched or changed unless the
data supports that it will be equal or better in terms of results for
patients."

Another important aspect of benefits management will be outcomes research,
and Linehan sees ValueRx as uniquely positioned for that job. Value Health
has two units that are intimately involved in outcomes research; ValueRx
will draw upon that expertise. "There's a real potential to demonstrate
that drug therapy delivered at the right amount and the right time will
save in medical expenditures," says Linehan. But even he admits that it
will take some convincing of clients.

"You have to work with an employer and tell them that spending an extra $5
million this year could save $20 million in other expenses." ValueRx hopes
to have the research in the future to do the convincing. But it will still
likely need some financial help from drug makers, says Linehan. He sees
ValueRx doing outcomes research in partnership with employer customers and
drug makers. The goal is to position ValueRx as the quality expert. Then,
"as the marketplace evolves, it should get us more business," says Linehan.

It will definitely take a politician's instincts to balance the competing
interests of drug maker, drug buyer, and drug benefits manager. Steve
Linehan's experience should help him navigate these tricky and untested
waters.--Alicia Ault Barnett, editor.

The Drug Industry Puts on a Kinder, Gentler Face


Covering up Armani suits with lab coats, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Assn.  (PMA) hopes to change its image with a new name and a new mission
that emphasizes its role as developer of "90 percent" of the drugs that
come to market. PMA will now be known as PhRMA -- the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America.  "The public relations spin is very
direct," PhRMA president Gerald Mossinghoff told executives attending the
association's annual meeting May 2. Outgoing PMA chairman William Steere
(chairman and CEO of Pfizer) spelled it out: "Our mission is research. It
is the defining characteristic of our industry."

The unveiling of the new improved trade group followed months of internal
soul searching driven by a failure to convince Congress, the Clintons, and
the public that drug firms aren't money-grubbing price gougers. Although
new PhRMA chairman Sheldon Gilgore (chairman and CEO of Searle) said that
PMA had made some strides in improving the industry's image, it wasn't
enough.  A year ago, said Gilgore, "we were a demonized industry"; today,
"we are less demonized."

PMA hired McKinsey & Co. to help the trade group become a better lobbyist
for its 100 member companies and win more points in the health reform
debate. Now the group will focus mainly on lobbying against price
controls, rebates, and other threats to profits. PhRMA has also hired
former Pfizer Washington office head and Glaxo exec Stephen Conafay to be
its new superlobbyist.

However, PhRMA still has an uphill battle convincing the federal government
that price controls are not necessary and large drug buyers that
manufacturers are ready to negotiate on price. The association's new
image was bolstered by holding its meeting at a staid Washington DC
hotel, not a lavish tropical resort. But Gilgore was seen getting into a
limo after a press conference.

Merck Wants Medicare Action -- If There Is Any


Trying to get in on the ground floor of a Medicare prescription drug
benefit, Merck sent a proposal to HHS and the White House last week
suggesting that the government allow private pharmacy benefits management
firms to use their tactics to control expenditures and quality for the
feds. However, it's not even certain that a Medicare drug benefit will
survive the grueling beating the Clinton health reform plan is taking on
Capitol Hill.

Under Merck's plan, Medicare would select up to three PBMs per region,
through competitive bidding, to manage drugs costs and quality for Medi-
care beneficiaries. Surprisingly, Merck advocates an "open" pharmacy
network; allowing any pharmacist who meets the terms to participate. Its
Medco business has used closed, exclusive networks.

So far, competitors haven't weighed in on Merck's proposal, but one says
that on the surface, "anything that applies the principle of competition
and private industry to government is good."

Salable


o FDA has cleared Bristol-Myers Squibb's Taxol (paclitaxel) for treatment
of breast cancer following failure of chemotherapy for metastatic disease
or a relapse within six months of chemo. Bristol claims that since the drug
can be administered in an outpatient setting that "this can eliminate the
need for an overnight hospital stay, resulting in greater convenience to
cancer patients, and potential cost savings to the health care system." The
drug was approved last December for ovarian cancer not responsive to
initial chemo.

o Prozac may get FDA's okay for a new indication, which should drive
formulary managers mad. The widely-used antidepressant has gotten an FDA
advisory panel's okay to treat bulimia.

o Adding another notch in its belt, Coumadin (crystalline warfarin sodium)
can now be used to prevent and treat blood clots associated with artificial
heart valve replacement. Clinical trial data collected from 1967 to 1990
show that "long term oral anticoagulation therapy significantly reduced the
incidence of thromboembolism" in heart valve patients, says the drug's
maker Dupont Merck.  However, the benefits need to be weighed against the
risk of bleeding, says a company press release.

o Minneapolis-based MGI Pharma launches its Salagen tablets for treating
radiation-induced dry mouth in head and neck cancer patients. The firm will
be handling its own sales and marketing, initially targeting doctors,
nurses, and hospital-based dentists. The factory price to wholesalers is
$89.50 per 100; patients should expect to pay between $2.68 and $3 a day,
says the firm.

o Pfizer will start immediately marketing Glucotrol XL, a once-daily oral
drug to control blood sugar levels in diabetics. Pfizer says the single-
dose regimen should "markedly increase patient compliance" and that "strict
control of blood sugar levels may delay the onset of eye, kidney, or nerve
complications of diabetes."

o A new generic form of Ativan is available. Schein Pharmaceuticals has
received FDA approval of its ANDA for lorazepam injection.

Notable

o Prayers for a cheaper alternative to the expensive H2 antagonists are
about to be answered -- and the war for the billions spent on them has
begun.  Mylan Labs, in conjunction with Eli Lilly, is set to begin
marketing the first generic form of SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet
(cimetidine). Tagamet is losing its patent exclusivity on May 17; Mylan's
generic goes out the door May 18. Mylan will sell to wholesalers and Lilly
to managed care at about 30 percent off the brand name price. Lilly will
seek risk-sharing or capitated arrangements and will help develop ulcer
treatment guidelines. More generics are expected before year's end, and
some formulary managers suspect they haven't heard the last from Glaxo;
that firm will probably weigh in with some offer to maintain its virtual
dominance of the H2 class.

o Kodak bucks the merger and acquisition trend in the pharmaceutical field.
The company announced last week that it will sell its Sterling Winthrop
drug unit.

o A coalition of hospitals, insurers, HMOs, and other drug buyers,
including Kaiser, United Healthcare, and Premier Hospitals Alliance calling
themselves the "Coalition of Health Care Providers Concerned About Rising
Drug Costs," wrote to Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) May 3 seeking to ax the
Health Security Act provision that would extend equal discounts to all drug
buyers. The provision has been seen as a political favor to pharmacists,
but the coalition said that if approved, manufacturers "are likely to
respond by limiting discounts to all purchasers."

o Initial results from the AHCPR-funded five-year Stroke Prevention Patient
Outcomes Research Team (PORT) study being conducted by researchers at Duke
Medical Center found that the cost of stroke is closer to $30 billion a
year than previous estimates of $15-20 billion. The study also uncovered
huge regional variations in cost and success of treatment.

o With five new products, Merck's West Point Pharma now offers generics
that account for 20 percent of a typical drugstore's dollar volume in
generics.  The new products: alprazolam, carbidopa/levodopa, gamfibrozil,
ketoprofen, and naproxen. The products will be made by "several leading
generic manufacturers" and sold under the West Point label.

Roche's Syntex Buy Will
Raise Outcomes Profile


With its impending acquisition of Syntex, Roche will gain greater entree
into the world of outcomes research, where Syntex is acknowledged as one of
the leaders.  The firm has been using outcomes to determine whether to
continue clinical trials on its own products for the last several years.
But Syntex's relatively paltry pipeline and the fact that most of its major
drugs are facing generic competition has made it an acquisition candidate
for those same several years.

Roche is paying $5.3 billion, or $24 a share, for the Palo Alto CA-based
drug concern.  That's a 57 percent premium over Syntex's closing stock
price the last trading day before the announcement, but seems small when
compared to the billions being tossed around to acquire pharmacy benefit
management firms that have no R&D capability.

The Syntex buy is another example of the consolidation trend in the drug
sector as manufacturers look for ways to streamline operations in the wake
of declining profits.  If Syntex shareholders tender a majority of their
stock and vote to approve the deal, Roche will become the fourth largest
drug company in the world.  Syntex will gain a presence win South America,
Japan and the Middle East.  Roche gains not only Syntex's outcomes
expertise but its strong marketing organization, which has successfully
built a franchise around the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories Naprosyn (A
$700 million drug), Anaprox, and Toradol.

To hang on to Naprosyn sales, Syntex formed a generic unit, Hamilton
Pharma; it also recently got FDA approval to take Naprosyn over-the-
counter.

EUROPEAN APPROVAL TIMES LEAVE US LAGGING BEHIND

BRUSSELS - A study on European approval times for medical technology
has revealed that patients in the US wait up to three times as long as
their European counterparts for government approval of new medical
devices.

The study, conducted by Medical Technology Consultants Europe Ltd
(MTCE, Brussels), found that higher-risk, breakthrough medical devices
were approved in European Union (EU) within 80-120 days, provided the
manufacturer passed a European Union facility inspection (which is
completed within 120 days).  The study also found that new lower-risk
devices entered the European market with no delay once a manufacturer
passed the initial facility inspection.  Similar devices take an
average of 178 days to be approved in the US.

One reason for the speedier approvals, noted the study, is the number
of authorised bodies that can carry out the approval procedure.  "The
approval procedures are carried out by a number of authorised
certifying bodies spread throughout Europe, rather than the one
authority in the US [the Food and Drug Administration]." MTCE said that
there are 35 third-party organisations, known as authorised bodies to
carry out the approval procedures for medical devices throughout the
EU.

Point of contention

This is a particular point of contention, with the US Food and Drug
Administration.  In testimony before the US Congress, FDA commissioner
David Kessler recently criticised key provisions in FDA reform
legislation allowing third parties to take part in the review process.
However, US device manufacturers are citing the European study's
findings as additional proof that FDA reform is essential.

Maurice Freeman, MTCE's principal and a former European Commission
medical device official, said, in a statement prepared for the US
Senate Committee on Labour and Human Resources (which has jurisdiction
on FDA reform legislation), "Many patients who benefit from the
applications of such new devices in Europe would have [under US
approval times] either not received the benefits from the use of such
devices or in many cases would have died."

The FDA takes four times as long to approve breakthrough medical
devices than is allowed by US statute, according to the Health Industry
Manufacturers Association (HIMA - the US trade group for medical device
and diagnostic manufacturers).  HIMA says the approval times for these
devices have nearly doubled since 1990 and; the FDA's record on
approving incremental improvements to existing devices is similar, with
approval times also nearly doubling since 1990.

"Manufacturers simply aren't as eager to research and develop devices
in the US knowing that they'll face these egregious delays," said HIMA
president Alan Magazine.  "It's a double whammy - the patients wait for
devices stuck in the FDA's pipeline, and manufacturers have little
incentive to bring new devices into that pipeline in the first place."

The difference between the US and EU review process for medical devices
is not a matter of safety, Mr Freeman said.  "The European route is
extremely rigid in its requirement for the manufacturer to provide
suitable evidence as to the development process, to verify the design
by comprehensive review process and to manufacture under controlled
conditions," he added.  The current EU review process for breakthrough
medical devices was implemented in 1992.

Both the American and European systems contain sound elements that are
essential in protecting public health, notes HIMA.  "We are aware of no
study that shows that medical devices on the market in Europe are less
safe than those in the US," Mr Magazine said.

According to another recent study conducted by The Wilkerson Group, a
New York-based independent consulting firm, FDA delays in approving
devices will lead to the loss of US jobs to nations where approval
processes are more streamlined - an estimated 50,000 over the next five
years.  Governments in the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and elsewhere
have already begun to highlight the impediment of FDA regulatory delay
in their marketing materials to attract US businesses overseas.

IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC DIRECTIVE CLEARS EP FIRST READING

STRASBOURG - European Union (EU) proposals to extend legislation on the
sale and use of medical devices to in vitro diagnostic equipment
cleared its first reading in the European Parliament on 12 March.
However, the assembly's endorsement was heavily qualified by 50
amendments, many of which were accepted by Industry Commissioner Martin
Bangemann.

Among the key issues that emerged were compulsory use of "local"
language - resisted by industry - and whether the EU should operate a
central data bank to aid monitoring.  Ethical aspects of devices using
human substances were another area of concern, with several speakers
calling for these to be dealt with under separate procedures.

Commissioner Bangemann said he was prepared to take on board 47 of the
78 amendments originally tabled, although a dozen involved linguistic
problems and were not put to the vote.  Among the accepted amendments
were those concerned with safety, protection and quality.  There were
accepted provisions concerning incidence reporting and use of a data
base for medical devices on the market.  One change placed the
Commission in the reporting loop with member states and may mean a
possible role in decisions to withdraw problematic devices.
Commissioner Bangemann also accepted an amendment making it clear that
the Directive would not affect "national laws which provide for the
supply of diagnostic medical devices and products by a medical
prescription".

Accepted amendments also clarified definitions and made wording
changes, such as "clinical laboratories" being called "medical analysis
laboratories".  In those provisions that pertained to human tissues and
substances produced from such tissue, the word "cells" was added.
Additionally, "packaging" was added to items that discussed standards
of design and manufacture.

Much of the debate centred on those amendments that the Commissioner
was not prepared to accept.  Chief among these were language and
labelling concerns.

Labelling could involve major costs

On use of languages, Commissioner Bangemann accepted it would normally
be self-evident that the language of the country of intended sale
should be used.  "However, in this specific case, this is not so
logical because 95 per cent of these products are for use by experts,
people who as a general rule are familiar with two or three languages
used in medicine.  It's not just a matter of labelling but also
handbooks and software, which are becoming increasingly important in
the use of these devices.  Therefore, it would involve major costs,
particularly in the case of smaller member states," he said.

Producers in smaller states, seeking to release their products on the
single market would be forced to have information translated into the
11 principal languages used in the 15 EU member states.  Commissioner
Bangemann insisted that the proposals would not preclude member states
from introducing a rule to that effect for its own producers.  However,
the Commission was prepared to re-examine the idea if it attracted
support in the Council of Ministers.  The original text of Article 4(3)
provides that member states may require information to be provided "in
their national language(s) or in other Community language(s) to the
extent that it is needed for safe and correct use of the device".

He also rejected Scottish Nationalist member Mrs Winnie Ewing's
(successful) Amendment 71, which would add "reagents and reagent
products of biological origin for the diagnosis of genetic diseases,
the detection and dosage of tumorous markers and the dosage of
hormones" to the Directive's annex listing of reagents and reagent
products for which conformity assessment procedures would be required.

In the Commission draft, this listing is limited to blood grouping and
detection of markers of HIV infection, Hepatitis B and C.  The
Commissioner also said he would be prepared to revisit this question.

As drafted, the Directives will cover reagents, instruments and
equipment for examining tissues or substances from the human body for
medical purposes and would include kits for conducting pregnancy or
cholesterol tests.  Currently subject to national rules, these devices
will have to comply with EU safety requirements before being marketed.

Time schedules complicated

The time schedules involved are complicated: the Directive will become
law 20 days after publication of the final, definitive text.  But
member states will have to allow continued marketing of devices
complying with current, national rules for a period of four years after
that act of final adoption.  Meanwhile, member states will then have to
transpose the Directive's requirements into national law by April 1998.

The proposals now go to the Council of Ministers, so that the 15 EU
member state governments can agree their own "common position" on the
proposals from the European Commission.

Rapporteur for the assembly's committee on industrial policy, French
parliamentarian Alain Pompidou, himself a professor of medicine, noted
that the legislation was a follow-up to two medical device directives
dating from 1990 and 1993.

Like several other speakers, Prof Pompidou was uneasy about the "hands-
off" approach followed by the Commission.

Procedures leaving quality control as a matter for manufacturers might
be justified for instruments using stable materials and electronic
circuits.  Prof Pompidou said the use of diagnostic medical devices
involved two major problems: stability of biological reagents, in the
case of 35 per cent of devices using immunological or other type
reagents, and the "potentially dramatic and tragic consequences of
diagnostic errors".

Arguing the case for EU monitoring and a requirement for defective
equipment to be recalled, Prof Pompidou said procedures had to be put
in place to identify and react to problems.  He described amendments
covering use of local language as "superfluous as far as health
professionals were concerned, but vitally important for self-testing
kits".

While Commissioner Bangemann was not prepared to go along with calls
for a full-blown, centralised EU monitoring system, he indicated that
the Commission might be prepared to adopt some points from milder
amendments.

Pending creation of a central EU database to which national authorities
would have access, transitional arrangements might entail manufacturers
being required to make notifications not just to the authorities of
their "home" state, but also to those of each member state targeted for
sales.

He also accepted that states should be under a duty to monitor
continuously devices and "take all necessary steps to ensure that
devices may be placed on the market and put into service only if they
comply with the requirements laid down in this Directive when properly
supplied, installed, maintained and used in accordance with their
intended purpose".

GRACE MERGES NMC WITH FRESENIUS REJECTING BAXTER'S $3.8 MILLION BID

DEERFIELD, IL - Baxter International has withdrawn its $3.8 billion bid
for Waltham, Massachusetts-based National Medical Care (NMC), WR Grace
and Co's dialysis services unit.  Baxter's bid for the business was
recently rejected by Grace, which favours the merger of NMC with the
dialysis products business of Fresenius AG (Germany), though the door
through which Baxter could have waved an increased bid was never firmly
closed.

Under the agreement, NMC will make a $2.3 billion payment to Grace
(Boca Raton, Florida), whose shareholders will get a 44.8 per cent
holding in the company, Fresenius Medical Care.  Fresenius USA, the
German group's US business (which manufactures and distributes products
for treating renal failure), will become a subsidiary of Fresenius
Medical Care, with the new company based in Germany and operating its
US business out of Waltham.  NMC, which operates 549 outpatient kidney
dialysis treatment clinics in the US and 75 abroad, plans to borrow
$2.3 billion for the transaction.

The deal should be complete by the third quarter of 1996, and will
result in the formation of possibly the largest integrated kidney
dialysis company achieving 1996 sales estimated at around $3.5 billion.
 The agreement will net Grace an equity gain of $700 million, a
significant portion of which it hopes to use to purchase as much as 20
per cent of its common stock.  Fresenius Medical Care is expected to be
traded publicly on the New York and European stock exchanges.

The withdrawal of Baxter's offer ends analyst speculation about whether
the company would raise its bid, especially considering the formidable
competitive strength of a Fresenius-NMC merger.  Baxter, however,
believes the impact on its own renal business will be limited.  Even
so, Baxter remains confused by Grace's flat rejection of what it
considered a "fair" offer and was reluctant to sit and negotiate
further.

Baxter had been in discussions with Grace since December 1995, and
stands by its bid to buy out NMC (the $3.8 billion deal would have
involved a straight $2 billion payment to Grace and a $1.8 billion in
Baxter common stock).

Early in February Baxter made its offer public, a move widely agreed to
represent a forceful invitation to push Grace into formal negotiations.

Baxter's chief executive, Vernon Louks, described the bid in a letter
to Grace counterpart, Albert Costello, as "substantially more
favourable to the Grace shareholders than the Fresenius proposal." He
added: "We will not increase our offer...since Grace management
continues to refuse to discuss our proposal and has determined to go
forward with the Fresenius transaction, we hereby withdraw our
proposal."

Last year, Baxter, with annual sales of $10 billion overall, including
$1.3 billion from its kidney therapy products, announced its intention
to split the company by spinning off its hospital supply division.  The
"new Baxter", essentially its medical specialities operations (with
annual sales of about $5 billion), includes its renal business.  If the
acquisition of NMC had gone Baxter's way, it was expected to have
diluted earnings by less than 5 per cent in the first year, and started
to add to earnings after about 18 months.

WR Grace, with interests lying foremost in specialty chemicals,
originally proposed to spin-off the NMC business to stockholders late
last year, after rejecting a $3.5 billion takeover bid for NMC by the
unit's chairman, Constantine Hampers (who will stay with the company if
the merger goes ahead).  Plans were delayed, however, by US federal
investigations into NMC's billing practices.

Fresenius will assume NMC's legal obligations

As part of the merger deal, Fresenius will assume all of NMC's legal
obligations from on-going government investigations.  The company is
the subject of three federal investigations.  Most recently, The New
York Times reported, the company received a letter from the US
Attorney's office in New Jersey stating that NMC was the target of a
New Jersey grand jury investigation.

Meanwhile, a separate inquiry into contracts between NMC's dialysis
subsidiaries and physician supply and service companies is underway by
a grand jury in Virginia.  Moreover, a US attorney in Massachusetts has
issued five subpoenas for NMC records in connection with an
investigation into a number of management, employee and accounting
practices.

NMC's three divisions achieved sales of $2.1 billion overall last year;
divided between its dialysis services division, providing outpatient
and inpatient hospital dialysis services ($1.5 billion), its homecare
division, offering home treatment services ($327 million), and its
medical products group, which manufactures dialysis products ($300
million).  The world market for dialysis products is estimated to be
$3.1 billion, with the major players being Baxter (holding 42 per cent
of the market), Fresenius AG (13 per cent), and Gambro AG (32 per
cent).

Meanwhile, Baxter recently opened its second medical products factory,
Eurovac Ltd, in Malta to manufacture CRD flex suction canisters.  The
company expects the plant to export 3.7 million units, valued at $3.4
million.  during its first year of operation, primarily to Germany and
Italy.

SMITH & NEPHEW PROFITS UP IN 1995

LONDON - Healthcare group Smith & Nephew Plc (S&N) announced pre-tax
profit before exceptional items up by 5 per cent to #180.4 million
($275.7 million) for the year to 31 December 1995.  Exceptional charges
of #14.6 million stemming from the integration of acquisitions were
largely offset by #11 million in gains from disposals.Turnover
increased from #965 million to #1.02 billion despite much tougher
market conditions, including pressures on healthcare budgets worldwide.

Chairman Eric Kinder said: "We do not expect any easing of the
difficult market conditions in North America, but further improvement
in Europe is likely together with continued progress in the Far East."

Turnover rose from #173.1 million to #186.1 million in Africa, Asia and
Australia.  With a rapid increase in sales for the second half of the
year, Asia and Japan experienced particularly strong growth at 30 per
cent and 25 per cent respectively.  Sales in the UK grew by 12 per cent
to #175 million, attributable to the establishment of a single sales
force for healthcare products which generated substantial orders from
the National Health Service, combined with a strong performance from
the consumer healthcare sector.  In Continental Europe, sales expanded
by 8 per cent to #230.3 million; the markets in France and Spain had
recovered in the second half of the year, while S&N was beginning to
build a stronger position in Germany.

In North America the expansion of managed care combined with the
consolidation of hospital groups and the increase in co-operative
buying organisations meant that S&N had to deal with a smaller number
of professional buying groups.  Sales slowed in the second half, but
still rose by 5 per cent to #404.7 million for the year.

Strong product lines during the year included chronic wound dressing
Allevyn, wound cleanser IntraSite Gel and IV3000, an intravenous
catheter dressing.  Rehabilitation products, extended by the
acquisition of Homecraft for #29 million during the year, also
performed impressively.  The slowdown in the US market had retarded the
growth of trauma, endoscopy and orthopaedic implants, although they
continued to do well in other markets, achieving sales growth of
between 4 and 6 per cent.

On the whole, selling prices were expected to remain "at best static",
but Mr Kinder believed the strengths in S&N's marketing and research-
backed innovation "will enable us to drive forward the competitiveness
of our product range to achieve steady growth and to outperform global
healthcare markets".

ESAOTE SEES INCREASED SALES, HOPES TO GO PUBLIC

GENOA - Spurred by exports, the Italian company Esaote reported
increasing sales of electro-medical devices in 1995 with plans to be
quoted on the stock market later this year.

The Genoa-based firm put its 1995 sales at L258 billion ($1.6 million),
up 11 per cent from the previous year, with its net income rising from
L4.8 to L8 billion.  Esaote will hold an extraordinary meeting of its
shareholders to decide its entry into the stock markets, possibly in
July 1996.

The company, characterising internal demand as "stalled", said its
overseas business now accounts for 53 per cent of sales, doubled from
two years ago.  In addition, the position of its overseas affiliates -
the US Biosound, Esaote France and Esaote Deutschland - are also
reported to have improved.

"The salient point of our growth", says Carlo Castellano, president and
chief executive officer of Esaote, "is our increasing global role in
the strategic sectors such as ultrasonic devices, tomography and
dedicated magnetic resonance."

Once a government-owned company and privatised in the recent flurry of
divestments by the state, 15 per cent of Esaote's shares were bought by
the Italian pharmaceutical group Bracco last year for L18 billion.
Bracco together with other major shareholders, such as Advent
International, Electra Investment Trust, Ipef-Euroventures Italia, Arca
Merchant and Sofipa, control 71.8 per cent of the company's shares.
The remainder belongs to Esaote's managers.

PRIVATISATION ON AGENDA FOR ORTOPEDICHE RIZZOLI

BOLOGNA - Officine Ortopediche Rizzoli, one of Italy's prominent
producers of artificial limbs, is considering privatisation to break
out of its current slump and is thinking about changing its focus to
high-technology products.

Ortopediche Rizzoli, which began producing wooden limbs in Bologna 100
years ago, is still a prestigious name in the production and sales of
orthopaedic artificial limbs.  In addition, the company produces
surgical equipment, wheel-chairs and other rehabilitation products
(some of it by handmade methods).

Its privatisation - the company is 94 per cent publicly-owned including
partial ownership by the city of Bologna - is expected this year.
Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara, a local entrepreneur who owns the Bologna
football team, has offered Ortopediche Rizzoli some L11 billion ($6.8
million), according to La Repubblica (the Italian national daily).  Mr
Frascara told La Repubblica he believes he could double the company's
sales.

Last year, the company's sales remained constant at L43 billion and it
broke even, although a net loss of about L1 billion is predicted for
1996.  Sales of orthopaedic devices account for 85 per cent of its
business, with 70 per cent of its total production going to Italian
hospitals and 30 per cent to private institutions and citizens.

In one high-tech venture, the company shot to fame at home and abroad
through its pioneering work in mioelectric hands capable of interacting
and amplifying cerebral impulses through receivers.  It also introduced
"intelligent" prosthesis to Italy.  One of its products is the "Bologna
Boot", which assists persons with spinal defects to walk with ease.

INCENTIVE SECURES OWNERSHIP POSITION IN GAMBRO

STOCKHOLM - Incentive Ab has consolidated its ownership position in
Gambro, the Swedish manufacturer and supplier of dialysis systems,
acquiring the outstanding 25 per cent of shares in the company from
pension funds, financial institutions and private owners in Sweden.

Incentive shareholders accepted the offer to such an extent that it
held 99.4 per cent of the capital and 99.7 per cent of votes.

Incentive's push to streamline its hold on Gambro came less than eight
weeks after the company presented a bid worth SKr10.3 billion ($1.4
billion) for the outstanding shares in Gambro.  Incentive's pre-bid
status was already strong, with the investment company holding 42 per
cent of shares and 58 per cent of votes.

A significant factor in the success of the bid was the acceptance of
the Crafoord Foundation, which was the second biggest owner in Gambro
after Incentive, with 2.2 per cent of shares and 11.3 per cent of
votes.

Gambro was founded by Holger Crafoord in 1964, and was initially
focused on the development of kidney dialysis machines and after care
products, areas in which the company still holds a strong market
position worldwide.

The bid emerged as Gambro issued an updated profit forecast for FY1995,
projecting earnings of SKr1.5 billion for the year, that was below what
some analysts had been anticipating.

Incentive's action in bidding for Gambro signals a change in the
company's strategy, which has been focused on acquiring minority and
strategic holdings in many of Sweden's leading industrials.  The
company's portfolio includes large shareholdings in Ericsson, Asea
Sweden and Electrolux.

Incentive is now expected to divest these shares as part of a new
policy of developing into a healthcare and energy systems group.
Resultingly, analysts forecast the company will divest non-core
interests in 1996.

"Once the Gambro acquisition is complete, more than half of the
Incentive group's annual sales will be generated from activities linked
to medical and diagnostic systems.  We intend to invest more heavily
into this business segment and sell-off non-core activities in the
future," said Incentive's chief executive officer Mikael Lilius.

The takeover is expected to boost Incentive's profit per share by about
SKr7 to SKr10 in the short-term.  "The long-term picture is more rosy,
and we expect a goodwill gain from the takeover of SKr8 billion and
increased profitability," said Lilius.

GEHE CONSIDERS TAKEOVER BID FOR HAFSLUND-NYCOMED

BONN/OSLO - Gehe, the German medical technology systems group, is
reported to be considering a hostile takeover bid on Hafslund-Nycomed,
Norway's leading supplier of healthcare products and hospital
equipment.  Gehe, which had revenues of $10.4 billion in 1995, is
stated to be particularly interested in acquiring the Norwegian
company's highly-profitable and international X-ray contrast fluids
division.

Hafslund-Nycomed will, under a plan approved by its board at the end of
1995, be split into two companies - medical products and power
production/distribution - both of which are to be listed on the Oslo
Stock Exchange in 1996.  Hafslund is also examining a possible listing
in Stockholm.

Gehe is in an acquisitive mood at present.  The company recently
presented a #5/share offer to acquire UK pharmaceuticals company Lloyds
Chemists, which has a market value of #6 billion ($9.5 billion).

The Norwegian group has been looking for an international partner since
1994.  Its search was nearly realised in 1995, when Hafslund signed a
letter of intent to merge with the US company Ivax.  This deal fell
through when Hafslund's Norwegian shareholders held out for a higher
price which Ivax refused to pay.  Although the merger was abandoned,
both companies agreed to enter into a long-term co-operation deal.

LEIRAS SET TO BE SOLD

HELSINKI - Leiras Oy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Huhtamaki group
and Finland's second biggest manufacturer of medical products, has
denied any connection between its intended sale and recent negative
publicity surrounding controversial tests carried out for the company's
contraceptive implant, Norplant, in Africa.

Huhtamaki is holding talks with at least four potential buyers,
including Astra, Ciba Geigy, Upjohn-Pharmacia and Bayer.  Orion,
Finland's largest pharmaceuticals manufacturer, is reported to be
looking for an international partner ahead of tendering a bid for
Leiras.

Huhtamaki's chief executive officer Timo Peltola said the group's
decision to divest Leiras was based on the need to restructure and
concentrate its future business around a single core division, foods
production and marketing.

"Our conclusion has nothing to do with the recent publicity involving
Norplant.  The simple truth is that Leiras is not large enough to
support the heavy investments in research and development (R&D) it
needs to make in future years" said Mr Peltola.  Leiras specialises in
developing and producing bone metabolism and ophthalmics as well as
oral contraceptive pills and implant devices.

The negative publicity that surrounded Leiras emerged following a
British television programme's (BBC's Panorama) investigation into
trial tests of Norplant within the framework of a tribal village in
west Africa.  The programme, which focused on the alleged unsystematic
nature and side-affects emanating from the tests, quoted international
researchers from the US and elsewhere who questioned the product's
reliability and innocuousness.

The negative publicity affected the value of Huhtamaki's shares and
caused much discussion within senior company circles, despite a company
declaration that associated tests in Africa had been conducted under
contract with a research firm outside the group.

"The rising trend in R&D expenditure, coupled with the downward
pressure on drug pricing due to cost savings programmes launched by
healthcare providers, is forcing the industry to seek greater economies
of scale from larger unit sizes.  The wave of mergers which has
affected the top 40 companies globally is now making itself felt among
smaller firms too," said Mr Peltola.

Describing Leiras's profit and R&D track-records as "excellent", Mr
Peltola said that the cost benefits to the company of remaining
independent were rapidly disappearing.  The company's R&D outlay
amounted to 20 per cent of net revenues in 1995, while the company
would find it increasingly difficult to find sufficient resources to
market its products internationally.

"We feel that Leiras's potential will be best realised as a specialised
unit within a major international pharmaceutical company.  The
divestment has attracted a lot of attention, and we expect to close the
sale during the spring," said Mr Peltola.

Leiras reported operating earnings of $32 million on revenues of just
over $204 million in 1995, in a year when the firm accounted for 11 per
cent of Huhtamaki group's total sales volume.  Some 51 per cent of
Leiras's production was exported.  The company operates three
production plants in Finland, with sales subsidiaries located in
Singapore, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.

SPECTRAL DIAGNOSTIC DISAPPOINTED WITH US SALES EFFORTS

VANCOUVER - Everyone says that Spectral Diagnostics Inc of Toronto (SDI
on the Toronto Stock Exchange) has a good product.  It's a credit-card-
sized diagnostic kit that can determine in seconds from a blood sample
whether an emergency room patient has, or has not had, a heart attack.
Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in March l995, Spectral
expected hot sales of the product to hospitals and emergency care
centres across North America.

It chose Dade International of Deerfield, Illinois (a Baxter
subsidiary) as its US marketing partner.  However, sales revenue since
product launch a year ago has been disappointing: C$400,000 ($289,855)
in April-September l995, and only $70,000 in the last quarter of the
year.  Share price, which had boomed up to C$40 on news of the FDA
approval, has slumped, and is bumping along this year in the C$10-12
range.

Spectral appears to be less than satisfied with its US partner's
efforts.  It recently reorganised its arrangement with Dade, allowing
it to find additional marketing partners, or even replace Dade
entirely.

Chris Plaxton, Spectral executive vice-president said: "We wanted to
see sales increase at a faster pace than we thought we were going to
see them increase with just the Dade International sales force.  Also,
Spectral is prepping a new diagnostic product for the marketplace.  A
successor to the CK-myoglobin test kit now on the market, this would be
a four-component test, refining the diagnosis by adding two more
cardiac markers."

So far, however, Spectral has not announced any new marketing
arrangements, nor has the filing process for the new test yet been

I-TA SWINDLES INVESTORS

TAIPEI - The financial slump that has hit Taiwan's businesses hard
recently claimed a local medical instrument company as one of its
latest victims.  However, instead of down-sizing operations and
applying to the banks for loans, the company's operators "swindled"
their investors.

Chen Hsi-i and Hsueh Kuan-tsu, I-Ta medical instrument company's
general manager and owner, have been charged with fraud by Wu Yin-chih,
as well as two men surnamed Hung and Kuo.

Chen and Hsueh apparently approached the three investors with a
business proposal to expand the company's operations into mainland
China.  Chen and Hueh reportedly then deceived the investors into
thinking the I-Ta company was stable and had plenty of finances.

The pair wrote cheques to guarantee a NT$2 million ($7million) loan to
Hung, and asked Kuo for NT$1.2 million as a bidding deposit.  They
asked Wu to give them NT$1.5 million to finance the project and
promised that the money would soon be repaid.

After giving the pair a total of almost NT$5 million, Wu, Hung and Kuo
realised their money had gone to saving the financially crippled I-Ta.
They filed charges with the Taipei District Prosecutors Office on 29
February.

Chen and Hsueh have denied any wrongdoing.

FAULDING SEES MIXED RESULTS

SYDNEY - Australia's Faulding has reported mixed results for its
devices business in the six months to 31 December 1995, with better
than expected profits at Faulding Imaging and a loss at Selby
Scientific.  Primarily a drug distributor, Faulding, the largest
Australian pharmaceuticals company with first-half revenues of A$781
million ($582 million) up 13.8 per cent, also is a distributor of
devices.

Faulding Imaging's main activity is distribution in Australia of the
medical equipment and microscope lines of Olympus Optical of Japan.
Selby supplies scientific equipment and laboratory consumables in
Australia and New Zealand.

Sales figures for individual subsidiaries are not released, but the
company says sales at Faulding Imaging were marginally below those for
the previous corresponding period.  Profit contribution, on the other
hand, was ahead both of the 1994/95 first half result and budget.

At Selby Scientific sales matched the result for the same period in
1994/95, but the division recorded an after-tax operating loss of NZ$1
million ($645,161), which comes on top of an A$1.9 million loss in the
1994/95 year.  Faulding hopes for improved profitability following a
recent restructuring of the group.

FIRST HIV ANTIGEN TEST APPROVED

ROCKVILLE, MD - On 14 March the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved the first antigen test kit to screen blood donors for HIV-1.
The new kit was also approved for use in diagnosing HIV-1 infections
and monitoring the progress of the disease itself.

The screening kit, manufactured by the Coulter Corp of Florida, is
known as the Coulter HIV-1 p24 Antigen Assay.  Based on an 8 August
1995 FDA recommendation to all registered blood and plasma
establishments, the test can be used within 90 days of the approval.

The Coulter test uses antigens (the virus' own proteins) which can
detect the virus about a week earlier than the antibody tests used
currently.  By reducing the "window period", when donors may be HIV-
infected but still have negative antibody tests, it has been estimated
that HIV-1 antigen screening could prevent around 25 per cent of the
current cases of Aids transmitted by transfusion.

Although the FDA has recommended that the test be used to screen blood
donations, it does not recommend that it replace the HIV antibody test
for routine patient testing and counselling in a medical setting.

The kit will be marketed to blood establishments by Ortho Diagnostics
Systems Inc, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (New Jersey).  There are
about 14 million blood donations processed annually in the US.

NEW DEVICE CAN WRITE WITH EYES

PARIS - Scientists at the National Health and Medical Research
Institute in Lille, France have developed a device that will assist
quadriplegics who cannot communicate.  The device allows them to write
with their eyes.

As the patient looks at a special keyboard, a laser-guided camera
records the stare as the patient's eye moves from letter to letter.
The camera feeds the selected letters into a computer, and the text
appears instantaneously on a computer screen.

The device, which is the result of five years of research, was
displayed at a recent Paris exhibition on language-learning techniques.
 Within a year, researchers expect that the device, called Deltavision,
will be fine-tuned and ready to market.

Delta 7, a humanitarian group that represents the interests of
paralysed people, organised funding for the project.

The Deltavision device is simple to use.  A camera in the middle of a
visual keyboard facing the patient focuses on the eye.  A red beam
reflects eye movement back to the machine.  Users need only look at a
key for less than a second for it to register, and can write about 50
characters per minute.  However, the system will only work for
quadriplegics with eye movements that are normal.

The technique has been successfully used by 100 quadriplegics in pilot
projects at rehabilitation centres in Nantes, Le Mans and Bordeaux.
The prototypes cost $20,000, but once the device is marketed, possibly
next year, Association Delta 7 expects the price to go down because of
larger-scale production.

CE MARK FOR INTRAVASCULAR DEVICE

BRUSSELS - Cardiometrics Inc of California received the Conformite
Europeene (CE) mark approval for its intravascular medical devices.

"This approval allows us to market our FloWire and SmartWire guide wire
products in all countries of the European Union without the need for
additional regulatory approval from any country," said Menahem Nassi,
president and chief executive officer.  "We believe that the CE mark
will streamline future product approvals, thus impacting the time to
market for our devices in key European markets."

Cardiometrics' products have been approved for use in most European
countries, and, to-date, more than 44,000 FloWire devices, the
company's lead product, have been sold for use in more than 300 medical
centres worldwide.  International sales currently account for about 75
per cent of Cardiometrics' revenue, as recently reported by the company
in its year-end earnings.

LASERSCOPE SEEKS BRAND RECOGNITION IN EUROPE

LONDON - Laserscope of California has received the Conformite Europeene
(CE) and International Standards Organisation (ISO) 9001 registration
from the British Standards Institution.  Robert McCormick, Laserscope
president and chief executive officer said, "These certifications will
allow us to compete more effectively in Europe and other international
markets by greatly simplifying the regulatory approval processes."

"Because the CE mark allows us to market the same model product in each
European nation," he said, "Laserscope brand recognition should grow.
From a manufacturing standpoint, we will no longer be compelled to
design, build and inventory different product configurations for each
individual country."

In 1995, international revenues represented 23 per cent of Laserscope's
total revenues, compared to 17 and 13 per cent of total revenues in
1994 and 1993, respectively.

Laserscope designs, manufactures, sells and services an advanced line
of medical laser systems and energy delivery devices for the hospital,
outpatient surgical centre and physician office markets.  It sells its
products in the US, the UK and France through its own direct sales
force and serves 20 other countries in Europe, the Middle East and the
Asia-Pacific region through regional distributors.

March - a breath activated inhaler.

The Easi-Breathe inhaler is a proprietary product of the respiratory
franchise of the Ivax Corp (US).  With this inhaler, the company says
the patient does not need to co-ordinate inhalation with actuation,
because the active ingredient goes directly to the lung, not to the
mouth or throat.

FDA APPROVES CHOLESTEROL SYSTEM

NEW YORK, NY - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved
Liposorber LA-15 System, a medical device manufactured by Kaneka
America Corp of New York to lower cholesterol in people who, because of
a genetic disorder, have extremely high cholesterol levels and are at
very high risk of heart attacks early in life.  This small group of
people, about 4,000 in the US, is not helped by low fat diets and
cholesterol lowering medications.

The device is a filtering system that removes low density lipoprotein
(LDL) from the blood via a plastic tube inserted into the patient's arm
and connected to the filtering machine.  The process, similar to kidney
dialysis, is performed at a medical facility and takes about three
hours to remove the "bad" cholesterol and must be repeated every one to
two weeks.

A clinical study of 74 patients, who were on cholesterol lowering drugs
and diet, were treated with the device at 11 US sites.  After each
treatment the LDL levels in all patients were immediately reduced;
however, after 14 to 30 days, the LDL rose to levels that were apparent
before treatment.  Long-term benefits of the treatment, such as whether
it reduces angina, heart attacks or death, were not shown.

FDA is requiring the manufacturer to establish a patient registry to
track patients who receive this treatment in order to help determine
long-term risks and benefits.  Patients who receive this treatment
should remain on a low fat diet and continue to take cholesterol-
lowering medication.

FDA REJECTS NON-INVASIVE BLOOD SUGAR TESTING DEVICE

PITTSBURGH, PA - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Clinical
Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices Panel did not recommend for
approval Biocontrol Technology's non-invasive glucose sensor for
diabetics.  The meeting held in late-February 1996 was sparked with
emotional, fiery and combatant exchanges by the public and the sponsor
directed against the advisory panel.

The non-invasive glucose sensor is a spectrophotometer which is
calibrated in a four hour process to recognise the individual user's
particular glucose pattern by calling on internal algorithms.  Once the
calibration has been completed, the forearm is placed on the sensor,
the start button pushed, and infrared light passes through the skin
into the blood and is reflected back to the sensor's computer.  The
pattern is analysed, converted to a blood glucose level, then displayed
on a digital screen quickly.

The company's device, if it was approved, would most likely have
replaced the current monitoring devices on the market today.
Presently, all devices that are on the market require an invasive
pricking of one's finger up to 10 or more times a day to monitor and
maintain accurate control of diabetes.  This is a painful and
debilitating experience for diabetics, especially children.

The meeting was marked by passionate pleas to the panel for approval of
the device during the open public session by mothers of diabetic
children and young and old diabetics.  Each speaker had a story of the
hardships of invasive testing and the resultant physical and
psychological injury suffered.  Even the company was engaged in heated
exchanges with members of the panel.

The main reasons for not recommending approval of the device were based
on the fact that the clinical study data presented by the company do
not support the intended use of the device.  There were 85 persons
initially enrolled in the clinical study but only eight were able to
qualify and complete the study.  The scale used to access accuracy of
the data was not acceptable because it was not considered an accurate
measure of error, said the panel.

The committee said more data are needed over a longer period of time,
and further study is needed with an increased number of patients,
including pregnant women and children.

MIDAC RECOMMENDS IN FAVOUR OF IMMUNOMEDIC'S CEA SCAN

ROCKVILLE, MD - Immunomedics Inc of New Jersey announced that the
Medical Imaging Drugs Advisory Committee (Midac), an external advisory
panel for the US Food and Drug Administration, unanimously recommended
approval for CEA-Scan, the company's diagnostic imaging product for
colorectal cancer.The FDA will now review the panel's decision.

"We are delighted that our first cancer imaging and diagnostic product
is in the final stages of the regulatory approval process and that the
panel recommended CEA-Scan's use in several settings," said Dr David
Goldenberg, chairman of Immunomedics.

CEA is expressed by more than 90 per cent of colorectal cancers, as
well as by a large number of other carcinomas, including lung, breast,
pancreas, uterus, and ovarian, and it has been show that this tumour
marker can serve as a useful target for radiolabeled antibodies.

In addition to CEA-Scan, the company's infectious disease imaging
agent, LeukoScan is undergoing regulatory review in Europe for imaging
osteomyelitis (bone infections).

FDA CLEARS PHADIATOP ALLERGY TEST

LONDON, CO - Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc received US Food and Drug
Administration clearance to market Phadiatop, a yes/no blood test to
determine whether a patient has an inhalant allergy.  Physicians using
the test take a blood sample to run through Phadiatop system to test
for a variety of different substances that may cause allergies.  The
results are obtained within hours.  The test is an alternative to skin
testing.

Mark D Myslinski, general manager for the Diagnostics Division of
Pharmacia & Upjohn, said that the Phadiatop system offers "physicians
and laboratories a blood test that may determine whether a patient's
symptoms are being caused by allergy or by a cold".  He noted that by
accurately diagnosing the cause of symptoms that are so similar,
appropriate treatment can be provided within a short time.  It is
estimated that 30 per cent of the US population suffers from allergy
symptoms.

Phadiatop is the latest in a panel of allergy tests that are offered in
the company's Pharmacia CAP System.  This system is currently being
used in over 2,000 laboratories worldwide.

SCALAR LAUNCHES SKIN MOISTURE TEST

TOKYO - Scalar Corp, a Japanese maker of video microscopes for medical
and industrial applications, has developed an inexpensive and light-
weight moisture checker.  According to a company spokesman, patients
place one end of the device on their skin, usually the face.  After
five seconds, the Scalar Moisture Checker beeps and gives a read out of
moisture content.

Scalar Corp hopes to expand the market for moisture checkers with its
new product.  The company claims conventional models are relatively
expensive so they are rarely installed in places other than a
laboratory.  However, the Scalar's device weighs 85 grams and sells for
Y12,800 ($134).

A prototype of the Scalar Moisture Checker was completed in March and
mass production is expected to commence in the near future at the
company's factory in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.

The spokesman expects beauty shops and department stores to be the
first customers.

Scalar Corp also believes the product will be a success amongst
dermatologists.  It is investigating worldwide regulations, after which
it will make a final decision about how and when to approach the
medical community.

OMRON'S BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR

TOKYO - Omron Corp, Japan's largest maker of blood pressure monitors,
recently launched what it calls the world's smallest and lightest hand-
held blood pressure monitor.

The digital blood pressure monitor HEM-808F uses a small optical sensor
in a finger cuff to measure blood flow.  The cuff collapses into the
body of the device after use.  It measures only 9x6x3 cm - about the
size of a pack of cigarettes, so customers can carry it with them at
all times.

A company spokesman reports that Omron developed the product because
conventional models are too large for portability.  "Patients should be
able to take a reading whenever they feel the necessity to do so," the
spokesman said.

The company plans to launch the monitor in all major international
markets by end-1996, if the time required for satisfying local
regulations of each country permits.

Production of the HEM-808F is underway at Omron's plant in Mie
Prefecture, Japan.

SMARTLIGHT ATTRACTS INVESTMENT

HAIFA - A group of Israeli investors including the Walden Israel Fund,
the Mofet Fund, and Quantum and Evergreen, invested $1.6 million in
Smartlight, a high-tech medical device company.

Smartlight has developed a sophisticated light box that enhances the
reading of X-rays.  The system is based on electro-optics technology.

Dan Inbar, one of the company's founders and vice-president of research
and development, explained to MDBN that the light box extracts the
picture at a much deeper resolution than the standard light box used by
hospitals.  He says the box will greatly reduce the 30 per cent margin
of error currently found in radiological studies.

"We studied the psycho-physic limitations of the human eye and
developed a light box that works with those limitations," he said.

The light box was introduced last year in the US, "with great success",
said Mr Inbar.  The company, which plans to produce the product in
Israel, has already started to sell it in the southwest region of the
US and has further plans to expand in Europe.

This is the second time Walden has invested in Smartlight.  It now owns
a 12 per cent stake in the company.

EUROPEAN STANDARDS TRY TO BREAK LANGUAGE BARRIER

BRUSSELS- New European standards on the information to be provided by
manufacturers of medical devices and the graphical symbols which may be
used are expected to be published before the end of this year.  John
Webster, who chairs the European working group responsible for the
standards, believes the adoption of new symbols for use on medical
devices will greatly assist manufacturers in marketing their products
throughout Europe.

He says the European Committee on Standardisation (CEN) is likely to
adopt standardised symbols for "do not reuse" (the number 2 with a line
drawn through it), a "use by" symbol showing an egg timer, and other
symbols for sterile, date of manufacture, serial number and batch
number.

The new symbols are likely to be welcomed by an industry for which
language requirements are becoming an increasing burden.  More and more
European Union member states are insisting that devices be in local
language packaging.  Some countries which once accepted English, such
as Sweden and Norway, now require the instructions for use to be in
their own language.  Others are considering adding a second or third
language requirement.

Mr Webster says this causes problems for manufacturers, as some words
and phrases do not easily translate into other languages.  He believes
the new language requirements are pushing up the cost of medical
devices - at a time when governments are struggling to contain
healthcare costs.

manufacturers to encourage them to do business in the UK.

As part of the effort to attract US investment, the CDDC is sponsoring
a medical technology fair in late-May to show the US companies what
they have to offer.  The event, which will exhibit over 100 new medical
devices, will seek to license the inventions to medical device
manufacturers in the US and Europe.

Rob Allaker, international marketing executive for CDDC, told MDBN:
"The market is huge in Britain, the National Health Service imports 75
per cent of the medical devices it uses."

PRODUCT LIABILITY BILL HAS A CHANCE TO BECOME LAW

WASHINGTON, DC - The US Senate is expected to pass by end-March a
compromise bill that would reduce somewhat the potential legal
liability of companies selling medical devices in the US.  The House of
Representatives, however, has not yet scheduled a date for
consideration of the measure.

The compromise bill was worked out by a conference committee, composed
of members of the Senate and House.  That committee was charged with
resolving the major differences between the House bill that was highly
favourable to industry and the more narrow Senate bill that passed the
respective chambers last year.  If the compromise bill is passed by
Congress, it is expected to be signed into law by President Clinton.

Some good news for industry

The bill does provide some good news for the medical device industry,
although provisions most sought by the industry are missing.  The bill
severely limits the liability of biomaterial suppliers for injury from
a medical implant or device.  Biomaterial suppliers would be liable
only if a claimant establishes that the supplier failed to meet the
contract requirements or specifications for the implant, or failed to
properly register the implant with the secretary of Health and Human
Services.  In addition, the bill provides an expedited dismissal
procedure for medical device defendants.

Absent from the bill, however, is language that would bar those who
claim they were injured by medical devices from winning punitive
damages if the product had been approved for sale by a regulatory
agency except under extremely limited circumstances.  The legislation
does limit punitive awards assessed against those found liable in court
for selling products that injure consumers and ends joint and several
liability for injuries.  It also bars suits for products sold more than
20 years before the injury is claimed and gives consumers only two
years after they suffer an injury to claim damages.

In general, the cap on punitive damages is the greater of twice the
compensatory (economic and non-economic) damages, or $250,000.  This is
a cap that pre-empts state laws to the extent that they are more
permissive.  Moreover, sellers may not be held strictly liable or
liable on the basis of a breach of an implied warranty.  This bill
would also extend this standard to any entity that rents or leases a
product by providing that such an entity shall not be liable for the
act of another, solely by reason of ownership of such product, but
shall be liable under the same standards as applied to product sellers.

Actions for commercial loss are excluded from the scope of the bill.
Thus, the bill does not apply to a business seeking its lost profits if
a defective product causes a work stoppage.

The fact that the bill was near passage prompted consumer groups to
launch a last-minute public campaign to pressure members of Congress to
vote against it.  Officials of Citizens Action and the Consumers Union,
at a news conference on 7 March said: "The legislation would gut the
laws that now protect Americans from defective and dangerous products
and let manufacturers that put profit before safety get away with their
misconduct."

Steven Spiel, associate vice-president for policy and communications
for Health Industry Manufacturers Associations, however, said this is
not the case.  "This bill will do a great deal to encourage companies
to continue to invest in new innovative products for US patients and
will help keep jobs in the US as well.  In fact, this bill is great
news for consumers."

"It will only limit punitive damages, and it will eliminate the lottery-
like system which serves no one," Spiel said.  "In many instances, the
reward has little relationship to the damage alleged," he said.

FDA TO EASE RULES FOR LOW-RISK DEVICES

ROCKVILLE, MD - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is exempting
122 categories of low-risk medical devices from pre-market review,
adding to the 450 categories already exempted from such review.

The agency, in an "FDA Talk Paper", states this action is part of the
drug and medical device reforms announced last spring as contained in
the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review.  The agency
also said it is in line with its commitment to speed up patient access
to new medical devices.

The devices to be exempted from the review include: gas pressure
gauges, oxygen masks, pacemaker chargers, dental floss, pneumatic
tourniquets, patient scales, examination lights and therapeutic
massages.

These products will continue to be regulated by the FDA and remain
subject to good manufacturing practice regulation, FDA factory
inspections, and other general reports.  However, the exemption means
that manufacturers will be allowed to market the products without
getting prior clearance from the agency.

To exempt the products, the agency reclassified three categories of
devices from Class II (medium risk) to Class I (low risk).  In
addition, the agency exempted two categories of devices already in
Class I.  The medical devices amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act and FDA regulation allow certain types of Class I devices to be
exempted from pre-market review.

With this action, notes the FDA, nearly 75 per cent of all Class I
devices are now exempt from pre-market review.  This represents one-
third of all classified medical devices.

The final regulation listing the 122 exempted device categories became
effective on 15 February.  All manufacturers who had pre-clearance
submissions pending FDA review on 15 February should have been notified
by letter that their device is exempt.

Meanwhile, the FDA has just published a proposed rule in the 14 March
Federal Register for analyte specific reagents to be reclassified as
restricted devices.

1996 PASSAGE OF FDA REFORM BILL IN QUESTION

WASHINGTON, DC - Despite strong support from the US medical device
industry, it remains uncertain whether legislation mandating prompt
Food and Drug Administration action on applications for new device
approvals will win congressional support this year.  Senator Nancy
Kassebaum (R-Kansas) chairman of the Senate Labour and Human Resources
Committee, has called for a mark-up late this month on her FDA reform
bill, S.  1477.

Because of a heavy congressional schedule and the fact that it is a
presidential election year, some observers say the legislation will not
be passed.

Moreover, Representative Thomas Bliley (R-Virginia), chairman of the
House Commerce Committee, has yet to introduce his version of the FDA
reform bill, nor has he indicated when he could possibly introduce such
legislation.

Also, the opposition of FDA Commissioner David Kessler to the Kassebaum
bill has dampened its chances for passage.  In testimony before
Kassebaum's committee Mr Kessler said he backed the principles of the
Kassebaum bill, but called for changes in the legislation to ensure
safety.  He criticised key portions supported by the industry,
including provisions to set shorter timetables for approval of devices
and allowing third parties to take part in the review process.

Mr Kessler told the panel: "Improvements also have been made in the
timetable for the review and approval of medical devices.  With respect
to the 510(k) process, through which 98 per cent of all medical devices
evaluated by FDA reach the market, the average review time in fiscal
year 1995 was 137 days, down 24 per cent from the 184-day average in
fiscal year 1994.  The average review time for those devices needing
premarket applications is still too long, but we are making progress
there as well.  The average PMA review in fiscal year 1995 was 20
months."

Mr Kessler proposed to Congress on 12 March, that user fees be imposed
on the industry to permit the FDA to hire more people to expedite the
review of new products.  While several medical device companies favour
the fees, the two major trade associations representing large and small
manufacturers strongly oppose such action (the Health Industry
Manufacturers Association and the Medical Device Manufacturers
Association).

UNCERTAINTY OVER MRI ORDER

VANCOUVER - Ontario radiologists still hope that the Ontario government
will honour a promise to approve the addition of 23 more magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scanners to the province's present 12 in
service, even though the commitment dates back to November l994, before
the present provincial government was elected.  So far, the Health
Ministry has given no word.

Desmond Walker, president of the Ontario Association of Radiologists
said, "The approval of these MRI scanners would dramatically reduce the
nine-month waiting lists which are believed to be the longest in the
industrialised world." Turkey, he noted, has more MRI scanners per
million people than Canada does.

MEDICAL DEVICE MAKERS URGED TO LOOK EAST FOR NEW BUSINESS

WASHINGTON, DC - The US Commerce Department's export promotion
officials are telling US medical equipment makers to look to Asian
markets for medical devices.  Asian markets are growing at double-digit
rates, much faster than the traditional markets of North America,
Europe and Japan, reported the US Journal of Commerce.

Global trade patterns are shifting and "we are encouraging (the US)
industry to focus more on Asia" as well as Latin America, said Jeffrey
Gren, director of Commerce's Office of Microelectronics, Medical
Equipment and Instrumentation.

Besides supplying US medical device makers with market data, Commerce
officials help arrange trade missions, exhibits and seminars key to the
Asian market.  They also work directly with foreign governments to
improve market access.

The US represents roughly half of the world's $90 billion a year
medical device market, but its share is shrinking, as Asia and Latin
America's shares rise, Mr Gren said.

In China, said Commerce analyst Paul Barry, "We expect sales to
increase dramatically over the next couple of years", as China embarks
on a new five-year plan.

Help manufacturers cash in

To help US manufacturers cash in, Commerce is arranging a US visit by
members of the People's Liberation Army, which operates hundreds of
hospitals and thousands of clinics in China.

In May, a US medical-dental industry trade mission will visit China,
and in June, the United States plans to take part in a Beijing
International Medical Equipment Exhibition.

South Korea, Taiwan and India also are among other fast emerging Asian
markets.  Boosting US sales prospects, South Korea's Health Ministry is
due to announce guidelines simplifying its testing and other medical
device regulations.  Taiwan is moving to a "universal coverage" health
system, though it may soon issue new rules that could force down US
medical device prices.

In India, said a Commerce analyst, "we see rapid growth for high-end
medical products, such as diagnostic and imaging equipment".

TURKMENISTAN REQUIRES LICENSING OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT

ASHKHABAD - As part of its new healthcare reforms, Turkmenistan has
introduced new rules for registration of medical equipment and
pharmaceuticals.  Under the rules, implemented on 1 March, all
producers and suppliers of the medical equipment and pharmaceuticals
must register with a new department in the Health Ministry created for
this purpose.

Equipment without the proper registration and documentation are
prohibited from being imported to the country.  The licensing system is
part of the country's healthcare reform which started at the beginning
of this year.  Turkmenistan also introduced medical insurance in
January.

SECTOR TO SEE "MODEST GROWTH"

SYDNEY - The Medical Industry Association of Australia published its
industry analysis for 1994 in its annual survey: "Industry Survey
Number 4".

The analysis of industry trends is based on data from 33 companies.
Although the number of companies involved in the supply of medical
devices and diagnostics in Australia is thought to exceed 600, MIAA
says the 33 companies constitute, in terms of sales, the "core"
industry.

Companies engaged in local manufacture have experienced sharply
different trading conditions over the period to those engaged solely in
importing.  "Importers have experienced continuous and substantial
sales growth in both the domestic and re-export markets while local
manufacturers have faced little growth in domestic sales and widely
fluctuating export levels," reports MIAA.

Reflecting these contrasting market conditions, manufacturing (and
overall) employment levels contracted sharply, despite modest growth in
non-manufacturing staff numbers.

Sharp differences across the various segments of the domestic market
were seen in 1994, with growth rates in the private hospital sector far
outstripping those in the public hospital market.

The diagnostics sector of the industry would have felt the impact of
these market changes more severely than the devices sector, since the
bulk of diagnostics sales are concentrated in the slower-growing
segments of the market.

Because of the diversity of the results, MIAA says it is difficult to
predict the outlook for future growth, but the group says at best, the
outlook is for modest growth.

* Domestic sales to the public hospital sector remain the backbone of
the industry's activities, accounting for 46 per cent of total sales in
1994.

* The government currently finances around 44 per cent of all
expenditure on public hospitals; total Commonwealth outlays on hospital
services are projected to rise by only 12 per cent between 1994-95,
A$5.3 billion ($3.9 billion), and 1998-99, A$5.9 billion.

AUSTRALIA HELPS CHINA ESTABLISH AUDIOLOGY TECHNOLOGY COURSES

SYDNEY - Australia has agreed to help China establish audiology
training schools in the major teaching hospitals in Beijing and
Shanghai.  Each school will have a centre with facilities for assessing
hearing, fitting aids and making ear moulds.

Last year, representatives from three bodies, Australian Hearing
Services, Cochlear Pty Ltd, Ascom Audiosys, and a group of Australian
universities led by Macquarie University, met with Chinese officials to
set up a new cadre of Chinese ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists.
These specialists will train fellow ENT specialists in audiology using
the latest scientific devices and techniques.

A spokesman for Macquarie University said Australia would advise on
facilities, equipment and local staff, and the Chinese government would
pay for local costs.  Australia would also provide computer equipment
for programmable hearing aids and associated software for Australian-
made aids, he said.

Professor Philip Newall of Macquarie University commented: "Audiology
has developed rapidly with recent improvements in electronics, computer
science and technology.  It has become highly specialised in the West
with new branches such as clinical, paediatric, industrial, educational
and hearing-aid audiology.  Hearing devices too are increasingly
sophisticated.  As yet, there is no formal audiology school in China.
ENT departments in hospitals and rehabilitation centres fit mainly
children with hearing aids.  The rest of the population buys them
through department stores without testing or fitting."

Professor Newall is also closely associated with an increasing
Australian presence in audiology in Thailand.  "The Thai government is
providing hearing aids free of charge under a new law for the
disabled," he said.  "The initial contract is for 6,000 units, and it
is hoped some will be made in Australia and fit to Australian
specifications."

INCONTROL TO START CLINICAL TRIALS

BRUSSELS - InControl Inc (Europe operations, Belgium) has submitted its
application to European authorities to begin clinical implant trials of
the Metrix atrial defibrillation system in up to 12 selected centres in
Europe.  At the same time, the company has also submitted an
application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting
permission to start US trials.

Though implanted pacemakers have long been used to treat slow heart
rhythms and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are used to
treat ventricular fibrillation, the Metrix atrial defibrillator is one
of the first devices designed especially for patients with atrial
fibrillation.

Intended to be placed and programmed by physicians using techniques
similar to those used for implanting pacemakers, the Metrix atrial
defibrillator is designed to detect the presence of atrial fibrillation
and deliver a low-energy carefully-timed shock to convert the rhythm to
normal.

PORTABLE DIALYSIS MACHINE PROVES "SMOOTHER & GENTLER"

VANCOUVER - A nocturnal hemodialysis system has just completed two
years of clinical testing at Toronto's Wellesley Hospital.  The team
doing the test has recommended to the Ontario Health Ministry that the
treatment be made standard for patients requiring dialysis.

The modified dialysis machine was designed by Dr Robert Udall of
Toronto Western Hospital, with a grant from the Health Ministry.
Compared to conventional dialysis, which is done two or three times a
week for three or four hours, under nursing supervision, the operation
of the eight-hour-a-night dialyser is described as "smoother and
gentler".

The machine is linked by phone to a computerised monitoring station at
the hospital, and a technician calls the patient within two minutes of
any irregularity in its function.  In two years testing on six
patients, no emergency home visits were required.  The design of the
machine is presently being refined in order to make it more portable,
so that a patient could travel with it in his luggage.

Dr Andreas Pierratos, head of the Wellesley team, says that the new
nocturnal dialysis system will cost only $25,000 a year per patient,
half the annual cost of conventional dialysis.  With 9,000 patients in
Canada requiring such treatment, the cost savings would be
considerable.

ST JUDE MEDICAL AND HEARTPORT TO TEST MITRAL VALVE REPAIR SYSTEM

ST PAUL, MN - St Jude Medical Inc and Heartport Inc (Redwood City,
California) received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for
its human clinical trials of its port-access mitral valve repair and
replacement system.

The surgical system permits less invasive port-access heart valve
surgery to replace and repair diseased heart valves.  It has the
potential to reduce trauma, pain and debility that can result from
conventional open-chest surgery.  Additionally, side effects, recovery
time and hospital stays and costs are reduced.

The port-access procedure allows surgery to be performed through small
incisions or "ports" between the ribs.  The system promises to replace
the traditional procedure for mitral valve surgery of opening the chest
or "cracking" it by making a large incision, sawing the breastbone in
half and forcibly spreading open the rib cage with a steel retractor.
This conventional surgical procedure usually requires that patients
spend eight to 12 days in the hospital and an equal time for recovery
at home.

Mechanical heart valve system

The two companies have a worldwide agreement to develop products,
supply components, as well as to patent, license and sell them.  St
Jude will sell a new, jointly developed product, the St Jude Medical
Port-Access Mechanical Heart Valve System that incorporates Heartport
Port-Access Technology.

St Jude Medical has an exclusive licensing agreement with Professor
Jacques Seguin of France for a unique, semi-rigid annuloplasty ring, a
product used in the repair of diseased heart valves that is compatible
with Heartport's Port-Access system.

PERCLOSE TO START CLINICAL TRIALS

MENLO PARK, CA - Perclose Inc has completed enrolling 500 randomly
selected patients for its Investigational Device Exemption trial for
the Prostar 9F and 11F Percutaneous Vascular Surgical systems.  The
company also announced that the initial human clinical testing of the
single suture Techstar 7F system has been completed and has validated
the device's safety and efficacy for human use.

The Prostar 9F and 11F are minimally invasive surgical systems used to
close arterial access sites following therapeutic catherisation
procedures, such as angioplasty and stenting.

Economic benefits

Hank Plain, Perclose's president and chief executive officer, said: "We
believe that the Prostar system provides patients with significant
clinical and economic benefits, including more rapid achievement of
hemostasis, reduced time to ambulation and increased patient comfort."

The Techstar 7F system was clinically tested and evaluated following
therapeutic and diagnostic coronary procedures in Canada.  Plain notes
that the Techstar system is offered in 6F, 7F and 8F sizes providing
physicians with a complete line of arterial access site management
devices that address the full range of clinical needs and physicians'
size preferences.

The company plans to begin marketing the system during the second
quarter 1996 in Europe, Japan and Canada.

IDS TO CLINICALLY TEST CTLM

SUNRISE, FL - Imaging Diagnostic System Inc has received approval from
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin clinical testing of
its Computed Tomography Laser Mammography (CTLM).

CTLM represents a painless and radiation free alternative to
traditional mammography.  The machine uses a high-speed laser and
sophisticated computer technology to produce ultra sharp three-
dimensional, cross-sectional images of the breasts, without discomfort
from breast compression.

The clinical trials under the FDA's Investigational Device Exemption
application will begin at the Strax Breast Institute in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida and will be expanded this year to screening
facilities at cancer detection centres across the US.

Dr Richard J Grable, chief executive officer and inventor of the
technology, said: "When the FDA granted a prompt review of our
applications, we were excited.  But now we're ecstatic it has resulted
in the FDA's first acceptance of clinical trials using our medical
optical imaging." The company projects more than $5 million in sales
this year in fulfilling orders from the Far East, Middle East and
Europe.

SLIGHT RISK FROM BREAST IMPLANTS

CHICAGO, IL - The largest study to-date on the health risks associated
with breast implants shows that women with implants are 24 per cent
more likely to self-report connective-tissue diseases than women who
have never had breast implants, according to an article in the late-
February issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.

The researchers noted: "The data from this large retrospective cohort
study are compatible with previous recent reports from two other cohort
studies that provide reassuring evidence against a large hazard of
breast implants on connective tissue diseases." However, they also
indicate a small but significant increased risk of ...  any connective
tissue disease."

The researchers found the small increased risk remained virtually
constant regardless of the woman's age or how long she had the implant.

Connective tissue diseases are a group of disorders associated with
abnormality of the immune system in which the body reacts against its
own cells, tissues and organs.  The researchers found the increased
risk was of borderline statistical significance for rheumatoid
arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome (a condition where the eyes and mouth
become excessively dry), polymyositis or dermatomyositis (a rare,
sometimes fatal disease in which the muscles and skin become inflamed,
causing muscle weakness and a skin rash) and scleroderma (a rare
condition that can affect many organs and tissues of the body).

Dr Charles Hennekens, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Massachusetts, and colleagues analysed questionnaires
completed by 395,543 female health professionals.  A total of 10,830
women reported they had breast implants and 11,805 reported they had
one of more connective tissue diseases between 1962 and 1991.

In 1992, the US Food and Drug Administration imposed a moratorium on
the use of silicone breast implants until their safety could be proved;
however, they are still available under clinical trials and women can
still get saline implants.

The results of the study are in line with FDA commissioner David
Kessler's testimony to Congress last year that the risk of getting a
serious disease from the implants is minimal.

The researchers noted: "Further research is necessary before firm
conclusions can be drawn.

The study was partially funded by former implant manufacturer Dow
Corning Corp.

IT TO CAPITALISE ON EXPERTISE IN POLYMER-BASED PRODUCTS

CHESHIRE UK - The implantable and extracorporeal devices sector provides
a $12 billion opportunity for sales of biomaterials, an area that has a
worldwide growth potential estimated at 7-12 per cent per annum.  This
market provides the Innovative Technologies (IT) Group with a huge
potential for capitalising on its research and development expertise in
alginate and polymer-based woundcare and medical products.

IT is aiming to establish itself as a"one-stop shop" for advanced
woundcare products and other medical devices based on its polymer
technology and to continue to gain market share as a supplier of
materials and manufacturing process technology.  Though IT's sales
focus at present is on alginate and polymer film-based woundcare
products, the company envisages a future in fields as far reaching as
self-lubricating hip joints, heart-assist devices, catheters, medical
and clean room gloves, condoms, and drug delivery.  In a number of
these areas IT is already involved in research with industry partners
including PharmaPlast AS (Norway), Nycomed AS (Norway) and Portex Ltd
(UK).  It is also carrying out research through the UK Department of
Trade and Industry LINK-funded programmes.

IT's core expertise in alginate and polymer woundcare products has
resulted in the development of tailor-made products for all categories
of wounds at various stages of healing.  The company quotes figures
which estimate the worldwide woundcare market to be some $9 billion,
with a hi-tech segment approaching $2 billion and growing at over 20
per cent annually.

Managing costs of healthcare

Managing the costs of healthcare is an increasing priority in any
number of medical fields, and to this end IT believes it can make
"unusually cost-effective" alginate and film dressings.  This is partly
possible through the ability of "intelligent film" to manage wound
fluid, resulting in a dressing which needs changing less frequently,
saving nursing time and therefore money.  Results so far suggest that
these dressings can be left in place for up to seven days.  To-date,
the design and development of a wide range of woundcare products has
been completed, including film, alginate, hydrocolloid, hydrogel and
special gauze dressings.  The company does not sell under its own label
but designs, develops, produces and manufactures for major companies
with "significant sales teams".

Focused research has been one of the keys to IT's success, financial
director David Chellingsworth maintains.  But there is also "a lot
bubbling beneath the surface".  Although the bottom line is to generate
revenues and profits for shareholders (the company was listed on the
USM in 1994, and now - as of a couple of weeks ago - on the London
Stock Exchange) it is important "not to lose track of the fact that you
must not stifle the creativity that lies beneath the surface".  (In
fact, IT's polymer technology does not stop at medical products, and
its offshoot textiles group is forming alliances with the aim to
develop waterproof, breathable textiles through the use of its
superurethane films as fabric coatings).

Unique position

IT also believes it has the potential to become one of the lowest-cost
producers of finished woundcare products, especially as alginate and
polysaccharide wound dressing manufacture has been integrated in house.
 The company sees itself "in a unique position" within the industry,
with fully integrated manufacturing capabilities for films, from
polymer design to finished products, including the facility to convert
and package many woundcare products, such as hydrocolloids and
hydrogels.

With major sales being generated by its line of "basic" alginate
dressings, the company has major clients in Europe and North America.
New products are planned for launch in the first half of 1996.  The
woundcare market is still open to innovation and new ideas, David
Chellingsworth suggests, with many more niches to explore.  IT has the
facilities and expertise to further develop any viable ideas brought to
the company from third parties.  The company recently invested in its
own leading edge conversion capability with laminating and packaging
facilities.  (The US market for custom conversion of non-woundcare
medical devices, excluding drug delivery patches, is $50 million, IT
claims).

The order books are filling steadily, David Chellingsworth says.
According to IT's chairman in his interim report at the end of last
year, the aim is to achieve annual sales in the order of #10 million
($15.9 million) within two years.  Though IT is quite a small company
(of some 80 individuals in total), it is targeting a fairly large
market with "top of the range" products.  Even a year or so ago there
was little to show in terms of sales, and no major contracts had been
signed.  Things have progressed a long way since then.

DEVICES SECTOR SETS SIGHTS ON MARKET AND INDICATION EXPANSION

LONDON - LocalMed, a California-based private medical devices company,
recently completed a $16 million private placement of preferred stock.
As lead investor, International Biotechnology Trust invested $3
million.  Hambrecht & Quist and Johnson & Johnson Development Capital
also participated in the preferred stock offering.

LocalMed markets devices which are used, in conjunction with balloon
catheters, to deliver drugs locally during angioplasty.  Its
InfusaSleeve system received FDA 510(k) approval in late-1994 and is
marketed by a direct sales force in the US and by distributors in the
rest of the world.  The local drug delivery catheter is used in
conjunction with a standard PTCA balloon catheter to deliver drugs to
the coronary arteries during angioplasty, effectively converting the
PTCA catheter into the drug delivery device.  LocalMed, founded in
1993, is developing other devices which will be used during cardiac
surgery.

Medtronic announced late-February that its Hemopump Cardiac Assist
System is being released to the cardiac surgery market in Germany and
on a limited basis to customers in other parts of Europe.  The Hemopump
is a catheter-mounted left ventricular assist system designed to
augment cardiac output.  The company is progressing toward US
regulatory approval to resume a modified clinical trial focusing on the
Hemopump's effectiveness during coronary bypass procedures.  Trials are
expected to take place during the 1997 fiscal year.

Keen support from city analysts

UK-based Cortecs, a biopharmaceutical company keenly supported by
several city analysts, hopes to launch before the end of the year a
simple rapid testing kit for osteoporosis.Analysts estimate the
potential size of the worldwide market for a diagnostic kit for
osteoporosis at up to $1 billion, three times bigger than that for any
other diagnostic product currently being sold.  A working prototype has
been established in collaboration with Danish company Osteometer
Biotech AS, and trials are expected to commence over the next three
months.  Cortecs took just eight months from the date of signing the
deal to create a working prototype.

Osteometer originated the bone breakdown technology, which Cortecs
secured access to last year through an exclusive licensing agreement.
The product has in recent studies been shown to be the only bone marker
which is predictive of hip fractures.

Combining diagnostics with therapeutics in a single disease area
provides enormous leverage when it comes to negotiating future
distribution and detail sales force arrangements.  Jonathan Pockson,
finance director of Cortecs, told MDBN: "If we can have a diagnostic
kit for osteoporosis, plus an oral version of calcitonin to handle the
disease, then effectively Cortecs will have a very strong control of
the disease state in a massive field.  It represents a significant
opportunity for the company and represents a follow on product from our
enabling technology.  "

Helisal, the company's recently-launched H.pylori diagnostic, is
proceeding as the company forecast.  Approval from the FDA is believed
to be imminent.  It is gradually building momentum in Europe as part of
H.pylori eradication therapy; H.pylori is a bacteria linked to stomach
ulcers, cancer and heart disease.  The results from the Phase II
studies of oral calcitonin are expected soon.  Cortecs posted "solid
all around progress" in its interim financial reports posted on 11
March, said the company.  It hopes to post profits in 1997.

International demand to grow quickly

California-based Microbics Corp, which develops and markets biosensor-
based systems for monitoring toxicity in environmental and process
control markets, is looking to raise about $20 million to fund the
expansion of sales and marketing and to support new systems
development.  International demand for toxicity testing is expected to
grow quickly over the next five years.

The anticipated pre-money valuation of $40 million offers considerable
upside for a company with forecast net earnings in excess of $20
million in 2001.  The company plans to move its headquarters to the UK,
with a full flotation on the London stock market in early 1998.

Shield Diagnostics expects within the next month to announce
preliminary data from the current Houston-based trials on its lab-based
test (AFT), for activated factor 12 a diagnostic test to predict
susceptibility to coronary heart disease.  Market estimates put the
market for such a test at between #50 and #100 million.  Further
product enhancements are likely, perhaps with a rapid assay test for
point-of-care use.

IL JUDGE DISMISSES PEDICLE SCREW CASE AS IMPERMISSIBLE

         In dismissing a complaint filed on behalf of 11 plaintiffs
who alleged injuries from implanted spine plate pedicle screws, a
federal judge in Chicago called the suit "an impermissible
lumping together of plaintiffs and defendants" and said the
claims must be filed separately.  Jarmasek et al. v. AcroMed
Corp. et al., No. 95-C-7095 (ND IL, Eastern Div.).

         "It simply will not do for counsel to put together this type
of hodgepodge in anticipation that it may be worked into
respectable size and shape through the efforts of the court or
opposing counsel or both," said Senior U.S. District Judge Milton
I. Shadur of the Northern District of Illinois.

         In his Dec. 6 order, Judge Shadur dismissed the suit with
leave for the plaintiffs to refile an amended complaint by
Dec. 19.  According to court records, an amended and restated
complaint was filed by the plaintiffs on Dec. 14.

         Joseph J. Jarmasek and 10 other plaintiffs filed a complaint
on Dec. 5, alleging that AcroMed Corp. and 99 other defendants
were responsible for injuries allegedly sustained from implanted
pedicle screws.

         "All 11 plaintiffs have a common grievance: the implanting
of a spine plate pedicle screw," Judge Shadur said.  "But of
course the several implant operations were performed at different
times and almost without exception at different hospitals."

         The judge criticized several problems in the complaint,
including the plaintiffs' engagement "in a type of boilerplate
rote repetition of allegations about defendants' purported
contacts with this district that seems very likely to be
demonstratably false."  The ability to obtain personal
jurisdiction over many of the defendants is extremely doubtful,
Judge Shadur said.

         "In addition, the inclusion in this action of some of the
categories of joined defendants (particularly, though not
exclusively, the individual defendants) would seem highly
problematic as they relate to any of the plaintiffs (and perhaps
as to all of them)," the judge said.
                   He said the litigation must be reduced to manageable
proportions in compliance with the rules of the court, and must
be supported by allegations that will be able to pass the
objective good faith standard of Rule 11.

         Representing the plaintiffs were Mark E. Stone of Kurasch &
Stone in Chicago; John J. Cummings III of Cummings, Cummings &
Dudenhefer in New Orleans, LA; and Cary Michael Saperstein of the
Law Office of Michael D. Mannis in Chicago.

PLAINTIFFS ASK PA JUDGE TO DENY DISMISSAL OF CLAIMS

         Nine plaintiffs in the orthopedic bone screw multidistrict
litigation in Philadelphia asked Senior U.S. District Judge Louis
C. Bechtle on Dec. 5 to deny a motion by defendant AcroMed Corp.
to dismiss their claims based on alleged noncompliance with
Pretrial Order No. 6.  In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Products
Liability Litigation, No. 1014 (J.P.M.L.).

         On Nov. 22, AcroMed moved the court to dismiss the claims of
nearly 600 plaintiffs, including William E. Biddle Jr., Cynthia
L. Glenn, Mattie Tripp Johnson, Maureen Leckie, Ann F. Little,
Bradley J. Little, Patricia Harper Whitley, Dan K. Whitley and
Johnny W. Taylor.

         In its motion, the company asserted that the plaintiffs were
compelled by Pretrial Order No. 6 to submit completed
questionnaires providing basic background and authorization to
enable defendants to obtain medical records within 60 days of
receiving the order.

         The plaintiffs argued in their response that each plaintiff
complied, in good faith, with the requirements of Pretrial Order
No. 6.

         "AcroMed believes that its interests in this litigation are
best served by seeking the wholesale dismissal of plaintiffs'
claims based upon any possible deficiency that AcroMed can point
to with respect to Plaintiffs' compliance with Pretrial Order
No. 6," the response stated.

         The plaintiffs are represented by John P. Kopesky of
Sheller, Ludwig & Badey in Philadelphia.  AcroMed is represented
by Richard I. Werder Jr. of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in
Cleveland.

multidistrict litigation in Philadelphia, according to the sixth
bi-weekly report filed Dec. 11 by the defense liaison counsel.
In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Products Liability Litigation,
No. 1014 (J.P.M.L.).

         The report, filed pursuant to Pretrial Order No. 68, details
each of the 10 defendant manufacturers in the multidistrict
litigation and the number of depositions taken, rescheduled or

COURT STAYS NOTICE PENDING MOTION TO RECONSIDER CERTIFICATION

         Senior U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel on Dec. 15
ordered that the notice to class participants in the Telectronics
Pacing Systems, Inc. litigation in Ohio be stayed pending the
resolution of the defendant's motion to reconsider the court's
order certifying the class.  In re Telectronics Pacing Systems,
Inc. Accufix Atrial "J" Leads Products Liability Litigation,
No. 1057 (J.P.M.L.), No. CV95-87 (SD OH).

         Judge Spiegel on Nov. 17 granted a motion to certify a class
of plaintiffs who claimed they were injured as a result of
allegedly defective pacemaker "J" lead wires.  In his order, the
judge granted certification on four of the plaintiffs' 11 causes
of action that stem from allegedly defective Telectronics Pacing
Systems Inc. Accufix Atrial "J" pacemaker leads that were
implanted into the plaintiffs.

         The plaintiffs assert that about 15% of the company's
pacemaker leads are J-shaped in design.  Telectronics had used
the J-shaped lead since December 1987 for pacemakers that are
specifically designed to stimulate muscle in the atrium of the
heart.

         The plaintiffs alleged that from December 1987 to October
1994, Telectronics manufactured and sold its pacemakers, a
significant portion of which contained defective leads, on a
continuous basis.  According to the plaintiffs, about 40,500 of
the company's J-leads were implanted into patients worldwide.

         Judge Spiegel ordered the plaintiffs to file their response
to Telectronics' motion by Jan. 2, and Telectronics to reply
before Jan. 9.  A hearing regarding the motion to reconsider
class certification has been scheduled for Jan. 26.

         The plaintiffs are represented by Louis Gilligan of Keating,
Muething & Klekamp in Cincinnati; and by Stanley M. Chesley and
Terrence L. Goodman of Waite, Schneider, Bayless & Chesley Co.,
L.P.A., also in Cincinnati.

         Telectronics is represented by Frank C. Woodside III and
James A. Comodeca of Dinsmore & Shohl in Cincinnati; and by
Charles P. Goodell Jr., Richard M. Barnes and Ian Gallagher of
Goodell, DeVries, Leech & Gray in Baltimore.

TELECTRONICS SAYS NAMES OF CLASS MEMBERS SHOULD BE KEPT PRIVATE

         In a Dec. 4 plan for notice of the pendency of the class
action, defendant Telectronics Pacing Systems, Inc. objected to
the plaintiffs' provision to provide the Plaintiffs' Steering
Committee with computer disks and labels identifying the names
and addresses of all class members in its possession.  In re
Telectronics Pacing Systems, Inc. Accufix Atrial "J" Leads
Products Liability Litigation, No. 1057 (J.P.M.L.), No. CV95-87
(SD OH).

         In its plan for notice of the pendency of the class action,
Telectronics said it must operate under the regulatory
requirements of the Food and Drug Administration, which requires
that patient names and addresses be kept confidential and be
protected from public disclosure.

         As an alternative to the plaintiffs' proposal, Telectronics
proposed that it produce a list identifying all patient names and
addresses under seal to the court, which would prepare the
notification for mailing to the class members.

         "In this manner, the confidentiality of the patient records
can be preserved, while at the same time notifying members of the
class of the pendency of this class action," Telectronics said.

         Translations of the class notice and press releases should
be made " at the plaintiffs' expense " in order to adequately
inform members of this world-wide class who live in predominately
non-English speaking countries, Telectronics said.  Those
countries include Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, Japan, Italy,
Belgium, Jordan, Iran, Iraq and Mexico.

NORPLANT PLAINTIFFS, DEFENDANTS ARGUE ON MEDICAL MONITORING

         In response to U.S. District Judge Richard A. Schell's order
regarding medical monitoring, plaintiffs and defendants in the
Norplant multidistrict litigation argued on the issue of medical
monitoring as a viable cause of action.  In re Norplant
Contraceptive Products Liability Litigation, No. 1038 (J.P.M.L.).

         Judge Schell on Sept. 25 ordered the parties involved in the
Norplant litigation to brief whether each state would recognize a
claim for medical monitoring and what physical injury information
would be required in order to bring such a claim.

         In a Nov. 30 brief, the plaintiffs argued that medical
monitoring is a viable cause of action and that every
jurisdiction would recognize medical monitoring as a recoverable
element of damages.

         "Although some jurisdictions require an existing physical
injury to warrant medical monitoring, that factor is present in
every plaintiff by virtue of the fact that mere use of Norplant
requires invasive surgical procedures to both insert and remove
the product," the plaintiffs said.

         The plaintiffs urged the court to follow In re Paoli R.R.
Yard PCB Litigation, 916 F.2d 829 (3rd Cir. 1990), cert. denied,
499 U.S. 961 (1991), and In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litigation, 35
F.3d 829 (3rd Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 1253 (1995).
In those cases, the plaintiffs said, the courts held that medical
monitoring is a viable cause of action.

         Another case cited by the plaintiffs is In re Telectronics
Pacing Systems, Inc. Accufix Atrial "J" Leads Products Liability
Litigation, No. 1057 (J.P.M.L.).  In Telectronics, the plaintiffs
contended in a footnote to their brief, the judge certified
medical monitoring as a separate class without making any
distinction between the laws of the various jurisdictions.

         The plaintiffs maintained that the court must analyze each
legal issue individually to determine which state has the "most
significant relationship" to each claim.  The places where the
individual plaintiffs were injured do not play a major role, the
plaintiffs said, because where the plaintiffs were injured is
unrelated to the defendant's conduct, which occurred in
Pennsylvania.

         Defendant Wyeth Laboratories developed, tested, marketed and
placed the Norplant contraceptive into the stream of commerce in
Pennsylvania, the plaintiffs said.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs
said, Pennsylvania has the greatest number of relevant contacts
with the litigation.

         "In this case, virtually every act conducted by Wyeth which
renders it legally liable for the claims brought by the
plaintiffs occurred in Pennsylvania," the brief stated.  "Thus,
in accord with the choice of law in this jurisdiction, the Court
should select the law of Pennsylvania to uniformly govern
plaintiffs' medical monitoring claims."

         In support of medical monitoring relief, the plaintiffs said
they are suffering from physical symptoms such as excessive
menstrual bleeding, recurrent headaches, weight gain, hair loss,
depression and mood swings.  The plaintiffs said they are
concerned about other long-term medical problems that they may be
experiencing that cannot be detected without medical monitoring.

         "The acceptance of medical monitoring as a separate claim
for relief is the trend in the law and is clearly the law in
Pennsylvania, the principal place of business of Wyeth
Laboratories and the state which has the most significant
contacts with this litigation," the plaintiffs said.

         On the other hand, the defendants argued in their brief that
no law exists in the majority of the jurisdictions of the
plaintiffs in the Norplant multidistrict litigation that touches
upon the issue of medical monitoring.  The defendants argued that
the court must answer no for those class members from
jurisdictions that have not recognized medical monitoring as an
independent tort.

         After the Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' decision
recognizing a cause of action for medical monitoring in Paoli,
the defendants argued, another Pennsylvania court rejected the
Third Circuit's ruling.  In Addams v. Westinghouse Electric
Corp., No. 1340 C.D. 1988, slip op. at 16 (PA C.P. Ct., Mercer
Cty., July 30, 1993), the court held that "an action for medical
monitoring is inappropriate."

         "For this Court in this case to recognize a cause of action
for medical monitoring in 31 jurisdictions would be to replicate
these other courts' errors in a far grander scale," the
defendants maintained.

         The defendants argued that a nationwide Norplant class
action predicated upon state law claims such as medical
monitoring would be unmanageable and "would constitute an
unwarranted intrusion by a federal court into areas best left to
local courts resolving individual actions."

         "This problem " how to intuit and then apply the law of 64
jurisdictions " demonstrates that there is something
fundamentally wrong with the course plaintiffs would have this
Court chart," the defendants said.

         The court should deny the plaintiffs' request for class
certification prior to ruling on the defendants' motion to
dismiss, thereby eliminating the need to create the law for the
31 jurisdictions that never have addressed the issue of medical
monitoring, the defendants concluded.

         The plaintiffs' brief was submitted by Christopher M. Parks
of Parker, Parks & Rosenthal, L.L.P. in Port Arthur, TX.  The
defendants' brief was submitted by Lawrence Germer and Paul Gertz
of Germer & Gertz in Beaumont, TX; and by John W. Vardaman, F.
Lane Heard III and Steven M. Farina of Williams & Connolly in
Washington, DC.

TRANSFER OF NONDEBTOR CASES OPPOSED BY TX PLAINTIFFS, MS DOCTORS

         Breast implant plaintiffs from Johnson County, TX, and a
consortium of physicians from Mississippi late last month filed
with the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals their briefs
opposing the challenge of the nondebtor defendant-appellants of a
district court finding that breast implant claims against the
nondebtors are not related to the Dow Corning Corp. Chapter 11
case.  In re Dow Corning Corp.; Lindsey v. O'Brien, Tanski,
Tanser and Young et al., Nos. 95-2034, 95-2106, 95-2082, 95-2084,
and 95-2107 (6th Cir.).

         The appellees contend that U.S. District Judge Denise Page
Hood did not err in ruling that the jurisdiction of her court is
limited to only those cases that are related to the core
bankruptcy proceeding.  The district court properly held that
because the appellees' state law claims against the nondebtors
would not affect the administration of the bankruptcy estate, it
did not have jurisdiction to hear those actions under 28 U.S.C.
Section 1334(b), the appellees said.

         At issue is Judge Hood's Sept. 12 memorandum opinion and
order in which she held that her court does not have jurisdiction
over breast implant claims against nondebtor defendants.  Claims
against nondebtor defendants are not "related to" the Dow Corning
bankruptcy, the judge said, citing to Pacor, Inc. v. Higgins, 743
F.2d 984, 994 (3rd Cir. 1984).

         Citing again to Pacor, Judge Hood noted the similarity of
the cases and held that "there will be no contingent claim by the
Shareholders against the debtor for indemnification until such
time as a judgment is rendered and, then, the non-debtors would
still have to proceed with an entirely separate proceeding in
order to obtain indemnification from the Debtor under 11 U.S.C.
Section 502.  Joint tortfeasors are not indispensable parties in
the federal forum.  The Bankruptcy forum provides for a mechanism
to resolve the debtor's liability for indemnification should a
judgment be rendered against the Shareholders."

         The appellants contend that the judge's holding that she
lacks jurisdiction over breast implant claims against the
shareholders under 28 U.S.C. Section 1334(b) is "clearly wrong."
The Sixth Circuit has often found that "related to" jurisdiction
under Section 1334(b) is fairly broad and that jurisdiction
exists if the claims at issue may "conceivably" affect the
bankruptcy estate, the appellants said.

Mississippi Physicians

         The Mississippi Physicians argued that the appellants have
failed to show that judicial economy would be served by the
district court's retaining jurisdiction over the cases at issue.
Judge Hood properly decided that the district court need only
concern itself with the cases that are central to the
administration of the Dow Corning bankruptcy estate, the
appellees said.

         "The claims by the Plaintiffs against the Non-Debtor
Defendants for indemnification and/or for joint and severed
liability with Dow Corning are contingent," the appellees said.
"It is unnecessary to join all tortfeasors in one action.  There
is no evidence of the impact the state court litigation will have
on Dow Corning's bankruptcy estate.  Accordingly, this Court has
no interest in the state court litigation in which any proceeding
against Dow Corning is stayed by virtue of 11 U.S.C. Section
362."

         Further, the Mississippi Physicians said, "[s]ince the opt-
out cases are stayed as against Dow Corning, the bankruptcy
estate will not incur litigation costs, nor should any judgment
in favor of Plaintiffs against the Non-Debtor manufacturer
Defendants be binding on the Debtor or incur a cost to the
estate.  These cases are unrelated to the bankruptcy case, and
not subject to removal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1452.  Thus,
this Court should affirm the District Court's ruling that it had
no jurisdiction over the Non-Debtor's claims."

Johnson County Plaintiffs

         "The arguments of the Third Party Nondebtors that the claims
against them are 'related to' Dow Corning's bankruptcy are simply
disingenuous," the Johnson County plaintiffs argued.  "First, the
Third Party Nondebtors argue that the claims against them, if
allowed to proceed, will undermine Dow Corning's bankruptcy case.
However, the arguments offered in support of this allegation,
namely, their common law right of contribution from Dow Corning,
are without merit.  Indeed, the Third Party Nondebtors failed to
present any evidence to the District Court of even one single
case in any forum anywhere in the United States in which any of
the Nondebtors have filed a cross-claim against Dow Corning for
contribution, even though thousands of cases have been pending
against those same Third Party Nondebtors for almost four years!"

         The plaintiffs went on to argue that "[a]lthough there may
exist shared facts in cases against Dow Corning and those
asserted against the Third Party Nondebtors..., the plaintiffs in
the underlying state court proceedings have alleged that the
liability is joint and several, thus providing an independent
basis of liability as to the Third Party Nondebtors....  The only
possible effect the estate may sustain in the present proceeding
is the speculative diminution of potential estate assets by
virtue of the utilization of insurance defense proceeds."

         The Mississippi Physicians are represented by Chris J.
Walker, Delia Y. Robinson and J. Hale Freeland of Markow, Walker,
Reeves & Anderson, P.A. in Jackson, MS.

         The Johnson County plaintiffs are represented by Daniel W.
McDonald of McDonald, Clay & Crow, L.L.P. in Fort Worth; J. Mark
Howell and J. Kevin Clark of Clark & Howell in Fort Worth; Frank
Cain of Bowers & Cain in Fort Worth; Michael P. McGartland of

LAWYER NOT REQUIRED TO ANSWER SETTLEMENT QUESTIONS, COURT RULES

         A lawyer for Dow Corning Corp. is not required to answer the
Tort Claimants Committee's questions about whether the debtor
believes the amounts of settlements with breast implant
plaintiffs are reasonable, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J.
Spector ruled Dec. 1.  In re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512
(ED MI Bankr.).

         The Tort Claimants Committee is conducting a Rule 2004
examination of debtor Dow Corning Corp. (DCC).  The committee
asked DCC's managing trial counsel, Douglas Schoettinger, whether
he had any reason to believe that the amounts for which DCC
settled some 200 breast implant claims were not reasonable.
Schoettinger said yes, but then refused to provide further
information, invoking the work product privilege and attorney-
client privilege.  The committee sought to compel him to provide
further information, but Judge Spector denied the request.

         He said the committee failed to show that it could not
obtain the information from other sources.  Judge Spector also
found that DCC had not waived the privilege merely by saying it
had reason to believe the settlement amounts were unreasonable.

         "The Debtor has given no clear indication, nor do I see any
reason to assume, that it will be using privileged information in
an attempt to prove that the agreements are unreasonable," he
said.  "Thus there is no justification for making a finding of
waiver based on the 'truth-garbling' rationale.  One could posit
numerous ways in which the reasonableness of the settlements
could be determined through the use of objective, non-privileged
information."

CIBA IMPROPERLY LABELED CONTACT LENS SOLUTION, APPELLANT ARGUES

         Ciba Vision Corp., knowing that its AOSEPT contact lens
solution had been injuring hundreds of consumers, failed to
comply with Food and Drug Administration regulations that
required "common sense" in deciding to strengthen its product
warnings/labels, appellant Leslie Scott contended in reply to
Ciba's answer to her petition for review by the California
Supreme Court.  Scott v. Ciba Vision Corp., No. S049608 (CA Sup.
Ct.).

         Scott argued that she received no advance warning through a
consent form of the danger of misidentification of the product
containers of Ciba's AOSEPT solution, which contains hydrogen
peroxide, and saline solution.

         Scott brought suit against Ciba, alleging claims of strict
liability, negligence, failure to provide adequate warnings and
breach of implied warranty.  She claimed she had difficulty in
distinguishing Ciba's AOSEPT solution from its saline solution.
As a result of the indistinguishable bottles, Scott said she
suffered chemical burns to her eyes when she rinsed her contacts
in the AOSEPT solution.

         Around the time of her injury, Scott said, Ciba began to
market its AOSEPT solution with a red cap, but also continued to
market it in the old bottle, knowing that persons not wearing
their contact lenses would have trouble in distinguishing the two
bottles.

         The Santa Clara County Superior Court granted Ciba's motion
for summary judgment, finding that Scott's claims were preempted
by the Medical Devices Amendments (MDA) to the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act.  On appeal, the California Court of Appeal, Sixth
District, affirmed the trial court.

         Scott petitioned the state Supreme Court for review, arguing
that the only other state Supreme Court that has addressed the
issue of federal preemption of Class III devices concluded that
the plaintiff's claims were not preempted (Larsen v. Pacesetter
Systems, Inc. [Hawaii 1992], 837 P.2d 1273, 1281).

         In response, Ciba argued that approved labels and warnings
on medical devices are "specific requirements" of federal law
that preempt causes of action brought under state law.  The
company maintained that the appellate court's ruling was aligned
with a majority of jurisdictions that have held that federal law
preempts causes of action brought under state law.

         In her Nov. 27 reply, Scott said the Court of Appeals cited
two cases in its decision that are not relevant to this case.  In
Evraets v. Intermedics Intraocular, Inc. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th
779, and Powers v. Optical Radiation Corp. (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th
1444, the cases involved experimental products for which adequate
warnings were not yet known, Scott said.
                   Ciba's statements that this case is a "pure label and
warning case" and that Scott "makes no claim for any defect in
the design" are disingenuous and completely inaccurate, Scott
argued.

         "Respondent is well aware that Leslie Scott claims that the
design of the two virtually indistinguishable white product
containers containing harmful and harmless ingredients

SUIT ALLEGING MALFUNCTIONING PENILE IMPLANT IS SETTLED

         Noting that the case has been settled, U.S. District Judge
Jan E. DuBois of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania last month
dismissed as moot motions for and against summary judgment in a
personal injury action brought by an Arizona resident for
injuries allegedly sustained after surgical implantation of an
inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP).  Werner v. American Medical
Systems Inc. et al., No. 95-1856 (ED PA).

         Plaintiff James Werner received the implant on March 5,
1992, in an operation at a hospital in Harrisburg, PA.  Following
the surgery, Werner allegedly experienced side effects.  On
March 25, 1993, an attempt to remove an infected prosthesis was
unsuccessful.  Subsequently, a diagnosis of an infected
prosthesis was made, and another operation was performed to
remove it.  After the operation, the plaintiff was told he could
not receive an implant of a properly functioning prosthesis,
rendering him permanently impotent.

         In their motion for summary judgment, defendants American
Medical Systems Inc. and Pfizer Inc. argued that Werner knew of
his injury and its cause more than two years before he initiated
his suit.  Werner, on the other hand, argued that the statute of
limitations had been tolled by certification of a class action
suit in the Southern District of Ohio against American Medical
Systems and Pfizer Inc. concerning similar allegations involving
their IPP, and that claims of negligent design and strict
liability could proceed in any event because neither the Medical
Devices Amendments nor the Food and Drug Administration had
imposed specific design requirements on the device.

         Werner was represented by John P. Kopesky of Sheller, Ludwig
& Badey in Philadelphia.  The defendants were represented by John
W. Frazier, Richard G. Placey and Sally Ackerman King of
Montgomery, McCracken, Walker & Rhoads in Philadelphia, and by
Daniel J. Johnson, legal counsel to American Medical Systems Inc.

9TH CIRCUIT UPHOLDS INJUNCTION ON MANUFACTURER OF DEFIBRILLATORS

         A Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals panel on Dec. 28
affirmed a district court's issuance of an injunction against a
manufacturer of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) for
alleged violations of the Medical Device Recording (MDR)
regulations.  United States v. Laerdal Manufacturing Corp. et
al., No. 94-35780 (9th Cir.).

         The panel upheld the district court's findings that
defendant Laerdal Manufacturing Corp. failed to timely file a
report with the Food and Drug Administration after one of its
AEDs allegedly failed.

         The litigation involves a Laerdal AED that was applied in
June 1993 to a man in cardiac arrest in Grand Rapids, MI.  The
device allegedly did not apply any shock to the man's heart, and
the man died after the AED was disconnected and an ambulance crew
applied its own defibrillator.  Laerdal did eventually file a
report on the incident, but argued that the circumstances of the
incident did not make filing a report necessary.

         After the U.S. government filed suit against Laerdal, the
U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon determined that
the company had violated 21 C.F.R. Section 803(a)(1)(i), which
requires a manufacturer to file a report with the FDA whenever
information is received that suggests that a patient care device
may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury.

         Laerdal argued that the district court improperly imposed
the injunction because there was no cognizable danger that the
company would violate the MDR regulation in the future.  Laerdal
asserted that the Grand Rapids incident was an isolated incident
and that the company has taken the necessary steps to prevent
future violations.

         The Ninth Circuit rejected Laerdal's contention of the
isolation of the Grand Rapids incident.

         "The [district] court developed at length the facts
surrounding the incident in Grand Rapids that first brought
Laerdal's reporting practices to the FDA's attention, but the
court also found testimony in the record that Laerdal had
received complaints of other instances in which a Laerdal AED
failed to work properly," the panel said.

         The district court also found that Laerdal had an ongoing
history of not implementing proper FDA reporting procedures, the
panel said.

         "Even if the district court had found evidence of only one
violation, Laerdal is in error in asserting that one violation
provides insufficient grounds for granting an injunction," the
panel concluded.
                   The panel cited its decision in Burlington Northern Railroad
Co. v. Department of Revenue of the State of Washington, 934 F.2d
1064, 1074-5 (9th Cir. 1991).  In Burlington, the court
determined that a statutory injunction may be imposed when a
violation of a statute has been or is about to be committed.

         "Laerdal's repeated self-justification is sufficient to show
a likelihood of future violation," the panel stated.  "Even if
Laerdal had not intended to violate the regulation, its continued
insistence on justifying its actions in committing the violation
'is an important factor in deciding whether future violations are
sufficiently likely to warrant an injunction.'"

         The panel also rejected Laerdal's argument that the public
interest was not harmed because the FDA allegedly suffers from a
backlog in filing its reports and the Grand Rapids report would
have languished for several months before being filed.

         "The public interest addressed by the MDR regulations
centers not on the efficiency of the FDA, but on the attention
manufacturers pay to evidence that their products could be
causing or contributing to needless deaths," the panel stated.

         Representing the plaintiff was Craig J. Casey, Assistant
U.S. Attorney in Portland, OR, and Elizabeth Stein of the U.S.
Department of Justice in Washington, DC.  Counsel for Laerdal was
James F. Dulcich, Jeffrey D. Austin and James N. Westwood of
Miller, Nash, Wiener, Hager & Carlsen in Portland, OR; and by
Daniel G. Jarcho and Daniel E. Johnson of McKenna, Conner & Cuneo
in Washington, DC.

AHCPR Releases
Cataract Guidelines

Although it stops short of charging surgical overuse, a federally sponsored
clinical guideline for cataract management urges the use of glasses and
other visual aids before rushing a patient into surgery. In 1991, 1.35
million procedures were performed.

The presence of a cataract, a naturally occurring cloudiness of the eye,
"never solely justifies" surgery, says Dennis O'Day, MD, chairman of the
18-member panel commissioned by the Agency for Health Care Policy &
Research (AHCPR) to develop the guidelines. In most cases, surgery should
be performed only if patients feel their lifestyle is compromised or if
visual impairment isn't corrected by glasses or other interventions, says
the guideline. Claiming that tests currently used by ophthalmologists to
gauge if surgery is necessary don't work, O'Day argues, "ultimately, the
decision is made by the patient."

Ophthalmologists who perform cataract surgeries have an "ethical
obligation" to provide postoperative care, says the guideline. Although
some postop care can be delegated to other professionals, including nurses
and optometrists, the guideline recommends that the primary responsibility
for postop rehabilitation fall to the primary ophthalmologist.

The guideline enjoys wide support from ophthalmology groups, but the
American Optometric Assn. charges the document "largely ignores the
extensive and legitimate role of optometrists." AOA disputes that
ophthalmologists should be the only provider of postoperative care for
patients who have "clearly recovered" from surgery.

Carotid Endarterectomy Still Questionable

The latest study on surgery to prevent stroke deaths does little to clear
up controversy over the treatment. Whether carotid endarterectomy reduces
mortality remains uncertain despite the procedure's widespread use, say
researchers, blaming sample size for their lack of conclusions.

The prospective Veterans' Affairs study, reported in the Jan. 28 New
England Journal of Medicine, followed 444 men with asymptomatic carotid
stenosis at 11 VA medical centers nationwide between 1983 and 1991.
Carotid stenosis is a hardening of one of the two main arteries in the
neck. Endarterectomy is the surgical removal of atherosclerotic plaque from
the artery. In 1990, 68,000 endarterectomies were performed in the U.S.,
down from a peak of 107,000 in 1985.

The researchers set out to find endarterectomy's effect on stroke and on
transient monocular blindness and transient ischemic attacks, both warning
symptoms of carotid stenosis. The patients were randomly assigned to groups
treated either surgically or medically. Both groups were treated with
aspirin. In the surgical group, 4.7 percent suffered strokes, compared with
9.4 percent in the medical group, but the combined incidence of stroke and
death "showed no benefit from operative intervention."

Outcomes Leader
Is Key Clinton Adviser

Thomas Pyle, acting chairman of the new Health Outcomes Institute, has a
key role advising the Clinton Administration on health care system
infrastructure and support, including quality assurance.

Formerly CEO of the Harvard Community Health Plan, Pyle is listed as chair
of a White House working group on health reform in an undated internal
document obtained last week by F&G's Automated Medical Payments News.
According to the memo, the working group addressing "New System
Infrastructure and Support" is divided into two subgroups: one addressing
Quality Assurance and the other, Administration, Reimbursement and
Information Systems. Pyle is listed as chairing both.

Meanwhile, the formal announcement that Pyle is acting chair of the Health
Outcomes Institute -- the successor to InterStudy -- was made Feb. 8. The
Institute's board includes Pyle, William Goss of General Electric, Kermit
Knudsen, MD, of Scott & White Clinic, and Donald Steinwachs of Johns
Hopkins University (MOGA 1/11/93).

The Minnesota-based Institute promotes the "Outcomes Management System"
(OMS), originally developed under the leadership of Paul Ellwood, MD, when
he was at InterStudy. OMS relies on the generic SF-36 patient quality-of-
life instrument and condition-specific TyPE questionnaires, filled out by
treating physicians. Information is gathered before, during, and after
clinical interventions and surgeries. Proponents want this approach
incorporated into the "managed competition" reform proposal now being
developed by the Clinton Administration. They propose that the Institute
become the central repository for OMS information and disseminate it to
payers and consumers, as a quality check on large health plan providers
(MOGA 1/28, 2/11).

Other names included in the memo as members of a Quality Assurance sub-
group include former HCFA researcher Henry Krakauer, MD, HCFA Health
Standards & Quality Bureau Director Barbara Gagel, Institute of Medicine
researcher Kathleen Lohr, and AHCPR senior staffer Linda Demlo. One insider
said the group hasn't yet grappled with specific approaches like OMS. At
press time, Pyle was unavailable for comment.

Medicare Quality Studies
Shouldn't Get Too Elaborate -- HCFA

The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is telling Medicare PROs
not to get carried away with elaborate and costly quality-of-care studies.
That's the message of a Feb. 3 draft memo to PROs from HCFA Senior
Physician Adviser Stephen Jencks, M D, regarding implementation of HCFA's
"Health Care Quality Improvement Initiative," which is to be phased in to
PRO workplans beginning Apr. 1.

In collaborating on practice pattern analysis with local physicians and
hospitals, PROs should "avoid research and writing guidelines," says
Jencks. He calls that the responsibility of AHCPR, arguing that PROs should
choose manageable, time-limited projects that emphasize "direct human
contact" between PROs and local providers.

Jencks recommends that PROs look at, among other things, differential
diagnosis in stroke, underuse of breast and cervical cancer screening, and
DRG coding errors. PROs should focus on areas showing "substantial
variation" between local practice and existing guidelines promulgated by
medical specialty societies, says the memo.

Jencks' recommendation that PROs use existing specialty society guidelines
to study variation is likely to raise eyebrows in the research community.
Duke University Professor David Eddy, MD, RAND researcher Robert Brook, MD,
the U.S. General Accounting Office, and others all argue that these
guidelines often haven't been validated by outcomes research and vary
substantially in terms of the rigor with which they're developed. Brook has
been especially critical of guidelines developed in the absence of
substantial literature reviews.

Lee To Head Public Health Service

HHS Secretary Donna Shalala has selected Philip Lee, MD, as Asst. Secretary
for Health. The job involves managing the $21 billion Public Health
Service, which oversees the Agency for Health Care Policy & Research
(AHCPR).

Lee, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University
of California at San Francisco, currently heads the Physician Payment
Review Commission. The PPRC's 1992 Annual Report to Congress included a
section critical of AHCPR. The re port accused the agency of failing to
develop guidelines addressing the most costly and overused treatments and
procedures.

"The efforts of guideline developers are not guided by a consistent set of
priorities," said PPRC. The report called for closer scrutiny of how panels
deliberate, more disclosure of the underpinnings of panel findings, more
efficient literature searches, and attention to questionable procedures
like chest x-rays, colonoscopy, and appendectomy.

AHCPR Administrator J. Jarrett Clinton, MD, tells MOGA that despite budget
constraints, AHCPR is reordering its priorities to focus more on cost
issues than it did initially. He cites guidelines now in process addressing
smoking cessation and mammography. Clinton says he has made no secret of
his wish to stay in his current position, that he has heard nothing from
the new Administration, and that his relations with Lee are "excellent."

MN Blues Form Managed Care Network
For Elective Cardiac Procedures

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota (BCBSM) and its Blue Plus HMO have
formed a network of what they consider the state's 10 best cardiac care
providers in an effort to manage elective cardiac care procedures. The
Minnesota Blues say of their Project Health Vision Cardiac Network that for
"the first time in Minnesota, patient outcomes and other quality of care
measures have been used to select providers."

BCBSM used the MedisGroups data analysis and severity indexing system to
compare complication and mortality rates for a variety of cardiac
procedures among hospitals throughout the state. The providers chosen by
the combination insurer/HMO-style provider for its network average 15
deaths per 1,000 for cardiac procedures, compared with a statewide average
of 35 deaths per 1,000. BCBSM formed the network to provide cardiac
catheterization, electrophysiologic diagnostics, angioplasty, coronary
artery bypass grafts (CABG), and valve surgery -- all on an elective,
nonemergency basis.

"Our research showed wide variation in patient outcomes among cardiac care
providers" in the state, says Mark Banks, MD, senior VP of BCBSM and COO of
Blue Plus. In addition to the MedisGroups data, BCBSM chose the providers
according to their experience with the procedures and their "potential to
participate in a long term relationship with Blue Plus."

Blue Plus and BCBSM plan to use similar selection techniques over the next
few years to create networks for oncology, orthopedics, high-risk
maternity, neurology, and physical therapy.

All three of Minneapolis-St.Paul's major hospital systems are included in
the network, says Vic Ellison, VP of the Metropolitan Healthcare Council,
the Twin Cities' hospital association. A spokeperson from the statewide
Minnesota Hospital Assn. said "all of the major players" in the state are
involved in the network.

AHCPR Insures Guideline Developers,
Offers Legal Guidance to Panels

The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) has purchased
liability insurance to protect members of agency-sponsored guidelines
panels, should the guidelines they produce not hold up in court. To date,
AHCPR has spent approximately $150,000 for a policy that would cover
individuals or entire teams, including consultants, for up to $5 million,
says an agency spokesperson.

An AHCPR report on "The Use of Language in Clinical Practice Guidelines" is
expected to be released to the public in the next few months. A draft has
already been distributed to the federal guidelines panels and is now
winding its way through an elaborate clearance and revision process.

The report, like the four guideline sets the agency has released so far,
will include a "quick reference guide" and a longer monograph. These offer
"guidelines on developing guidelines" for teams concerned with the "legal
implications" of the language they are using. Written by George Washington
University's Center for Health Policy Research, it has sections devoted to
the legal significance of words, hazards inherent to guidelines drafting,
the importance of documenting all decisions that led to finalizing
guidelines, and actual legal cases that examined practice guidelines. The
report should become available "no later than June," says Kathleen
Hastings, director of the agency's Legal Medicine Program.

The Agency commissioned the report to calm fears expressed by AHCPR's own
guidelines panels, but the report should be useful for specialty societies
and others developing practice guidelines, says Hastings.
For more on legal issues in guideline development, see p. 7.

Maine Liability Project
May Include More Specialties

If legislation proposed in Maine late last month is signed into law, it
will expand the state's ground-breaking Medical Liability Demonstration
Project to allow inclusion of all medical specialties. Only four are
currently participating: anesthesiology, emergency medicine,
obstetrics/gynecology, and radiology.

At press time, the proposal was being reviewed by the state's banking and
insurance committee and awaiting a public hearing.

Under the current law, the first of its type in the country, physicians may
use proof of adherence to state panel-produced practice guidelines as an
"affirmative defense" in malpractice cases. The 1990 law called for a five-
year demonstration period beginning in January 1992, during which
defendants who signed on as participants can introduce evidence that they
followed one or more of the 20 protocols for the four specialties. The law
stipulated that the project would not begin unless more than half of the
state's practitioners in each of those specialties agreed to participate.
Among the specialties, enlistment has ranged "from 58 percent to almost 90
percent in ob/gyn," says Gordon Smith, counsel for the Maine Medical Assn.
Under the new proposal, any additional specialties that wished to
participate would also have to sign up over half of their members.

The law intends to lower medical costs in the state by stemming the tide of
defensive medicine. Similar laws have since been enacted in Minnesota,
Vermont, and Florida (see box on p. 8).

There have been no test cases so far under the five-year project, and the
likelihood that any will come soon is slim, says Smith. "These 20 protocols
deal with a very small portion of the medicine practiced in a small state
by a small number of physicians. We're glad to see (the other three states)
joining in because it's going to take a lot more data than we have to
examine the liability issue."

While liability seems to be the main focus of the Maine project, it's
important not to lose sight of the program's effect on patients, says
Robert Keller, MD, executive director of the Maine Medical Assessment
Foundation. He calls for a study documenting changes in patient outcomes
resulting from practitioners following the parameters.

CA Firms Start High-Tech Angioplasty Tests

Two California medical device manufacturers are launching separate clinical
trials focusing on percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)
outcomes. One study is designed to determine if patients with lesions
determined "significant" by angiography might benefit from drug therapy
over PTCA. The other study is designed to evaluate PTCA success when the
invasive nonsurgical procedure is performed by a combination
ultrasound/angioplasty device.

Mountain View-based Cardiometrics will test its ultrasound catheter, called
FloWire, in 14 hospitals across the country "to conclude that patients
whose coronary lesions don't impair blood flow are appropriately excluded
from angioplasty."

The prospective, controlled trial will randomize 425 patients with
"angiographically significant" lesions that do not impair blood flow to
groups receiving either angioplasty or drug therapy. "Our belief is that
angioplasty done on lesions that don't impair blood flow will not lead to
greater angina relief than medical therapy alone," says Nat Bowditch,
Cardiometrics marketing manager. The two groups will be assessed at 30
days, six months, and one year to determine whether symptoms are relieved
and patients' ability to perform a standardized exercise stress test.
Adverse event rates including coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG),
myocardial infarctions, and mortality will be compared. It is estimated
that 375,000 PTCAs were performed in the U.S last year at a cost of about
$10,000-$15,000 each.

Pleasanton-based EndoSonics is starting a randomized, multicenter clinical
trial of a projected 500 patients to test its combination ultrasound
catheter and balloon angioplasty device, called Oracle-Micro. EndoSonics
will test the effectiveness of PTCAs performed with the Oracle-Micro
against those performed with traditional PTCA devices, which do not offer
simultaneous ultrasound imaging. A six-month follow-up will compare
complication rates for the two groups. Complications from PTCA include
thrombosis, artery dissection, and acute reclosure, says EndoSonics
President Mike Henson.

Specialty Society Ready To Release
Parkinson's Disease Guidelines

The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is set to release its guidelines
for initial treatment of Parkinson's disease. A draft of the guidelines,
which were approved by the AAN's executive board this week, calls for using
levodopa as a front-line therapy because it is "usually the most effective"
of all the drugs indicated for alleviating symptoms. The draft lists the
advantages and drawbacks of the other drugs in relation to levodopa.

The AAN says it developed the guidelines because of current variations and
controversy surrounding initial treatment. The group describes initial
therapy as the first two years of treatment following diagnosis. The
recommendations are based on a literature search of 818 articles and
textbooks and were approved by consensus of AAN experts.

The guidelines caution that treatment must be tailored to each patient and
that prolonged follow-up is necessary to recognize and adjust for
medication side effects. Doctors are told to encourage physical activity
and watch for signs of depression. In addition to treatment
recommendations, the guidelines contain recommendations for future
research, including outcomes studies to assess the benefits of physical
therapy.

MN Managed Care Firm Tests
Substance Abuse Outcomes Measures

A managed mental health care firm is launching a nationwide pilot study to
test a system for measuring substance abuse treatment outcomes. Ultimately
the system will be used to create what developers call "empirically based
standards of care" for providers.

Minneapolis-based MCC Behavioral Care, a subsidiary of Cigna, commissioned
a team of researchers at the University of Minnesota to construct a
database for ongoing analysis of care and its effects on patient recovery,
cravings, and relapses. MCC will use the database to measure clinical,
medical, behavioral, emotional, and economic outcomes. Factors measured
include abuse levels, quality of life, social functioning, employment
status, medical status, and duration of abstinence.

The project aims to separate the effects of treatment from other influences
on outcomes, gauge success rates for various treatment approaches, examine
variations among therapists, and determine cost-effectiveness of treatment.
Patients' pretreatment baseline data will be compared with posttreatment
data.

The firm also plans to use the data to tell employers if they are spending
enough, or too much, on substance abuse treatment. The Institute for a
Drug-Free Workplace estimates U.S. employers lose $60 billion a year
through drug abuse-related accidents, medical claims, absenteeism, theft,
and lost productivity.

MCC plans to analyze the pilot data in October, when it will begin to
expand the program to all its sites. The MCC network includes 1,500
inpatient and outpatient facilities. MCC covers 5 million individuals. It
estimates 150,000 to 250,000 of those individuals will have substance abuse
problems each year.

The project aims to set scientific standards in an area of care
traditionally viewed as rife with ambiguity. "Until now care has been based
on clinical judgment. In the '90s, we are finally beginning to practice
empirical health care," says Robert Kane, MD, head of the research team at
the University of Minnesota's Center for Health Services Research and
Policy. Once the pilot study for the substance abuse system is over and the
program is in place throughout the network, MCC says it will begin work on
similar systems for depression and anxiety.

Vasectomy May Increase
Risk of Prostate Cancer

Two studies of a total of 73,000 men point to a link between vasectomy and
an elevated risk of developing prostate cancer. Researchers say the cancer
risk increases over time following the procedure, but they are unable to
pinpoint the correlation's cause. In light of the studies' findings, the
American Urological Assn. (AUA) is recommending that younger vasectomized
men follow guidelines established by the AUA and the American Cancer
Society for early detection of prostate cancer in men ages 50 -70.

The NIH-sponsored studies, one prospective and one retrospective, found
that men who had a vasectomy more than 20 years ago have up to an 89
percent "elevated risk" of developing prostate cancer. Both studies,
conducted by Edward Giovannucci, MD, of Harvard University and Brigham and
Women's Hospital, and colleagues appeared in the Feb. 17 Journal of the
American Medical Association.

The prospective study began in 1986 and compared 10,055 40- to 75-year-old
health professionals who had had a vasectomy with 37,800 similar men who
had not. Three hundred cases of prostate cancer appeared in the
vasectomized group between 1986 and 19 90. This group had no previous
cancer history. Baseline data were taken at the study's outset, and follow-
up questionnaires were collected in 1988 and 1990. The overall increased
risk of prostate cancer in the vasectomy group is 66 percent -- a figure
that rises to 85 percent 22 years post-vasectomy.

The retrospective study used a questionnaire that had been administered in
1976. Researchers followed up in 1989 with reports on 13,034 men with
vasectomies and 12,306 without. The researchers found an overall 56 percent
increase in prostate cancer for the vasectomy group. It was in this group
that the risk rose to 89 percent 20 years post-vasectomy.

"The mechanisms that might link vasectomy and risk of prostate cancer
remain undefined," the researchers say. The studies were designed to rule
out "detection bias" and causal effects from smoking, alcohol consumption,
level of physical activity, diet, educational level, body mass index, and
geographical area of residence. Because the risk factors for prostate
cancer remain unknown, the researchers say it is "impossible" to "ensure
that the true risk factors" were equally distributed among the cohorts.

While the researchers argue that the increased risk over time rules out
better detection in vasectomized men, "bias was not properly addressed,"
says Marc Goldstein, MD, director of male reproduction and microsurgery at
the New York Hospital/Cornell University's department of urology. Goldstein
says that because all the vasectomized men had seen a urologist pre- and
post-surgery, "Diagnosis of prostate cancer goes up. This clearly explains
the difference."

The AUA immediately released an official statement upon the studies'
publication that warns the suggested relationship "does not mean that men
who have had a vasectomy should seek a reversal of the procedure" because
"the data are far too preliminary ." Four previous studies found a link
between vasectomy and prostate cancer, while three others did not.

The AUA does caution, however, "If vasectomy is a risk factor for prostate
cancer, people need to know and informed choices need to be made." Prostate
cancer is now the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men.
One in 11 men in the United States will develop prostate cancer, the
majority of whom will not have had a vasectomy. More than 15 percent of
American men over 40 have had a vasectomy.

The AUA/ACS guidelines for men between the ages of 50 and 70 advise annual
rectal examinations and testing for serum prostatic antigen levels. The AUA
is now saying that men who had a vasectomy more than 20 years ago, or when
they were over 40 years old, should get exams and tests regardless of their
age.

Guidelines in the Courtroom:
Great Expectations

I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine. I've
recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines
and if they follow these guidelines, it raises the presumption that they
didn't do anything wrong. -- Bill Clinton, presidential debate, Oct. 15,
1992.

As policymakers prepare to attack health care costs with various proposals,
many are lining up malpractice spending in their sights. The weapon most of
them are aiming: practice guidelines.

Recent estimates place potential savings from malpractice reform at a
projected $36 billion over the next five years. It is still unclear,
however, whether better guidelines would indeed lower the cash awards and
number of malpractice cases through fostering better care, or whether they
would serve to increase malpractice awards and cases by giving plaintiffs'
attorneys more ammunition in court.

"I am currently working on an Administration task force looking at
malpractice reform, and we are definitely examining practice guidelines as
alternatives," Kathleen Hastings, director of the Agency for Health Care
Policy & Research's (AHCPR) Legal Medicine Program, told a gathering of
policymakers and analysts earlier this month in Washington DC.

The group, convened by the Assn. of Academic Health Centers (AHC) to
investigate the rapidly growing bond between guidelines and the law,
explored topics including whether federally produced guidelines would soon
take legal precedence over those produced by states and private
organizations. The AHC is a not-for-profit health care education
organization with over 100 institutional members in the United States and
Canada.

Maine is the first state to battle malpractice costs with a legal defense
for physicians who follow state-sponsored guidelines. The federal
government taking that same route "is possible but not likely," says Gordon
Smith, legal counsel to the Maine Medical Assn. and chief expert on the
Maine law, pointing to the U.S.' tradition of handling tort laws on a
state-by-state basis.

The move in most states' courtrooms, however, has been toward acceptance of
standards produced on a national level, whether by government agency or
specialty society, says Troyen Brennan, MD. A national approach must
account for regional differences in standards of care, such as those in
rural areas versus inner cities; conflicting standards, such as
disagreements over mammography screening; and uneven resource distribution,
cautions Brennan, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical
School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. AHCPR's Hastings counters that
nationally produced guidelines "can be tailored to a local level later."

The American Medical Assn. wants to see guidelines legislation for
malpractice defense remain at the state level, at least for now. The
science of guidelines creation is "still in its infancy, not reliable
enough to mandate nationally," says Ed Hirshfeld, the AMA's associate
general counsel for health law.

Hirshfeld told the group that the AMA's policy asserts that guidelines,
which it calls parameters, should retain their current status alongside
peer-reviewed studies and expert witnesses as "simply one source of
evidence" among many that judges and juries should consider in malpractice
cases. The AMA is concerned that mandating practice patterns nationwide
might stifle creativity in clinical research, technology, and drug
development, and other "experimentation in the margins," creating a
chilling effect. Mandating standards of care on a national level would also
damage efforts to fine-tune those standards, Hirshfeld says.

One advantage of the Maine law, which has yet to be tested in court, is
that it will stop "the battle of the experts" on the witness stand, says
Smith. Maine's "affirmative defense" stands in contrast to President
Clinton's recommendation of raising "presumption" against physician
wrongdoing, because presumption will leave the defense wide open for
rebuttal from plaintiff's attorneys and their hired guns, Smith predicts.

Conflicting testimony on scientific evidence that points in several
directions already has courts in a quandary, says Franklin Zweig, senior
staff scientist at George Washington University's Center for Health Policy
Research. Merely blocking attempts to weave guidelines into federal law
"won't stop the issue from being litigated in courts," warns Zweig, who
recommends health care professionals take advantage of this early stage in
guidelines litigation by moving forward to educate trial judges so they
can recognize valid, scientifically sound practices.

Judges are ripe for educational efforts, says Zweig. In a recent random-
sample survey conducted by his Center, trial judges rated medical practice
guidelines as third among topics for which they want more information.
Alcoholism science and genetic-based criminal evidence came in first and
second. Zweig attributes this desire to know more to the growing number and
complexity of health-related cases currently winding their way through the
courts. Many of those cases will soon have practice guidelines as their
main core of evidence, regardless of who created them or whether they are
mandated. -- D.S.

Three States Join Maine
With Malpractice Defense Laws

Maine was the first state to pass legislation tying practice guidelines to
malpractice defense. To date, three other states have approached the
'guidelines as defense' arena as part of state health care reform
legislation:

Vermont's Universal Access statute, passed in 1992 and awaiting adoption in
Jan. 1994, will allow practice guidelines "recognized by state law" as
admissible evidence in cases judging whether a provider "met or failed to
meet the applicable standard of care." The state calls upon provider
organizations, hospitals, and quality assurance programs to draft the state
guidelines. The statute also establishes a nonbinding arbitration system
for all medical liability claims.

Under its Health Care Reform Act of 1992, Florida mandates the "adoption
and implementation" of "scientifically sound medical practice parameters"
to eliminate "unwarranted" variations in health care delivery. Physicians
participating in a demonstration project between June of this year and Oct.
1, 1998, will be able to use compliance with the parameters as an
"affirmative defense" similar to the one established in Maine. The statute
also calls for periodic reviews and revisions of the parameters to ensure
they are based on the latest scientific findings. The state plans to
address overall tort reform in upcoming legislative sessions.

As part of its reform legislation, Minnesota's 1992 HealthRight Act
established a program to develop, adopt, revise, and disseminate practice
parameters, drawing from those developed within the state and those created
by AHCPR and national specialty societies. Under the Act, adherence to the
state-sanctioned guidelines is an "absolute defense" giving the defendant
an automatic win -- a sharp contrast to Maine's "affirmative defense." The
absolute defense is suspended in cases involving delay in diagnosis,
misdiagnosis, inappropriate application of the parameter, or failure to
obtain informed consent.

HEAT ON US ANALGESICS AS BAYER LAUNCHES ACTRON

Bayer has launched Actron, its OTC version of the non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory, ketoprofen, onto an already crowded US market for
headache.

Actron is entering the non-prescription market two months after
Whitehall-Robins' rival ketoprofen brand, Orudis KT, and 18 months
after Procter-Syntex' NSAI switch, Aleve (naproxen sodium), shook up
the intensely competitive analgesic segment.

So far the principle that being first to market is crucial to the long-
term success of switches appears to be confirmed by Johnson &
Johnson/Merck's H2-antagonist, Pepcid AC (famotidine) - a product that
was something of an also-ran in prescription drug terms.

Pepcid has managed to maintain around a seven per cent market share
differential over SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet HB (cimetidine) by
arriving first, Merck & Co senior vice-president Judy Lewent told
securities analysts in mid-December.

"Thanks to Merck research, Pepcid was first on the market because,
quite frankly, Tagamet had better name recognition. If Pepcid had come
in second, that would have been a challenge", she said.

Small but powerful

Bayer announced on 8 January that Actron was available in drug, food
and mass merchandise retail outlets throughout the US. Both versions of
ketoprofen were approved for OTC switching by the Food and Drug
Administration on 6 October 1995 (OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 32,
page 3).

Actron is being promoted in full-page newspaper advertisements in top
20 markets and USA Today, as well as in television adverts featuring
the theme, "Actron. It's so small because it's so powerful."

Bayer sees size as a key selling point - Actron is 7ml in diameter, at
least one-third smaller than (Whitehall's) Advil, (Johnson & Johnson's)
Extra Strength Tylenol and Orudis KT tablets.

The company is supplying a full array of promotional materials,
including "Try Me Free" displays in many retail outlets. This will
enable consumers to purchase one 24-tablet bottle with full-price
rebate during the introductory period.

Gary Balkema, president of Bayer Consumer Care in the US, said the
launch was the single biggest in the division's history.

"We're excited to be launching Actron because it represents a
meaningful new choice in OTC pain relief", he commented. "Actron's
powerful medicine offers effectiveness against many types of pain. And
its unique size gives a new, tangible benefit for consumers: it's easy
to swallow."

Bayer appears to be counting on its Aspirin legacy to give the new
brand vital leverage in the analgesics market.

"With Bayer Aspirin, this company brought the first branded analgesic
to the consumer marketplace almost 100 years ago. Now with Actron,
we're poised to significantly impact the analgesics category again as
we approach the 21st century", Mr Balkema said.

A recent survey conducted by Bayer found there was "more than enough
room in the very competitive OTC analgesics market for a differentiated
new entry like Actron", he added.

Unmet need

This study confirmed that 89 per cent of American adults suffer from
aches and pains each year but more than a third of these do not at
present take medication to help relieve the pain. The average adult
spends one of every five days - or a total of more than two months each
year - in pain, the survey found.

"Because analgesics can work differently in many individuals, we think
offering Actron as a new choice with ketoprofen in a unique new size
will go a long way towards serving unmet consumer need", Mr Balkema
asserted.

Merck & Co's comments on Pepcid AC were made to securities analysts on
12 December 1995. Ms Lewent said the brand was the leading US acid
relief product with a market share of 22 per cent at the end of
November, successfully thwarting the challenge from Tagamet HB.

SmithKline Beecham maintains, however, that its product is performing
extremely well in the US market. Analysts' estimates put Tagamet HB
sales at around $3 million per week, only slightly behind Pepcid AC.

Ms Lewent presented Nielsen data indicating that Pepcid AC climbed to
the number one spot in the $1 billion antacid market within one month
of its OTC launch in June 1994. When Tagamet HB was subsequently
introduced in mid-August, it leapt to number one, the Nielsen data
showed.

Pepcid AC regained the lead in late September and was holding onto it
as of 25 November, the Merck official said.

According to the Nielsen data, Tagamet HB then dipped to third place -
just behind SB's older antacid, Tums - with about a 13 per cent market
share. J&J/Merck's Mylanta held just over 10 per cent of the segment.

Most successful OTC?

Ms Lewent described Pepcid AC as "the most successful launch in US OTC
history. The big initial push ... for Tagamet HB was the direct result
of very heavy couponing", she noted.

"The significant market expansion that we are seeing validates the
theory that bringing an established prescription product with a
significant franchise into the OTC market can transform the marketplace
and revitalise growth", the Merck official told analysts.

Pepcid slightly widened its lead in the week ended 2 December 1995,
according to the company's figures. The brand's most recently quoted
market share was 24 per cent compared with 12 per cent for Tagamet HB.

Despite the strong initial sales, Merck & Co does not expect to see
substantial profits from Pepcid AC until the end of the decade because
of heavy promotional spending, Ms Lewent said.

SB BUYS INTO GERMAN MASS MARKET

SmithKline Beecham prepared for Christmas by fattening up its German
OTC business with a DM203 million ($142 million) agreement to purchase
Abtei Pharma-Vertriebs GmbH, a distributor of vitamin and mineral
supplements (VMS) and natural remedies.

The acquisition sees SB widen its consumer healthcare interests in
Germany - previously centred on oral care and the pharmacy sector - to
take in grocery outlets, where Abtei is the leading OTC presence,
SmithKline says.

Assuming approval by the Federal Cartel Office, the transaction will
also make SB the leading consumer healthcare company in Germany, it
adds.

Based in Bielefeld, Westphalia, Abtei is a family-owned concern founded
in 1972 (although the Abtei brand dates back to the last century). It
has a workforce of 125. Last year Abtei registered sales of DM130
million compared with DM110 million in 1994.

The company's product range includes vitamin and mineral supplements,
natural medicines, dietary products and skincare. Around half of its
portfolio is licensed medicines and the rest food and vitamin
supplements.

Abtei holds a 20 per cent share of a German OTC grocery market valued
at DM550 million (manufacturers' selling prices).

Oral care profile

To date, SmithKline has been associated mainly with oral care in
Germany, and it is the market leader in this category, the company
noted. Its existing German subsidiaries are Lingner & Fischer, which
sells oral hygiene products, and Fink, ranked sixth in the pharmacy OTC
market.

This latest acquisition will boost SB's share of the German healthcare
market by 25 per cent.

Abtei will both complement and consolidate SmithKline's pharmacy VMS
business, which includes leading brands such as Eunova multivitamins,
Cetebe (vitamin C) and Granufink for urological indications, offering
potential to divert SB pharmacy brands through Abtei's grocery channels
and visa versa.

The move into the mass market does not signal a particular European
strategy but is rather country-specific, and reflects Germany's
propensity for preventative healthcare, SB told OTC Business News.

However, Peter Jensen, chairman of SmithKline Beecham Consumer
Healthcare Europe, said the OTC division would undertake "a full
analysis of the market opportunity for the (Abtei) products across
Europe and elsewhere".

"With the increasing consumer awareness of positive "well-being"
healthcare and with ageing populations in the developed world, we
consider that natural medicines and health supplements have tremendous
potential for expansion, and our track record has demonstrated SB's
ability to reach the target consumers', he commented.

SB estimates the European OTC grocery market at #1.5 billion "and
growing".

No short-term changes

SmithKline will retain the Abtei brand and says it does not plan any
short-term changes in the German company's operations. It has given
undertakings to consult Abtei's management on any future restructuring.

Manufacturing for Abtei is contracted out, and these arrangements will
remain in place after the acquisition.

The German company had been looking for a partner to help it expand
further on the domestic and international health shop and pharmacy
markets, said managing director Andreas Sarhage.

SB had the resources to support Abtei on the medical and scientific
front, and to bolster its international product development, he added.

The deal suggests that relatively modest, targeted acquisitions are the
way into the German OTC market, which is regarded as somewhat
impenetrable.

Boots Healthcare International has made no secret of its ambition to
buy up a German OTC presence but to date has cited price levels as a
persistent deterrent.

FEMSTAT SECOND SWITCH FOR PROCTER-SYNTEX

Procter-Syntex is preparing a spring launch for its second prescription-
to-OTC switch, Femstat 3 vaginal cream (butoconazole nitrate 2 per
cent).

Cleared for OTC use by the Food and Drug Administration on 27 December
1995, Femstat will be the first and only three-day treatment for
vaginal yeast infections available without a prescription in the US,
said Procter & Gamble, which will market the product to physicians and
other health professionals as well as direct to consumers.

All of the current OTC options for vaginal yeast infection require
seven days of treatment, P&G noted, adding that clinical trials had
shown Femstat 3 to be as safe and effective as Johnson & Johnson's
Monistat 7, the leading brand in an estimated $250 million US market
for OTC vaginal antifungals (IIR retail figures, November 1995).

Butoconazole nitrate was first launched on prescription in 1986 and has
been marketed as a three-day regimen by Syntex (now part of Roche) as
Femstat and Femstat Prefill. The US patent on butoconazole for fungal
infections expires in March 1997; Procter-Syntex will now gain three
years of marketing exclusivity for Femstat 3.

Prescription Femstat will be withdrawn from the US market once its OTC
derivative is launched, P&G said.

The non-prescription version was developed by The Procter-Syntex Health
Products Company, the US joint venture that brought its first switch,
Aleve (naproxen sodium), to market in June 1994. Femstat will be
manufactured for OTC sale by Roche.

An NDA for the prescription-to-OTC switch was filed with the FDA on 20
December 1993. Because the safety and efficacy data were comparable
with seven-day OTC yeast treatments, Femstat 3 did not have to undergo
advisory committee review, P&G told OTC Business News.

Creams preferred

Femstat 3 will be available in US pharmacies, drugstores, supermarkets
and mass merchandise outlets in a 5g prefilled disposable applicator,
with three applicators packaged together as a per-day treatment
regimen. The cream will also be sold in a 20g tube packaged with three
disposable cardboard applicators.

According to P&G, its research indicates that more than 50 per cent of
women would rather buy vaginal creams than suppositories. "This plays
out in the marketplace, where nearly 70 per cent of OTC vaginal yeast
infection products sold are in the form of creams", the company
commented.

It stressed that Femstat 3 is for treating the recurrent symptoms of
previously diagnosed vaginal yeast infection: first-time sufferers
should consult a doctor.

A physician should also be contacted if there is abdominal pain, fever
or a foul-smelling discharge; if the infection does not clear up in
three days or symptoms return within two months; or if the sufferer
thinks she has been exposed to the HIV virus.

Women who are (or believe they may be) pregnant should not use Femstat
3, the labelling points out. The product is also contraindicated in
women who are HIV-positive, diabetics and girls under 12 years old.

Clinical evidence

More than 13 million women worldwide have been treated with
butoconazole nitrate for vaginal yeast infections. In 45 clinical
studies involving a total of 5,289 patients, the drug-related incidence
of local adverse reactions (eg, burning and itching) with butoconazole
was equivalent to that of Monistat 7, P&G said.

Two controlled clinical trials conducted in support of the switch
application showed that a three-day regimen of butoconazole nitrate 2
per cent (more than 300 patients were evaluated) was as safe and
effective as seven days of miconazole nitrate 2 per cent cream
(Monistat 7, also tested on more than 300 patients) in combating
vulvovaginal candidiasis when assessed at eight and 30 days post-
treatment, the company added.

According to P&G, the incidence of vulvovaginal candidiasis in the US
nearly doubled between 1980 and 1990, to 13 million cases per year.

Handsome payoff

Vaginal antifungal switches have paid off handsomely in the US. The
first such product to reach the market, Schering-Plough's Gyne-
Lotrimin, grew from a $27 million brand prescription to generate $115
million in OTC sales.

However, Gyme-lotrimin is now relegated firmly to second place in the
OTC vaginal antifungal segment, with a market share of 15.7 per cent
compared with Monistat's 49.9 per cent.

ASTRA WEIGHS UP BUDESONIDE OPTIONS

Astra Pharmaceuticals has yet to decide on an OTC marketing strategy
for budesonide, the corticosteroid that was cleared for UK sale as a
pharmacy-only medicine for hayfever by the Medicines Control Agency at
the end of last year.

Astra confirmed that a budesonide licence had been issued but would say
no more as yet about how it might proceed with a P version. The company
does not have an OTC division.

The approved indication is for the prevention and treatment of seasonal
allergic rhinitis in adults and children aged over 12 years (OTC
Business News Vol 2, Issue 29, page 7).

Astra sells budesonide on prescription in the UK for the treatment of
perennial, allergic and vasomotor rhinitis in nasal aerosol and nasal
spray formulations (as Rhinocort and Rhinocort Aqua respectively). The
UK P licence is for non-aerosol administration.

NEW DRUGSTORES FORMAT PAYING OFF AT LLOYDS?

Despite a 3.5 per cent decline in like-for-like sales by its troubled
drugstores division in the second quarter, those stores already
operating under the new health and beauty format "registered higher
numbers of customers and increased sales" against the same quarter of
1994, said Lloyds Chemists.

The UK company took a #13.4 million provision last year to reorganise
its Supersave chain, which recorded a #3.7 million loss before tax in
the year to June 1995 compared with a #1.2 million profit in 1993/94
(OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 33, page 8).

The re-think involved closing more than one third of the Supersave
outlets, converting some of them into the more fruitful Holland &
Barrett format (like-for-like sales up 10.3 per cent in the second
quarter), and incorporating some 175 stores into the chemists division
with a health and beauty profile.

Without adjustment for closures, drugstore sales were down by 29.1 per
cent in the first and 45.9 per cent in the second quarter of 1995/96.
In the half year to December, sales through the drugstores fell by 37.9
per cent to #29.6 million (the like-for-like decline was 6 per cent).

The overall picture was happier for Lloyds: total sales rose by 2.4 per
cent and 2.1 per cent in the quarter and half year respectively. Like-
for-like sales in the chemists division were 5.9 per cent ahead (+0.9
per cent in the first quarter), with growth in both prescription and
cash sales.

BELGIAN INDUSTRY FEARS BLOCK ON ADVERTS

OTC companies in Belgium fear the new system of approval for television
and radio advertisements may be so restrictive that many adverts will
never reach the screen.

The system, introduced last year to bring Belgium into line with the
European Union's advertising Directive (92/28/EEC), means OTC
manufacturers can now legally advertise their products nationwide,
formalising what had already been common practice at regional level.

But advertisements must be approved before they can be broadcast. A new
body, the Commission de Controle de la publicite des medicaments
(commission for the control of medicines advertising), is charged with
vetting adverts and then making recommendations to the Minister of
Public Health on whether they may be screened (OTC Business News Vol 1,
Issue 23, page 1).

During its first two months of operation, the commission is believed to
have given positive recommendations on several advertisements. However,
the Minister may still disregard the commission's advice and refuse to
grant screening authorisations.

Ministerial opposition

Fears that this might happen have been given credence by recent
ministerial statements voicing opposition to any advertising of OTC
products on television. One industry source commented that the
government may do everything in its power to make advertising as
difficult as possible.

But with the first advertising 'visas' likely to be granted within the
next few weeks, the Belgian pharmaceutical industry association, AGIM,
is adopting a "wait and see" approach.

The new procedures are likely to continue coming under attack from OTC
companies, which object in principle to the prior approval requirement
for advertisements.

And, as a Belgian source noted, the system is a headache for companies
that want to run pan-European advertising campaigns.

The costs of the vetting procedure, which are met by prospective
advertisers, have also come under fire - particularly the charge of
BFr25,000 ($846) for the renewal of a two-year advertising licence.

As the source commented: "It's just a question of putting the right
stamp on the right papers."

IBUPROFEN AND CLOTRIMAZOLE NOW OFFICIALLY GSL

Ibuprofen and topical clotrimazole are now formally cleared for general
over-the-counter sale in the UK.

Amendments to the General Sale Order releasing the ingredients from
pharmacy-only (P) control in specified strengths and quantities went
through on 29 December 1995, taking effect from 1 January 1996.

This was despite strong reservations voiced by UK pharmacists and their
representatives, who have raised concerns about unsupervised use of
ibuprofen and clotrimazole leading to drug interactions or serious side-
effects in special cases such as asthmatics.

The amendments were put out for consultation last summer after
pharmacists' hackles were raised by a temporary GSL approval
unexpectedly granted to Galpharm's 200mg ibuprofen tablets (OTC
Business News Vol 2, Issue 26, page 1).

Pharmacist resentment has already prompted two companies to backtrack
on plans to launch GSL versions of ibuprofen, although Crookes
Healthcare (Boots), the UK brand leader with Nurofen, has held firm to
its intention of entering the grocery market.

In September Zyma Healthcare (Ciba), which had already secured a
temporary exemption from pharmacy-only status, decided to restrict its
ibuprofen brand, Proflex, to pharmacy distribution. Subsequently
Dendron announced that it would maintain its topical ibuprofen,
Ibuleve, as a pharmacy-only product.

The UK Medicines Control Agency (MCA) recently held out an olive branch
to pharmacists by proposing to establish a standardised P-to-GSL
procedure, similar to that already operating for POM-to-P switches -
although this concept is opposed by the OTC industry on confidentiality
grounds (OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 33, page 10).

GSL specifications

The GSL amendments specify that ibuprofen for oral administration must
be limited to adults and children aged over 12 years, and that: the
indications are for rheumatic and muscular pain, backache, neuralgia,
migraine, headache, dental pain, dysmenorrhea, feverishness and
symptoms of cold and influenza; the maximum dose is 400mg; and the
maximum daily dose is 1200mg.

The 12 years and over stipulation also applies to topical ibuprofen
when on general sale. Additional restrictions are that the indications
are for relief of rheumatic pain and muscular aches, and of pains and
swellings such as strains, sprains and sports injuries; the maximum
strength is 5 per cent; the maximum dose is 125mg; and the maximum
daily dose is 500mg.

GSL clotrimazole is limited to external use. The indication must be for
athlete's foot and the maximum strength 1 per cent.

The MCA has also specified maximum pack or container sizes for the new
GSL medicines: 12 X 200mg units for oral ibuprofen; not more than 2.5mg
per pack for topical ibuprofen; and not more than 500mg per pack for
topical clotrimazole.

Questioned wisdom

John Ferguson, secretary and registrar of the Royal Pharmaceutical
Society of Great Britain, questioned the wisdom of adding further
medicines to the General Sale List.

UK law recognised that the public should have ready access to informed
advice when considering whether to use a non-prescription drug, he
said, adding that this was particularly important for people suffering
from certain medical conditions and for pregnant women.

Citing concerns about ibuprofen's potential to provoke asthma attacks
even at low doses, he asked who would offer advice on side-effects or
drug interactions "at the supermarket checkout or garage forecourt".

Moreover, Mr Ferguson said, he could not see the justification for
wider availability of clotrimazole, as athlete's foot was unlikely to
require urgent attention. There was also a risk of people buying GSL
clotrimazole products to treat other fungal infections, "for which, in
law, they would still need to be obtained from a pharmacy so that
professional advice would be available".

"This is a serious issue with implications for the management and
enforcement of the licensing of medicines in this country. The Society
is looking for clarification on how the government intends to ensure
that conditions attached to the licences for these products are
enforced", Mr Ferguson stated.

The MCA insisted, however, that the patient information leaflets (PILs)
now mandatory with new or amended medicines licences would provide a
buffer against misuse. Licensed GSL medicines are obliged to carry
safety information either on packaging or a PIL.

The licensing authority has also cleared for general sale a higher dose
of folic acid (500mcg as opposed to the current ceiling of 400mcg); and
various minor ingredients such as benzoin tincture compound in pastille
form, equisetum, magnesium alginate, choline bitartrate, capsicum
oleoresin and capsicum (water soluble).

Nurofen imminent

The MCA has seen a growing number of applications for GSL ibuprofen.
Crookes Healthcare told OTC Business News that it obtained a temporary
approval for Nurofen (ie, by the same route as Galpharm) in the week of
12 December 1995.

GSL Nurofen will be on the shelves soon, the company said. The patient
leaflet will include full information on side-effects and
contra indications, in line with the provision for P Nurofen, it added.

Branded versions of 1 per cent clotrimazole on the UK OTC market are
Bayer Consumer Care's Canesten Cream and Crookes Healthcare's more
recent line extension, Mycil Gold Clotrimazole.

Both companies, however, said they had no current plans to move their
products into the GSL sector.

An application to market GSL clotrimazole was made by Scholl Consumer
Products, which already sells a range of treatments for athlete's foot
in the UK containing 1 per cent tolnaftate.

The company confirmed to OTC Business News that it had secured approval
for GSL clotrimazole, and said it was reviewing whether to take the
licence further. A decision is expected shortly.

WHICH? SLAMS PHARMACISTS AGAIN

Which? magazine has once again taken UK pharmacists to task over their
supervision of pharmacy (P) medicine sales.

In their latest snap survey, the Consumers Association (CA) researchers
found that nearly half the pharmacy staff approached "sold the wrong
drugs or failed to give the right advice", Which? said.

The CA has decided to oppose any further prescription-to-OTC switches
until it is confident that its concerns about P medicine supervision
have been fully addressed.

Although the issue has been bubbling under since Which? ran its last
critical report in June 1994 (OTC Business News Vol 1, Issue 1, page
14), this was the second time in less than a month that consumer
research had cast doubt on the protocols for P medicine sales
introduced at the beginning of 1995.

Shortly before Christmas, a radio broadcast by the BBC consumer
programme, You and Yours, drew similarly damning conclusions about
protocol adherence after running tests at 40 pharmacies around the UK.

But pharmacy representatives, while admitting that some of the findings
are cause for concern,
have attacked the surveys as failing to grasp
the realities of the pharmacist/consumer relationship.

Nurofen test

Five (anonymous) Which? researchers were sent to 10 pharmacies around
the UK with specific brand or treatment requests as well as a prepared
history of symptoms and concomitant drug use.

With Crookes Healthcare's Nurofen, the test was predicated on the
potential of ibuprofen to interact with methotraxate, a prescription
drug for psoriasis, or to aggravate the symptoms of asthma.

The researcher was told to say, if asked, that she did not suffer from
asthma but was taking other medication. If further questioned, she was
instructed to say she was on methotraxate.

Seven out of 10 pharmacies wrongly sold the researcher Nurofen, Which?
reported. In two of these no questions were asked, while in one a sales
assistant enquired whether the customer was on medication but did not
ask what it was, and subsequently sold her Nurofen.

In three of the outlets the pharmacist was involved in the interaction
and was aware that the researcher was taking methotraxate, but still
sold her Nurofen. The researcher was asked if she suffered from asthma
in six of the pharmacies.

The pharmacist was alerted to the request for a P medicine in only five
of the eight cases where the researcher was served by a sales
assistant, Which? added.

These findings are particularly worrying in view of the decision to
allow ibuprofen to go on general sale, the magazine commented (see
separate story on page 6).

It agrees with the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain
(RPSGB) that ibuprofen should remain subject to pharmacist supervision.
"However, our research shows that, even in pharmacies, it's often being
sold without these safety checks", Which? said.

Crookes Healthcare, noted that the failings highlighted by Which?
largely concerned pharmacy assistants. The issue of P medicine
supervision was being looked at constantly, and the company would work
to ensure both that assistants understood their role and that this role
was made easy for them, it said.

Canesten let-down

Three versions of Bayer's Canesten are available across the pharmacy
counter in the UK: a 500mg clotrimazole pessary and a 10 per cent
cream, both for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis (thrush); and a 1
per cent cream, for the external treatment of fungal and candidal skin
infections.

Bayer recently supplemented these with the Canesten Combi pack (one
pessary plus a tube of 1 per cent cream) for treating both the cause
and symptoms of thrush.

First-time sufferers should be referred to a GP before being sold
Canesten or other OTC products for thrush. "If there are other symptoms
that are not the normal symptoms of thrush, like pain in the lower
abdomen, there could be a more serious problem, such as pelvic
inflammatory disease, which would need treatment by a GP", Which?
noted.

The magazine's researcher asked for Canesten by name but did not
specify which version she wanted or what it was for. She was detailed
to say, if asked, that she had not used Canesten before, nor had
experienced these symptoms previously. If referred to the pharmacist,
the researcher was to say (again, if asked) that she had not consulted
her GP and that the symptoms included lower stomach pain.

In only one out of 10 cases was the researcher referred to her GP -
after the sales assistant serving her had consulted the pharmacist. In
the one instance where she was served by the pharmacist, the researcher
was asked about her symptoms and described lower stomach pain, but was
not referred to a doctor.

In nine out of 10 cases the researcher was not asked whether she had
used Canesten before. Two of the pharmacy assistants asked no questions
at all before selling the product, Which? found.

In five cases the only question asked by the sales assistant was
whether the customer wanted Canesten cream or pessary. In six cases the
researcher was sold the Canesten 1 per cent cream, "which is the least
effective preparation for treating thrush", the magazine said.

Which? described its findings as "deplorable", commenting that "staff
in all but one of these pharmacies let their customers down badly".

Bayer Consumer Care said it had recognised ever since the original OTC
Canesten was launched that the product required proper consultation.
The company had invested a "huge amount of time and money" in training
courses and distance learning packs for pharmacy staff.

Bayer ran its own anonymous survey at around the same time as the first
Which? report and discovered some confusion in pharmacies about which
version of Canesten to sell. The company had stepped up its training at
that point and would be doing "more of the same", it told OTC Business
News.

It noted that the new Canesten Combi pack, which it says is the most
appropriate format for treating thrush, is performing very well and
appears to be clarifying the issue of product choice for pharmacists.

Tagamet better

Tagamet 100 fared somewhat better, although there was "still plenty of
room for improvement", Which? cautioned.

The exercise was again premised on the potential for drug interactions
- in this case with the anti-asthmatic, phyllocontin. It also picked up
on fears that indigestion in the middle-aged and elderly may be a
pointer to gastric cancer.

The researcher, a middle-aged man, was detailed to tell the pharmacist
or sales assistant that he had not taken Tagamet before nor had
previously suffered from indigestion. This was his first attack and it
had been coming and going for a week.

If asked about other medication, the researcher was to mention
phyllocontin. "The pharmacist should have told him to go and see his
GP. In the meantime, he should not have been sold Tagamet - if any drug
was suggested, it should have been an alternative", Which? said.

In the event, only two out of 10 pharmacists sold the researcher
Tagamet 100 - one without asking any questions and the other despite
being told that the customer was on phyllocontin. Seven pharmacists
offered an alternative to the brand and one refused to sell any drug,
telling the researcher to see his doctor immediately.

Five of the pharmacists instructed the researcher to see a doctor if
his symptoms persisted. But in four cases the pharmacist failed to ask
whether the customer had suffered indigestion before and did not refer
him to a GP.

Diarrhoea/hayfever

Another Which? researcher asked for advice on how to treat diarrhoea.
If questioned, he described symptoms that had persisted for a few weeks
and told pharmacy staff he had recently visited South East Asia - at
which point, Which? said, "he should have been sent to a doctor
immediately. Oral rehydration salts might have helped but anti-
diarrhoeal drugs would not have been much use."

The researcher was "asked all the relevant questions" and told to see a
GP in seven out of 10 cases. In one other instance he was told to visit
his doctor if the symptoms did not abate.

In two of these eight cases the pharmacist or sales assistant refused
to sell the Which? researcher any medicine. In four cases he was sold
oral rehydration salts, in one Imodium (a prescription-to-OTC switch of
loperamide), and in another both Arret (also loperamide) and oral
rehydration salts.

In two cases the customer was not referred to a GP and was simply sold
Imodium.

A hayfever enquiry was designed to test whether someone taking the
antidepressant, amitriptyline, would be steered away from Triludan
(terfenadine), since the two drugs in combination can aggravate heart
problems.

The researcher sought a recommendation for hayfever and in five out of
10 cases, the sales assistant failed to establish that another drug was
being used.

Triludan was sold in five cases, in two of these despite the pharmacist
knowing that the customer was taking amitriptyline. The sales assistant
discussed the request with a pharmacist in six cases.

Pharmacists in crisis?

Under the headline "Pharmacists in crisis", Which? commented: "We have
criticised pharmacists in the past for failing to protect consumers
from the dangers of non-prescription drugs. Unfortunately the service
is still not measuring up ... and now it matters more than ever."

"More and more drugs are coming off prescription and being heavily
promoted by the drug industry", Which? said. "At the same time, over-
secretive licensing laws do not allow the public to know whether such
moves are safe for consumers."

Which? encouraged consumers, in the absence of intervention, to
describe their symptoms to pharmacists as well as any action taken and
whether they were already on medication or had a pre-existing medical
condition.

This advice was welcomed by the RPSGB, which in a statement noted that
pharmacists trying to implement the new protocols "meet with resistance
and in some cases even hostility from some customers who do not wish to
discuss their symptoms".

The pharmacists' body did not agree, however, with all the conclusions
of the Which? report, saying: "In some cases the report had been
critical of the level and content of advice given and of the provision
of products that it would have been perfectly proper for the pharmacist
to supply in all circumstances."

In fact, the survey showed that "the public could have confidence in
the service provided by pharmacists, who in order to help them provide
the best service were now clearly asking for more information from
people requesting a medicine by name", the Society maintained.

It was concerned, however, by the cases where pharmacists appeared to
be asking no questions at all.

Professional judgment

Roger Odd, head of the RPSGB's practice division, said pharmacists had
to make their own assessment of specific cases, in the same way as
doctors. The P medicine protocols were there to provide guidance only.

Nonetheless, the Society is reviewing the protocol situation to make
sure pharmacy staff are aware which questions they should or should not
be asking, Mr Odd told OTC Business News. But the RPSGB does not
anticipate amending the guidelines in the light of the Which? report.

The Society's position was supported by Boots The Chemists (BTC), the
largest pharmacy chain in the UK - although it noted that no Boots
outlets were mentioned in the Which? report.

"The introduction of new protocols in all Boots pharmacies, backed up
by intensive training of all our pharmacy and healthcare staff, is a
major priority for us and we invest in excess of #4 million per year on
Healthcare training", BTC stated.

It also stressed that pharmacists had to use their professional
judgment rather than automatically running through a list of questions.

Customers give out "visual signals" in their interaction with counter
staff, and quite often these will be at least observed by a pharmacist,
commented public relations manager Sharon Buckle. Moreover, if
consumers asked for a specific product, they need not necessarily be
quizzed on whether they had taken it before.

The feedback from BTC's own stores and customers was that the
pharmacist's role was highly valued, Ms Buckle told OTC Business News.

GERMAN PHARMACY SALES UP 3.7 PER CENT

The German market for OTC medicines sold via pharmacies grew by 3.7 per
cent to DM7 billion ($4.9 billion) between September 1994 and August
1995.

Direct supply by manufacturers bypassing wholesalers accounted for 14.9
per cent of the sales by value and 22.5 per cent by volume, according
to data given in the annual report of Anzag.

In its pharmacy business the German wholesaler focuses particularly on
the OTC sector and is hence facing competition from manufacturers that
opt for direct delivery of non-prescription drugs.

However, direct OTC business in Germany declined by 1.4 per cent to DM1
billion at manufacturers' prices last year, Anzag said.

Overall, the pharmaceutical wholesale market expanded by 7.2 per cent
to DM27.3 billion (excluding value added tax) in the year to August
1995, according to Anzag's figures. Growth was more pronounced in
eastern Germany (up 8.2 per cent to DM5.1 billion) than in the western
part of the country (DM22.2 billion, +6.9 per cent).

Anzag's share

Anzag's share of the total wholesale market stands at 16.1 per cent. It
expects to see its turnover lift by 3-4 per cent in the current
financial year, as the German market recovers from the negative impact
of the healthcare reform legislation introduced in 1993.

The company recorded profit after tax of DM32.3 million in 1994/95 -
slightly down on the DM33 million achieved in the previous year - on
turnover of DM4.06 billion.

Peter Haac, chairman of the Anzag board, said the company would further
develop the marketing services it offers to pharmacists.

Of the 8,000 pharmacies supplied by Anzag, 2,000 make use of the
company's marketing package, which combines the delivery of selected
OTC medicines, display materials and customer leaflets with Anzag's
advertising campaigns.

Anzag has been beefing up its OTC advertising strategies since 1994,
mostly through pharmacy displays but also in the print media.

GROWTH SLOWING IN UK MEDICATED SKINCARE?

The UK market for medicated skincare products is maturing, and growth
is expected to slow from an impressive 39.2 per cent in 1990-1994 to
five per cent in the years to the end of the decade.

UK sales reached #89 million in 1994 and should climb to #95 million by
the year 2000, according to a new report by MarketLine, Global
Medicated Skincare.

The surge in value during 1990-94 was largely driven by acne remedies
and therapeutic moisturisers, respectively the largest (37.6 per cent
of total sales) and second-largest (30.5 per cent) segments of the
medicated skincare market, MarketLine says.

Therapeutic moisturisers have been particularly dynamic, growing by a
cumulative 81.3 per cent over the five-year period, but both categories
have been gaining market share at the expense of antifungals, anti-
itching products and haemorrhoid treatments.

MarketLine gives the following estimates for sales and growth by
category in 1990-94:

UK Medicated Skincare Market by Sector

              Sales (# million)             % compound

preparations
Total         64.0  71.6  77.3  85.3  89.1        7.4

In the acne remedies segment, Clearasil is the brand leader in a
concentrated market where the top three manufacturers account for more
than 90 per cent of sales.

"Smaller brands are suffering as a result of strong brand recognition
of the major acne remedies and the heavy advertising used to support
such products", MarketLine comments.

It adds that market concentration and the brand loyalties built up
among teenagers generally make for rather static brand shares.

MarketLine believes therapeutic moisturisers will remain the most
energetic segment of the UK market over the next five years.

"Growth in this sector will be due mainly to a move towards premium
products", the researchers predict.
Sluggish performers

The most sluggish performers will be acne remedies, because of a lack
of new products in this area, they say.

FDA APPROVAL FOR ZANTAC SWITCH

Glaxo Wellcome's Zantac is poised to become the third H2-antagonist
option for US consumers in the OTC market for heartburn.

The Food and Drug Administration approved OTC Zantac late last year and
the product will be launched sometime during the first quarter of 1996.

It will be marketed as Zantac 75 (ranitidine hydrochloride 75mg) by
Warner Wellcome Consumer Healthcare in packs of four, 10, and 20
tablets.

Zantac was the third H2-antagonist to be approved for OTC use by the
FDA during 1995: Johnson & Johnson/Merck's Pepcid AC (famotidine) was
cleared on 28 April and SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet HB (cimetidine) on
19 June.

Warner Wellcome is confident, however, that a late start will not deter
it from becoming the market leader.

"The world's leading prescription H2-antagonist over the last five
years is now poised to take its rightful place in the over-the-counter
heartburn market", said Robert Casale, vice president, gastrointestinal
marketing.

$250 million potential

Zantac has generated 200 million prescriptions in the US since 1983 and
Warner Wellcome expects the OTC version to be among those drugs most
frequently recommended by pharmacists.

The product could bring in sales of around $250 million by the end of
the decade, according to UK analysts Paul Krikler and Mark Tracey of
Goldman Sachs International.

They believe Tagamet HB sales in the US are running at "a spectacular
rate of $3 million per week", slightly behind Pepcid AC.

"Broadly speaking, these products have expanded the roughly $1 billion
US market for OTC acid-disease remedies by around 40 per cent to 50 per
cent since their launch earlier this year. We expect further share
gains for these newer products, although this may increasingly come at
the expense of the non-H2-antagonist therapies", the analysts comment.

The Zantac 75 launch will be propelled by the biggest marketing
campaign in Warner Wellcome's history. US advertising is being handled
by J Walter Thompson.

The OTC joint venture expects to repeat its success with Zantac 75 in
the UK market, where sales have overtaken both Pepcid AC and Tagamet
100 despite Zantac being introduced almost a year later than its
competitors.

By its fifth month on the UK market, Zantac had captured a 50 per cent
share of the OTC H2-antagonist segment.

Consumer expectation

Mr Casale noted that US sales of OTC stomach remedies over a 22-week
period rose by 27 per cent after the H2s became available without
prescription. "We expect that growth will continue with the
introduction of Zantac 75", he said.

"Our research has shown that heartburn sufferers are looking forward to
buying a product with the characteristics of Zantac 75: wide
acceptance, prescription heritage and familiarity. We expect that high
consumer expectation will translate into even higher retailer
excitement", Mr Casale commented.

The recommended dose for adults and children aged 12 years and over is
one 75mg tablet, not to exceed two tablets in 24 hours. Zantac 75 will
have no interaction warnings (unlike Tagamet HB) and, when used as
directed, can be taken at the maximum dose daily for up to two weeks.

The Zantac 75 approval came just as Warner-Lambert signed a letter of
intent to purchase Glaxo Wellcome's interest in the Warner Wellcome
joint venture for $1.05 billion (OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 36,
page 1).

The companies are also restructuring their marketing alliance for Glaxo
Wellcome's prescription-to-OTC switches, including Zantac. Profits and
marketing costs will continue to be split 50:50, with Glaxo Wellcome
receiving a royalty on sales.

FDA FINAL MONOGRAPH UPDATE

Three final OTC drug monographs were published by the US Food and Drug
Administration during l995.

These were for the categories of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
(adopted 24 April); cough/cold combinations (27 July); and otic -
swimmer's ear (16 August).

Several monographs are expected to come up by spring of this year.
These include documents on antidiarrhoeals, laxatives, anticaries,
antiflatulents and poison treatments.

Monographs on skin protectants, weight control products and internal
analgesics are also expected to be finalised sometime in 1996.

SIX US SWITCHES IN 1995

The US Food and Drug Administration was remarkably active in approving
prescription-to-OTC switches during l995.

Six prescription drugs, the largest number in over a decade, were
granted approval to switch to OTC status. 1996 also looks promising, as
four drugs have been recommended for OTC switching by FDA advisory
committees.

Stomach remedies led the switch list in 1995, with three winning
approval, followed by two internal analgesics and one treatment for
vaginal yeast infection.

28 September 1995.

* Nicorette, SmithKline Beecham's nicotine gum (2mg and 4mg, licensed
from Pharmacia & Upjohn), recommended on 28 September 1995.

* Pharmacia & Upjohn's hair regrowth treatment, Rogaine (minoxidil 2
per cent), recommended for approval on 17 November 1995.

The dandruff shampoo, ketoconazole, is also awaiting FDA approval. It
was cleared for switching by the agency's advisors on 16 February 1994.

FDA SITS OUT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

The US Food and Drug Administration's OTC drug office had a remarkably
quiet Christmas holiday season. No announcements were made, no meetings
scheduled, no rules promulgated and no enforcement actions reported.

But the inactivity was not, as many thought, a symptom of the historic
US government shutdown, which affected the Department of Health and
Human Services.
History the reason

"History is the reason", explained Don McLearn, FDA deputy associate
commissioner  for public affairs.

The agency's budget falls under the Department of Agriculture, one of
the few departments to receive an appropriation, and the FDA has hence
been fully operational.

While the agency's positioning within the executive branch has been
altered to the relevant departments of health (Health, Education and
Welfare - now the Department of Health and Human Services), its budget
has stayed under agriculture.

The powerful chairs of the Congressional agricultural appropriations
committees have fought successfully over the years to retain
jurisdiction over the FDA budget - primarily to ensure that the agency
would remain concerned with food adulteration and insecticides.
Essential employees

Mr McLearn seemed pleased to explain the FDA's budgetary history rather
than answer the many enquiries he has received about the "essential
nature" of its employees.

The government shutdown required essential workers to report to their
agencies while others were furloughed.

The FDA's critics apparently thought the budget standoff gave them a
chance to learn how many of the agency's employees were 'inessential'.

WHOSE STANDARDS? ADVERTISING IN SOUTH EAST ASIA

If the growth surge in South East Asia has created a ready market for
premium-priced western OTC brands, reaching the consumers with new
money in their pockets can be an uphill struggle.

It is not just a question of geography and the unevenness of
distribution routes across the region. Multinationals complain that
their competitive edge in what consultant Nicholas Hall calls the
"world's fastest growing OTC market" is blunted by cumbersome,
unpredictable and paternalistic controls on advertising.

In common with other regions where a western-style OTC sector is only
just beginning to coalesce, and 'self-prescription' is rife, there are
wide divergences in both the range of products that can be advertised
to the public and the claims that can be made on them.

But one consistent feature of the South East Asian markets is a
preference for pre-vetting of OTC adverts.

Marketers of international brands claim these systems are non-
transparent (and, by implication, protectionist), bureaucratic and
corrupt, with some adverts taking anything from two to eight months to
gain clearance: a potentially disastrous scenario when it comes to
scheduling product launches.

It was hardly surprising, then, to see so much energy spent at the
WFPMM's 2nd Asia Pacific Regional Meeting in Bangkok on promoting the
kind of self-regulatory and message-led framework now installed in the
majority of western markets.
Different priorities?

It could be argued that the health authorities in Thailand and other
South East Asian countries have different priorities from their
counterparts in the more developed OTC markets - that what appears
paternalistic in Western eyes is inextricable from issues of education,
awareness, wealth distribution and regulatory enforcement.

As Margaretha Helling-Borda, director of the World Health
Organisation's (WHO) Action Programme on Essential Drugs, said in
Bangkok, self-medication is about a "whole matrix" of socio-economic
and health factors affecting purchase.

Some, however, view the advertising restrictions in South East Asia as
bureaucracy pure and simple.

One country manager commented to OTC Business News: "In my opinion
external factors such as literacy are not a barrier to a more liberal
advertising environment. Instead, the bureaucracy ... is locked in
regulations which relate to historical accident more than any realistic
assessment of the level of development of consumers."

Moreover, there is a fear that governments in South East Asia may
offset encouragement of self-medication with demands for comprehensive
advertising information on ingredients, usage, side-effects, etc, under
the influence of the WHO's ethical criteria for drug promotion - taking
the opposite path from European countries that have moved to eliminate
full disclosure requirements.

The international industry says the WHO guidelines were formulated by
doctors and largely for doctor, not consumer, promotion. And the
prevalence of doctor dispensing in South East Asia means the profession
has a direct financial stake in resisting any swing to self-medication.

Against disclosure

The arguments against full disclosure were marshalled in Bangkok by
Peter Glynn-Jones, chairman of the WFPMM and managing director,
strategic development for SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare.

OTC advertising can at best convey one or two messages such as the name
and function of the product, he said. Research proves that it is "just
not possible" to inform consumers about contra indications or side-
effects through adverts, Mr Glynn-Jones maintained.

Last August the Pharmaceutical Producers Association of Thailand (PPA)
sponsored an advertisising research project at the Chulalongkorn
University Faculty of Communication Arts. This found that Thai
consumers responded favourably to an "always read the label" direction
on adverts for SmithKline Beecham's cold remedy, Contac 400.

Two other versions of the ad carried either no written instruction or
the full text of labelling for Contac 400 (which is a prescription-only
medicine in Thailand).

On a mean scale, the "read the label" version drew the most positive
reaction in the poll, in which each advert was viewed by 200 out of a
total 600 selected Bangkok residents of mixed age, income, education,
etc.

Nonetheless, 83 per cent of all the respondents saw advantages in
having written texts in OTC adverts (52 per cent of these because they
"provide the right way to take a medicine"), while 72 per cent
identified disadvantages (39 per cent of them because of "too much
information").

This suggests avenues for further research on exactly how much
information is desirable in advertising. At the same time, the
researchers found that 97 per cent of the Bangkok poll obtained medical
information through reading product labelling.
Carte blanche

At present Thailand has no full disclosure requirement for OTC
advertisements. But the broad regulatory authority invested in the Thai
Food and Drug Administration is seen as giving the agency carte blanche
to clamp down on the expressive devices - music, testimonials, 'before'
and 'after' images, depictions of discomfort - conventionally employed
by OTC advertisers in the west.

Exacerbating these restrictions, local sources say, is a refusal to
consider precedents when reviewing advertising applications. Moreover,
any problems that emerge must be cleared up before the FDA will proceed
with the review, adding months to the approval timetable.

At the same time, OTC Business News was told, some companies sidestep
the controls by advertising live on radio in rural areas. "The
international companies feel bound to obey the regulations but the
local companies are more entrepreneurial", one executive commented.

From a multinational perspective, the Philippines offers the most
palatable system. Again there is pre-control but it is administered by
a review board that includes representatives of advertisers as well as
consumer groups, and works with predetermined criteria (eg, are the
claims technically supportable, in good taste, non-disparaging).

The board meets several nights a week and reviews are generally
completed in a single session. An appeals procedure is available if
objections arise once the advertisement has gone public.

Otherwise experience is mixed. Singapore and Malaysia are regarded as
relatively unproblematic, with similar committee systems to the
Philippines if a slightly less brisk turnover of applications. Vietnam
does not regulate veracity or accuracy of advertising content but
applies 'political' censorship.

The divergence of allowable claims or images - for example, an advert
for a stomach remedy may conclude with a smiling customer in one
country and impassively in another if 'relief' cannot be shown -
inevitably adds to the cost of reworking material from market to
market.

Longer-term dividends

For those manufacturers that can build brand loyalty in South East
Asia, the longer-term dividends could be substantial.

Addressing a meeting last summer of the Proprietary Medicines
Association of Australia in Canberra, Mr Hall, chairman and chief
executive officer of Nicholas Hall and Company, predicted that the
total OTC market in South East Asia would double to around $6 billion
by 2004, with growth (from a relatively small base) of 305 per cent in
China and 211 per cent in Indonesia.

A recent report by Euromonitor estimates that the market has expanded
by 46 per cent since 1990, with the Philippines showing the fastest
rate of growth (132.3 per cent) followed by Thailand (110.7 per cent)
and Indonesia (80.9 per cent).

But it would take a hardened optimist to expect any rapid shift towards
a harmonised environment for OTC advertisers in South East Asia. As yet
there is little indication of any regional pattern in drug regulatory
trends.

For example, Singapore's move to switch some 80 medicines from
prescription- to pharmacy-only status, and to make an even larger group
available for general sale, appears an isolated case. In other South
East Asian markets the tendency is still to restrict fairly routine OTC
ingredients to prescription-only use.

One problem, local observers say, is the insularity of drug regulators
in the region. And since the OTC market is as often as not something of
an undefined quantity, there is little incentive to look at how it
operates in other countries.

Moreover, the kind of state-funded healthcare systems that are now
weighing heavily on government finances in Europe have not been the
norm in South East Asia, so there has not been the same economic
rationale for stimulating self-care.

A standardised split into prescription and non-prescription drug
categories might clear some space to define new rules for advertising
OTCs. But the adoption of anything approaching European-style
classification could be years away.

The Thai regulators, for their part, show little sign of modifying the
country's two-stream system of 'dangerous' and 'non-dangerous' drugs.

Non-dangerous products are effectively OTC in Thailand, since they can
be advertised to the general public. But the PPA would rather see a
separate category for self-medication, with formalised procedures for
advertising, labelling, packaging and patient information.

Industry observers say the 'dangerous' classification is a misnomer as
long as products such as oral contraceptives and psychotropics are
freely available in Thai pharmacies.
Global harmonisation?

Even in the European Union, where the advertising Directive (92/28/EEC)
adopted in 1992 has generally liberalised the conditions for OTC
marketers, some member states such as Belgium have clung onto their pre-
control authority in regulating adverts for OTC medicines (this was one
element that the Directive left to national discretion).

Summing up the European regulatory achievements in Bangkok and noting
their considerable impact on legislative reform in Central and Eastern
Europe, Dr Hubertus Cranz, director of the European OTC association,
AESGP, asked if these experiences might not be applied on a global
scale.

In the past, harmonisation in the self-medication market has been
complicated by the strong influence of traditional medicines, Dr Cranz
commented. However, over the last decade the balance has tipped towards
more 'international' OTCs, particularly in the light of consolidation
within the industry and the large market shares captured by
prescription-to-OTC switches.

Dr Cranz suggested that a viable route to worldwide harmonisation might
be standard-setting through guidelines that could be used as the basis
for national procedures. The WFPMM had long since embarked on this
process, through its Guidelines on Drug Promotion.

But it was particularly important that the political climate was right
for broadening the context of harmonisation, he added. "Therefore it is
significant that the WHO recently reinforced its position on the
importance of responsible self-medication and enlarged its statements
on the appropriate use of non-prescription medicines", Dr Cranz said
(see OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 29, page 15).

Nonetheless, he was cautious about the prospects for harmonisation of
advertising regulations.

A great deal of research has been conducted on "reasonable" rules for
advertising OTC products and in particular on the information that can
be conveyed through adverts, he noted.

"Again, in the sense of standard-setting, it might be worth taking
such rules as a basis for considerations in countries which have often,
due to their tradition, been more restrictive", Dr Cranz proposed.

But, he went on to state, there are "certainly many areas in the
regulatory environment of non-prescription medicines which are not
suitable for harmonisation; particularly evident are the areas of
distribution of OTC medicines ... or the systems controlling public OTC
advertising."

A similarly pragmatic line was taken in a panel discussion by Dr Jerome
Reinstein, director general of the WFPMM, who advised against
developing countries moving immediately to a self-regulatory system of
advertising control.

This required the agreement of trade association members to a set of
standards and codes, and some industry associations were not yet strong
or unified enough to achieve this, he commented.

(So far Australia and New Zealand are the only countries in the Asia
Pacific region that have a discrete OTC industry association - Ed).

Moreover, governments in emerging OTC markets must feel that "industry
has earned the right to self-regulation", Dr Reinstein said.
Gulf in interests

The issue is further muddied by the gulf between local and
multinational interests in `developing' markets.

One illustration is the adoption of a self-regulatory Code of Marketing
Practices by the Thai PPA in August 1994 (OTC Business News Vol 1,
Issue 5, page 14).

While the Code is undoubtedly closer to international practice (it is a
requirement of WFPMM membership that member associations have their own
effective advertising code), its real impact is questionable. Not only
are the guidelines more lenient than the government regulations in
force but around 80 per cent of the Thai OTC market is controlled by
non-PPA members.

Many of these are local generic players that, over the years, are
likely to have found ways of working with the pre-control system. The
multinational industry is now focusing on issues of product quality and
information provision in a bid to assert the superiority of its brands
over generic competitors.

A similar national/multinational split is seen in the Philippines,
where one local company holds around 25 per cent of the OTC market.
However, in Indonesia the local industry association has agreed to
collaborate with international companies - a far cry from a few years
back when the multinationals were not even allowed to attend local
association meetings.

The Thai PPA also reports some positive signals from the Bangkok
meeting, with Food and Drug Administration officials requesting copies
of presentations and talking about the need to look at OTC developments
in other markets. A new, younger head of the FDA appointed last October
(Prof Dr Pakdee Pothisiri) is seen as another harbinger of a more
international mindset.

Education or persuasion?

The drive towards regulatory harmonisation in Europe was largely a
matter of market access - the free movement of goods as laid down by
the Treaty of Rome. How much, and indeed whether, consumers benefit
from a broader range of OTC products depends on assumptions about their
ability to make informed choices, with appropriate steerage from
pharmacists or, in some cases, doctors.

These issues are more sharply defined in South East Asia, particularly
as in Indonesia, for example, pharmacies are relatively thin on the
ground and an estimated 35-40 per cent of OTC sales go through non-drug
outlets (see OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 35, page 19).

Mary Murray, who has worked on national drug policies in Australia and
other Asia Pacific markets, warned at the WFPMM meeting that many
consumers in developing countries do not recognise symptoms and rely on
the family unit for guidance. Moreover, both literacy and health
knowledge decline in line with economic status.

And Janne Graham, former chairwoman of the Consumers' Health Forum of
Australia, said recent research in her home country revealed that
people living just above the poverty line had to make "real choices
between medicines and food on a daily basis".

On the contrary, Steven Grossman, senior vice-president and director of
health policy at US advertisers Hill & Knowlton, saw health awareness
benefiting from a more liberal advertising climate.

"I believe that the sophistication of American consumers about health
matters is a result of advertising, not, as some would have it, a
precondition of allowing advertising to occur", he told the meeting.

Mr Grossman went on to argue that wide availability coupled with broad
public knowledge of OTC medicines was likely to check inappropriate
usage - and keep prices down.

"Even when a primary goal of an advertisement is the creation of
immediate product demand, it is usually consistent with public health
goals because the advertising directs the consumer to a product that
resolves their health concern in a safe and effective manner", he said.

Mr Grossman cited a 1992 survey by the Heller Research Group for the US
Non prescription Drug Manufacturers Association, which found that nearly
seven out of 10 respondents preferred, if at all possible, to combat
symptoms without recourse to medication; and that close to nine in 10
US consumers knew medicines should only be taken when absolutely
necessary.

Co-regulation?

But a more co-operative approach to squaring corporate and consumer
interests in OTC advertising was suggested by the Australian system of
pre-clearance.

The committee that assesses compliance with the Proprietary Medicines
Association of Australia's (self-regulatory) Code of Conduct is chaired
by an independent lawyer, with consumer and pharmacy representatives
sitting alongside delegates from the Therapeutic Goods Administration
and the drug industry - not "a committee of our mates", commented PMAA
president David Stephens.

Health consumer groups in Australia had been "naturally suspicious"
about pharmaceutical industry associations monitoring their own
members' compliance with advertising requirements, Ms Graham noted.
Moreover, "there is a real risk from the consumer view that members
will simply resign to avoid sanctions under the code and that outlier
or 'rogue' companies simply will not join", she said.

Two factors, however, had raised confidence in the Australian system,
Ms Graham told the meeting: scrutiny of the PMAA Code of Conduct by the
Trade Practices Commission, which resulted in "the widening of
interests but, most particularly, those of the consumer" on the
compliance committee; and the annual public reporting of complaints and
outcomes.

The co-regulatory spirit manifested in this system and bodies such as
Australian Pharmaceutical Advisory Council (APAC) was borne out in
recent discussions over indirect advertising of non-sedating
antihistamines.

In this case, both industry and consumer groups saw the value of
'generic' public advertising - with an "ask your chemist" message - to
raise awareness of a more advanced treatment option, Ms Graham
explained. (The products' Schedule 3 (pharmacy-only) status did not
permit advertising to the general population.)

It was agreed that a set of guidelines on indirect adverts should be
incorporated into the PMAA Code of Conduct and, to provide regulatory
ballast, eventually be taken up by the Therapeutic Goods Act.

Here, then, was an instance of industry and consumers moving in tandem
to secure mutual benefit from OTC advertising - and pre-empting the
Australian licensing authority, which has yet to respond.

EC FINES BAYER OVER ADALAT PARALLEL IMPORT BAN

Bayer has fallen foul of EU competition rules for trying to impede
parallel imports into the UK of its big-selling antihypertensive Adalat
(nifedipine). The European Commission imposed a fine of ECU3 million
($3.5 million) on 10 January, after deciding that the German
pharmaceuticals producer had infringed the EC Treaty.

The Commission has been investigating trading practices among several
of the group's subsidiaries for some months now, and says that Bayer
has committed a serious infringement of Community law, going back to
the end of the 1980s. Bayer immediately said it would appeal.

This was a classic example of a blatant attempt to limit parallel
imports, explained the Commission as it announced the fine in Brussels.
The prices for Adalat vary widely in the various Member States in which
it is marketed, but Adalat's largest market shares are in the UK, where
its price is considerably higher than in other Member States, notably
France and Spain, it said.

Before 1989 in Spain and 1991 in France, the main customers of the
French and Spanish subsidiaries of Bayer, ie the pharmaceutical
wholesalers in those Member States, used to order larger quantities of
Adalat than they required for supplying the domestic market, and they
then exported the surplus to other Member States, including the UK. But
as from early 1989, Bayer Spain set up a computerised system for
identifying exporting wholesalers, and was refusing to supply them with
all of the quantities of Adalat which they ordered. In September 1991,
French wholesalers also found that Bayer France was no longer prepared
to supply them with their full orders. In the autumn of 1991, a Bayer
Spain executive visited the management of Bayer France, to explain how
this system worked (although in the event, the system set up by Bayer
France for identifying exporting wholesalers remained less elaborate:
handwritten lists were drawn up specifying "do not supply" or "blocked"
for certain orders) .

Wholesalers in France and Spain continued to try to obtain supplies of
Adalat from Bayer over and above their domestic requirements, and
reacted to the manufacturer's blacklisting by using various means to
camouflage their requests so they could continue exporting to the UK.
In particular, wholesalers used a system of spreading orders intended
for export between their various agencies. They also placed orders
through other, small wholesalers not subject to monitoring. The aim was
to appear to comply with Bayer's requirement that the product should
not be exported - but the subterfuges broke down on occasions, and when
one of the wholesalers was found to be exporting, Bayer France and
Bayer Spain imposed their own penalties, making successive reductions
in the volumes supplied.

"All these practices engaged in by Bayer France and Bayer Spain show
that they subjected their wholesalers to a permanent threat of a
reduction in the quantities supplied, a threat which was repeatedly put
into effect if the wholesalers did not comply with the export ban",
says the Commission.

It goes on to point out that the export ban was not just a one-off
exercise, but formed part of the continuous commercial relations
between Bayer France and Bayer Spain and their respective wholesalers -
relations that the wholesalers, both in France and in Spain, clearly
understood, as their conduct shows, says the Commission. This proves
that the company was operating an agreement in breach of Article 85(1)
of the Treaty (which forbids such agreements flatly as being anti-
competitive).

However, the Commission has not imposed the maximum possible fine. EU
rules allow it to fine offenders as much as 10 per cent of their
turnover of the product involved - which ECU3 million certainly is not.
In an interesting aside, the Commission has acknowledged that in
determining the amount of the fine, it has taken account of the fact
that pharmaceutical product prices are not set autonomously by
companies, but are governed by the various relevant national rules and
regulations. This is an unusual Commission admission of the fact that
companies do not necessarily have a level playing field.

Bayer said within hours of the fine being announced that it would take
legal action in the European Court of Justice against the Commission
decision. Bayer "has not categorically violated the legal provisions of
the Treaties of Rome", it says, and "protests at the Commission's
unconventional legal stance in interpreting the anti-trust rules",
which it brands "incomprehensible".

"The Commission's aim is evidently to restrict Bayer's freedom to
decide what quantities of products to sell to which businesses",
complains Bayer, pointing out that compliance with the Commission's
demands for full supply of all wholesalers' requests would
automatically mean parallel importers benefiting.

At the same time as it rejects the Commission's interpretation of EU
rules, Bayer also claims it has in any case not deliberately penalised
wholesalers, while acknowledging that some orders have not been filled.
"As far as capacities allow, Bayer supplies subsidiaries outside
Germany with Adalat or its active ingredient, nifedipine. Supplies are
generally governed by the requirements determined and forecasted by the
subsidiaries for their local markets on the basis of past experience.
In isolated cases, therefore, wholesalers who obviously order more than
they require for the local market may receive lower quantities than
they have ordered".

HOECHST AND RPR FORM CENTEON

The US dominant Rhone-Poulenc Rorer subsidiary Armour Pharmaceutical Co
and the leading European Hoechst subsidiary Behringwerke AG have joined
forces in a 50/50 venture to form Centeon, a $1.2 billion new plasma
protein therapies company employing 4,500 people worldwide to be
headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.

Centeon, headed by former Armour president John Sedor as CEO and
Hoechst managing board member Karl Seifert as chairman, is to become
the largest single supplier of plasma derived products worldwide,
supplying plasma proteins used in coagulation disorders, immune
deficiencies, wound healing, trauma and neurologic disorders. Centeon
should hold a 24 per cent share of the $5 billion plasma products
market, ahead of Baxter, Bayer, Green Cross-Alpha, Immuno and several
smaller players, according to Mr Sedor.

The collaboration has involved Hoechst and RPR contributing all the
plasma protein assets of both Armour and Behringwerke's plasma protein
division. Behringwerke will retain separate diagnostic and vaccine
divisions.

Pooled research budgets of the current companies are to be doubled to
$60 million enabling Centeon to increase investment in R&D and
accelerate the pace of new plasma-derived product development. Its size
also means it can be the global leader in supplying the world's needs
for plasma products.

Both companies are active in Aids research; new research areas that
Centeon will focus on include blood components, rDNA technology and
gene therapy. Emphasis is to be on innovative therapeutics. The company
says it will provide viral safety by combining the largest and most
sophisticated commercial plasma collection and tracking operation in
the world with advanced technology for viral inactivation and
purification of products.

Mr Sedor is predicting average annual sales growth for the company of 7-
10 per cent, double the market's current 3-5 per cent growth rate.

HOECHST RESTRUCTURING TAKES EFFECT

The global restructuring plans announced by Hoechst last December have
now been put into effect commencing 1 January. The plans include a
reorganisation of research activity, establishment of a drug
development centre, a reduction in ingredient production, the shedding
of 8,000 jobs including 1,400 in Germany, and the adoption of a
multicultural marketing approach. Integration between 1995 and 1998
will cost an estimated $800 million but cost savings of $800
million/year will be achieved by 1997 says the company with marketing
and administration efficiencies saving $350 million, R&D $230 million
and manufacturing $20 million. A return on sales of 20 per cent is
forecast for 1997/8 compared with 12 per cent in 1994 and Hoechst's
pharmaceutical business in total is expected to contribute 27 per cent
of the company's DM15 billion sales.

Research activity is to be based at four locations: Frankfurt,
Romainville, France, Somerville, US and Kawagoe, Japan. Research will
focus on eight therapeutic areas; cardiovascular, metabolic disorders
and rheumatology, infectious diseases, bone diseases, CNS, oncology and
respiratory disorders. Research centres at Cincinnati, US, Gerenzano,
Italy, Strasbourg, France and Swindon, UK are to be closed and activity
transferred to the other sites. The natural product screening facility
in India is under review but a decision has been taken to continue
research at HMR's combinatorial chemistry affiliate Selectide in
Tucson, US.

Hoechst's stated aims are to cut costs and launch innovative products
rapidly, using novel marketing methods. Integration of Roussel Uclaf
(56 per cent Hoechst-owned) should be complete by end 1996 and the
expected synergies, cost savings, higher sales and growth potential
from the acquisition of Marion Merrell Dow are expected to start
becoming apparent this year.

ALKERMES TO ACQUIRE MEDISORB

Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company Alkermes Inc has announced it
will acquire the technology and assets of the controlled release drug
delivery leader Medisorb Technologies International of Wilmington,
Ohio.

In doing so, it will provide Alkermes with the wherewithal to
manufacture injectable sustained release formulations of traditional
small molecule pharmaceuticals, complementing Alkermes ProLease drug
delivery system for larger, complex biotechnology compounds.

Alkermes aims to be the leader in injectable sustained drug delivery,
said CEO Richard Pops last week, and the Medisorb acquisition will open
new large markets.

The acquisition is to be financed by a combination of cash and future
payments based on the successful commercial launch of products
incorporating Medisorb's technology, said a company statement. No
Alkermes stock is to be issued to finance the deal.

AMGEN AND SUGEN CONCLUDE RESEARCH COLLABORATION

Sugen Inc and Amgen have agreed to end a four-year research
collaboration into neurobiology and haematopoiesis one year earlier
than planned.

A change of research priorities for both parties have led to the
amicable winding up of the project which was to have identified novel
signal transduction targets for certain neurological and haematopoietic
disorders, say the companies.

Amgen will pay Sugen $2.5 million and grant back to Sugen exclusive
worldwide rights to 22 proprietary signal transduction targets
discovered during the collaboration, subject to royalty payments on
future sales.

Sugen is buying back from Amgen 235,000 shares at $11.48 per share. The
company develops small molecule drugs which interact with key signal
transduction molecules known as tyrosine kinases and phosphatases.
Signalling pathways for the molecules are involved in a number of human
diseases including cancer and diabetes.

BRACCO TO EXPAND EASTWARDS

Bracco, the Italian pharmaceutical company has announced it intends to
expand its Chinese and Russian interests this year. The company has
recently been concentrating on penetrating the US market.

Bracco, which last year purchased Squibb Diagnostics recently bought 15
per cent of the shares of Esaote, a partly US-owned Italian
pharmaceutical company, for #18 billion. Its 1995 sales should reach
L1,600 billion, up from L1,142 billion the year before. Net profits for
1995 are anticipated to be 40 per cent of sales of which 71 per cent
are derived from overseas business.

RHONE-POULENC ISSUES PROFITS WARNING

Hit by a number of negative factors, Rhone-Poulenc SA last week warned
of lower 1995 profits than forecast earlier. In 1994 the group reported
a net attributable profit of FFr1.915 billion and had hoped to post a
double-digit growth in 1995.

Investment sentiment among sector analysts appears neutral to mildly
positive: some analysts expect a flat to negative outturn, others a
healthy increase. Analysts expect the company to report net profit for
1995 of between FFr2 billion to FFr2.3 billion.

"The implication of RP's warning is that it made little or no profit in
the fourth quarter," commented one bearish analyst. Negative factors
are thought to have wiped out some FFr600 million of potential profits
in the fourth quarter - these included the slowdown in the French
economy, the transport strike and provisions for the integration and
restructuring of Fisons, expected to exceed FFr100 million.

Rhone-Poulenc Rorer separately announced that its 1995 results, due to
be released on 29 January, would be in line with the consensus of
analysts' expectations, despite a one-off tax charge of around $20-25
million. One analyst said he expected earnings per share of around
$3.25, up almost 30 per cent on 1994's $2.50 per share." We are holders
of most French drug company stocks until we see what the impact is of
the negotiations with the French government over a FFr2.5 billion
contribution sought from the industry to help cut the social security
deficit."

Still, French pharmaceutical companies will be cushioned to a greater
extent than foreign companies because of their higher domestic research
expenditure. Although French drug companies account for a quarter of
the total French pharmaceutical market, they are liable to just 15 per
cent of the total potential tax burden.

A spokesman for RPR told PBN "we are confident that the business
overall is going forward well." Details will shortly be unveiled on the
integration charge for Fisons and the structure and shape of its newly-
enlarged asthma management business.

LEGALITY OF CSM'S ADVICE OVER PILL CHALLENGED

The Director of the University of Aberdeen's Medicines Assessment
Research Unit is continuing to highlight the possibility that the UK
Committee on Safety of Medicines acted unlawfully in issuing advice to
doctors concerning third generation oral contraceptive Pills and the
risk of thromboembolism.

Dr Andrew Watt has written to the chief executive of the Medicines
Control Agency (MCA), Dr Keith Jones, after failing to receive a
response from the licensing authority to a letter he published in the
British Medical Journal on 16 December. The BMJ letter pointed out that
the committee had based its recommendation on hastily considered and
incomplete data. It further suggested the CSM had exceeded its
authority in advising prescribers because its remit is solely to advise
the MCA which as licensing authority should then take appropriate
action in revoking or amending product licences as seen fit. No such
action was taken so, according to Dr Watt, the MCA must be assumed to
have considered the third generation Pill to be safe and the CSM could
arguably be said to be acting unlawfully in overriding the Agency's
judgment by going direct to prescribers with advice.

In his letter to Dr Jones, Dr Watt accuses the Licensing Authority and
the Committee on Safety of Medicines of unnecessarily disrupting the
lives of one and a half million women and of actions "which do not
appear fully to have met the highest standards of behaviour either in
respect of law or science".

A statement issued to the press last weekend calls on the MCA to
demonstrate its confidence in the CSM by taking appropriate licensing
action or by stating publicly its lack of confidence in the advice.

Dr Watt whose University is conducting research work on unconnected
product areas for Wyeth ( manufacturers of the gestodene-containing
oral contraceptives Minulet and Triminulet) says his interest in the
issue stems from a previous position studying the role of the CSM. He
has however disclosed that he has worked briefly as a consultant for
one of the Pill manufacturers concerned.

If Watt's point is shown to carry weight it could conceivably benefit
oral contraceptive manufacturers if they were to take legal action
against the UK Regulator. The three month time limit for seeking a
judicial review however runs out on 18 January. As PBN went to press,
none of the three companies Schering, Wyeth and Organon had taken a
final decision on whether or not to seek a review.

GERMAN WHOLESALERS EXPAND BUSINESS

German pharmaceuticals wholesaler Anzag expects business to improve
considerably in 1996 and results to be as good as those achieved before
the introduction of the healthcare system's reform in 1993. "We
envisage between 3 per cent and 4 per cent growth in turnover," said Mr
Peter Haac, chairman of the Anzag board.

In the business year 1994/1995 (September to August), the company
recorded turnover of DM4.06 billion. From January to August 1994, when
Anzag changed its report period, it had achieved turnover of DM2.5
billion. After-tax profits were DM32.3 million, while in the first
eight months of 1994, they totalled DM22.2 million. The company
benefited considerably from the unexpected upswing in the German
pharmaceuticals wholesale market. Between September 1994 and August
1995, the combined market volume of all pharmaceuticals wholesalers
rose 7.2 per cent to DM27.3 billion. In western Germany, the increase
was 6.9 per cent totalling DM22.2 billion, and thus less pronounced
than in eastern Germany, where 8.2 per cent growth to DM5.1 billion was
recorded. Anzag maintained its market share of 16.1 per cent.

Mr Haac said the company will continue to develop its marketing
services to pharmacies, mainly in the self-medication sector. Anzag
plans to expand into new markets, particularly in eastern Europe.

Anzag's competitor Phoenix has taken another step to strengthen its
position within Europe. The company signed a letter of intent to
acquire a 52 per cent stake in Italian Comifar. The Mailand-based
wholesaler achieved turnover of around DM500 million in 1995 and holds
a market share of 20 per cent. According to Phoenix, Comifar is one of
the major pharmaceuticals wholesalers in northern Italy.

Phoenix is already present in Italy through stakes it holds in
Commercio Ingrosso Medicinali (CIM). Perugia, Societa Adriatica
Medicinali (SAM) in Paese and P Felletti Spadazzi, Padua. Including
Comifar, the Italian companies of the Phoenix group would achieve a
combined annual turnover of DM1 billion. Phoenix is also active in
France, Poland, the Netherlands, Austria, Hungary and the Czech
Republic and, again with Comifar, forecast a combined foreign turnover
of DM4 billion for 1996.

The group holds a 30 per cent share of the German pharmaceuticals
wholesale market and achieved domestic turnover of DM7 billion in 1995.

GERMAN PHARMA GROWTH LAGS IN 1995

Following a strong first half of the year, growth in the German
pharmaceuticals market slipped "perceptibly" in the second half of
1995, according to the industry association Bundesverband der
pharmazeutischen Industrie (BPI).

Against the background for statistical aberrations due to the German
government's switch to EU-compatible reporting methods, BPI said it
expects full-year figures to show production up 4 per cent and sales to
pharmacies up by just over 6 per cent. This would bring results back
into line with 1992 and 1994. The improvement is attributed in major
part to higher growth rates in eastern Germany and steady demand from
abroad in the first half year. Business in western Germany continued to
decline throughout 1995, resulting in negative production growth for
the full year.

Along with restrictions on prescribing mandated by the German health
ministry, the strength of the Deutschemark also affected adversely the
performance of German pharmaceutical producers in 1995, said BPI.

Led by anti-infectives (up 15.5 per cent) in the wake of an influenza
spell and the launch of new products in the first year, sales of
pharmaceuticals to German chemist shops rose by nearly 7 per cent from
January to November to reach a value of DM21.6 billion. Blood products
saw growth of 13 per cent, urogenital and CNS preparations 8.5 per cent
and 8.6 per cent respectively, respiratory drugs 8.1 per cent
cardiovascular medications 3.3 per cent, digestion aids 4 per cent and
muscular-skeletal drugs 2.1 per cent.

After increasing 8 per cent in 1993 and 12.6 per cent in 1994, export
sales rose by only 6 per cent in the first eight months of 1995, the
last period for which the organisation has figures. However, imports
growth also slackened to 9 per cent in the January-August time frame,
after expanding by one third in 1994. BPI estimates that producer
selling prices eased forward 0.2 per cent in 1995 following the end of
the price freeze agreed with the health ministry. In 1993, prices
declined 3.6 per cent and in 1994 by 1.2 per cent.

According to the federal office of statistics, employment in the German
pharmaceutical industry fell by 1,600 in the first nine months of 1995.

However, BPI believes the decline for the full year could be greater,
due to ongoing restructurisation procedures at drug producers since
1993.

FRENCH PHARMA INDUSTRY IS RESIGNED TO PARALLEL IMPORT THREAT

The European Commission's decision to go ahead allowing wholesalers
within the union to import pharmaceuticals from Spain and Portugal has
raised some fears of the French industry being undercut. Last autumn,
the Paris authorities sought to extend the period of protection for
another two years, but failed. There is a chance that France, and the
other nine countries opposed to this particular liberalisation will go
to the European Court of Justice. But a senior French official poured
cold water on this idea, saying that the decision was more a political
than legal matter.

The ban on Spanish and Portuguese drugs went back 10 years, to the time
when these countries joined the European Economic Community (as it was
in 1985) but did not have proper patent legislation, allowing local
pharmaceutical manufacturers to copy molecules without having
contributed to the research costs. They became subject to legislation
in 1992, and the commission set a three-year transition period, which
expired on 31 December 1995.

The French industry sought to console itself with the thought that most
Iberian production was now licensed, and that in general it was only
about 15 per cent cheaper than French production, which did not
normally justify the trouble of importing. Only a few specific drugs,
which were significantly cheaper than 15 per cent, were likely to be
affected, indicated one specialist. The impact of the change was likely
to be much greater in other countries such as Germany or Holland - the
latter having pharmaceutical prices on average some 75 per cent higher
than Spain.

Another expert noted that pharmaceuticals were relatively cheap in
France, compared with other European countries, and that France tended
to export them towards its northern neighbours. But the new rules could
undermine these sales.

The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations has
estimated that opening the Spanish border could cost its members some
$2 billion a year in lost turnover.

INSTITUT PASTEUR FIGHTS AGAINST BANKRUPTCY

The Institut Pasteur de Lyon has succeeded in raising FFr10 million
($2.02 million) additional finance to keep going - a matter of days
before it was due to go into formal liquidation. Of the additional
money, FFr8 million ($1.62 million) will come from the state, while
FFr2 million ($404,000) will come from the national research institutes
CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) and INSERM
(Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale).

But the money is not quite the end of the Institut Pasteur's
difficulties. It still needs a further FFr4 million to keep its 107-
strong research team running for a full year - long enough to put its
rescue plans into action. Pasteur Lyon's president, Christian Dutreuil,
was confident the money could be found "from a few additional sources".

The rescue plan involves transferring the 140-strong hospital biology
section to Hospices Civils de Lyon. The 125-strong commercial section,
which carries out analyses, is going into partnership with Foundation
Merieux. And to raise the funds to pay for some 82 redundancies, as
well as paying off an accumulated debt of FFr20 million ($4.04
million), the institute has arranged a property deal with the regional
blood transfusion centre, which would buy part or all of Pasteur Lyon's
building in the centre of the city, and rent it to the institute.

Institut Pasteur has lost its lawsuit alleging three patent
infringements by Cambridge Biotech concerning Cambridge's HIV-1 western
blot confirmation test.

The US bankruptcy court for Massachusetts has declared a non-exclusive
patent license to be in effect between the two companies as of 1
January covering the HIV-1 test. In September the court ruled Cambridge
has a valid licence under two of the Pasteur patents covering HIV-2.

FRENCH COMPANIES AWAIT PAYMENT FORMULA FOR LEVY

The formula for paying the special contribution of FFr2.5 billion that
the French pharmaceutical industry is having to make this year towards
reducing the national health insurance deficit will be officially
announced by the government on 17 January, when a Cabinet meeting is
due to approve the final text of the executive order. The formula is
being negotiated between the Syndicat National de l'Industrie
Pharmaceutique (SNIP), the industry federation, and Health Ministry
officials; neither side is prepared to make any official comment about
the content of their discussions at present.

However, some pointers to the way each company's contribution will be
calculated have leaked out and given rise to what SNIP calls "press
speculation". The talks appear to be moving towards the adoption of a
formula composed of three components. Almost half the surcharge, FFr1.2
billion, would be raised through a tax on any increase in companies
revenues in 1995. However, those companies whose revenues rose by less
than 3 per cent (or less than 4.5 per cent in the case of those that
have signed conventions with the government on the limitation of their
drug sales) would be exempt. Others would be liable to pay the
equivalent of 25-30 per cent of the growth in turnover between 3-6 per
cent and 50-60 per cent on any increase over 6 per cent.

In addition, there could be an exceptional increase in the special tax
on pharmaceutical companies' advertising and marketing outlays from 9
per cent to 14 per cent this year, which would generate an additional
FFr500 million.

Finally, some FFr700-800 million would be raised through a 1.5 per cent
surtax on companies' total revenues, less R&D outlays.

Whatever the amounts due by companies under these different headings,
no company will have to pay in total more than the equivalent of 6.5
per cent of its 1995 turnover. The government order is expected to
require all companies to file an assessment of what they owe by 1
April, with payment to be made by 31 August.

The government is introducing all its planned social security reforms
by means of executive orders, which circumvent normal legislative
procedures. Five are to be promulgated over the next few months and
must be ratified en bloc by parliament by 31 May at the latest. They
will provide successively for: the introduction of a new contribution
to pay off the accumulated debts of the social security system over the
medium to long term; the implementation of short-term measures for
bringing social security income and expenditure into balance in 1996-97
(which includes the pharmaceutical industry's contribution); reform of
the health insurance system and its administration; hospital reform;
and new measures for controlling healthcare costs by establishing
guidelines for good medical practice.

ITALIAN PHARMA INDUSTRY COMES UNDER RENEWED PRESSURE

A further drastic reduction in state reimbursement for medicines this
year has been approved in a government Finance Bill amendment by the
Italian parliament. The sudden and surprising move, hotly contested by
the pharmaceutical industry, is likely to force major changes in the
classification of reimbursable medicines and, according to the
industry, will accelerate its decline.

The legislative action follows a government decree to write off cost
overruns in government reimbursement for medicines for 1995. The L9,000
billion ceiling forecast for 1995 was exceeded by L700 billion.

Parliament has called for a similar spending cap during the government
1996 Finance Bill debate and to ensure a chance of succeeding has
attached an amendment stating that reimbursements will be based, as of
April, on the cost of the cheapest medicines in the same class
administered by the same route. Until now, reimbursements were allowed
regardless of cost.

The legislative move has created confusion, if not panic, within the
industry because, in effect, it means medicines costing more than the
cheapest ones in their class may no longer be marketable.

In addition, the amendment also calls for physicians to inform patients
prescribed a more expensive alternative that government will reimburse
only the cost of the cheapest drug of its type available for their
medical condition. In effect it would mean that most prescriptions will
be for the cheapest medicines since it seems unlikely patients would
want to pay the difference for medicines considered of equal efficacy.
Most will opt to change brands.

Italy's pharmaceutical industry association, Farmindustria has
responded with a sharp, so far futile, protest, threatening to withdraw
altogether from the National Health service and the reimbursement
scheme.

Farmindustria has claimed that medicine prices in Italy, are now 31 per
cent below that of the European Union average, with prices forced to
drop by 20 per cent in the past four years despite 18 per cent
inflation in the same period. In addition, according to Farmindustria,
in the past 12 months medicine prices dropped by 7 per cent, while
inflation remained at 6 per cent and production costs soared (25 per
cent for glass, 39 per cent for packaging, 6.5 per cent for rubber and
4.7 per cent for labour).

"Under these conditions, "Farmindustria declared, "companies can no
longer guarantee necessary standards, and many are being forced to halt
investment in Italy."

Although 1995 figures are not yet available, Italy's pharmaceutical
industry stood alone among all industrialised nations in showing a
decline in both production and revenues during 1994. Much of this is
attributed to diminishing government subsidies, which declined from a
peak of L14,000 billion four years ago to the ceiling of L9,000 billion
in 1995. The ceiling is expected to remain the same in 1996.

At the same time, Parliament is also calling for the possible
introduction of generic medicines in an attempt to further reduce
government spending on medicines and for a 50 per cent discount on
certain drugs for specific diseases.

As supposed compensation for reduced government spending on medicines,
the prices of some Class A and Class B medicines are to increase
between 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent in 1996. But Farmindustria said
there would be no real increase since prices would merely return to
their 1994 levels.

Industry sources are consoling themselves with the hope that the
parliamentary amendment may be subject to further debate in a future
parliament. The life of this legislature, although elected less than
two years ago, is on a tight-rope and early elections are likely
sometime in 1996.

EC MAY DROP ANTIBIOTIC CONTROLS

The European commission is considering easing import controls on the
first generation antibiotic, dihydrostreptomycin, from China. Under a
1991 Council Regulation, imports are currently subject to a strict anti-
dumping duty to protect European industry. But a review of this
limitation has been requested by Dutch importer, Tocelo Chemicals,
acting on its own behalf and also for Long March Pharmaceutical Plant,
a Chinese exporter. They claim the duty is no longer necessary to
offset dumping, because there is no Community industry that would be
injured by such imports. The original - and sole - EU complainant in
the proceedings that led to duty being imposed was Rhone Poulenc
Biochimie, which, says Tocelo, has now ceased production. It also says
the other EU manufacturer, Norbrook Laboratories Ltd produces a
different type of dihydro-streptomycin, for internal consumption only.

The Commission has therefore opened an investigation, and will seek
information via questionnaire from Rhone Poulenc, Norbrook, and
importers known to be concerned. At the same time, a copy of the
questionnaires will be sent to representative associations of
importers. The Commission is inviting any other parties interested in
co-operating in the investigation to make contact with it directly, and
to submit views by mid-February. But it stresses that any information
submitted under this article will only be taken into account if
supported by factual evidence at the time of submission. Details from:

EU HELPS FIGHT DIPHTHERIA

The European Commission has granted nearly ECU2 million ($2.4 million)
to combat diphtheria in the new independent states of the former Soviet
Union. The grant will be channelled via the European Community
Humanitarian Office and will enable the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) to
continue work on a co-ordinated vaccination campaign.

UNICEF will get a grant of ECU1 million, to cover Tadjikistan, the
country with the highest level of fatal cases (ECU630,000 ), and the
three southern Caucasus states, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia
(ECU370,000). IFRC will get a grant of ECU980,000, for work in Belarus
(ECU730,000), and the Russian Federation (ECU250,000).

Diphtheria, which had been virtually eradicated in Western Europe, made
a comeback in the former Soviet Union as social structures broke down.
In 1994, there were about 50,000 cases, eight out of 10 of them in the
Russian Federation. Isolated cases have also been reported in the
European Union in individuals who had travelled east.

These new grants provide continuing support for the anti-diphtheria
campaign the World Health Organisation launched in late 1994 with
UNICEF and IFRC. ECHO's contribution prior to this fresh funding
amounts to 3.6 MECU. Thanks to the campaign, the number of cases
reported in the Russian Federation has been declining since July, but
elsewhere both the number of cases and death rates are still climbing.

FDA ISSUES GUIDELINE ON NEW DRUG SUBSTANCE IMPURITIES

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published, 4 January, a
guideline entitled Impurities in New Drug Substances following the
International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for
Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), in the EU, Japan
and the US. The final draft was approved at the ICH meeting in March
l995.

The guideline assists drug marketing registration by detailing the
content and qualifications of impurities in new drug substances
produced by chemical syntheses and not previously registered in a
region or member state. It is not intended to apply to new drug
substances used during the clinical research stage of development or
clinical trials. Not covered are: biological/biotechnological, peptide,
oligonucleotide, radiopharmaceutical, fermentation and semisynthetic
products, herbal and crude products of animal origin. The guidance
addresses impurities in new drug substances from two perspectives;
chemistry and safety aspects, and offers descriptions of and
suggestions about analytic methods. The new l996 guideline represent
FDA's current thinking. The publication is expected to be periodically
reviewed.

Copies of the guideline are available from the Consumer Affairs Branch
(HFD-210, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, FDA, 7500 Standish
Pl., Rockville, D 20855, USA.

Brazil and represents a stepping stone towards GW doubling its market
share from 2 per cent to 4 per cent in the year 2000, said Jorge
Raimundo Filho, president of GW's Brazilian operations.

GW Brazil had a turnover of around $100 million in 1995 and expects
this to grow to $300 million in the year 2000.

Bristol Myers Squibb currently leads pharmaceuticals sales in Brazil

BRAZILIAN DRUG SALES UP28 PER CENT

Figures released in December by Brazil's association of pharmaceuticals
manufacturers (Abifarma - Associacao Brasileira da Industria
Farmaceutica), show 1995 sales rose 28.2 per cent to R$8.23 billion
Brazilian Reals (c US$8.35 billion). Brazil is the world's fourth
largest pharmaceuticals market after the US, France and Italy.

Only 50 per cent of Brazil's medicines production was exported in 1995
but Abifarma plans to raise this amount to between 10 per cent and 15
per cent with target markets being the South American Common Market
(Marcosur) and other Latin American countries.

During the year 1.77 billion units were sold, 16.4 per cent more than
in 1994. Abifarma's president Sr Jose Eduardo Bandeira de Mello said at
least five pharmaceutical companies were closing their plants in other
countries and planning to move their operations to Brazil.

In 1995, he said, laboratories invested $250 million in Brazil, up 25
per cent on the previous year. In 1996 he expected these investments to
increase substantially seeing Glaxo Wellcome alone was investing $111
million.

ELI LILLY INVESTS $20 MILLION IN BRAZIL

At the end of December Eli Lilly & Co announced $20 million investments
in its Brazilian subsidiary. The funding will be used to build a new
production unit alongside its existing installations in Cosmopolis, Sao
Paulo. The new plant will produce principally antibiotics.

Eli Lilly plans to double its exports from Brazil to $30 million in the
next three years. Its export markets are Mercosur (the South American
common market consisting of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay),
Asia and the US.

This is the largest investment made by the company in Brazil where it
has been established for 51 years. Most of the $20 million will be used
to buy high technology equipment in order to bring production
techniques into line with FDA requirements.

The Brazilian subsidiary of Eli Lilly had a turnover of approximately
$180 million in 1995.

Investments reported to be planned by other companies include Knoll
Basf ($37 million); Sanofi Winthrop ($7.3 million); Fundacao Ataulfo de
Paiva ($5 million); Laboratorio Darrow ($3 million ) and Bravet ($2
million).

BRAZILIAN MEDICINE PRICES INCREASE

Brazilian medicine prices were allowed to rise in December by an
average of 8 per cent. The industry had been demanding 14 per cent.
Medicine prices should not be adjusted again until June 1996.

The 8 per cent limit was calculated by Brazil's prices secretary to be
the industry's loss through inflation. Since Brazil's successful anti-
inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 medicine prices have risen
21.34 per cent. The plan has cut inflation from 50 per cent a month to
less than 2 per cent.

In order to co-operate with the government's anti-inflation plan,
laboratories have agreed to place 100 to 150 generic medicines on the
market and to cut prices to the less well-off through public hospitals
and health scheme discounts.

The industry has also backed OTC sales in supermarkets in order to
reduce prices. Brazil's pharmacies operate with a profit margin of 42.5
per cent and it is hoped to cut this to around 30 per cent.

SANOFI GAINS US RIGHTS TO PHOTOFRIN

Sanofi Winthrop Inc, the US subsidiary of Sanofi, itself part of the
Elf Aquitaine group, has signed an agreement with Canadian company QLT
PhotoTherapeutics Inc giving Sanofi Winthrop exclusive US marketing
rights to Photofrin (porfimer sodium) and future photodynamic therapy
products developed by QLT (originally known as Quadra Logic
Technologies). Photofrin, used to treat advanced oesophageal cancer is
the first light-activated drug for use in photodynamic therapy to be
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

The agreement provides for Sanofi to pay an access fee, partly in cash
and partly through the purchase of QLT stock, as well as to make
milestone payments for the development of new photodynamic therapy
products (although no timetable has been set).

Photodynamic therapy is an emerging medical technology utilising drugs
activated by light, for the treatment of various cancers, as well as
use in ophthalmology and other diseases.

Photofrin is administered intravenously and accumulates in tumours; it
is then activated by non-thermal light emitted by a medical laser,
producing an active form of oxygen that helps destroy cancer cells.

Sanofi describes the deal as a logical step in its developing oncology
programme. It has a number of anti-cancer compounds undergoing clinical
development, which include:

* tirapazamine, for the treatment of solid tumours, currently in Phase
III clinical trials in the US;

* mitoguazone, for Aids-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma;

* oxaliplatin, for colorectal and ovarian cancers, which is being
tested in Europe; and

* urate oxidase, for hyperuricaemia-associated cancer treatment.

JAPANESE FIRMS' INTERIM RESULTS

Interim earnings of Japan's top drug makers fell in line with
expectations, with few surprises overall.

More importantly, year to March forecasts - the focus of most attention
- were subdued, as the companies seek to avoid closer scrutiny from the
Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) which will implement a new round
of ethical drug price cuts from 1 April.

Industry leader Takeda, recorded a doubling of revenues of its lead
product Lupron, to Y10.5 billion in the half year, and is forecasting
revenues in the full year here of Y21.5 billion (US215 million).

For Sankyo, revenues of its cholesterol agent, Mervalotin, rose 5-8 per
cent to Y67.4 billion, and are forecast to reach Y131.4 billion ($1.31
billion) in the year to March. Continued growth in revenues leaves the
product exposed to further price cuts from the MHW which takes especial
interest in drugs generating revenues of over Y100 billion as being
over-priced.

In the same drug category, Merck associate Banyu Pharmaceutical saw
revenues of its cholesterol agent Lipovase rise 24 per cent in the
September half, reaching Y16 billion ($160 million), and set to total
Y31.5 billion in the year to March.

It also saw buoyant growth from its EPO, ESPO, with revenues rising by
7.1 per cent to Y15.1 billion in the years first half, which is
forecast at Y30.2 billion for the full term.

Ono Pharmaceutical's September half year spending on R&D rose to Y7.83
billion, up from Y7.12 billion in the same term last year. Year to
March outlays are budgeted at Y12.47 billion. Similarly, Dai Nippon
Pharmaceutical, is forecasting year to March R&D outlays of Y13
billion.

Industry leader Takeda's R&D spending is to rise to Y61 billion in the
full year, following a rise in September half earnings to Y30.4
billion.

Sankyo continues to top the list in terms of R&D outlays, with year to
March spending budgeted at Y45.1 billion, well ahead of Takeda's and
pitched at over 10 per cent of forecast full year revenues of Y405
billion

Japan's year to March 1995, drug sector revenues were basically flat,
rising 1 per cent year on year to Y5.75 billion, on a drug production
basis.

Revenues in most key categories showed modest rises, with the biggest
declines in areas such as antibiotics, down 12.9 per cent and
traditional Chinese medicines, down 14.3 per cent.

Both of these areas have been recent targets of the MWH for cuts,
following sizeable rises in recent years.

INDIA FINALISES DRUG PRICING BODY

A National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority is on schedule to be up and
running in India for the new financial year beginning 1 April 1996.
Posts of chairman and secretary and the NPPA's remit have now been
sanctioned by the union cabinet following year long talks with the
ministries of chemicals, industry and finance.

The NPPA will be an independent body with more flexibility in drug
pricing than the Bureau of Costs and Prices was allowed. Besides fixing
drug prices, the authority will update the list of drugs subject to
price control each year, monitor prices of other drugs, and will
oversee the implementation of the Drug Price Control Order. Time limits
for deciding on price approvals will be set by the NPPA. Initially
these will be two months for formulations and four months for bulk
drugs.

SPIC TO EXPAND ANTIBIOTIC PRODUCTION

SPIC Pharma the pharmaceutical division of Madras-based Southern
Petrochemicals Industries Corp Ltd (SPIC), plans to invest Rs3,000
million in its core areas of fermentation products, synthetic drugs and
herbal products over the next two to three years, says pharmaceuticals
vice-president Dr MD Nair. Cephalosporins will be the next
antibacterials to be manufactured.

SPIC, which commissioned an international-sized plant for Penicillin G
in June last year at Cuddalore with an initial investment of Rs1,800
million and bought in overseas technology, is also experimenting with
other antibacterials. The company is planning to manufacture Penicillin
based products such as ampicillin and amoxycillin and is seeking
marketing partners globally and on the domestic front for these, said
Dr Nair. The company is already working with a number of German
pharmaceutical companies and with companies in the Indo-China region,
eg, in Vietnam and Cambodia.

LUPIN DEVELOPS OWN HIV TESTS

Bombay company Lupin Laboratories has announced it is developing
diagnostic kits for HIV I and II that are specific to particular
antigens predominant in Aids patients in India.

The company is investing 6.4 per cent of its Rs4450 million turnover on
R&D compared with an average of 1.5 to 2 per cent for most Indian
pharmaceutical companies.

Lupin, which already manufactures five cephalosporins, is also setting
up facilities at Mandideep, near Bhopal to produce ceftazidime. The
company launched cefachlor, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime last year and
expects a sales potential of Rs2000 million annually from its
cephalosporin range.

PHARMAC REVIEWS MEDICINES SUBSIDY POLICY

New Zealand pharmaceutical funding agency, Pharmac, is looking at
redirecting resources into more cost-effective treatments such as the
AZT/DDI or AZT/DDC Aids cocktails and away from treatments "which it
subsidises for purely historical reasons and which probably no longer
warrant being given out free." Pharmac is spending NZ$2.3 million
(US$1.5 million) subsidising cold sore creams "and at the same time,"
David Moore, Pharmac general manager says, "we don't have the half
million necessary to extend the lives of Aids victims."

Mr Moore is at odds with the New Zealand Medical Association over a
statement that doctors have been prescribing medicines like a "lolly
scramble". But Mr Moore says "whether Dr Dennis Pezaro," president of
the New Zealand Medical Association, "wants to acknowledge it or  not,
there is considerable wastage in some parts of the medicines budget."

Mr Moore says the extent to which medicines are wasted is demonstrated
by a recent campaign to collect unused drugs which touched only four
per cent of Auckland homes, but collected unused drugs worth $730,000
including Roaccutane for acne, bronchodilators, treatments for
rheumatic disease and gout, and antibacterials.

Pezaro told PBN  "it's a ridiculous storm in a teacup." The NZMA has no
problem with controlling wastage. "The question is how we go about
strategies to contain it and Mr Moore appears to have a problem
recognising who are his helpers." Pezaro says the NZMA and Pharmac
should be "sitting down and talking things through" but Pharmac "is not
in a consultative mode." Pharmac is a joint venture of New Zealand's
four regional health authorities.

In Pezaro's view some wastage is "truly inevitable". In the end, it is
"patient choice" whether they finish a course of medicines or not.
"Where it is very much controllable," in his view, however, "is where
prolonged quantities are dispensed in order to cut the co-payment
implications for the patient."

Three-month prescribing was very low before the New Zealand government
introduced part-charges, Pezaro says. "Part of the wastage is a direct
responsibility of government policy." Pezaro is not necessarily
suggesting part-charges should be abolished, but that they should be
structured so that they do not introduce incentives to over-
prescribing. There is currently no difference in the co-payment amount
per item whether the prescription is for a short or long treatment.

PROCEPT FORMS VACTEX TO DEVELOP TB VACCINE

Procept, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company, has joined with
top researchers at the Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's
Hospital, and a group of investors to form the VacTex Corp. The latter
has raised $1 million to fund new vaccine developments which exploit
the discoveries of researchers Dr Michael Brenner and Dr Steven
Porcelli regarding hitherto unknown aspects of immunology concerning
the CD-1 system of lipid antigen presentation.

Vaccines based on lipid antigens may succeed where other approaches
using MHC molecules have failed, according to a company statement.
Infectious agents which may be addressed by novel vaccines include
tuberculosis, malaria and salmonella, said VacTex chairman and CEO Dr
Robert Carpenter. Initial efforts will focus on producing a vaccine for
TB which affects 1.8 billion people worldwide and is the leading cause
of death from a single infectious agent. Procept has an option to
purchase VacTex under certain unspecified terms and conditions.

Procept has also announced it is to start a new Phase I/II trial of its
anti-HIV drug PR 2000 in Belgium under the direction of Dr Nathan
Clumeck at the Saint Pierre University Hospital, Brussels. A Phase I
safety trial using single bolus injections was successfully completed
in the UK last May but continuous iv infusion has been associated with
reversible liver enzyme and platelet changes in some patients.  The new
trial will therefore stick to single daily bolus injections.

PR 2000 blocks the binding of a surface glycoprotein gp 120 found on
the HIV-I virus to the CD4 protein on immune cells. The rationale for
its use is therefore to act as a molecular barrier to block HIV from
infecting critical immune system cells including T-cells and
macrophages. By targeting the CD4 protein rather than the HIV virus
itself, Procept believes drug resistance is less likely.

ALLIANCE AND HMR COLLABORATE ON LIQUIVENT

The San Diego based Alliance Pharmaceutical Corp and Hoechst Marion
Roussel have announced an agreement in principle for a worldwide
licence to develop and market LiquiVent (perflubron) for treatment of
acute respiratory failure. A final agreement, conditional on regulatory
approvals, is expected to be negotiated within the next two months.

Alliance has recently started a paediatric Phase II/III trial of
LiquiVent for acute respiratory failure in addition to continuing
trials with adults and premature babies. Early trials in adults,
children and premature babies showed the treatment improves respiratory
gas exchange and lung mechanics.

HMR wants LiquiVent in order to build up its respiratory drug portfolio
which includes the anti-allergic drug Seldane, Rifampicin for TB,
several development compounds for asthma, allergies and acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well as antibiotics used to
treat lower respiratory tract infections.

Hoechst says the licence agreement is expected to include the purchase
of a minority equity interest in Alliance and a licence fee payment for
Alliance contingent on milestone developments. HMR will fund product
development and pay Alliance royalties on sales. In return HMR will
have exclusive manufacturing and worldwide marketing rights to the
product.

AGOURON TO START NEW ANTICANCER DRUG TRIALS

Clinical testing of Agouron Pharmaceuticals' two new anticancer drugs
will start this year, company president and CEO Peter Johnson has
announced.

Speaking at the Hambrecht & Quist Annual Life Science Conference in San
Francisco, he said one agent, AG2034, has demonstrated potent anti-
tumour activity in preclinical animal models. The drug inhibits an
enzyme required for the synthesis of purine nucleotides essential for
sustained proliferation of cancer cells.

Another agent, AG3340, has shown significant anti-metastatic and anti-
tumour activity in animal models. The drug, which is orally
bioavailable and has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile, was designed
as a potential selective inhibitor of matrix metalloprotease enzymes
involved in cancer and arthritis.

The company already has the anti-cancer agent Thymitaq (AG 337) in
clinical development. To date 120 patients have been enrolled in six
Phase II studies (PBN 258 1995, Vol II, Page 19).

Viracept (nelfinavir mesylate), the company's anti HIV drug being
developed in conjunction with the pharmaceutical division of Japan
Tobacco, is also in Phase II trials. In the trial programme, evaluating
eight different dose levels, it has shown potent activity in acute HIV
infection, said Mr Johnson. In the most recent studies, doses of 750mg
and 1000mg tds produced significantly greater reductions of HIV than
lower doses tested previously. Large scale pivotal trials using the
higher doses are now scheduled to begin next month.

BIOCRYST STARTS PHASE II TRIAL FOR T-CELL CANCER AGENT

BioCryst Pharmaceuticals' oral formulation of its lead drug BCX-34, a
small molecule inhibitor of purine nucleoside phosphorylase - the
enzyme active in T-cell proliferation, is now in a Phase I/II dose
escalation trial. The trial follows an open label Phase I trial which
showed it is well tolerated in doses of 36-42mg iv followed by the same
dose orally a week later and has high bioavailability (>76 per cent).

The new trial will target BCX-34 against T-cell cancers for which
currently there are no satisfactory effective treatments, said
president and CEO Dr Charles Bugg. But the drug is also to be tested
for other clinical conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple
sclerosis and transplant rejection. BCX-34 was granted orphan status in
1993 and qualifies for accelerated review as a new drug to treat
serious and life-threatening illness.

In the Phase I/II trial, to be conducted at University of Alabama,
Birmingham, a dose range of 20mg up to 350mg twice daily for 28 days
will be tested.

More than 20,000 patients in the US are thought to suffer from T-cell
cancers - either cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, T-cell leukaemia or other T
cell cancers. Approximately, 1,000 new cases of CTCL, more than 400 new
cases of T-CLL and approximately 8,000 new cases of other T-cell
cancers are diagnosed each year in the US.

A topical formulation of BCX-34 tested in a Phase I open-label trial
showed evidence of efficacy in CTCL and as a result a multicentre Phase
III trial of topical treatment in CTCL is now in progress. A Phase II
trial is examining topical therapy in psoriasis.

THERATECHNOLOGIES' LEUKAEMIA RESEARCH GRANT

The National Research Council of Canada has awarded Theratechnologies a
$350,000 grant to continue its research into the photodynamic treatment
of leukaemia. The money will enable the research to progress to Phase I
trials.

Preliminary research over the past four years suggests
Theratechnologies has produced a molecule that will benefit patients
with chronic myeloid leukaemia. The molecule may also be of benefit in
other types of leukaemia and some metastic cancers, says the company.
Theratech researchers have also developed a new activating light
source.

The new technique permits autologous bone marrow grafting; previously
only a quarter of chronic myeloid leukaemia patients receive a bone
marrow graft depending on the compatibility of available donor marrow.

NPS DEVELOPING CALCIUM RECEPTOR TECHNOLOGY

NPS Pharmaceuticals has reported reaching a milestone in developing its
calcium receptor technology worth $3 million in a deal with SmithKline
Beecham. The technology which has anti-resorptive and bone-growth
stimulating implications has applications in osteoporosis. The
condition affects more than 200 million people worldwide but numbers
are expected to escalate with the growth of the ageing population over
the next 25 to 35 years. The company also reports satisfactory outcomes
to Phase I/II clinical trials of NPS R-568 Norcalcin its
hyperparathyroidism treatment. The drug, licensed to Kirin Brewery Co
for Asia and to Amgen for the rest of the world, mimics the action of
calcium in activating the calcium receptor, reducing secretion of
parathyroid hormone and lowering levels of serum calcium.

the bronchodilator, and to avoid side effects of hyper-reactivity. A
Phase II trial completed last year demonstrated that the S-isomer of
racemic albuterol, previously considered inert, induces bronchial
hyper reactivity. Racemic albuterol products currently generate revenues
worth around $2.5 billion worldwide.

MORE HEART PROBLEMS FOR IMIGRAN

Another sumatriptan - associated myocardial infarction is reported in
the current issue of Neurology (45: 2274-6). The patient, a 43-year old
Canadian man, suffered a transmural MI within one hour of ingesting
sumatriptan 100mg.

Dr P O'Connor of St Michael's Hospital, Toronto, said that the case
underscores the need to avoid using sumatriptan in patients with a
history of symptomatic coronary artery disease, or ill-defined chest
pain. He further suggests caution in using sumatriptan in any patient
with significant vascular risk factors, including smoking.

The occurrence of serious cardiac complications after sumatriptan
injection resulted in Glaxo Wellcome issuing a warning in October 1994
that "Serious coronary events, including some that have been fatal,
following Imitrex (Imigran) injection have occurred but are extremely
rare."

Dr O'Connor highlights a previous report of a 47 year old woman who
developed symptoms of severe substernal chest pain radiating to the
left shoulder 15 minutes after 6mg subcutaneous injection. In June
1995, Neurology also reported another cardiac arrest suffered by a 35-
year-old woman within minutes of receiving a first time dose of
subcutaneous sumatriptan.

Glaxo Wellcome's spokeswoman Corrine Gordon said "Imigran is
contraindicated in patients with ischaemic heart disease or previous MI
- but use in patients with risk factors for heart disease is a matter
of clinical judgement. We normally advise that patients in whom
recognised cardiac disease is likely should be evaluated for underlying
cardiovascular disease - examples of these sorts of patients would be
post menopausal women, males over 40 and patients with risk factors for
coronary artery disease. Its basically a matter of clinical judgement
what these risk factors are".

In the UK Glaxo Wellcome issued a "Dear Doctor" letter strengthening
existing warnings and precautions about use of Imigran in December
1994.

RANITIDINE FOR PSORIASIS

Better news for Glaxo Wellcome comes with the publication of a study
showing that ranitidine (Zantac) has a substantial clinical effect in
the treatment of psoriasis.

Previous studies of H2 receptor antagonists in psoriasis, have proved
disappointing; an almost immediate deterioration in some patients
leading to discontinuation of treatment.

The key to success, according to a team of Danish dermatologists and
immunologists, is persistence. They found that oral ranitidine 300mg
twice daily for six months reduced the mean PASI score (Psoriasis Area
and Severity Index) from 15.7 to 5.7 in 18 patients with moderate to
severe plaque-type psoriasis.

Fifteen patients did experience a mild to moderate worsening of their
psoriasis in the first month of treatment. However, this resolved with
continuing therapy. "We emphasise that initial worsening during
ranitidine therapy is not a reason for discontinuation of treatment as
clinical benefit was observed in the long term. Ranitidine appears to
be a safe and effective long-term treatment for psoriasis," reported Dr
H Nielsen of the National University Hospital, Denmark. (British
Journal of Dermatology 133:  905-908).

The accumulating evidence of benefit for ranitidine in this indication
suggests that histamine is involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
Ranitidine is thought to act by blocking H2-receptors presented by CD8+
T lymphocytes, counteracting a possible dysregulation of CD8+ cytotoxic
lymphocyte-CD8+ suppressor lymphocyte axis. This may return suppressor
activity to normal and down-regulate synthesis and presentation of
major histocompatibility class II antigen and release of
auto antibodies.

BIOADHESIVE TABLET FOR VAGINOSIS

A bioadhesive vaginal tablet containing 100mg metronidazole and applied
to the cervix shows promise for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis,
according to preliminary studies by Dr J Remon, of the Laboratory of
Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Gent, Belgium.

In tests, the bioadhesive tablet achieved similar cure rates to
conventional oral metronidazole, but using only one-seventieth of the
oral dose (Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology  47:  970-971).

Dr Remon concludes that further tests of the bioadhesive matrix
(consisting of a modified starch/polyacrylic mixture) are required. The
formula has already been used successfully as a buccal bioadhesive
tablet to treat candidiasis.

INFLUENZA VACCINE BENEFIT FOR ELDERLY CONFIRMED

Doubts about the efficacy of influenza vaccination of older individuals
will be dispelled by a study published in the current International
Journal of Epidemiology (24, 6, 1240-1247).

Dr Suzanne Ohmit, of the School of Public Health, University of
Michigan, found that vaccination reduced the likelihood of 65+ year
olds being admitted to hospital with influenza by 32 per cent during
both influenza type A and type B epidemics. Her community based
influenza surveillance programme covered seven counties in Michigan,
over a two year period.

CORTICOSTEROID CONTROVERSY HIGHLIGHTS BONE LOSS

While the controversy over the safety of inhaled corticosteroids in
young asthmatics continues, a new twist has been added to the story by
Californian researchers. Doctors from the Department of Family and
Preventive Medicine, University of California, say that older adults
may risk loss of bone mineral density following prolonged use of oral
and inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone, triamcinolone,
flunisolide).

Their study, published in the American Journal of Public Health (85, 12
pages 1693-95) suggests that women may be more at risk. The decrease in
bone mineral densities for oral corticosteroid users (compared with non-
users) was 7.2 per cent  at the midshaft radius, 9.4 per cent at the
hip and 8 per cent at the spine. "The most striking difference was at
the hip, suggesting that this site may be particularly vulnerable to
corticosteroids," reported Dr Elizabeth Barrett-Connor. She suggests
that further studies of bone mineral density loss and corticosteroid
use (particularly inhaled use) in older adults are still needed.

BENEFIT IN GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE

Oral beclomethasone dipropionate appears safe and effective in the
treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease, a complication of
allogenic bone marrow transplantation, according to a study by
University of Washington oncologists and gastroenterologists.

Forty-two patients were given 8mg BDP daily for up to 28 days. Symptoms
such as nausea and diarrhoea improved, as did appetite. An overall
beneficial response was observed in 72 per cent of the group and
further studies are warranted, concluded the report (Transplantation,
60, 11, 1231-38).

OFLOXACIN SEIZURE RISK WARNING

Clinicians have been reminded to comply strictly with manufacturers
guidelines for renally impaired patients, when using the antibiotic
ofloxacin (Tarivid, Hoechst). A report in Clinical Infectious Diseases
(21: 1504-6) describes four patients who had seizures while receiving
ofloxacin. All were older patients receiving high doses. Renal
insufficiency was thought to play a role in three cases. The authors,
from Akron City Hospital, Ohio, US, say that neurotoxicity and seizures
associated with ofloxacin have previously been described. Dosage
reductions may be warranted in elderly, severely ill patients because
accumulation may occur in some severely ill patients in spite of normal
renal function.

TAXOL INHIBITS BONE RESORPTION

The anti-tumour compound taxol has been found to inhibit osteoclastic
bone resorption, suggesting benefit in the inhibition of hypercalcaemia
and bone metastases, according to research published by Dr Tony Hall,
of Ciba-Geigy, Basle, Switzerland.

The report, which appears as a rapid communication in the current issue
of Calcified Tissue International, (57: 463-465) shows that Taxol dose-
dependently inhibited bone resorption in a bone-slice assay. This
inhibition was only partly accounted for by a decrease in osteoclast
spreading, suggesting that Taxol inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption
by more than one mechanism.

BROMOCRIPTINE FAILS IN APHASIA

The postsynaptic dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine has failed to show
any benefit in the first randomised, double-blind and placebo
controlled study of aphasia.

The study, by neurologist Dr Sergio Strakstein, of the Department of
Behavioural Neurology, Raul Carrea Institute of Neurological Research,
Buenos Aires, followed earlier reports that bromocriptine may improve
language deficit in people suffering nonfluent aphasia.

However, the study, which used doses escalating from 3.75 mg/day to
60mg day over a six week period , failed to show any differences
between active and placebo treatment when speech was rated by a speech
pathologist.

KW-4679 IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS

KW-4679 a new compound thought to have both antihistaminic and anti-
allergic properties may be useful for the treatment of allergic
rhinitis, according to pharmacologists from Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co, the
Japanese company responsible for synthesising the compound.

Animal work, published in this month's Japanese Journal of Pharmacology
shows that the compound reduced nasal blockage. The mechanism of action
is thought to be via the inhibition of release of histamine, peptide
leukotrienes , the production of PAF and leukotriene B4, and the
release of neuropeptides.

GAVISCON SCORES OVER ALGITEC

Liquid Gaviscon (Reckitt and Colman) is superior to Algitec Suspension
(SmithKline Beecham) in the prevention of reflux when given as a single
dose, according to a study by Dr N Washington, of the Department of
Surgery, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, UK.

The study assessed the ability of both compounds to suppress food and
acid reflux into the oesophagus after a test meal in 12 healthy
volunteers. Liquid Gaviscon significantly reduced both food and acid
reflux, but Algitec did not (Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology  47:
879-882).

The raft strength of Algitec was approximately half that of Liquid
Gaviscon, a factor which may explain the poor results for the former,
said Dr Washington. Algitec is a combination of sodium alginate with
cimetidine. According to the report, the H2 -receptor antagonist and
the alginate may interact in a complex manner with the latter
influencing the delivery or bioavailability of the cimetidine. Although
a longer dosing schedule may improve the benefit from Algitec, most
patients want immediate symptomatic relief on an as-needed basis and
"the formation of a physical barrier on the gastric contents by the
alginate (in Gaviscon) allows an immediate action," concludes the
report.

CI-988 IN ANXIETY - DISAPPOINTING RESULTS

The novel CCK-B antagonist CI-988 could not be distinguished from
placebo in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder, when given at
a dose of 300mg/day thrice daily, according to research published by
Parke-Davis (Michigan) researchers. In the current Journal of Clinical
Psychopharmacology (15: 6,428-433) they report that " there were no
trends in this study strong enough to warrant repeating a study using
CI-988 at the 300mg/day dose." However, evaluations of higher doses
will be performed to discover whether CCK-B antagonists play a role in
the modulation of anxiety, concluded their report.

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE WARNING

Two reports published this month highlight the growing problem of
antibiotic resistance. Finnish researchers call for more prudent use of
antibiotics in outpatients following the finding of a statistically
significant association between local erythromycin use and erythromycin
resistance in group A streptococci in Finland. "Restrictions of
treatment are essential to the continued efficacy of antibiotics
currently available," states their report (Clinical Infectious Diseases
21: 1378-85).

A second study, by German researchers, tracked national antimicrobial
resistance patterns over two years for Streptococcus pneumoniae
isolates causing systemic infections (Clinical Infectious Diseases 21:
1398-401). The prospective study involved 40 laboratories ranged across
Germany. The results showed that penicillin remained the antibiotic of
choice for pneumococcal infections (despite 1.8 per cent of isolates
showing reduced susceptibility. Rates of resistance to clindamycin,
erythromycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol were 1.4 per cent, 3.2
per cent, 11 per cent, and 1.9 per cent respectively. Resistance to
cefotaxime was not observed.

CYTOKINES AS VACCINE ADJUVANTS

In the light of limited clinical data and the controversial results
obtained, much more work has to be done before cytokines can be
accepted as adjuvants for use in human vaccines, according to a review
article by Sandoz researchers, published in this month's Clinical
Infectious Diseases (21: 1439-49).

"Two critical issues must be addressed by clinical trials of vaccines
with cytokine adjuvants.  The first is the balance between safety and
adjuvanticity...the second is how best to combine vaccines and
adjuvants," concludes the review - however despite these reservations,
it says that cytokines are likely to play an important role as future
adjuvants.

NEW FRAXIPARINE IN STROKE STUDY

A new trial to find out if low molecular weight heparin can be used to
treat stroke victims begins this week in Europe, North America, Hong
Kong, and Australia.

A product licence for the use of low molecular weight heparin in the
treatment of stroke moved a step closer last December, with the
publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, of a study showing
that nadroparin calcium (Fraxiparine - Sanofi) improved outcome when
given within 48 hours of a stroke.

Sanofi, clearly delighted at the results, this week hosted an
international press conference to publicise the study - and to announce
the new trial.

The NEJM "Fraxiparine in Stroke Study (FISS)" involved 306 stroke
patients at four Hong Kong hospitals. Patients received high dose
nadroparin (4100 anti-factor Xa IU twice daily), low-dose nadroparin
(4100IU once daily) or placebo subcutaneously for 10 days.

Three and six months after treatment there were no significant
differences in the primary endpoints of death or dependency (defined as
the need for help with everyday activities). However, there was a
significant improvement in the combined endpoint of death or dependency
(p=0.12 at three months and 0.005 at six months). By the end of six
months, 45 per cent of patients on high dose Fraxiparine, 52 per cent
of patients on low dose Fraxiparine, and 65 per cent of patients in the
control group had poor outcomes (ie had died or become dependent on
others for daily living).

"Our data suggest that for every five patients treated, one death or
case of dependency may be avoided," reported Dr Richard Kay, Associate
Professor of Medicine, Chinese University of Hong Kong.

However, at this week's meeting, he said the results - although
promising - did not warrant routine use of Fraxiparine in all stroke
patients. In order to get the 312 patients randomised, 2,750 stroke
patients were screened.

The major exclusion criteria were the wrong type of stroke
(haemorrhagic rather than ischaemic); age (>80); or arriving too late
for treatment (later than 48 hours post-stroke).

In the US, heparins are widely used in the treatment of stroke despite
a lack of evidence that they work, said Dr Kay. He estimates that some
30-50 per cent of US patients receive predominately older standard
heparins.

New low molecular weight heparins, such as Fraxiparine, have several
advantages over these older products. They can be administered
subcutaneously making home treatment feasible, they are better
tolerated, and the results of treatment are more predictable.

With Fraxiparine antithrombotic activity is guaranteed for at least 24
hours without the need for laboratory monitoring. Patients treated with
standard heparin need daily blood tests to monitor anticoagulant
activity. With these advantages, and a positive result from a second
confirmatory study, the market for low molecular weight heparins could
expand substantially.

Heparins are currently used for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis,
and peri- or post-operative surgical thromboprophylaxis. World wide,
some 200 million units of heparins are sold annually.

Since their introduction in the mid 1980's, low molecular weight
heparins have gradually been taking a larger slice of this total -
amounting to about half of the units sold in 1995. Of the low molecular
weight heparins, three companies account for the lion's share of sales;
Sanofi with Fraxiparine (32 per cent of all units sold); Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer with enoxaparin (28 per cent) and Kabi Pharmacia/Upjohn with
Fragmin (20 per cent).

Fraxiparine was worth $650 million in 1995. Company analysts are
confident of a massive boost in sales, if the new study confirms the
FISS results. World wide, some 1.5 million people suffer a stroke each
year. "We hope to capture at least 30 per cent of this market. With
Fraxiparine selling at $5 to $10 for a days treatment, this amounts to
a considerable turnover," said Francine Jacob, Strategic Marketing,
Sanofi.

"This growth will really depend on the outcome of the new study. The
results will be available in 1997 and should lead to registration and
formal approval for this indication. We would anticipate the first
approval in Europe, followed by Asia and North America," she said.

The new study will duplicate FISS, but with more subjects (800 stroke
patients) drawn from a wider range of countries.

ZENECA TO LAUNCH NISOLDIPINE IN US

Zeneca has acquired the US rights and full marketing control for a new
calcium channel blocker, nisoldipine (Sular), recently approved by the
FDA. The company which will launch the product this month is still
negotiating marketing rights for other countries.

Sular is in a controlled release formulation to allow once daily dosing
and will be marketed for hypertension as Sular Extended Release
tablets, says Zeneca.

The product has been acquired to boost Zeneca's cardiovascular
portfolio which includes the world's No 3 ACE inhibitor Zestril, the
largest selling beta-blocker Tenormin and Sorbitrate, the nitrate.

Despite the recent controversy over calcium channel blockers, the
market has been growing and has a current estimated value of #4.4
billion worldwide and #2.2 billion in the US.

Arimidex, Zeneca's aromatase inhibitor, has been cleared for treatment
of advanced breast cancer in the US. The drug was approved for use in
the UK last Autumn and has been submitted to all major markets outside
Japan.

In the US 18,000 women have advanced breast cancer and the expected
number of new cases diagnosed each year is 184,300. The US market for
hormonal breast cancer therapies is valued at $300 million.

The approval follows FDA clearance for Zeneca's other new treatment for
advanced breast cancer Zoladex, announced mid December. Zoladex,
injected once monthly, is indicated for premenopausal and
perimenopausal women and avoids the need for oophorectomy. One third of
new cases of breast cancer are in the pre and perimenopausal age groups
and 6 per cent of new cases have advanced disease.

Zoladex, which won a Queen's award for technology five years ago, was
approved in the US in 1989 for advanced prostate cancer and in 1993 for
endometriosis. It is already earning in excess of $60 million in the
US. Zeneca announced FDA approval of the drug in its three month depot
formulation (Zoladex LA) for prostate cancer on 12 January. Treatment
reduces testosterone to castration levels and avoids the need for
orchidectomy. The drug is already approved for pre and peri-menopausal
breast cancer in 72 countries.

LEUKOTRIENE ANTAGONISTS TIPPED AS ASTHMA MARKET LEADERS

Leukotriene receptor antagonists are tipped to become the leading
product group in the respiratory drug market of the early years of the
21st century with 20 per cent of asthma sales and 14 per cent of the
total respiratory market. Merck, Zeneca, Abbott and SmithKline Beecham
are companies new to the respiratory market which will profit from the
new drug class.

The projection comes in a new report from the Pharma Strategy Group of
IMS based on an analysis of IMS data and interviews with 80 opinion
leaders, which sees total drug sales for respiratory disorders growing
by 47 per cent in six major markets - Germany, France, UK, Italy, Japan
and the US. Total sales are projected at $14.1 billion by the year 2005
against the current $9.5 billion.

Phosphodiesterase inhibitors which have both bronchodilatory and anti-
inflammatory effects in asthma, as well as possible applications in
rhinitis and dermatitis, are predicted to reach the marketplace by the
year 200? and to hold 7 per cent of asthma sales by 2005.

P&U GETS FDA CLEARANCE TO MARKET NEW ANTIARRHYTHMIC

Pharmacia &Upjohn, Inc announced US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval to market Corvert Injection (ibutilide fumarate injection),
used to treat the common arrhythmias of atrial fibrillation and atrial
flutter. Corvert is used to achieve rapid conversion of atrial
fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm.

The frequency of arrhythmias increases with age. Atrial fibrillation
affects .4 per cent of Americans under the age of 60 and 2 to 4 per
cent of those over 60. The primary treatment option for patients
needing rapid conversion of atrial fibril action and flutter is
electrical cardioversion. Drugs are not rapidly effective and usually
require one to three days of hospitalisation, dose titration and
observation. Two large, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and
randomised clinical trials demonstrated that, compared to placebo,
Corvert Injection successfully and rapidly converted atrial
fibrillation and flutter to normal rhythm. In a third study in Europe,
Corvert compared quite well with another intravenous antiarrhythmic
agent.

Joann L Data, corporate vice-president for world-wide pharmaceutical
regulatory affairs and project management, said "Corvert is a novel
agent, that provides a pharmacological alternative for a difficult
management problem. Currently, no medicines are approved to provide
rapid pharmacological conversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial
flutter to normal sinus rhythm".

FDA APPROVES ORTHO'S RENOVA

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved for marketing, 2
January, Renova, 0.05 per cent tretinoin emollient cream.) as a
treatment for reducing certain kinds of skin damage, such as fine
wrinkles, spotty discoloration and rough skin. Renova was developed by
the Dermatological Division of Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation
(Raritan, NJ), a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson. It is an offshoot
of the company's acne product, Retin-A. Renova is formulated as an
emollient cream, which differentiates it from Retin-A. Renova was
approved for damaged skin, in conjunction with a co prehensive skin
care and sun avoidance programme. Its effectiveness is dependent on
other good skin care practices including avoiding direct sunlight,
applying sunscreens, wearing protective clothing and using moisturising
lotions. FDA notes that many people can enhance skin appearance and
protect skin from damage by adopting regular use of these practices and
not using Renova.

It does not eliminate wrinkles, repair sun damaged skin, reverse the
ageing process or photo ageing or repair factors leading to skin cancer.
Nor is there evidence that Renova treats deep wrinkles, coarse skin,
skin yellowing or other skin problems. Studies have shown that after 24
weeks, approximately 30 per cent of users had moderate improvement of
their fine wrinkles or spotty discoloration, 34 per cent had minimal
improvement and 35 per cent had no improvement. Furthermore, about 16
per cent of users had moderate improvement in skin roughness, 35 per
cent saw minimal improvement and 49 per cent had no improvement.
Patients using Renova noticed some improvement between three to six
months. Improvements gradually diminished when treatment stopped. The
safety of daily use for more than 48 weeks has not been established.
Renova has not been studied in people age 50 or older, or in people
with moderately or darkly pigmented skin. Safe use in children has not
been shown and pregnant patients are warned not to use this cream.
Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp will begin marketing Renova in February l996.
The company estimates costs for the patient of $10-$15 per month. The
average retail price for the 40 gram tube that usually lasts four to
six months is $60. It will be available, also, in tubes containing 60
grams. The company, that markets in more than 100 countries and employs
approximately 2,000 workers, sells Renova in Ireland and the UK, having
received approval for the drug in those countries in 1993 and 1995
respectively. In 1995, Renova was also approved in Canada. Ortho's
spokesperson told PBN that Renova has been filed in Mexico, France,
Portugal, Spain, Australia, New Zealand and Thailand. The discovery
that Retin-A reduces wrinkles and photoageing was made by Dr Albert
Kligman of Pennsylvania University. The university and its agent
Competitive Technologies will receive royalties on US and foreign
sales.

drug pramipexole following the conclusion of three large scale Phase
III trials. The dopamine agonist, discovered by Boehringer Ingelheim
and co-developed with Pharmacia & Upjohn, is indicated for both the
early and late stages of disease. Early use of pramipexole is expected
to delay the onset of complications seen in late stage disease after
early use of levodopa therapy. Preclinical studies have shown the drug
has advantages over levodopa in binding preferentially to the D3
receptor and acting as a full dopamine agonist.

CITY TALK

Sector analysts increasingly are recommending an overweight position in
the US pharmaceuticals sector, with faster approvals from the FDA in
1995 said to have helped bolster new product prospects. Proposals for
FDA reform should ensure a continuing improvement in the rate of
approvals by the agency and a lowering of the review time required.
Despite a weaker Dow Jones Industrial Average, Merck gained $1-1/2 on
15 January. In late December Merck outlined its growth strategy in a
presentation to analysts, saying it would grow sales with effective
promotion of existing products, by providing value to managed care
customers with Medco and through R&D support to ensure future new
product flows. It was disclosed that Merck's products account for 13
per cent of Medco's sales, the highest of any drug company and up from
11.5 per cent a year ago. One analyst, maintaining a hold
recommendation on the shares, highlighted the huge margins generated
from the Astra Merck joint venture, estimated at around 50 per cent.
Merck's vaccine business, including joint ventures, has sales
approaching $1 billion a year. Johnson & Johnson, up $1-1/8 to $84-7/8
in morning trade on 12 January, was upgraded to near-term buy by one
Wall Street analyst. Industry consolidation looks set to continue
through much of 1996. Hygenics Pharmaceuticals, a US company that
develops premium generic drugs, announced it was in preliminary talks
to merge with an unidentified pharmaceutical manufacturing company.

In the UK, the majority of analysts have turned neutral after the
sector's stunning performance in 1995 - the pharmaceutical sector
outperformed the All-Share index by about 35 per cent last year - and
recommend profit-taking ahead of the anticipated economic recovery.
"More people are looking to take profits rather than to build up
weightings," said one analyst. That said, Glaxo Wellcome, Medeva and
SmithKline Beecham are tipped to perform well this year, with some
analysts continuing to recommend an overweight investment stance.
Shares in SmithKline Beecham, at 719p on 5 January, have risen strongly
over the past 12 months, up more than 50 per cent, and boosted recently
by keen interest from US investors. Better-than-average earnings growth
over the next two years should bolster the stock's investor appeal.
Analysts estimate full-year underlying pre-tax profits of around #1.35
billion and reported pharmaceutical sales growth in excess of 12 per
cent when 1995 results are announced on 20 February. Margins at DPS
however are considered weaker than first thought at the time of the
acquisition. Strong deal-making efforts are likely to see Medeva
outperform, with the shares considered cheap at current levels.
Although the shares have risen more than 40 per cent relative to the
market over the past 12 months, further headway is likely as the
company demonstrates the potential of its restored growth and sound
underlying strategy. Analysts highlight the growth potential from a
generic version of Glaxo Wellcome's Ventolin and anaesthetic gases from
Inhalon. In December the US FDA approved the first generic inhaled
asthma drug, Ivax's aerosol formulation of salbutamol. Full-year
results for the year to end December will be announced in late
February. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of around #77
million, an increase of over 20 per cent on 1994. The results also
include a #1.5 million charge in relation to settlement of a
shareholder suit tied to the company's share price fall in 1993. Last
week Glaxo Wellcome issued a $500 million 10-year Eurobond, completing
its debt restructuring programme following the #9.5 billion acquisition
of Wellcome. On 15 January, rating agency Standard & Poor's affirmed
its AA minus long-term and A1 plus short-term ratings of Glaxo Wellcome
and revised its outlook to stable from negative. The positive re-rating
acknowledges the strength of Glaxo Wellcome's research pipeline and its
strong cash-generating ability. Risks remain however, including
uncertainties over the group's ability to generate the anticipated cost
savings and the threat of a higher-than-anticipated decline in sales of
Zantac. "Glaxo Wellcome is at a discount to the sector because of
uncertainty over Zovirax, Zantac and the rationalisation benefits.
Zeneca, which last week received FDA approval for its Zoladex prostate
cancer treatment, drifted lower, closing the week off 2.8 per cent at
1230p. Takeover speculation apart, the shares are described as
overvalued.

European drug stocks, strengthened by firmer product and market
strategies, face a bright year ahead. Hafslund Nycomed, Synthelabo and
Sandoz are expected to perform in line or ahead of their respective
markets over the next six months. Shares in the latter surged more than
60 per cent in absolute terms in the past year but are now likely to
consolidate around current levels.

SPORTS AND EXERCISE DURING ACUTE ILLNESS
Recommending the Right Course for Patients

By:
William A. Primos, Jr, MD

In brief: Active people who suffer acute infectious illness may have
questions concerning participation in exercise or sports during their
illness. Many patients are reluctant to ``get behind'' on their training or
``let down the team.'' Physical activity, however, may worsen the
condition, result in impaired performance, or infect others. On the other
hand, some contagious diseases are relatively benign, and some activities
don't affect others. Therefore, clinicians need to understand both the
sport and the illness to know what level of activity to recommend. For
example, solo exercise at a reduced intensity is generally safe for
patients whose symptoms are above the neck.

   Although regular exercise can help improve health, even well-trained
athletes develop acute infectious diseases. Most physicians advise patients
to rest during an acute illness. However, highly motivated athletes and
exercisers often have a variety of reasons to continue athletic activities
during an illness:
   -- Marcia is a 30-year-old runner training for a marathon. She develops
infectious gastroenteritis. She does not want to miss a day of running and
fall behind in her training schedule. Despite several episodes of diarrhea
the night before, she decides to accompany her friends on their usual
Saturday morning 20-mile run. The weather that day is unusually warm and
humid. During the run she collapses and suffers heatstroke.
   -- Mark, a 16-year-old wrestler, has influenza. Tomorrow the conference
tournament will be held, which he must win to qualify for the state
championships. His symptoms include headaches, chills, and myalgia. His
temperature is 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C). Mark decides to enter the
tournament. In his first-round match he loses to an opponent he had easily
defeated 2 weeks before. Mark's team receives no points in his weight class
and is narrowly defeated for the team championship.
   -- Michelle is a 32-year-old aerobics instructor who has an
upper-respiratory tract infection with rhinorrhea and a sore throat. She is
scheduled to teach two classes tonight and one tomorrow morning and cannot
find a substitute instructor. She slightly alters the routine for her
classes, decreasing the number of high-intensity steps and increasing the
time spent stretching. She is able to complete her classes, has no
worsening of symptoms, and is asymptomatic 2 days later.
   Patients with acute infectious diseases often have questions about
participation in athletic activities. What effect does exercise have on an
infection? Can physical exertion worsen the problem?
   Physicians should be able to determine what level of activity is safe
for their patients with infectious diseases and to explain to the patients
who need restrictions why they should avoid sports. An understanding of
athletes' susceptibility to infection, effects of illness on physical
performance, risks of exercising during an illness, and general guidelines
about determining playability will guide the physician's recommendations.

How Susceptible to Infection?
   Does regular exercise and physical conditioning affect susceptibility to
infection? Do athletes have altered immunity? A number of factors can
affect a physically active person's risk of acquiring an infection.
   Active people may be placed at increased risk of contracting infectious
diseases because of increased exposure. Athletes are often in close contact
with other participants who may carry pathogens. Transmission may occur
through a number of different mechanisms. Training and competition often
involve heavy respiration, coughing, and spitting. These acts may transmit
nasopharyngeal secretions containing infectious organisms. Direct
transmission may occur by bodies touching in some contact sports. Infection
may also be transmitted by contact with contaminated objects such as mats,
towels, and water bottles.
   Some studies1,2 (Reference) have shown that intense physical training
may lead to a suppressed immune system and an increased susceptibility to
infection. A recent study3 showed that natural killer cell activity
increased immediately after high-intensity exercise, but decreased 1 hour
and 2 hours after both moderate- and high-intensity exercise. These changes
may have been due to a shift of the natural killer cells from the blood to
peripheral tissues.
   Eichner4 (Reference) reviewed several studies dealing with exercise and
the immune system. Some showed alterations in the immune system by
exercise. Most of the data, however, were inconclusive about whether the
changes that occurred in the immune system were clinically important. Also,
some changes in immunity in athletes may be attributable to emotional
stress.
   Even if exercise does not increase susceptibility to illness, physical
activity may make people more sensitive to symptoms. Minor symptoms such as
nasal congestion or a cough are likely to be noticed by a runner during a
train- ing session but may be overlooked by a sedentary person.

Harmful Effects
   In making a decision about whether an individual should participate in
athletics, a number of different factors should be considered. The primary
area of concern is how exercise would affect the health of the patient.
Could exercise worsen symptoms, cause complications, or delay recovery?
   Strenuous exercise may result in more severe symptoms. Studies have
shown that intense exercise during the incubation phase of an infection can
increase the severity of the illness.1 (Reference) This may be related to
suppression of the immune system during exercise.
   Exercising with an infection also carries some disease-specific health
risks. Symptoms of a respiratory tract infection, for example, may worsen
with exercise. These infections are often associated with inflammation of
the airways and increased bronchial secretions. In individuals with asthma
or reactive airways caused by a respiratory tract infection, strenuous
exercise may cause bronchospasm, with increased cough, wheezing, and
dyspnea.
   Splenic rupture is a potentially fatal complication of infectious
mononucleosis. Physicians restrict patients who have infectious
mononucleosis from strenuous athletic activities for extended periods
because of the perceived risk of splenic rupture from direct trauma or
exertion.5 (Reference) The decision on the proper time for resuming
athletic activity is controversial, ranging from 1 to 6 months after the
onset of the illness.5-8 (Reference) Since only enlarged spleens rupture,
and because almost all splenic ruptures occur in the first 3 weeks of
illness,6 (Reference) the following criteria may be used for determining
the proper time for return to athletic activity, assuming the patient is
also asymptomatic:
   -- For light, nonstrenuous exercise, patients can resume activity 3
weeks after the onset of the illness as long as the spleen is not markedly
enlarged on physical examination.
   -- For strenuous and contact sports, patients can resume activity
approximately 1 month after the onset of the illness if the spleen is not
enlarged on palpation. (Physical examination may not be reliable for
determining spleen size. Therefore, ultrasonography should be considered
for assessing spleen size in a patient who wishes to return to strenuous or
contact sports before 1 month.)
   Another group of diseases that might be worsened or complicated by
exercise is infection with enteroviruses such as coxsackieviruses.
Enteroviruses usually cause respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, but
they may also cause myocarditis.9 (Reference) (See ``Viral Myocarditis:
Detection and Management, July 1995, page 63.) Studies on viral myocarditis
in mice found that strenuous exercise can result in myocardial necrosis and
cardiac dilation, which often led to death from pulmonary edema.10
(Reference) Myocarditis has also been implicated as a cause of sudden death
during exercise in humans11 (Reference) and has been reported as the most
frequent cause of sudden death in military recruits.12 (Reference) Because
of the potential for myocarditis, it has been recommended that people who
have systemic symptoms such as fever and myalgia avoid strenuous
exercise.11 (Reference)

Impaired Performance
   A different factor to consider in determining playability is impaired
performance. Acute illness can hinder athletic performance by influencing
several different body systems.
   Cardiac function may be altered during acute infections, especially
those accompanied by fever. Cardiac output and cardiac stroke volume may
decrease during systemic febrile viral infections. These effects were found
in subjects who were inoculated with sandfly fever virus.13 (Reference) In
another study,14 (Reference) individuals with febrile illness showed higher
oxygen uptake and higher maximal heart rate during exercise. Still another
study15 found acute disturbance of myocardial electrical and mechanical
function in subjects who had viral infections.
   Acute viral respiratory tract infections can affect pulmonary function.
For example, research studies have shown respiratory infections to impair
pulmonary gas exchange, though the impairment is not serious. A possible
explanation for this effect could be mild bronchiolitis that results in
mild ventilation-perfusion abnormalities.16 (Reference) Additionally,
rhinovirus infection may produce transient peripheral airway abnormalities,
which are detected by measuring the dynamic compliance of the lungs and
also are not serious. In a study by Blair et al,17 (Reference) five of
eight individuals with rhinovirus infection developed increased lung
compliance with higher respiration rates. These changes were transient,
usually resolving in 2 weeks.
   Viral infections can also affect the muscular system. Studies9,13,18
(Reference) have shown impaired skeletal muscle performance and strength
during acute viral infections. One study13 found that all subjects had
decreased muscle strength and function, and another18 (Reference) showed
that 9 of 10 subjects had statistically significant loss of isometric and
dynamic strength and muscle endurance.
   Some infectious diseases may alter an active person's fluid status.
Acute infectious diseases, especially those with gastroenteritis and fever,
often result in reduced fluid intake and increased fluid losses. A fluid
deficit of as little as 2% to 3% of body weight stresses the circulatory
system and can impair endurance.19,20 (Reference)
   Low levels of body fluid could also affect temperature regulation since
less perspiration results in dissipation of less body heat. Although body
temperature normally rises during exercise, exercisers who have a fever
experience an even greater rise.21 (Reference) Impaired fluid status and
thermoregulation caused by febrile illness could put an active person in
danger of developing heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and circulatory
collapse.
   Because of these effects on the various body systems, acute infectious
illness may result in decreased endurance, strength, speed, concentration,
or any combination of these factors. If an athlete is unable to perform
adequately, the goals of the team would probably be better served by using
another team member who is able to perform at a higher level.
   Because of the previously discussed physiologic effects of acute febrile
viral infections, it is logical to assume that working out during a viral
illness would impart fewer fitness gains than would working out while
healthy. Patients who are concerned about losing training time can be
reminded of this supposition.

Risk of Infecting Others
   Playability decisions are also affected by whether other people would be
put at risk by the infected person's participation. To determine the risk
of transmission, one must consider the period of contagiousness, the mode
of transmission, and the type of contact. If the illness is potentially
severe and is in the contagious period--and the type of contact would put
others at risk of infection--participation should be avoided. Athletes
should be encouraged to consider the health and welfare of others more
important than their participation in sports.
   Measles is an infection that can be transmitted to others through sports
participation. Measles is a highly contagious illness for those who are not
immune and is transmitted person to person via aerosol droplets. Measles
transmission during athletic events such as the 1991 International Special
Olympics and the Maryland high school state wrestling tournament has been
documented.22 (Reference) The period of contagiousness for measles lasts
until 4 days after the appearance of the rash; people with measles should
be disqualified from sports participation during this period.
   Epidemic pleurodynia, or epidemic myalgia, is characterized by abrupt
onset of chest or abdominal pain and fever. The usual pathogen is
coxsackievirus B. Outbreaks of this disease have been reported on football
and soccer teams. In an outbreak on a New York high school football team, a
possible mode of transmission was shared water containers.23 (Reference)
   In a recent review of infectious diseases in sports in the United
States, the most common disease spread by person-to-person contact was
herpes simplex,24 (Reference) with 12 documented reports among wrestlers
and rugby players. Close contact is required for transmission. The disease
can be spread either via body fluids or by direct contact of the lesions
with uninfected skin or mucous membranes. The risk of transmission is
increased if the uninfected skin is abraded or otherwise damaged. To
prevent spread of herpes simplex, infected athletes should be disqualified
from contact sports until all lesions are crusted over or healed.

Practical Advice
   Physicians need to educate patients about exercising during an acute
illness, limiting spread of the disease, and preventing infection in the
first place (see the patient handout ``Exercising--or Not--When You Are
Sick'' on page 55). As pointed out by Goodman et al,24 (Reference) athletes
should be reminded that by their participation in sports, others may be put
at risk of acquiring infection. If infection could be transmitted during
the sport, participation should be avoided.
   In addition, athletes should be immunized against preventable diseases
such as measles, mumps, tetanus, rubella, and, possibly, hepatitis B.
Diseases such as enteroviral infections can be prevented by avoiding shared
water bottles and towels. Also, healthcare providers need to report
outbreaks of infectious diseases to public health officials to allow
control measures.
   Active people who do develop acute infectious illnesses should be
advised that the benefits of exercise are decreased during illness and that
they might as well wait until they have recovered. Patients should also be
informed that participation in strenuous exercise may be dangerous to their
health.
   To help prevent serious complications such as myocarditis, patients can
use a ``neck check'' of symptoms.4 (Reference) If the person has only
``above the neck'' symptoms, such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sore
throat, then he or she can probably safely try participation. However, if
the patient has ``below the neck'' symptoms, such as myalgia, hacking
cough, fever, or chills, it would be wise to refrain from intense physical
activity. By following these recommendations, patients who have acute
illnesses may avoid complications and make a safe return to full activity.

DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF EXERCISE-INDUCED ASTHMA

By:
Ned T. Rupp, MEd, MD

   In brief: Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) affects 12% to 15% of the
general population. Its symptoms include chest tightness, shortness of
breath, coughing, wheezing, fatigue, and prolonged recovery times after
exercise. Diagnosis depends on accurate history, physical examination, and
lung function testing. Nonpharmacologic management includes modification of
both activity and ambient conditions, along with rigorous patient
education. Short-acting inhaled beta (subscript) 2 agonists are the
pharmacologic treatment of choice for isolated and breakthrough EIA.
Anti-inflammatory medications such as inhaled cromolyn sodium, nedocromil
sodium, and corticosteroids are used to control underlying asthma as well
as EIA. Other agents such as oral theophylline or long-acting beta agonists
may be important but their roles aren't clearly defined.

   When undiagnosed, exercise-induced asthma (EIA), a common clinical
syndrome characterized by a transient increase in airway resistance
following several minutes of exercise,1,2 (Reference) can be an obstacle to
an active lifestyle. But when the disease is identified and well managed,
the results can be remarkable for patients of all activity levels. Of the
597 members of the 1984 United States Olympic Team, 67 (11.2%) experienced
EIA.3 (Reference) The athletes who had EIA won 41 medals during the games.
Their superb achievements indicate the high level of performance that
people who have EIA can reach with appropriate therapy.

How Common is EIA?
   EIA affects a broad segment of the population. Up to 90% of people who
have asthma experience EIA during the course of their disease, and most
consider exercise to be a major precipitant of their asthma.4-6 (Reference)
In addition, 35% to 40% of patients who have allergic rhinitis experience
EIA precipitated by allergens, viruses, cold air, air pollutants, or a
combination of these factors.2,4-7 (Reference) The general population who
are not diagnosed as asthmatic and do not have noted respiratory allergies
have a much lower EIA incidence of 3% to 10%. Combining these groups gives
an overall EIA incidence of 12% to 15%.8 (Reference) The incidence is
somewhat higher in children than in adults.8 (Reference)
   Among active people, the incidence of EIA ranges from 3% to more than
12%.3,6,9-11 (Reference) The presence of EIA in active people, however, may
be underreported, as many athletes may not be aware they have the
condition. The symptoms of EIA can often be perceived as part of the
experience of normal vigorous exercise.11 (Reference) In addition, denial
of illness is common among young athletes.

When Exercise Obstructs
   Asthma is an obstructive disease of the airways characterized by airway
inflammation and hyperreactivity. Airflow obstruction is influenced by
bronchial wall edema, mucus production, airway smooth muscle contraction,
and hypertrophy. The obstruction may be initiated by inflammatory events in
the airways, particularly the release of inflammatory mediators from mast
cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells. Airway hyperreactivity is an
exaggerated bronchoconstriction response to various stimuli including
allergens, environmental irritants, viral respiratory infections, cold air,
and exercise. Airway obstruction brought on by exercise is termed EIA.
   The etiology of EIA is probably multifactorial. Though much has been
discovered about EIA, complete understanding of the pathophysiology of the
disease has not yet been obtained. For example, the concept of airway
inflammation contributing to asthma is relatively new, and its impact on
management of the disease is still being determined.
   There is a general consensus that the airway obstruction that develops
in EIA is related to thermodynamic events within the airway during
hyperpnea. As a result of hyperventilation during and after exercise, the
upper airway is unable to bring inspired air to body temperature and 100%
humidity. Heat and water are drawn from the respiratory tissue in order to
warm and humidify the inspired air, resulting in respiratory tissue water
loss and airway cooling.12-14 (Reference)
   Typically, EIA begins with bronchodilation either during or immediately
following exercise. All people experience bronchodilation in response to
exercise. Normally, widening of the glottis and bronchodilation meet the
increased oxygen requirements during exercise. In EIA, however, the glottis
widens but the lower airways constrict. Respiratory demand increases, and
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV (subscript) 1) and peak
expiratory flow rate (PEFR) decrease significantly. Maximal
bronchoconstriction generally occurs 3 to 15 minutes after exercise
ceases.15 (Reference) Factors that can vary the usual bronchoconstriction
timing include environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, air
quality, or pollens; the type, duration, or intensity of the exercise; the
time from a previous exercise session; and the degree of bronchial
hyperreactivity.
   With a second exercise challenge, less than half of the original degree
of obstruction will occur--this is defined as the refractory period.
Approximately half of patients are refractory within 1 hour, but nearly
everyone loses the effect after 2 to 3 hours. It is impossible to predict
whether a person will be refractory to EIA, and occurrence of a refractory
period may be intermittent in any patient. Original bronchospasm severity
plays no role in a patient's refractory status, though certain factors
encourage the refractory period: a warm-up session before exercise;
breathing or exercising in warm, humid air; and prolonged submaximal
exercise.
   Though most patients recover from EIA within 1 hour,2 (Reference) late
asthmatic responses that occur 3 to 9 hours after exercise have been
reported.16,17 (Reference) Patients at higher risk for late responses
appear to be children and those with severe early responses.2 (Reference)
Some investigators have doubted the existence of this late response or its
clinical relevance19 (Reference) because bronchoconstriction during the
late response is usually much less severe.
   In other words, repeated exercise challenge during the refractory period
may still reduce FEV (subscript) 1 and PEFR, but less than half as much as
with the initial postchallenge reduction.18 (Reference)
   The factors that influence the severity of EIA (table 1) are similar to
those that affect the refractory period and include the degree of
underlying bronchial hyperreactivity; duration, type and intensity of
exercise; environmental conditions; exposure to allergens; respiratory
infections; interval since the last episode of EIA (refractory period);16
(Reference) and low fitness level. Environmental factors such as cold, dry
air, airborne allergens such as pollens or house dust mites, and air
pollutants can exacerbate EIA. In patients with EIA who are susceptible to
allergens, antigen challenge during exercise has been found to double the
intensity of EIA.20 (Reference) Therefore, designing an individual
treatment regimen requires consideration of seasonal and geographic
factors. Activities such as running and cycling that require high levels of
activity at or near maximal levels of aerobic capacity are most likely to
cause EIA. Generally, the more vigorous the exercise, the more rapid and
severe the bronchospasm.21 (Reference) The relationship of duration of
exercise to intensity of EIA is more complex. With a short period of
activity, the severity of bronchospasm is related to exercise length;
however, some patients find that if they continue to exercise after
symptoms develop, they may be able to ``run through'' their
bronchospasm.2,8 (Reference) This effect may be related to the refractory
period.

EIA Workup Strategies
   In the workup of a patient who has suspected EIA, a thorough history is
vital (table 2). The signs and symptoms of EIA are typically those of
classic airway obstruction: dyspnea, cough, and chest tightness with or
without wheezing, though some patients may also complain of
gastrointestinal discomfort. EIA may also present as chest pain in children
and adolescents.22 (Reference) Without a careful history, possibly
augmented by teammates, coaches, family, or friends, these signs and
symptoms may be easily misinterpreted as postexercise fatigue. Also, denial
of symptoms is common, especially among student-athletes because of peer
pressure, embarrassment, and fear of losing their place on the team.11
(Reference)
   A careful physical examination of the upper and lower respiratory tracts
is important. However, because of the episodic nature of EIA, the physical
exam is often normal despite the presence of significant disease. The
pharynx should be examined for mucus indicating postnasal drainage.
Examination of the nose may reveal erythema, congestion, and enlarged
turbinates. Sinuses should be percussed to assess for tenderness.
Examination of the lower respiratory tract should include auscultation of
the lungs to determine the presence of a prolonged expiratory phase,
wheezing, or coughing with inspiration.
   Pulmonary function testing is an integral part of EIA diagnosis. Initial
FEV (subscript) 1, forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV (subscript) 1/FVC
ratio, and PEFR values should be determined. FEV (subscript) 1 and FEV
(subscript) 1/FVC values below 80% of predicted value indicate obstructive
airway disease. Caution should accompany a diagnosis based on PEFR
measurements: Peak flow is highly effort dependent, and a low PEFR may
indicate either obstructive or restrictive respiratory disease. Once the
EIA diagnosis has been made, PEFR measurements may be useful in following
the course of the disease and response to treatment.
   However, many patients have symptoms of EIA but a normal resting
pulmonary function test. These patients may require inhalation challenge,
exercise challenge, or a therapeutic trial to establish the diagnosis. (See
``Exercise Challenge for Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm: Confirming
Presence, Evaluating Control,'' August 1995, page 47.) Furthermore, active
patients often have lung function well above normal predicted values; for
example, a 30% drop in a patient with 150% of normal function may appear
satisfactory, but could represent a bronchospastic problem for that
individual.
   Bronchoprovocation testing is sensitive for diagnosing hyperreactive
airways.6 (Reference) Patients inhale gradually increasing concentrations
of a bronchoconstrictor, usually methacholine (though histamine may also be
used), while spirometric changes in airflow are recorded. The degree of
airway hyperreactivity is related to the amount of bronchoconstrictor
required to cause bronchospasm. Another laboratory test that has gained
popularity is bronchoprovocation with cold air.
   Exercise challenge testing involves determining baseline lung function
before exercise and measuring forced expiration at 5- to 10-minute
intervals following exercise for 15 to 30 minutes. Exercise challenge
should consist of 6 to 10 minutes of strenuous exercise at 85% to 90% of
the predicted maximal heart rate. Postexercise decreases of 10% to 20% in
FEV (subscript) 1 indicate mild EIA, 20% to 40% moderate, and more than 40%
severe.23 (Reference) When the patient's history is compatible with EIA yet
spirometry at 15 minutes is nondiagnostic, a prolonged postexercise
evaluation is necessary.15 (Reference)
   Exercise challenge is less sensitive than methacholine challenge, so
negative results do not exclude the diagnosis of EIA; however, exercise
testing is highly specific for EIA, and positive results provide good
assurance of the presence of the disease. Results of provocation testing
may vary due to the influences of allergens, air pollution, temperature, or
upper respiratory infections. These same factors can account for the
seasonal occurrence of EIA in many people.
   Because a patient who has EIA may have normal ``at rest'' pulmonary
function, a history consistent with EIA should prompt patient education
about the condition and its treatment. A trial of a short-acting beta
(subscript) 2 agonist prior to exercise, with symptom monitoring by the
patient, is often the next appropriate step. Follow-up exercise challenge
is often unnecessary in cases of clear benefit, so this strategy can be a
very cost-effective management approach.
   Challenge testing is warranted when the patient history is unclear or
when the patient's coach or parents have brought the symptoms to the
physician's attention. Testing can help avoid overuse or unnecessary use of
medication when the patient's breathing problems are caused by anxiety,
hyperventilation syndrome, poor conditioning, upper airway obstruction, or
seasonal EIA. Finally, an exercise challenge can not only reproduce the
symptoms for the patient, but also encourage compliance by demonstrating
the effectiveness of therapy.

Nonpharmacologic Interventions
   The goal of EIA management is to allow patients to participate fully in
athletic activities without difficulty. The ultimate success of
pharmacologic therapy will depend on the following nonpharmacologic
strategies: activity modification, improvement in ambient air conditions,
and patient education.
   Management should begin with efforts to increase physical conditioning,
which can reduce the requirements for pharmacotherapy and decrease the
incidence of asthma attacks.7,24 (Reference) Also, short bursts of activity
have been shown to decrease EIA.25 (Reference) By incorporating warm-up
activities into their exercise program, patients may be able to take
advantage of the refractory period and decrease the frequency and severity
of bronchospastic episodes.
   Warm, humid environments or breathing in warm, humid air will ameliorate
EIA and will improve the patient's chances of being refractory to repeated
exercise challenge over the next 1 to 3 hours. Wearing a face mask during
activity warms and humidifies inspired air when outdoor conditions are cold
and dry. Breathing through the nose rather than the mouth will filter,
warm, and humidify inspired air.
   Education can boost the effectiveness of other therapeutic
interventions. Patients must be aware of the conditions that exacerbate
their disease and how to avoid them, early signs of an impending asthma
attack, and appropriate use of medications for prevention and flares.

Pharmacologic Options
   The pharmacologic goals of treating EIA are preventing the onset of
asthma episodes and treating breakthrough episodes that may occur following
exercise. Several classes of drugs with bronchodilating and
anti-inflammatory effects are used to treat EIA, including beta agonists,
cromolyn sodium, nedocromil sodium, and corticosteroids--all most
frequently given by inhalation--and oral theophylline.
   Beta agonists are the drugs of choice for preventing isolated EIA and
for on-demand treatment of exercise-induced acute asthma
exacerbations.2,6,7,15,24,26 (Reference) This group includes the
established short-acting agents albuterol, bitolterol mesylate,
metaproterenol sulfate, pirbuterol acetate, terbutaline sulfate, and the
newer, longer-acting salmeterol. Both short and long-acting beta agonists
are effective in nearly all patients who have asthma--those with chronic
obstruction and those who have only exercise-related obstruction. However,
short-acting beta agonists are the most effective agents for preventing
EIA, and are effective in 80% to 95% of patients.27 (Reference) They
reverse contraction of bronchial smooth muscle and are very effective
bronchodilators.28 (Reference) In the laboratory, beta agonists have
exhibited some anti-inflammatory activity through stabilization of mast
cells and prevention of release of histamine and other inflammatory
mediators; however, the clinical relevance of these effects is not yet
known.29 (Reference) Short-acting inhaled beta agonists have a rapid onset
of action, usually within 5 minutes, and maximal bronchodilation usually
occurs within 15 minutes.30 (Reference) Therefore, to achieve maximal
effect during intense exercise, short-acting beta agonists should be
administered 15 minutes before exercise. Duration of action varies, but
effectiveness against EIA generally lasts 3 to 6 hours.
   Salmeterol, the long-acting beta agonist approved for use in patients
age 12 or older in the United States, has been shown to protect against EIA
for up to 12 hours in 55% of patients who have EIA and take no chronic
asthma medications.31 (Reference) Because its onset of action is slower
than that of the short-acting beta agonists, salmeterol is never to be used
as a rescue medication, and dosing is limited to 2 puffs every 12 hours.32
(Reference) Patients who take salmeterol, therefore, must have a
short-acting beta agonist available to relieve sudden onset of
bronchospasm.33 (Reference) The effectiveness of short-acting beta agonists
for rescue purposes may be blunted if salmeterol is being used.34
(Reference)
   In addition, tolerance to the effects of beta agonists is an area of
active research. In general, tachyphylaxis appears to occur with regular
use of beta agonists.33,35,36 (Reference) With regard to EIA, a recent
study37 reported that after 4 weeks of regular salmeterol administration,
tachyphylaxis developed to the point that there was no significant
difference in effectiveness between the drug and placebo. The controversy
surrounding the regular use of beta agonists has led to the current
consensus recommendation of on-demand use.24,26,38,39 (Reference)
   Current guidelines for the management of EIA begin with administration
of a short-acting inhaled beta agonist 15 minutes before exercise. Patients
should then undertake a 15-minute warm-up period of stretching and
low-level exercise, followed by a 15-minute rest period before intense
exercise if possible. If asthma symptoms develop during exercise, on-demand
therapy with two puffs of short-acting beta agonist should be repeated.6
(Reference)
   Patients must be carefully educated about the proper use and roles of
short- and long-acting beta agonists. If a patient's use of a short-acting
beta agonist increases, he or she should immediately contact the physician:
Increased use may be a sign of worsening disease, and the patient may need
further evaluation and anti-inflammatory therapy. Patients should also
clearly understand that a long-acting beta agonist is not intended as
rescue medication nor as a replacement for inhaled anti-inflammatory
therapy. Recent reports of deaths attributable to respiratory arrest in
patients using salmeterol40,41 (Reference) emphasize the importance of
patient education and proper use of asthma medication.
   Cromolyn sodium is another frequently used medication for the treatment
of EIA; its anti-inflammatory effects prevent EIA in 70% to 85% of
patients, with a very low incidence of side effects.28 (Reference)
Administered before exercise, it is most effective in patients who have
normal pulmonary function tests. Cromolyn combined with a beta agonist is
highly effective in patients who don't respond to single-medication
therapy. Early- and late-phase asthmatic responses are inhibited by
cromolyn sodium, though its exact mechanism of action in EIA is unknown.
Theories include inhibition of mast cell mediator release and alteration of
calcium influx. Because the duration of action and efficacy of cromolyn
sodium are less than those of the beta agonists, it is generally used as a
second-line agent.7 (Reference) The greatest inhibitory effect of cromolyn
sodium on EIA may occur at much higher doses than provided by two puffs of
the metered dose inhaler.42 (Reference)
   Cromolyn is most effective for EIA when given by inhaler 10 to 45
minutes prior to exercise.43 (Reference) Cromolyn does not have any
bronchodilating action, and if it fails to prevent bronchoconstriction, a
beta agonist inhaler should be used for immediate relief.
   Nedocromil sodium, an inhaled anti-inflammatory agent, has also been
found to inhibit exercise-induced asthma,44,45 (Reference) showing
effectiveness equal to that of cromolyn sodium.46 (Reference) Like
cromolyn, nedocromil is administered before exercise and is most effective
in patients who have normal pulmonary function tests. Nedocromil combined
with a beta agonist is highly effective in patients who don't respond to
single-medication therapy.
   Corticosteroids administered through an inhaler improve asthma symptoms
by reducing airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity. They do not
have any immediate bronchodilator effect and are not effective if used
alone just prior to exercise. Corticosteroids should instead be used as
maintenance therapy to control asthma. Such use can improve the
effectiveness of pre-exercise beta agonists in preventing or decreasing the
severity of EIA.6,47 (Reference) Inhaled dosages of less than 400 g daily
have a low incidence of side effects. When side effects occur, the most
common are oropharyngeal candidiasis and dysphonia; both can be avoided by
using a spacer.28 (Reference)
   Oral theophylline has been widely used in the treatment of asthma for
decades. Its bronchodilating effects are directly related to plasma
concentration, and theophylline may also have some anti-inflammatory
effects.29 (Reference) Theophylline is not a first-line agent in the
prevention and treatment of EIA--it is generally used for patients who do
not respond well to inhaled beta agonists. Theophylline would be a third
choice behind beta agonists and cromolyn for patients under age 12, and
would rank behind beta agonists, cromolyn or nedocromil, and perhaps
ipratropium bromide in those over age 12. Theophylline may be given either
in rapid-release form 1 to 2 hours before exercise or regularly in the
sustained-release form for prophylaxis. Even in rapid-release form,
theophylline's long onset of action (approximately 90 minutes) limits its
use in an athletic setting.29 (Reference) Factors influencing serum
concentration and the possible effect on classroom concentration in
children make theophylline less desirable than other options in most
patients. As with cromolyn sodium, the combination of theophylline and a
beta agonist may be additive in the prevention of EIA,29 (Reference) though
concerns have been raised regarding increased incidence of side effects
when these two agents are used together.7 (Reference)
   Ipratropium bromide is a derivative of atropine and has bronchodilating
effects. The inhaled drug is used in some patients with EIA who are unable
to tolerate or who do not respond well to beta agonists. It may also be
used in combination with beta agonists or cromolyn sodium. If cromolyn or
nedocromil combined with a beta agonist do not adequately control
bronchospasm, a trial of ipratropium bromide would be recommended. The drug
has a slower onset of action than beta agonists, and its use in EIA is
limited: When used alone, the drug is effective in only 30% to 40% of
patients and requires nearly normal baseline pulmonary function to be
effective.7 (Reference) When combined with a beta agonist, ipratropium
bromide may be a helpful adjunct in adults who have moderate-to-severe
asthma. Though some studies have reported effective prophylaxis of EIA with
ipratropium bromide, others have not found it to be effective.48
(Reference)
   Other agents that have been used in the treatment of EIA include
antihistamines and calcium channel blockers. Antihistamines decrease
bronchospasm in some individuals but will not prevent EIA. However, they
can improve nasal function, allowing the patient to breathe better through
his or her nose. The calcium channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil
hydrochloride have been shown to inhibit mast cell mediator release and
prevent symptoms of EIA in a select group of patients;49 (Reference)
however, data are insufficient to recommend them for EIA control.
   Recent studies50,51 report that leukotriene inhibitors and heparin
relieve EIA. The clinical effectiveness and use of these medicines will
become more apparent after further trials.

Removing Breathing Barriers
   From allergies to air temperature, many factors can affect the
bronchospastic response of EIA, and the physician must be aware of the
nuances of each patient's response. Fortunately, there are many
nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic options that can be combined to control
nearly any degree of EIA.
   The efforts put into the diagnostic workup, follow-up, and patient
education are rewarding because they enable patients to perform at or near
maximal activity levels.

NECK INJURIES
Urgent Decisions and Actions

By:
John Wiesenfarth, MD, MS; William Briner, Jr, MD
Emergencies Series Editor: Warren B. Howe, MD

In brief: When a neck injury is suspected, the on-site physician must first
provide basic trauma care, which includes establishing an airway as
necessary, assessing breathing, and checking circulation and neurologic
compromise. A few targeted questions during history taking and a directed
physical exam will help rule out serious cervical injuries, which are
uncommon. More common are minor injuries, such as ``burners.'' Team
physicians must also be well-versed in immobilizing and transporting the
patient, administering a thorough neurologic exam, and establishing when
the athlete can return to competition.

Of the 6,000 to 10,000 spinal cord injuries reported each year, motor
vehicle accidents account for 35% to 45%, and falls for 25% to 30%.1
(Reference) Most of the rest are related to sports, especially football,
rugby, ice hockey, soccer, diving, gymnastics, and wrestling.2-4
(Reference) Nevertheless, catastrophic neck injuries are infrequent in
sports, with a prevalence of less than 2/100,000 neck injuries.3
(Reference) One sport has especially reduced the incidence: Fewer than 10
football players each year have sustained permanent injury to the cervical
spinal cord since 1977.5 (Reference)
   Less serious sports-related neck injuries, in contrast, are fairly
common. Moreover, it is often difficult to differentiate a stable neck
injury from an unstable one, so physicians must be proficient in assessing
and managing all neck injuries. Three priorities must be considered in the
emergency medical management of a patient with a spinal cord injury: (1)
ensure patient survival, (2) preserve spinal cord function, and (3) allow
the highest possible chance for an injured spinal cord to recover.

On-Field Evaluation
   First, do no harm! Do not move the patient except from immediate danger
or for basic trauma management. An estimated 50% of neurologic deficits are
created after the initial traumatic insult.6,7 (Reference) Furthermore, it
is difficult to determine immediately if a neck injury is stable or
unstable.
   If the athlete has fallen on the field, have him or her lie there until
a brief initial evaluation is completed (figure 1). An unstable neck injury
must be assumed in the following instances: an unconscious athlete, an
awake athlete who has numbness and paralysis, and a neurologically intact
athlete who has neck pain or pain with neck movement.
   When a neck injury is suspected, institute the ABCDEs of trauma care
(airway, breathing, circulation and cervical spine, disability, and
exposing an injury for evaluation). Here is a modified version that can be
used for possible neck trauma.
   Trauma care basics. Airway management is of primary importance. The jaw
thrust technique has been shown to be the safest method for opening the
airway in patients with suspected neck injury.8 (Reference) In this
technique, the caregiver places his or her fingers behind the angle of both
sides of the patient's jaw and lifts up, bringing the mandible forward. If
this technique is inadequate, the modified jaw thrust-head tilt, in which
the jaw is pulled upward and the head tilted back as little as possible,
can be used.
   In a football player with a suspected neck injury, do not remove the
helmet initially because the jostling may cause severe neurologic
complications if the patient has an unstable fracture. If an airway access
is necessary, the face mask may be cut using a sharp knife or a device
called a Trainer's Angel (Trainer's Angel, Riverside, California). Trained
personnel can remove a face mask in less than 30 seconds using a Trainer's
Angel.
   Breathing problems in a patient with a neck injury may signal more
severe injury. For example, apnea may mean that the patient has sustained
damage to the brain stem. Once the airway is secure, artificial respiration
may be necessary.
   In assessing circulation, first check for a carotid pulse. If it is
absent, begin chest compressions in accordance with basic life support
guidelines. It is important to remember that spinal shock can cause
hypotension, paradoxical bradycardia, and warm, dry skin. However, consider
all causes of shock in an athlete who might have multiple fractures. A
tension pneumothorax, especially in tall, thin athletes, may also cause
hypotension with paradoxical bradycardia.
   It is also important to gauge cervical tenderness by palpating the
spinal processes for tenderness and the paraspinal musculature for
tenderness and spasm.
   To evaluate disabilities, it is important to perform a motor and sensory
assessment (table 1). This can also be done on the sideline. Clinically,
there are two classes of spinal cord injury: complete and incomplete.
Complete injury renders the patient without motor power or sensation below
the level of injury. Incomplete injury leaves the patient with some
preserved motor or sensory function. Although rare, a complete injury
results in a poor outcome in almost all cases. Spinal shock may appear to
be a complete lesion; however, it usually resolves within 24 hours.9
(Reference)
   Finally, if a serious injury is visually obscured, it may be necessary
to expose the area by removing clothing or equipment without moving the
patient.
   History. If the patient is alert, the history is at least as important
as the physical exam. History taking can be included during initial trauma
management or be done immediately afterward. How the athlete responds to
questions can help in further assessing the level of consciousness. If he
or she can respond verbally without any problems, chances are the airway is
patent. Important questions to ask are:

    -- How did the injury happen?
    -- Are you having any weakness, numbness, or tingling?
    -- Are you feeling any pain?
    -- Does it hurt to move your neck?
    -- Have you had a neck injury before?
    -- Do you think you can go back into the game?

   Most sources agree that severe neck injury is usually accompanied by
pain and sometimes neurologic symptoms.10-13 (Reference) An athlete without
pain and neurologic symptoms has a very low probability of having a severe
neck injury and therefore can be helped off the field for further
evaluation. A patient with neck pain should have his or her cervical spine
immobilized and be placed on a backboard for transport to the sideline en
route to an emergency facility.

Transportation to the Sideline
   It is essential that proper equipment be available for transporting the
patient from the field safely. If the clinical picture is unknown, it is
best to treat all neck injuries as unstable by immobilizing the neck. If a
cervical collar is available, apply it until a cervical-spine injury is
ruled out.14 (Reference) A backboard is necessary to prevent further injury
while moving the athlete (figure 2). Once the athlete is on the backboard,
immobilize his or her head and torso. Use sandbags or other padding to
sandwich the head as it is taped to the backboard (figure 3). Ammonia or
smelling salts should be avoided in the dazed or unconscious athlete
because a reaction of jerking away from this stimulus may cause neurologic
compromise.

Off-the-Field Management
   Further assessment and initial treatment can be initiated once the
patient is on the sideline. If there is time, patients on backboards can be
assessed while waiting for emergency transportation.
   When an unstable injury is possible, it is important to determine the
nature and severity of the injury and have the patient further evaluated at
an appropriate medical facility. Stable cervical sprains and strains, in
contrast, rarely require extensive treatment and generally resolve without
incident. All possible neck injuries, however, require a thorough
neurologic examination off the field.
   The sideline neurologic exam includes a quick assessment of motor,
sensory, and reflex pathways. Have the patient move his or her fingers and
toes. Assess grip strength by having the athlete squeeze your fingers with
each hand simultaneously; be alert for asymmetry. Look for asymmetry when
the athlete dorsiflexes and plantar flexes his or her feet. Check for gross
sensation in the upper extremities by simultaneously touching similar parts
of each arm. If the situation allows, check for reflexes and for asymmetry
of reflexes.
   Also, assess the cranial nerves. Nerves II through XII should be quickly
assessed in all patients who have acute neck injuries. This evaluates brain
stem function. Finally, active range of motion (ROM) should be included so
that the patient can stop if the movement becomes painful. A patient who is
asymptomatic and has full ROM can usually return to play.
   The most common neurologic cervical injury is a unilateral neurapraxia
of the cervical nerve roots and brachial plexus, often called a ``burner.''
Key historical features of this condition are quick recovery from the
resulting paresthesia or weakness in the extremities, accompanied by full
ROM without pain. Return to activity is permitted when the paresthesia has
subsided and full muscle strength and full, pain-free ROM have
returned.15,16 (Reference) Neurapraxias that are multiple or bilateral may
warrant further diagnostic workup. If this is an athlete's first
neurapraxia or if the condition involves the lower extremities, he or she
needs a full workup and should not return to play.

Be Prepared
   The best way to handle cervical spine injuries is to be prepared for
them. It is important to have a game plan, with all equipment inspected and
readily accessible, and all personnel involved trained to use it.
Communication among all members of the emergency medical team should be
established before the competition. Transportation to an emergency medical
facility should be immediately available as well. Proper preparation can go
a long way in avoiding serious long-term sequelae.

with at least one piece of tape across the forehead and one piece across
the chin. Also, fasten down the trunk.

EXERCISING--OR NOT--WHEN YOU ARE SICK

By:
William A. Primos, Jr, MD, with James R. Wappes

   You're not feeling great. You have a sore throat, stuffy head, and runny
nose. But you feel like you could maybe log a few road miles. Should you?
   Whether you're a low-key exerciser or a competitive athlete, knowing
when to work out if you don't feel well can be difficult. When you have an
infection such as a cold, ``stomach flu,'' or contagious skin condition,
you (and, often, your doctor) need to decide how exercise might affect your
health, your performance, and the health of others. Of course, it's also
good to avoid infection in the first place.

Should You Play On?
   The first question to ask your infected body is if you need to push it.
When your body is fighting an infection, your performance and fitness
benefits will likely be less than optimal, so why bother? Missing a few
days of training is not the end of the world--and it may even be a better
option. And if you're a competitive athlete, taking yourself out may be the
best thing for the team.
   Sometimes, though, physical activity helps you feel better. For example,
working out can sometimes temporarily clear a stuffed-up head when you have
a cold.
   So if you think exercise might help, or if you can't bear to miss a
workout, do a ``neck check'' of your symptoms.1 (Reference) If your
symptoms are located ``above the neck''--a stuffy or runny nose, sneezing,
or a sore throat, for example--then exercise is probably safe. But start at
half speed. If you feel better after 10 minutes, you can increase your
speed and finish the workout or game. If you feel miserable, though, stop.
   On the other hand, your ``neck check'' may reveal ``below-the-neck''
symptoms. Avoid intense physical activity if you have any of these
symptoms: muscle aches, hacking cough, fever of 100 degrees F or higher,
chills, diarrhea, or vomiting. Exercising when you have below-the-neck
symptoms may mean, at best, that you'll feel weak and dehydrated. Worse,
you may risk such dangerous conditions as heatstroke (dangerously high body
temperature) and heart failure.
   You can resume exercising when ``below-the-neck'' symptoms subside.
However, when recovering from an illness that prevented you from working
out, it's important to ease back into activity gradually. A good rule of
thumb is to exercise for 2 days at a lower-than-normal intensity for each
day you were sick.

Stop the Spread
   If you're on a team, an additional concern is whether you will infect
others. And if you're healthy, you may wonder about someone else infecting
you. For common illnesses like the cold, practice commonsense hygiene like
washing your hands frequently and directing coughs and sneezes away from
others.
   Some infections, though, are readily spread in sports and require
athletes to be sidelined while they are contagious. Two such conditions are
measles and herpes simplex (a virus that often causes cold sores or
blisters and is transmitted via skin-to-skin contact, as in wrestling). If
you may have such an infection, see a doctor for treatment and information
about when to resume sports.
   Other conditions can also spread readily. So in addition to regular
hygiene, athletes need to refrain from sharing water bottles and towels.
Infections have been known to pass to other athletes via both routes.
   You should also be properly immunized against diseases such as measles,
mumps, tetanus, and rubella. Also, some athletes may benefit from an
influenza vaccine. Ask your doctor what immunizations you need.

Common Cold, Common Sense
   As is often true, deciding to exercise when you are sick largely
involves common sense. Taking precautions about spreading infection and
listening to your body can go a long way in getting you back into action
without serious problems.

   Remember: This information is not intended as a substitute for medical
advice. If you have concerns about your health, consult a physician.

AN IRREGULAR PULSE IN A SKYDIVER

By:
John D. Cantwell, MD

   A 29-year-old man was referred to a cardiologist after an irregular
heartbeat was found on a preemployment physical examination. He had no
cardiac or pulmonary symptoms.
   Past illness or surgery included only several operations for ocular
strabismus. He took no medications. His weekly alcohol intake included six
beers, two shots of hard liquor, and six or seven glasses of wine. He
averaged one-fourth pack of cigarettes per day over the past 9 months, but
had not smoked previously.
   His exercise habits included skydiving (two to five jumps per weekend),
running 6 miles three times per week, and lifting weights for 1 hour two to
three times per week. His father was hypertensive. There was no family
history of early coronary disease, arrhythmia, or sudden death. The systems
review indicated a single syncopal episode 6 years earlier while lifting
weights after having donated blood.
   On physical examination the patient's blood pressure was 115/82 mm Hg,
and his pulse was 54 per minute and irregular. Neck and chest evaluations
were normal. The heart was not enlarged. A grade 1/6 short systolic
ejection murmur was heard at the upper and midleft sternal border, and
diminished with Valsalva's maneuver and with standing. His first heart
sound quieted progressively on an intermittent basis in cycles of three or
four. The complete blood count and biochemical profile were normal. His
total cholesterol level was 135 mg/dL and his HDL was 45 mg/dL.
   His resting electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in figure 1. His Bruce
protocol treadmill test was normal; he had a duration of 16 minutes,
stopping because of fatigue.

   Why did his first heart sound soften progressively and cyclically? Based
on your interpretation and diagnosis, do you think he should be hired for a
demanding job that involves a certain amount of emotional stress?

Diagnosis
   The resting ECG shows 5:4 Wenckebach second-degree atrioventricular (AV)
block (figure 2). The loudness of the first heart sound is inversely
related to the length of the PR interval on the resting ECG. A longer PR
interval allows the AV valves more time to drift closer to the closed
position, resulting in a softer sound. The exercise ECG is normal (figure
3); the PR intervals usually become regular as the athlete exercises.

Discussion
   In 1906, the noted Dutch physician Karel Frederik Wenckebach first
reported periodic prolongation of the PR interval with dropped ventricular
beats.1 (Reference) Wenckebach had previously discovered that extrasystoles
were seen in healthy individuals as well as in those with cardiac disease.
   Wenckebach AV block (also referred to as Mobitz type I AV block) can be
normal in a highly-trained athletic person such as this patient. It is
probably related to an increase in resting vagal tone and subsides during
the stress of exercise when blood catecholamine levels rise.
   We advised the company that the young man was healthy and recommended
that he be hired. We added that his maximum oxygen uptake was 54.7
mL/kg/min, placing him in the high fitness category for men his age.

NONTRAUMATIC HIP PAIN IN ACTIVE CHILDREN
A Critical Differential

By:
Lynda F. Gerberg, MD; Lyle J. Micheli, MD
Pediatrics Series Editors: Barry Goldberg, MD, and Elliott B. Hershman, MD

   In brief: A case report of an 8-year-old baseball player who was
diagnosed with Legg-Calve-Perthes (LCP) disease gives an opportunity to
consider the many nontraumatic causes of hip pain. Possibilities include
slipped capital femoral epiphysis, septic arthritis, transient synovitis,
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and bone tumor. Radiographs and bone scans
are used to document and stage LCP, and to evaluate the effectiveness of
treatment. Though the aggressiveness of treatment depends on the disease
stage, the treatment of choice is generally nonsurgical containment of the
femoral epiphysis with a cast or orthosis.

   When an active young person presents with a limp and hip pain, an injury
should of course be considered; however, it is also important to think
about the many nontraumatic entities with similar presentations.
   Our case report of a patient who had Legg-Calve-Perthes (LCP) disease
(avascular necrosis of the femoral head) demonstrates the importance of a
thorough exam and referral when necessary.

Case Report
   An 8-year-old Little League baseball player presented with a history of
intermittent pain in his left hip over the past 6 months. It had begun
gradually and was initially most noticeable during baseball practice.
Crutches and activity restriction, prescribed after a recent exacerbation,
had provided no relief, and he was referred to our orthopedic sports
medicine clinic.
   There was no history of acute trauma. He had been experiencing pain with
all activities. He had no history of illness.
   On physical exam, the patient walked with an antalgic limp. He otherwise
appeared to be in good health with appropriate height and weight for his
age. He was afebrile. There were no gross deformities in his legs or hips
and no differences in temperature or girth between the limbs. He had marked
discomfort to palpation over the entire left hip region. Internal rotation
and hip abduction caused significant pain. When compared with the opposite
side, decreases were noted in hip range of motion in abduction, internal
rotation, and flexion.
   A full laboratory work-up included complete blood count, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and Lyme
titer. There were no significant findings. Plain radiographs demonstrated a
``moth-eaten'' radiolucency suggestive of osteopenia of the femoral
epiphysis and neck (figure 1a). The femoral epiphysis was shortened. A bone
scan (figure 1b) demonstrated evidence of avascularity of the left femoral
epiphysis consistent with LCP disease.
   The patient was placed in a Petrie spica cast with the hip in 30 degree
abduction and 30 degree internal rotation. A follow-up x-ray (figure 1c)
demonstrated proper containment of the femoral epiphysis within the
acetabulum.
   The patient was pain free 2 weeks after cast application. After cast
removal at 6 weeks, physical therapy was instituted to restore full range
of motion and strength to the hip, and three-point partial weight bearing
was begun. Anteroposterior and frog lateral radiographs taken after 1 month
of physical therapy demonstrated continued containment and no fragmentation
of the femoral epiphysis. The patient remained pain free, and hip range of
motion improved. He was sent home on crutches for another 12 weeks after
which crutch use was tapered. Nine months after initial diagnosis he was
taken off crutches completely and was asymptomatic.
   Anteroposterior and frog lateral x-rays taken 1 year after initial
presentation (figure 1d) demonstrated that the femoral epiphysis had
remodeled within the acetabulum with a good spherical shape. Mild sclerotic
changes had not progressed and the joint space was preserved. The patient
returned to sports without difficulty.

More on Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease
   LCP disease may present between ages 2 and 12; the majority of cases
occur when patients are between 4 and 8 years old. In boys the incidence is
1:750; in girls it is 1:3,700.1 (Reference)
   Initially pain free, this condition often presents as a limp after
activity. The limp usually worsens, and eventually the patient may complain
of pain in the hip, groin, inner thigh, or occasionally the knee. Muscle
spasm and synovitis can limit motion, particularly abduction and internal
rotation. Though various triggers of LCP disease have been hypothesized,
including trauma, synovitis, and hypercoagulability, the pathogenesis these
hold in common is interrupted blood supply of the growing femoral
epiphysis.2 (Reference)
   The natural history of LCP disease occurs in the following stages:
   (1) Edema develops at the synovial membrane and capsule over 1 to 6
weeks.
   (2) Necrosis of the femoral epiphysis occurs, and can last from several
months to 1 year.
   (3) Regeneration/resorption lasts 1 to 3 years. Granulation tissue
invades the necrotic bone, leaving isolated areas of bone sequestered.1
(Reference) Invasion by connective tissues leads to resorption and
replacement by new immature bone. This may result in weakening of
subchondral support.
   (4) Repair occurs when new, normal bone replaces dead bone. The outcome
is related to the percentage of epiphysis involved, the patient's age, and
the promptness of the diagnosis.3 (Reference)
   Catterall3 (Reference) classified LCP disease into four stages based on
radiographic findings of percentage of involvement of the epiphysis (figure
2). Plain radiographs of our patient's hip showed changes that were clearly
consistent with LCP disease (Catterall stage 2); however, further imaging
is indicated if there is a strong suspicion of LCP disease despite normal
plain films. We confirmed our diagnosis with a bone scan, which is highly
accurate once symptoms have presented. New developments in nuclear medicine
such as the pinhole camera and computerized axial techniques allow even
earlier diagnosis of ischemic necrosis.4 (Reference) Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is extremely effective in detecting early and preclinical or
asymptomatic avascular necrosis, and it localizes and identifies the extent
of the ischemia. Because of cost, MRI should be reserved for early
identification when less expensive tests are negative or inconclusive.4
(Reference)

Other Nontraumatic Hip Disorders
   The differential diagnosis in the work-up of a patient with apparent LCP
disease takes on added significance because one of the
possibilities--slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)--is an orthopedic
emergency and requires immediate referral. Several other hip disorders
resemble LCP disease.
   Slipped capital femoral epiphysis. SCFE is the most common nontraumatic
hip problem in adolescents, and its presentation is similar to that of LCP
disease. In SCFE, the epiphyseal plate weakens during rapid growth. The
stress of the patient's body weight disrupts the attachment of the femoral
neck and the femoral epiphysis, with the femoral neck moving upward and
forward on the femoral epiphysis.
   Clinically, patients who have SFCE are either obese or tall and thin.
The condition usually occurs in children who are slightly older (11 to 16
years) than those who have LCP disease. The physical presentation is
similar, but the pain is usually worse. The patient is unable to touch the
abdomen with the thigh because the hip externally rotates with flexion.
Radiologic studies help differentiate SCFE from other hip disorders. It
must be kept in mind that SCFE is an emergency, and requires
non-weight-bearing treatment as soon as it is diagnosed.5 (Reference)
   Septic arthritis. In our patient, septic arthritis was quickly ruled
out. He appeared healthy, with no fever or other clinical or laboratory
signs of sepsis, and the physical exam of his hip did not correlate with
the picture of a septic joint.
   Though septic arthritis is seen in all age groups, it is most common in
infants and children ages 1 to 2 years. Patients often have a history of
recent injury or infection such as otitis media. The usually acute onset of
septic arthritis is accompanied by fever, apprehension, and loss of
appetite. The joint is warm, swollen, and held in flexion. Active and
passive range of motion are limited by extreme pain. Physical and
laboratory signs of sepsis should prompt quick referral for immediate
aspiration of the joint under appropriate conditions.
   Transient synovitis. Transient synovitis can resemble LCP disease;
however, the patient may have a history of a recent upper-respiratory
infection and may have a slight fever, usually no higher than 100 degrees F
(37.7 degrees C) to 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C). Transient synovitis is
the most common cause of hip pain in children under age 10. Patients
present with pain in the anteromedial aspect of the thigh and knee and walk
with a limp. Motion is limited, and a flexion contracture of the hip may be
present. Hematologic tests are negative with no signs of sepsis. On
radiographs, capsular bulging is evident; no changes in bone are seen,
which helps rule out avascular necrosis. Transient synovitis is a
self-limited benign condition. Weight-bearing is limited, and radiographs
are repeated in 2 to 3 months to rule out LCP disease, which may develop
after an episode of transient synovitis.
   Rheumatoid arthritis. The hip is the third most common joint to be
involved in pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Children with
pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis do not present with systemic
systems. The insidious onset is accompanied by swelling, stiffness, and
minimal pain on motion. Effusion is palpable, and soft-tissue and bony
changes are seen on radiographs.
   Tumors. Tumors involving the hip joint must also be kept in mind. The
physical exam and radiographic studies will help detect or rule out a bone
tumor.

Restoring Hip Function
   LCP disease requires individualized treatment; factors include age at
onset, change in range of motion, stage of the disease, and Catterall
group. Age at onset is a significant prognostic factor--results are
significantly better in younger children. Therefore, early diagnosis is the
most important factor in preventing long-term complications. The main
treatment objectives are to relieve muscle spasm, regain range of motion,
and contain the femoral epiphysis within the acetabulum to minimize
deformation of the femoral head.
   Historically, there have been four methods of treatment:1 (Reference)
observation, bed rest, nonsurgical containment with ambulation, and
surgical containment. Currently, observation is chosen only when the
patient has no decreased range of motion and meets Catterall's stage I
criteria. The child is allowed to continue with regular activities of daily
living. Bed rest is rarely used today because it requires lengthy
hospitalization.2 (Reference) However, bed rest with hip abduction has
shown satisfactory results in 70% to 80% of patients.1 (Reference)
   If surgery is required, the goals are the same as for nonsurgical
treatment: to regain adequate range of motion, minimize deformity, and
relieve muscle spasm.5 (Reference) The femoral head is repositioned via
femoral osteotomy or the acetabulum repositioned via pelvic innominate
osteotomy. The goal is to place the femoral epiphysis deep within the
acetabulum, therefore preventing or minimizing deformation. Surgery should
be reserved for patients who have or are progressing to femoral head
deformity, but who cannot or will not accept orthoses.
   The current treatment of choice is ambulatory management with
nonsurgical containment of the femoral epiphysis. This method has been used
with extremely favorable results.6 (Reference) and allows the child to
continue most activities of daily living. Good results have been observed
in 60% to 70% of patients. Without containment, the femoral epiphysis may
become deformed and extrude from the acetabulum during the
revascularization stage of LCP disease, particularly if the hip is allowed
to maintain adduction and external rotation. Placing the femoral epiphysis
within the acetabulum and maintaining abduction and internal rotation
reduces forces on the epiphysis, allowing it to remodel properly.
   Methods of ambulatory containment include the Petrie spica cast and
removable devices such as the Newington A-frame orthosis, the Scottish Rite
abduction orthosis,7 (Reference) and the Toronto brace. It has been our
experience that ambulatory casting gives excellent results along with good
compliance by the patients and their families.
   Long-term prognosis. Long-term outcomes are good in the majority of
patients.1,2,5 (Reference) Approximately 9.5%, however, develop
deteriorating symptoms and degenerative arthritis in late adolescence and
early adulthood. The development of degenerative arthritis is not related
to sports participation after initial treatment.5 (Reference) These
patients often require surgery before age 35. Studies5 (Reference) have
shown that the abduction extension osteotomy yields the best results,
relieving pain, improving range of motion, and correcting any leg length
discrepancies.

A Full Return to Activity
   Early recognition and intervention can help patients with LCP disease
avoid deformity and disability that might otherwise lead to lifelong
impairment of activity. Indeed, the long-term prognosis for complete
recovery and sports participation after treatment is excellent, and most
patients can return to activity without restrictions.

Illustration(s):
Figure: 1. An anteroposterior radiograph (a) of the pelvis of an 8-year-old
boy who presented with left hip pain demonstrates shortening of the left
femoral epiphysis (bracketed area) caused by trabecular fracture.
Irregularity of the bony contours of the femoral epiphysis is also noted
(arrow), along with fullness about the left hip suggestive of an effusion.
``Moth-eaten'' radiolucencies (arrowheads) suggest osteopenia of the
femoral epiphysis and neck. On a bone scan of the patient's left femoral
epiphysis (b), decreased uptake is consistent with the avascular necrosis
of Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (arrow). Films taken shortly after Petrie
casting (c) indicate proper containment of the femoral head within the
acetabulum. The legs have been placed in 30 degrees of abduction and 30
degrees of internal rotation bilaterally. Note the presence of mild
flattening of the left femoral epiphysis (arrow). A follow-up frog lateral
view (d) taken 1 year after treatment with a Petrie spica cast demonstrates
proper joint space preservation. The left femoral epiphysis remains well
seated within the acetabulum. Mild flattening and sclerosis (arrows) show
no further progression.

Figure: 2. Catterall classified Legg-Calve-Perthes disease into four
stages. In stage 1, necrosis is present at the anterior aspect of the
femoral head as noted by the dotted areas. Lysis is present, but there is
no bony sequestration. In stage 2, bony sequestration is present as noted
by the central areas of radiopacity. A medial and lateral column of normal
bone protects the central area from collapse. In stage 3, extensive bony
sequestration diminishes support and increases the chance of residual
deformity. Metaphyseal cyst formation is noted by the line-slashed areas.
In stage 4, total involvement produces significant residual deformity shown
by the jagged areas that indicate sclerosis and decreased size of the
femoral head.

GOING ONLINE: SPORTS MEDICINE AND MORE

By:
Ann Harste, Minneapolis
psm@mill2.millcomm.com

   You say you don't have time to search online for lively sports medicine
debate and helpful medical resources. But you have Internet access at the
clinic or at home, and you find yourself craving some high-tech
professional connectedness. How you access the different areas of the
Internet will depend on the type of connection you have, but once you're
on-line, here's a quick tour of the Net to get you started.
   World Wide Web. A good starting point on the Web is Yahoo
(http://www.yahoo.com), a hip and definitive directory of some of the best
sites indexed by subject. Yahoo offers hundreds of links under the health
category. Another site is the highly acclaimed Virtual Hospital
(http://indy.radiology.uiowa.edu/), a digital health sciences library
administered by the University of Iowa. You'll find patient simulations,
journals, clinical practice guidelines, multimedia textbooks, and teaching
files.
   To get a quick handle on the medical journals and newsletters available
online, visit MedWeb: Electronic Newsletters and Journals
(http://www.cc.emory.edu/WHSCL/medweb.ejs.html), a directory that provides
many direct links to journals' tables of contents and, in some cases,
abstracts and full-text articles.
   Medical Matrix: Guide to Internet Clinical Medicine Resources
(http://www.kumc.edu:80/mmatrix/) is a project of the American Medical
Informatics Association's Internet Working Group. In addition to being rich
in links to other sites, Medical Matrix provides an overview of existing
Internet medical resources and news on resources in development.
   Finding epidemiologic information is a whole lot easier now that the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a Web site for the Morbidity
and Mortality Weekly Report (http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/mmwr.html). The
site features full-text retrieval, and users can search past issues by
topic--no more thumbing through that prolific stack of skinny reports. The
National Library of Medicine's HyperDOC Home Page (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/)
is the place to go for links to the institution's vast collection of
clinical resources.
   A must-visit stop on your Web rounds is Dr Bil's Cool Medical Site of
the Week (http://www.hooked.net/users/wcd/cmsotw.html). William C. Donlon,
DDS, exhaustively searches the Web's medical sites and crowns his pick of
the week. Visitors are also asked to submit their suggestions.
   Gopher servers. Even though the Web is getting the lion's share of the
attention these days, there are also many valuable resources on Gopher
servers. The University of Southern California offers links to
medicine-related Gopher servers all over the world. Their Gopher address is
cwis.usc.edu; once connected, select: Other Gophers and Information
Resources/Gopher-Jewels/Health, Medical, and Disability/Medical
Related/Medical Related (misc).
   News groups. News groups are discussion groups devoted to specific
topics; they are similar to bulletin board systems found on commercial
online services or private dial-up services. There are hundreds of topics
to choose from. To get a thumbnail sketch of what other physicians are
doing with their technology tools, consider browsing through
sci.med.telemedicine. It's a convenient source of medical software reviews,
an announcement board for other online medical resources, and a sounding
board for physicians' experiences with clinical information systems.
   E-mail lists. Like news groups, electronic mailing lists provide an
exchange of information among users interested in a particular topic.
Subscribers receive the discussion directly to their e-mailbox through
e-mail postings from other members of the group. The American Medical
Society for Sports Medicine's AMSSMNet is available to its members and
other interested parties. To subscribe, AMSSM members can send an e-mail
message to listserv@msu.edu. In the first line of the body of your message
type: SUBSCRIBE AMSSMNet Your Name. Nonmembers can request e-mail
information about joining AMSSMNet from Dave Jenkinson, DO, at
13460DJ@msu.edu or Randy Pearson, MD, at 13460RP@msu.edu.
   The ATHTRN-L e-mail list contains topics in sports medicine along with
discussions on the roles and certification of athletic trainers. To
subscribe, send an e-mail to listserv@iubvm.ucs.indiana.edu . In the first
line of the body of your message type: Subscribe ATHTRN-L Your Name.
   A vital source for family medicine practitioners is Fam-Med, an e-mail
list that focuses on use of computer and telecommunication technology in
the teaching and practice of family medicine. Fam-Med also offers a
resource area that includes access to file archives, a Gopher server, and a
Web index. The resource area and instructions for subscribing to the
discussion group can be found on the Web at http://apollo.gac.edu/.

RELIEF FOR EXERCISE INCONTINENCE

By:
Carol Potera, Great Falls, Montana


   Stress incontinence often puts a damper on a woman's resolve to
exercise. Up to a third of women--even young, conditioned
athletes--experience stress incontinence.1 (Reference) Treatment options
have included tampons, pessaries, diaphragms, and, for severe cases,
surgery. The bladder neck support prosthesis (BNSP) is a new option.
   A study1 (Reference) on the effectiveness of two incontinence
options--tampons and pessaries--recently came out in favor of tampons. The
researchers found that 8 of 14 women with mild incontinence (less than 15 g
of urine loss) remained dry while wearing a tampon during aerobic exercise,
while a standard pessary kept only 5 of 14 women dry. Urine loss was
measured by weighing an absorbent pad before and after exercise.
   The tampon is worn during exercise or other activities that produce
stress incontinence, says Ingrid Nygaard, MD, the study's author and
assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the
University of Iowa College of Medicine in Iowa City. Tampons have no side
effects when worn for less than a day, she says. Nygaard advises patients
to moisten the tip of the tampon with water beforehand to make insertion
and removal more comfortable.
   Most women, and even some gynecologists, have never heard of pessaries,
Nygaard says. There are many types of pessaries: The ones specifically
designed to treat stress incontinence resemble a diaphragm but have a
protrusion on the ring that helps elevate the urethra, thus blocking urine
leakage. When worn only for short periods of time during activities that
produce incontinence, pessaries produce no side effects and do not
decondition pelvic floor muscles, Nygaard says.
   A new vaginal device designed especially for active women debuted in
October. The flexible, ring-shaped BNSP has two blunt prongs on one end
that laterally support the urethra. The BNSP (Johnson and Johnson Medical,
Inc, Arlington, Texas) rests on the pelvic floor muscles and reinforces
their function during exercise. ``This is the same thing we accomplish with
surgery,'' says urogynecologist Willy Davila, MD, of the Colorado
Gynecology and Continence Center in Denver. When tested on runners, hikers,
and other active women, the BNSP kept 24 of 30 patients dry; 6 were
improved but still had mild incontinence.2 (Reference) Benefits were
greatest in those who had severe incontinence. All participants rated the
device satisfactory.
   To provide a custom fit, BNSPs come in 25 sizes, varying in ring size
and prong length. The BNSP appears to be relatively free of side effects,
says Davila. One patient in the study developed a bladder infection;
however, he says bladder infections are not unusual in patients who have
stress incontinence. Pelvic floor muscle deconditioning is not an issue,
Davila says. In fact, he says muscle function seems to improve: Pelvic
floor contractions during activity are partially responsible for the
device's support function.
   Physicians can routinely help women open up about their problems with
incontinence by telling patients that many active women notice urine
leakage while exercising, says Nygaard. Advising women about simple,
nonsurgical treatments such as tampons, pessaries, and pelvic floor
exercises can minimize incontinence and keep women exercising, she says.
   A traditional pessary costs about $50, and the BNSP costs about $300,
says Nygaard. Some active women report that the BNSP is more comfortable
than the traditional pessary, says Davila. ``The BNSP fits in loosely and
is designed to be dynamic; it moves with the woman,'' he says. ``A
traditional pessary fits in tightly and supports prolapsed tissues.''
However, Nygaard says many of her patients who are runners have been
satisfied with comfort of traditional pessaries.

EXPEDITE ANKLE EVALUATION

By:
Aaron Rubin, MD, Fontana, California

   When making return-to-play decisions for players who have just injured
their ankles, a good screening test if you're busy on the sidelines is to
ask them to squat. If they are unable to squat because of pain or have
difficulty rising, they are probably unable to resume play.

IMPROVE YOUR GOLF GRIP

By:
Ty Wadsworth, MD, St Louis

   A new exercise to develop grip strength was developed by Dale Boggs, a
golf professional who was recovering from an upper-extremity injury. The
exercise requires an old telephone book. To begin, open the phone book with
the binding facing away. The fingertips should be slightly moist. With one
hand use pressure from the fingertips to rip, crumple, then discard the
first page from the phone book. Repeat the exercise until fatigued,
typically 15 to 30 pages for the dominant hand and 10 to 20 pages for the
nondominant hand. The page numbers can be used to keep up with repetitions,
which are increased over time.
   This exercise is useful for increasing grip strength and endurance,
wrist flexor strength, and fine motor control. It is useful for injury
rehabilitation and for performance enhancement because it promotes a firm,
relaxed grip throughout the golf swing.

EARLY ASTHMA DETECTION

By:
William W. Dexter, MD, Lebanon, New Hampshire

   Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) presentation can be subtle, especially in
children. Parental reports of a child lagging on the playground or seeming
unduly fatigued after competition warrant further investigation: These can
be signs of EIA, even if the child is not coughing or wheezing.

ESTABLISHING TEAM CONFIDENCES

By:
David Garner, PhD, Bowling Green, Ohio

   As a clinical psychologist in Toledo and an adjunct professor of
psychology at Bowling Green State University, I've worked with teams that
have players with eating disorders. I've found that it's useful to build an
independent relationship with the team--one that is not connected to the
coach. This may enable team members to open up to you and be more honest.
At the same time, I discourage enlisting the help of players to identify
eating disorders in teammates. This practice only serves to establish an
atmosphere of paranoia on the team.

WOUND CARE FOR AQUATIC ACTIVITIES

By:
Stephen Fuzie, PT, ATC, Pittsburgh

   In water sports such as water polo, there are times when an athlete
needs to wear a bandage to prevent bleeding or to cover stitches. Regular
athletic tape loses adherence in the water and presents a target for
opposing players. Covering a flesh-colored bandage with clear Tegaderm
transparent dressing with label (3M Corp, St Paul) or a similar product
will keep the wound dry and prevent bleeding. The thinness of the material
minimizes the edge so that the bandage can't be easily removed by friction
or contact. This bandaging technique is also helpful when athletes sweat
heavily.

STRENGTHENING THE HIP ABDUCTORS

By:
Michael Ross, MSEd, PT

   Many common exercises, like partial squats, involve movement mainly to
the front and back. Such exercises are good conditioners for activities
like bicycling and using stair machines and treadmills, which primarily
require back-and-forth motion. But most sports and many daily activities
require side-to-side motion. To prepare your body for a variety of
stresses, you need to build strength for those motions, too.
   The muscles most responsible for sideways leg motion are the hip
abductors on the sides of your hips. These muscles help move your legs out
and away from each other. They play a large role in steadying forward
movements, not to mention their importance in sports like tennis and golf
that require a lot of side-to-side motion or stability. Including
hip-abductor strengthening in your exercise regimen will help with daily
activities and sports and will lower your injury risk. These strengtheners
are especially good for people who have had hip or low-back pain.
   The exercises in figures 1 through 3 help strengthen your hip abductors.
These exercises are simple and don't take much time, so you can easily fit
them into your training.
   For each exercise, build up to three sets of 20 repetitions, 3 to 4 days
per week, if possible. Go slowly, and rest only long enough between sets to
let your muscles recover from the slight burning sensation they will
experience. As the exercises become easier over time, you can add ankle
weights in 1- to 2-lb increments as long you have no pain.

   Remember: This information is not intended as a substitute for medical
treatment. Before starting an exercise program, consult a physician.

Illustration(s):
Figure: 1. To do the sideways leg raise, lie on your side. Flex the muscles
on the outside of your thigh and lift your leg 12 to 15 inches while
keeping your back still. Hold for 3 to 5 seconds. Repeat with the other
leg.

Figure: 2. For the hip hiker, stand with one foot on a stable 4- to 6-inch
object (a). Slowly raise yourself by straightening the upper knee and hip
(b). Hold for 3 to 5 seconds, then slowly lower the foot back to the floor.
If you find it hard to balance, stand in front of a sink or table and place
your hands on it for support. Repeat on the other side.

Figure: 3. Start the squat and slide by standing. Slightly bend one knee as
you slide the opposite foot to the side as far as is comfortable without
bending that leg. Hold for 3 to 5 seconds, then return. Repeat with the
other leg. For better balance, place your hands on a sink or table.

ACCIDENTAL HYPOTHERMIA: WHEN THERMOREGULATION IS OVERWHELMED

By:
Teofilo L. Lee-Chiong Jr, MDJohn T. Stitt, PhD

Preview
   The homeless, the elderly, infants, military personnel on duty, and even
persons living in subtropical climes may fall prey to the effects of
hypothermia. Most cold-related injuries and fatalities are due to
accidental exposure, ingestion of alcohol and other intoxicants,
hypoglycemia, trauma, or chronic debilitating illness. The authors explain
the effects of heat loss on body systems and discuss how to reverse the
process and achieve rapid rewarming.

   Like other homeothermic animals, humans are able to maintain their body
temperature within narrow limits regardless of normal changes in
environmental conditions. Nonetheless, hypothermia, which is defined as
body core temperature below 35 degrees C (95 degrees F), can develop
whenever this remarkable thermoregulatory apparatus is overwhelmed by
excessive heat loss, inadequate heat production, or impairment of
function.

Epidemiology
   Over 9,300 deaths from hypothermia were reported in the United States
between 1979 and 1990.1 (Reference) Most cases occur in urban areas, and
the elderly, the indigent, and the homeless are often affected. For
example, one half of cold-related fatalities in the District of Columbia
between 1972 and 1982 occurred in persons with inadequate housing.2
(Reference) The highest number of deaths from hypothermia occurred not only
in states with severe winters, such as Illinois, New York, and
Pennsylvania, but also in states with milder weather, such as North and
South Carolina and Virginia.3 (Reference) The incidence of hypothermia is
equally alarming in other countries. In a Danish hospital from 1975 to
1989, hypothermia was documented in nearly 5% of patients admitted to the
intensive care unit.4 (Reference)
   Cold-related deaths and injuries are also often reported in combatants
during military campaigns and in participants in outdoor winter sports.
About 91,000 cases of cold injury were reported among US soldiers in Europe
during World War II.5 (Reference)
   Hypothermia may develop in persons exposed to a modestly cool climate
for prolonged periods. The condition has even been reported in tropical
climates where average daily temperatures do not fall below 16 degrees C
(60.8 degrees F).6 (Reference) However, most cases of ``tropical''
hypothermia have involved patients with severe undernutrition or
malnutrition.

Predisposing factors
   The principal predisposing factors in cases of hypothermia are
accidental cold exposure, immersion in water, extremes of age, trauma, drug
ingestion, poisoning, and chronic illness. Hypothermia due to accidental
cold exposure is encountered most commonly among neonates and the elderly,
in those immobilized by trauma or exhaustion, and in intoxicated and
unconscious persons.

   Extremes of age--In neo-nates, large surface area relative to body mass,
lack of subcutaneous fatty tissue, rudimentary adaptive behavior, and
ineffective shivering all contribute to inability to defend against extreme
environmental conditions. In the elderly, altered thermal perception,
deteriorating adaptive responses, low body-fat content, autonomic
dysfunction, maintenance on medications, impaired vasoconstrictive ability,
and low metabolic capacity are common factors that contribute to
hypothermia.
   Trauma--Exposure to cold at the scene of an accident, during lengthy
surgery, or as a result of inadvertent transfusion of large amounts of
unwarmed crystalloid solutions and chilled blood components increases the
risk for hypothermia in trauma patients. Furthermore, heat production from
shivering is inhibited by anesthetics and neuromuscular blocking agents.
Abnormal peripheral vasodilatation and dermal damage produced by surface
burns may produce large, unchecked heat losses from the body surface.
   Drug ingestion and poisoning--The possibility of recreational and
therapeutic drug ingestion must be considered in any unexplained case of
hypothermia. Depending on the population surveyed, consumption of ethanol
is associated with up to 80% of hypothermia cases.7 (Reference)
Phenothiazines may produce hypothermia through a hypothalamic depressant
action and an inhibitory effect on shivering. Drug overdoses and poisonings
can disrupt normal heat production and conservation by impairing perception
of changes in ambient temperature (which may result in inappropriate and
often paradoxical behavioral responses) and depressing the mental status.
   Chronic illness--Antecedent chronic debilitating illnesses, such as
severe hypothyroidism, hypothalamic tumors, overwhelming infections, severe
strokes, and malnutrition, not only exacerbate hypothermic injuries but
also decrease the victim's capacity to counter hypothermia once it has
developed.

Manifestations
   During early, mild hypothermia, the body attempts to compensate for its
falling temperature by intensifying thermogenesis through shivering and
hypermetabolism. A generalized increase in heat production by the
musculature surrounding the torso is associated with shivering. In the
extremities, shivering is less pronounced or absent. Accompanying the
increase in metabolism are (1) elevations in respiratory rate, minute
ventilation, and oxygen consumption, (2) increases in heart rate, cardiac
output, and mean arterial pressure, and (3) elevated levels of serum
cortisol, lactate, glycerol, ketones, and glucose; all of these result in
increased heat production. Acrocyanosis and cool skin reflect the intense
peripheral vasoconstriction that helps sustain core temperature by shunting
blood away from the cold body surface.
   Thermoregulatory failure--Thermoregulation eventually fails when peak
heat production is unable to offset the rate of heat loss from the body
surface; further reductions in core temperature occur, eventually leading
to progressive multiorgan dysfunction (table 1). Because of reductions in
cerebral blood flow, patients may become uncooperative and uncoordinated
and may even manifest irrational behavior, such as undressing. Confusion
and stupor emerge at temperatures between 32 degrees C and 35 degrees C
(89.6 degrees F and 95 degrees F). Most patients are comatose at 27 degrees
C (80.6 degrees F).
   Pulmonary and renal effects--Depression of the central respiratory
center can cause both tidal volumes and respiratory rates to decline.
Cold-induced vasoconstriction increases central blood volume; this increase
promotes withdrawal of antidiuretic hormone, which leads to the familiar
cold-induced diuresis. Furthermore, in cases of hypothermia, cold-related
impairment of renal enzymatic activity can inhibit active tubular
reabsorption, resulting in marked excretion of extremely dilute urine,
which, in turn, may further compound preexisting hypovolemia and
hemoconcentration. Renal failure secondary to depressed renal blood flow
and defective tubular activity often develops in patients who have
prolonged and profound hypothermia.
   Gastrointestinal effects--Diminished intestinal motility is commonly
observed at core temperatures below 34 degrees C (93.2 degrees F), and
ileus is invariably present once body temperature falls below 30 degrees C
(86 degrees F). In addition, acute punctate erosions of the stomach and
duodenum, hepatic dysfunction, and pancreatitis may develop as a result of
hypoperfusion.
   Cardiovascular effects--Cardiac output and mean arterial pressure fall
as a result of bradycardia, hypovolemia, and decreased ejection fraction.
Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias often develop as hypothermia progresses.
Atrial fibrillation becomes common below 32 degrees C, and ventricular
fibrillation and asystole may occur if core temperature falls below 28
degrees C (82.4 degrees F) and 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), respectively.
When body temperature drops below 31 degrees C (87.8 degrees F), a
characteristic electrocardiographic change called the Osborne wave (J wave)
is seen; it manifests as a deflection at the QRS and ST junction and is
best visualized in leads II and V (subscript) 6.
   Reduced metabolic demands--The widespread physiologic derangements of
hypothermia would be immediately fatal were it not for the concomitant
reduction in metabolic demands caused by body cooling. Vasoconstriction and
hemoconcentration ensure acceptable arterial pressures in spite of reduced
cardiac indexes. As a result of reduced metabolic requirements, even the
progressively falling respiratory minute ventilation remains adequate to
meet the demands of oxygen delivery and carbon dioxide elimination. Oxygen
consumption falls by 25% at a core temperature of 31 degrees C and by 75%
at a core temperature of 20 degrees C. Depression of cerebral metabolism
enables the brain to tolerate most hypothermic insults, and complete
recovery of neurologic functions has been reported despite prolonged
cardiac arrest and resuscitation.8 (Reference)

Treatment
   One of the most difficult tasks confronting physicians who treat
patients with hypothermia is accurate determination of death. Rigor mortis,
dependent lividity, and fixed, dilated pupils--all of which are commonly
associated with death in normothermic individuals--become unreliable
indicators in the presence of hypothermia. Therefore, resuscitative
measures must be terminated only when cardiac arrest persists despite
rewarming.
   Preventing further heat loss--It is imperative that further heat loss be
halted by moving patients to a warmer environment. They must be kept dry
and insulated. Hot drinks and particularly alcohol are best avoided because
they can magnify ongoing heat loss by promoting inappropriate peripheral
vasodilatation.
   Laboratory studies--Laboratory values obtained at presentation not only
serve as a useful baseline for future determinations but also may
facilitate early recognition of emerging complications. In addition to
blood counts, serum chemistry values, and coagulation parameters, it is
advisable to obtain a thyroid panel, measurements of serum cortisol and
cardiac isoenzymes, and surveillance cultures and chest radiographs. Blood
glucose levels are notoriously unpredictable and must be closely monitored,
especially in cases of hypoglycemia, which may impede rewarming if left
uncorrected. Films of the cervical spine are essential whenever coexisting
head and neck trauma is a possibility. Repeated abdominal and pelvic
radiographs and determinations of serum amylase and lipase levels may be
necessary to monitor pancreatic and intestinal injuries.
   While awaiting results of toxicologic studies, physicians may consider
empirical administration of naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan) and thiamine
hydrochloride (Biamine) in patients who are known to have a history of
illicit drug and alcohol abuse. Levothyroxine sodium is indicated only for
hypothermic myxedema and methylprednisolone (A-Methapred, Solu-Medrol) only
for adrenocortical insufficiency.
   Cardiac monitoring--This is essential for assessment of arrhythmias.
Faint peripheral pulses can be extremely difficult to appreciate because of
bradycardia and intense vasoconstriction. Atrial arrhythmias and heart
blocks are usually transient phenomena that convert spontaneously with
rewarming. Bretylium tosylate (Bretylol) is the drug of choice for
ventricular fibrillation and appears to be more efficacious than lidocaine
hydrochloride (Xylocaine). Bradyarrhythmias may require temporary pacing.
Aggressive rewarming is mandatory with arrest rhythms, because
pharmacologic and electrical cardioversions are invariably unsuccessful
when body temperature is below 30 degrees C. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation
must be continued until the victim's core temperature has reached 32
degrees C to 35 degrees C.
   Maintenance of intravascular volume--Adequate intravascular volume needs
to be supported. Early initiation of intravenous access facilitates
parenteral administration of pharmacologic agents as well as infusion of
crystalloid solutions and various blood components. In the presence of
frostbitten extremities, central venous access may be preferable to
peripheral catheters. Furthermore, central venous lines allow large-volume
infusions, which may not be possible peripherally with cold-induced
vascular constriction; central lines also permit monitoring of central
venous pressure during fluid replenishment.
   Because the hypothermic myocardium is intensely irritable, the tip of a
central catheter must be located at a reasonable distance from the heart to
prevent induction of arrhythmias. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring using
pulmonary catheters may precipitate fatal arrhythmias.
   Preferably, 5% dextrose in normal saline solution should be heated to 40
degrees C to 42 degrees C (104 degrees F to 107.6 degrees F) before
administration. Lactated Ringer's solution is best avoided because the
liver's capacity to metabolize lactate to bicarbonate is often inhibited by
hypothermia. Low doses of dopamine hydrochloride (Dopastat, Intropin) may
be required if hypotension persists despite seemingly adequate fluid
repletion. Because of their inherent arrhythmogenic capacity, levarterenol
(Levophed), epinephrine, and isoproterenol hydrochloride (Isuprel) are
rarely, if ever, indicated. Hourly urinary output should be monitored by
using indwelling bladder catheters.
   Airway control--Satisfactory airway control must be guaranteed.
Administration of warm, humidified oxygen by face mask suffices for most
cases of mild hypothermia. Endotracheal intubation is primarily indicated
during respiratory arrest and whenever adequate protection of the airways
is questionable. Control of secretions is particularly troublesome in
persons with moderate to severe hypothermia, because profuse bronchorrhea
and ineffective mucociliary activity may contribute to airway obstruction.
   Infection--This ever-present hazard requires diagnostic vigilance and
vigorous therapy. Infection is easily missed because fever is often absent
and laboratory findings are invariably nonspecific. At times, an
unexplained fall in systemic vascular resistance is the sole clue to
evolving sepsis. Use of prophylactic antibiotics is indicated in neonates
and infants and also in diabetic adults, in whom the prognosis with sepsis
is particularly ominous.
   Thromboembolism--Hypothermic patients may be prone to thromboembolism
because of cold-related intravascular volume depletion and increased blood
viscosity. Unfortunately, traditional measures are often unsatisfactory in
preventing this complication. Cutaneous hypoperfusion renders the
absorption of subcutaneously administered heparin highly erratic.
Application of pneumatic boots may further compromise frostbitten
extremities.
   Dermal injury--Dermal injury from frostbite typically affects the
extremities, face, ears, penis, and scrotum. Initially gray and waxy, the
involved areas usually become swollen and blistered and may turn red to
black with rewarming. Frostbitten dermis may be thawed by bathing in water
that has been warmed to 38 degrees C to 40 degrees C (100.4 degrees F to
104 degrees F). Parenteral heparin has been used to salvage injured
tissues. Surgical excision and amputation must be deferred until definite
demarcation of nonviable dermis becomes apparent during the second week
after injury.

Methods of rewarming
   Rewarming should be achieved rapidly at the most hemodynamically
tolerable rate possible with use of the least invasive means (table 2). A
particular rewarming method, whether passive or active, is selected after
thorough consideration of the patient's age and overall health, the
presence of any concurrent complications, the severity and duration of the
hypothermic insult, and the effectiveness and degree of invasiveness of
available techniques.
   Passive external rewarming--This is the least invasive method of
rewarming and is generally sufficient for patients with core temperatures
above 33 degrees C (91.4 degrees F). Minimizing further heat dissipation by
removing the patient from the cold environment and providing shelter and
insulation is often all that is necessary for acute, mild hypothermia when
endogenous heat production through shivering restores body temperature to
acceptable levels. With this method, temperature can increase by 0.4 degree
C to 2 degrees C (0.7 degree F to 3.6 degrees F) each hour. Peripheral
vasoconstriction is maintained; this minimizes the risk of both hypotension
and temperature afterdrops, which often occur when cold peripheral blood is
shunted to the core during vasodilatation.
   Active rewarming--This method is indicated for patients with moderate to
severe hypothermia and core temperatures below 32 degrees C. It may also be
preferable in the elderly and in patients with hypoglycemia,
hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, or other disorders
that limit endogenous thermogenesis. Persons with diabetic ketoacidosis and
cardiovascular instability may benefit from the rapid normalization of core
body temperature that is possible only with active rewarming. Finally,
active rewarming must be considered in any patient, whatever the degree of
hypothermia, if initial passive rewarming methods fail to elevate body
temperature.
   Active external rewarming--This may be accomplished with hot water
bottles, heated blankets, external radiant sources, or warm bath
immersions.9-11 (Reference) These approaches are highly effective in
elevating body temperature but do have several drawbacks. In addition to
dangerous surface burns, which may occur if the temperature of the thermal
appliance is not closely monitored, afterdrops of core temperature may
develop because these methods tend to induce early peripheral
vasodilatation. Hemodynamic instability may ensue if the hypothermic heart
is unable to respond adequately to the rising metabolic requirements of the
rewarmed exterior tissue shell. The risk of circulatory collapse is
determined primarily by the patient's degree of cardiovascular tolerance,
the extent of exposed body surface, and the intensity of rewarming.
   Active core rewarming--This provides the most rapid return to
normothermia and is the method of choice in patients who have cardiac
arrest or ventricular fibrillation. Airway rewarming is done with warmed,
humidified gas, and rewarming rates between 1 degree C and 2.5 degrees C
(1.8 degrees F and 4.5 degrees F) an hour can be achieved. This method has
the added benefits of (1) preferential rewarming of central blood volume
and the heart and lungs and (2) stimulation of the airway mucociliary
apparatus. Inhaled gas temperatures should be maintained between 40 degrees
C and 45 degrees C (104 degrees F and 113 degrees F) by using an in-line
temperature monitor to prevent tracheobronchial injuries and parenchymal
edema, which may occur if gas temperatures exceed 46 degrees C (114.8
degrees F).
   Lavage of the gastrointestinal tract can be done with warmed solutions.
However, the effectiveness of intragastric irrigation is limited by the
small surface area of the stomach, and fluid and electrolyte shifts may
complicate intracolonic irrigation. Lavage is contraindicated in persons
with suspected intra-abdominal trauma and in those who have had recent
gastrointestinal surgery.
   Pleural irrigation is performed either through thoracostomy tubes or
with open thoracotomy. Circulating warm saline solution can also be
introduced into the mediastinum through chest tubes. Similarly, peritoneal
lavage with prewarmed dialysate can be accomplished by peritoneal dialysis
or by direct irrigation of the open peritoneal cavity if hypothermia
develops as a complication of abdominal surgery. Peritoneal dialysis is
contraindicated in patients with abdominal injuries and is preferably
avoided in those who have had previous operations, because they may be more
prone to intraperitoneal injury and infection from preexisting adhesions.
Like intracolonic lavage, peritoneal dialysis may promote detoxification of
ingested drugs and poisons by rewarming the liver and reactivating hepatic
enzymes.
   Extracorporeal rewarming of blood by cardiopulmonary bypass or
hemodialysis should be considered for severely hypothermic patients with
core temperatures below 28 degrees C. Blood circulation can be preserved by
using cardiopulmonary bypass even in the absence of effective myocardial
activity. The rate of rewarming averages 9.5 degrees C (17.1 degrees F) an
hour during cardiopulmonary bypass.12 (Reference)

Prognosis
   Survival is inversely related to the intensity and duration of
hypothermia. Outcome is better in cases resulting from simple exposure or
ingestion of ethanol. Significant antecedent illness, cardiac arrest before
hospitalization, hypotension, coma, respiratory failure, and intravascular
thrombosis indicate a worse prognosis.

Summary
   The diagnosis of hypothermia must be entertained when patients present
with unexplained mental status changes or arrhythmias. Prompt recognition
and aggressive treatment of complications should reduce cold-related
fatalities. The choice of an appropriate rewarming method must be
individualized and depends on the severity of hypothermia and the patient's
degree of hemodynamic tolerance.

THE COST OF CARING: WHO HEALS THE HEALER?

By:
Peter A. Setness, MD

   The cost of medicine. We hear about it constantly, usually in connection
with terms such as ``skyrocketing,'' ``spiraling,'' and ``out of control.''
But at a 25-year reunion of a family practice residency program I attended
recently, the discussion centered on a different type of medical cost--the
personal cost of being a primary care physician.
   A large group of current faculty and residents, as well as returning
graduates, spent a Saturday morning listening to a panel discussion and
then, in smaller groups, sharing some of their own stories. These
physicians, from rural solo practices, urban multispecialty group
practices, and everything in between, talked not only of their great
satisfaction in sharing in the personal and family events in the lives of
their patients, but also of the loneliness in dealing with medical crises
and other problems faced by patients they had come to know as friends. Most
of them spoke of a lack of emotional support from the community and,
unfortunately, a lack of overt support from colleagues when they were
dealing with a poor patient outcome, a malpractice suit, or personal
problems.

Key rewards
   I'd like to believe that physicians in primary care medicine have some
personal values that enable us to reach out to patients and that these very
connections, in turn, reward us. There is an important difference between
being a doctor and being a personal doctor, one who is willing to make a
commitment of person to the patients he or she serves. This commitment is
what allows us to turn a case into a patient and a number into a name--of a
real person in a real family in a real community. It gives our medical
encounters depth, but it also puts us at some emotional risk.
   The relationships we develop with patients are the key rewards in our
practice. They are what keeps us coming back for more. Often we have the
privilege of caring for a patient through many years or even through the
patient's life span. The flip side, though, is the emotional burden of
foreseeing the medical problems that lie ahead for a patient. The joys of
the doctor-patient relationship are tempered when a patient is dying or
when we feel we or the medical community could have done something better.

Punishing ourselves
   When a patient's outcome is poor, we punish ourselves by second-guessing
our decisions. But when a result is less than optimum, perhaps no one is to
blame. As Rabbi H. Kushner says in his well-known book, bad things do
happen to good people. We may be at the wrong place at the wrong time.
Despite our competence and conscientious surveillance, some patients may
experience side effects of medications or procedures. As financial
considerations become more important in medical care, managed care
guidelines or policies may distort our particular style of medical
practice. We may pay too much attention to cost containment, thus
increasing the potential for a poor outcome.
   Instead of personalizing poor results and internalizing the discomfort,
we need to remind ourselves that the situation may have been beyond our
control. One long-time physician in my discussion group shared the pain of
not diagnosing a carcinoma until it became metastatic in a patient who had
just recently come in for an annual exam. The physician felt personally
responsible for that patient's cancer and had grieved silently for years.
Unfortunately, his family, his friends, and even his other patients also
suffered because of his unresolved grief, damaged self-esteem, and mild
depression.
   Such self-doubts can get way out of hand: According to the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, physicians are No. 3 out of
230 occupations analyzed for risk of suicide, with an odds ratio of 2.88
compared with the general public. Only psychologists and pharmacists rank
higher, and lawyers hold the fifth spot.
   A poor outcome is not necessarily the same as a mistake. As Mark Twain
is quoted as saying, ``Good judgment comes from experience, and experience
comes from poor judgment.'' Reviewing events retrospectively, with all the
advantages of hindsight, can be healthy. But it is easy to focus on a
particular outcome and to forget about the confusion and complexities that
surrounded the case in context. We are accountable for what we try to do,
but not for everything that happens.

Sharing our feelings
   We also need to remember that we cannot protect ourselves or others from
the personal pain of living. Sometimes all we can do is try to ease
someone's pain. But because we feel we need to be strong, we tend not to
show our feelings. And when bad things happen, we blame ourselves too
easily. We might feel such guilt that we dread seeing a patient or won't
even call the patient's family. The point is, it's okay to say ``I'm
sorry.'' It's not an admission of guilt. And by sharing your feelings with
your patients and their families, you become a personal doctor.
   Like everyone else, physicians have to deal with personal
problems--family illnesses and deaths, financial concerns, chemical
dependency, divorce, disabilities, and the whole range of human frailty.
Physicians who are struggling with such problems need tremendous support.
The stress of silence can be almost unbearable, and not talking about our
feelings contributes to a sense of isolation and hopelessness. Doctors are
usually better at analyzing and evaluating facts, function, and form than
at dealing with their own frustrations and feelings and their need to
forgive and to be forgiven.

A listening ear
   The physicians at the reunion shared their difficulty in coping with
their personal pain within their practice setting. In one case, the least
likely colleague initiated a healing discussion, while a best-friend
physician would not or could not discuss the topic with the distressed
physician. It's almost as if some physicians cannot talk about painful
issues. Perhaps they think that the emotional feelings surrounding poor
outcomes, malpractice cases, and personal pain are contagious. But, at
least in the case of problems related to practice, support from colleagues
who not only can understand the confidential nature of a poor outcome or
the legal implications of a malpractice threat, but also can identify with
our vulnerability, is invaluable. We need our colleagues, with common
experience, to become trusted listeners.
   Support can also come from other sources. One doctor in the discussion
group said that a unique, long-time patient-friend turned out to be his
greatest source of support time and again. The important thing is to find a
nonjudgmental listener who, by hearing and reflecting on our story, can
help us understand our experience better. Sometimes all a patient needs is
for us to listen. At times, a good listener may be all that we need too.

Reaching out for help
   So who heals the healer? How do we talk, and how do we find trusted
listeners? How do we deal with our burdens?
   Look to your colleagues and friends. And perhaps consider a group, but
don't call it a support group. Instead, call it a professional development
group, or a case study seminar, or a journal club, and devote the last part
of the discussion time to patient and personal issues. The group could be a
model of the now-classic Balint seminar, where one confronts oneself by
discussing case-centered, patient-centered issues. What often happens in
such discussions is that the ``doctor'' in the doctor-patient relationship
emerges as you talk about a patient's problems, and soon you are talking
about your own place in the relationship and your own needs as a doctor.
   If discussion groups aren't your cup of tea or if you are in an isolated
rural solo practice, consider e-mail with other physicians. You might find
that the distance adds a measure of safety and comfort when sharing
personal issues. But be careful of confidentiality issues when discussing
cases on e-mail. The point is, reach out for help. If you don't know where
to turn, call a trusted faculty member at your local residency program or
contact a medical school or your state or county medical society. If you
are in severe distress, consider professional therapy.
   Finally, don't forget to celebrate the everyday joys and successes of
practicing medicine. We have all helped patients through difficult times.
Let's start reminding each other of the successes we have had. And let's be
a constructive force in helping colleagues to cope during difficult times.
The need for help is not a sign of weakness. Don't let the burdens of
caring hide the rewards of practicing medicine.

What is the Balint method of training?
   Michael Balint was a psychiatrist who, with his wife Enid, conducted a
series of training seminars for general practitioners at the Tavistock
Clinic in London during the late 1950s and 1960s. He published the
monograph The Doctor, His Patient, and the Illness after several of his
groups had been meeting for at least 3 years.
   The design of the ``training cum research'' was extremely simple: Small
groups of family physicians met weekly to discuss their interactions with
patients that were in any way puzzling, frustrating, or unsatisfying.
Presentations were informal and spontaneous, and the groups dealt with the
cases over time to understand more about the doctor-patient relationship
and how it affected the quality and outcome of care.
   After Dr Balint taught in the United States in the late 1960s, his
training techniques were widely adopted, especially in family practice
training programs around the country. Today, the International Balint
Federation continues to adapt and use his methods. Information about the
American Balint Society can be obtained from Laurel Milberg, PhD, Forbes

TWO BY TWO

By:
Eric G. Anderson, MD

   I often see geriatric patients as Noah saw his passengers: two by two.
Many of my older patients bring their spouses with them to the office.
   Sometimes these couples make me laugh and brighten my day. I've learned,
however, to bite my lip on occasion and not to laugh too soon, because
sometimes the humor is inadvertent.
   This was the case with Mrs Angel,* who brought her husband in on a day
when he was being particularly difficult.
   ``Do you know why I married this man?'' she finally asked me.
   I shook my head cautiously.
   ``Because there were things about him that I knew would bother other
people that didn't bother me,'' she replied.
   I sometimes learn more from the couple than I would seeing each person
separately. But just as often in my interactions with pairs, I blow it.
   That's what happened with Mrs Teitelbaum,* a new patient who
unexpectedly volunteered that she had divorced her first husband. Her
current husband shrank back uncomfortably into one of my office chairs.
   ``Well, I'm sure Mr Teitelbaum is better looking,'' I said
encouragingly, smiling at the embarrassed man.
   ``No,'' she said, brushing some lint off her skirt. ``My first husband
was better looking.''
I blundered on. ``Yes, but I bet your mother prefers Mr Teitelbaum.''
   ``No. She prefers my second husband,'' she replied. ``He's my third.''
   Silence really is golden.
   Not so funny was my relationship with Mrs Freedman.* She insisted on
giving her husband's history, even though he was an intelligent retired
schoolteacher who was very much on the ball. She corrected any symptoms he
offered. It was hard, therefore, to get the patient's perspective--not an
uncommon problem when one spouse is dominant, yet a situation experienced
physicians learn to handle.
   I must have forgotten my experience, because at one point in the office
visit I said, probably in exasperation, ``Mrs Freedman, please let your
husband explain how he's feeling. Then we can see if you agree with what
he's said.''
   I caught a strange look on her face, a look I saw again later when I
made my only appearance in court to defend myself against a charge of
medical malpractice. The charge was preposterous and I won, but it took 3
years of my life and a lot of the joy out of practicing medicine.
   The malpractice charge surely sharpened my sensitivity to any patient's
spouse, but I still smile when I think about two situations in which I was
slow to tune in.
   Mrs Schlott* brought in her oversedated husband, who sat drooling in the
corner while she told me what had happened: She'd taken him to our urgent
care department, and a doctor there had diagnosed depression and prescribed
trazodone. The doctor hadn't mentioned the drug's side effects, though. Mrs
Schlott wondered if her husband's headache, nausea, and palpitations could
be related to the medication.
   I wasn't surprised by her questions. The husband, a deaf, irascible
person who never showed his wife affection, used various doctors for
primary care. She often asked me to sort out any confusion regarding his
treatment.
   I looked at the label and noted that a heavy loading dose had been
prescribed for a man his age. I thought I should warn him about the more
important side effects.
   I leaned over and shouted in his ear, dropping my voice when I came to
priapism, a complication I'd actually seen in a couple of patients. I
didn't want to embarrass his wife.
   ``What exactly are you saying, Doctor?'' she asked.
   ``The male might have an erection that could last for hours, Mrs
Schlott. It can be a problem if it doesn't go down,'' I said hesitatingly.
   She led her husband out the door, saying, ``Well, I don't think we'll
worry about a little bit of nausea and headache, will we, Fritz? This
medicine is helping you.''
   Mrs Firenze* had the opposite situation.
   Her debonair Italian husband, aged 93, sported a silk cravat, pearl
tiepin, and a polyester leisure suit. He wanted his ``marital rights''
twice daily.
   His younger wife was exhausted.
   At a number of visits, the old man asked, ``Don't you think my wife
should consider her husband's physical needs?''
She responded with frantic semaphore signals behind his back that showed
she didn't share his sexual appetite.
   Mr Firenze had severe pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. I don't know
how he had the energy to talk about sex, much less want it so often.
   One day, he came in with arrhythmia. He was lethargic, confused,
vomiting, and dehydrated; he'd had a strangulated inguinal hernia for 2
days. I called for an ambulance, then went back to explain the poor
prognosis to his wife.
   She listened carefully until I felt obliged to say, ``He's a poor risk
for surgery. He might die on the operating table. I wish the hospital was
closer. Even the short ambulance ride could kill him.''
   Bless her heart. She fought hard, trying to compose her face, but she
finally broke out into a lopsided grin.
   ``When we take the ambulance,'' she asked, ``could we go the long
way?''

*Names have been changed.

YOUR `WINDOW' TO THE WORLD'S INFORMATION

By:
Jerry F. Potts, MD

   Consider the paramecium. The little one-celled creature we all remember
from basic biology can be compared to the computer sitting in many a
physician's office, or at least to the way it's used.
   A one-celled organism is capable of simple functions (eg, it is motile
and can feed itself). Similarly, a physician's computer often sits alone,
unconnected to others, and completes simple tasks (eg, generates letters or
tracks accounts) with use of a small-business application.
   But when grouped, both organisms and computers become more complex
entities, capable of functioning at new levels that are stunning in their
diversity and exciting in their potential.

What computers can do
   Right now, the technology is available to bring radiographs directly
from the imaging equipment to the desktop screen and to allow the
radiologist and the clinician at the screen to discuss the radiographs as
they view them simultaneously.
   Right now, the technology is available to transfer the spoken word
directly into text on a word processor. Yes, the ``talking typewriter'' of
science fiction stories is now a science fact. And the ``picture
telephone'' is becoming common in the business world as computers and
telephone equipment merge.
   Right now, the technology is available to check a drug dose as you
prescribe it, to print out a personalized set of instructions for a
patient, and to enter information on that patient into an electronic
record.
   To take advantage of the technology that is already available, not to
mention what is coming up, physicians need to take a wider view of what a
computer can do. Rather than thinking of a computer as a tool with which to
accomplish a task, these days it may be more accurate to think of it as a
``window.'' Through it, physicians can see and choose information that is
available from nearly anywhere. As technology becomes simpler and more
standardized, fear of computers, which is already fading fast, will be
replaced with the confident attitude, ``I know it's there. How can I find
it?'' The dominant role of physicians of the future may well be to find and
interpret the most current information, wherever it resides.

What computer networks can do
   One of the latest trends in the computer world is networking. Experts
call for the eventual connection of virtually all computers. The
ramifications as this concept becomes reality are amazing to consider. Even
small networks (eg, a few computers within one office or clinic that can
communicate with each other) offer more information to physicians than what
is immediately available on a single computer.
   The biggest network of all, known as the Internet, is the driving force
behind a complete transformation of computers--from pieces of individual
equipment to mechanical members of large-group cooperatives. By some
counts, as many as 20 million computers now are connected to this worldwide
network of information. Until quite recently, the Internet was the
exclusive province of universities and military institutions. But as
technology advanced, more and more people started using the Internet to
``talk'' to others all over the world. Soon commercial interests came to
appreciate the ability to reach millions of computer-literate people at
virtually no cost.
   The Internet continues to grow at a tremendous rate. The standard method
of communication among corporations, students and others members of the
academic community, and many professionals throughout the world is
electronic mail passed through the network. Today, an Internet address is
almost as common on a business card as a telephone number.

What all this means to physicians
   Among the abundance of material that is readily available on the
Internet is medical information. Disease-prevention statistics,
medical-image files, reference databases, and many other types of text and
graphics are available with a few keystrokes if you know where to look.
Educational pieces for both physicians and patients are accessible and
useful. For minimal cost, you can view an encyclopedia (including audio and
video clips), and if you really want to, you can even watch a frog
dissection.
   In the near future, computer networking is likely to directly affect
physicians by changing the reimbursement process. Electronic submission of
claims is available and is already being used by the large healthcare
institutions. Almost certainly, electronic filing will become a
requirement, so significant changes will be needed in the business offices
of even small practices.
   Many people feel that they save personal time by using the Internet.
Users can plan trips, purchase tickets and other products, and make banking
transactions. They can also dial in to read the latest news or check up and
comment on legislation that is pending in Congress.
   And there are just-plain-fun aspects of networks. Discussion groups have
been formed around virtually every interest, from the arts to gardening to
tennis. Whatever your passion may be, you can chat about it with fellow
enthusiasts across the globe.
   My aim in coming columns is to look at a number of issues related to
computers and the Internet. I'll tell you about ways I've incorporated
computers into my practice and about some of the things ``out there'' that
are on my agenda to try. What's on your computer agenda? I'll be interested
to hear your stories and opinions, and we may share some of them in future
columns (with your permission, of course).
   It becomes more and more obvious the longer I work with computers and
networks that there are no limits to their practical applications in daily
life, especially since they are becoming easier and easier to use. Already,
daughter Elizabeth (aged 20 months) is displaying a tendency to monopolize
the home computer. Can her own e-mail address be far behind?
   Your comments and discoveries about using computers in practice and for
fun are welcome and may be published in Digital Doc. Contact Jerry F.

MEET JERRY POTTS

By:
Peter A. Setness, MD, Editor-in-Chief

   Computer poker! Teletype Star Trek! Thus began Jerry's noble and
altruistic interest in computers.
   But that was only high school and college stuff. During his residency
training in the early 1980s at Hayes Army Hospital, Fort Ord, California,
he attended a patient-wellness fair where the big drawing card was a fairly
new idea at the time--a computer printout of each person's results. With
hundreds of people awaiting their printout, the Radio Shack TRS-80 computer
locked up. To the great relief of the organizers, Jerry was able to get
things going again. As is the Army's way, it rewarded Jerry the Army
Service Medal for his act of selfless heroism. He is probably one of only a
few physicians to be decorated for computer work above and beyond the call
of duty.
   And once again he has fearlessly stepped forward, this time by
volunteering to write a column on computer use by busy practicing
physicians. Jerry is certainly one of those. He has been with the Family
Practice Department at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis since
1986 and is the department's assistant chief and a faculty member of the
residency training program. He is medical director of the Family Medical
Center, sees patients nearly every day, and in his spare time is working on
a prototype electronic medical record-keeping system for the clinic.
   In the limited remainder of his time, he has agreed to give us his
perspective on becoming a ``digital doc.'' Although he has a Mac IIcx at
home, a Pentium 90 at work, and an Apple IIe that he still uses regularly
for word processing (plus a Tandy model 100 in the closet), he really is a
physician first. His interest in computers is self-generated, and he uses
this interest at work to explore ways to facilitate and improve patient
care. This column will be a travelogue of Jerry's explorations--what works
for him and what doesn't.

MODERATE PARKINSON'S DISEASE: STRATEGIES FOR MAXIMIZING TREATMENT

By:
Paul M. Silverstein, MD


Preview
   Levodopa has long been the standard pharmacologic agent for treatment of
Parkinson's disease, but after long-term use of the drug, motor
fluctuations and dyskinesia occur in many patients. In this article, Dr
Silverstein discusses dosage adjustments, combination drug regimens, and
dietary changes that help to optimize symptomatic therapy. He also explores
the neuroprotective potential of selegiline in slowing progression of
Parkinson's disease.

   Parkinson's disease is a relentlessly progressive neurologic disorder
that affects primarily the elderly. Symptoms of the disease are sometimes
initially attributed to the aging process, but one or more of the cardinal
symptoms of parkinsonism--bradykinesia, a characteristic resting tremor,
postural instability, impaired gait and mobility, and limb rigidity--are
often clinically apparent. A number of other symptoms are less common
(table 1).
   Symptoms and rate of disease progression vary greatly among patients.
Once the diagnosis is established, the degree of functional impairment
dictates whether or not drug therapy is initiated. With the help of current
therapies, some patients continue working or lead a relatively normal life
for 10 years or more. But this was not always the case. According to a
study from 1967,1 (Reference) about two thirds of patients were severely
disabled 5 years after onset of the disease; more than 80% were severely
disabled or dead 10 years after onset. The rate of expected mortality has
decreased markedly since 1967, when physicians began to use levodopa
(Dopar, Larodopa)--the precursor to dopamine hydrochloride--for treatment
of Parkinson's disease.2 (Reference)
   Today, there are many options for pharmacologic management of
Parkinson's disease (table 2). This article summarizes a number of the most
current strategies for treating patients with moderate disease and
functional impairment.

What causes Parkinson's disease?
   The exact cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but theories abound.
Although a link has not definitely been established, excessive free radical
formation and oxidative damage to the cells of the substantia nigra
probably play a role in development of the disease.3 (Reference)
   The pathology of Parkinson's disease is well defined: Intracytoplasmic
inclusions, progressive destruction of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal
pathway, and consequent reduction of striatal concentration of dopamine are
characteristic.4 (Reference) Postmortem studies have revealed an 80% loss
of dopamine in the striatum at the time symptoms become clinically
apparent.5 (Reference) A deficiency of dopamine, which functions as a
neurotransmitter in the striatum and in other related brain centers,
results in the vast array of physical changes, cognitive dysfunction, and
depressive symptoms that characterize Parkinson's disease.

Slowing disease progression
   Neuroprotective therapy to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease
has become an important focus of treatment strategies recently. The
monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor selegiline hydrochloride
(Eldepryl) may moderate disease progression by reducing toxic free radical
formation, thereby sparing remaining neurons in the substantia nigra.
   Studies involving newly diagnosed cases of Parkinson's disease show that
selegiline slowed the rate of symptom development and delayed the need for
levodopa therapy.6-8 (Reference) Whether this resulted from the drug's
symptomatic effect or from its neuroprotective effect on the neurons of the
substantia nigra remains controversial.9,10 (Reference) Selegiline has the
potential to exert a symptomatic effect because it increases intracellular
dopamine through its inhibition of MAO-B, which blocks the breakdown of
dopamine. Consequently, many clinicians choose selegiline for initial
therapy because of its potential to provide both symptomatic and
neuroprotective benefits.

Symptomatic treatment
   When a patient with Parkinson's disease becomes functionally disabled,
symptomatic treatment is initiated. The choice of the appropriate
pharmacologic intervention is determined by the patient's needs, extent of
disability, symptoms, age, presence or absence of cognitive dysfunction,
and response to initial drug therapy.
   In 1994, a panel of neurologists outlined treatment guidelines for
Parkinson's disease and developed an algorithm that helps maximize response
to drug therapy (figure 1). The algorithm is designed to help physicians
tailor treatment, especially in newly diagnosed cases.
   Currently, drugs used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease include
anticholinergics, amantadine hydrochloride (Symadine, Symmetrel), dopamine
agonists, and levodopa. Each of these agents relies on a different
mechanism of action in the brain and has a well-defined role in the
management of Parkinson's disease.
   Levodopa is currently the most effective treatment, but motor
fluctuations and dyskinesia develop in most patients after long-term
administration of the drug. Current research suggests that this is because
of gradual loss of dopamine terminals in the striatum and changes in the
response of the striatal receptor cells to dopamine.11 (Reference)
   In the normal brain, striatal receptor cells receive a continuous, tonic
stimulation from dopamine via the intact striatonigral pathway. The gradual
loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum diminishes the brain's
ability to continuously produce, store, and release dopamine. In
Parkinson's disease, postsynaptic changes seem to result from the
intermittent stimulation of striatal receptor cells that occurs when
standard levodopa is administered periodically during the day. As the
disease progresses, daily fluctuations in motor capability--ranging from
``wearing-off'' phenomena to sudden, unpredictable changes in mobility,
known as ``on-off'' syndrome--produce increasing disability. Choreiform or
dystonic dyskinesias also develop and are often disabling.
   Other factors thought to influence wearing-off phenomena are the
variability of gastric emptying and factors that influence levodopa
transport. Levodopa is absorbed into the duodenum and then must compete
with large neutral amino acids in the diet for transport across the gut
wall and into the bloodstream; similar competition occurs for transport
across the blood-brain barrier.12 (Reference) Gastric emptying into the
duodenum is delayed by large meals and the use of anticholinergic and
dopaminergic drugs and is a common consequence of advancing age.13
(Reference)

Motor fluctuations
   Management of motor fluctuations is challenging and not always
successful, but a number of strategies are worth trying. Many of these
treatment options share the principal goals of therapy: to sustain
therapeutic brain concentrations of levodopa and provide continuous
stimulation of the striatal receptor cells. These strategies attempt to
control the delivery of levodopa to the brain, modify its breakdown within
the brain, or bypass the presynaptic substantia nigra neuron that is
degenerating and directly stimulate the dopamine receptor.
   Dosage adjustments--Lower and more frequent doses of immediate-release
carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet) throughout the day may help maintain
therapeutic levels in the blood. Providing a dose every 3 to 4 hours during
the day is often beneficial. It is important to give a sufficient amount of
levodopa with each dose to produce an effect; insufficient doses can result
in multiple dose failures during the day.
   Sustained-release preparation--Use of the sustained-release formulation
of carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet CR) prolongs the drug's benefit and helps
avoid wearing-off effects.14 (Reference) This strategy may help to prevent
further alteration in the striatal receptor response by providing a more
physiologic tonic stimulation. When patients change to the
sustained-release preparation, however, the daily levodopa dose must be
increased by 20% to 30% because of differences in bioavailability between
the two preparations. Patients who switch to the sustained-release
formulation often comment that they miss the initial ``kick'' they used to
receive from their first morning dose of regular carbidopa/levodopa. In
such cases, a combination regimen of 1 tablet of the immediate-release form
and 1 tablet of the sustained-release form may be taken as the initial
morning dose. This provides rapid onset of action and a prolonged effect.
   Liquid preparation--For selected patients who are highly compliant and
willing to adhere to a demanding therapeutic schedule, a liquid preparation
of carbidopa/levodopa can be mixed at home to counteract wearing-off
periods.15 (Reference) The standard formula calls for 10 tablets of
carbidopa/levodopa in the 25/100-mg strength and 2 g of ascorbic acid
crystals dissolved in 1 L of tap water. The patient drinks 75 mL of the
solution first thing in the morning and then consumes 35 to 50 mL/hr
thereafter. This preparation works well for many patients who have motor
fluctuations, but a fair amount of fine-tuning is usually required to
establish the correct dose.
   Dopamine agonists--Addition of a dopamine agonist to the
carbidopa/levodopa regimen often results in substantial improvement of
motor fluctuations, because dopamine agonists directly stimulate dopamine
receptors16 (Reference) (figure 2). The two agonists that are currently
available in the United States, bromocriptine mesylate (Parlodel) and
pergolide mesylate (Permax), differ in the way they stimulate the striatal
receptors but have virtually the same effect. A patient who does not
respond to one of the agonists may benefit from the other.
   Daily doses of 15 to 30 mg of bromocriptine generally suffice when the
agonist is added to the carbidopa/levodopa regimen. Doses of 2 to 4 mg of
pergolide per day usually are required to avoid wearing-off effects. When a
dopamine agonist is added to this regimen, the carbidopa/levodopa schedule
is often modified so that smaller, more frequent doses are administered.
For example, a patient taking the 25/250-mg strength of carbidopa/levodopa
three times a day might be switched to the 25/100-mg strength six times per
day. Supplemental dopamine agonist therapy helps smooth out fluctuations.
   Mao-b inhibitors--Use of a selected MAO-B inhibitor, such as selegiline,
may help manage motor fluctuations.17 (Reference) MAO-B inhibitors block
the enzymatic breakdown of dopamine and extend the duration of levodopa
effect. The addition of 5 mg of selegiline twice a day generally requires a
10% to 20% reduction in carbidopa/levodopa to avoid levodopa peak-dose side
effects, such as increased dyskinesia.
   Amantadine also may help some patients. The drug appears to enhance the
release of dopamine, thereby prolonging the amount of ``on'' time that
patients experience.
   Dietary modifications--Large neutral amino acids in the diet can
significantly alter the effect of levodopa by competing with the drug for
transport, primarily across the blood-brain barrier.18 (Reference) Thus, a
meal that is high in protein may diminish the effect of a recent dose of
carbidopa/levodopa. Most patients can avoid this problem by taking their
medication about 30 to 45 minutes before eating. For patients with more
severe fluctuations, a protein-redistribution diet, in which most protein
is consumed in the evening, may be indicated.19 (Reference) Another option
is to consume a balanced carbohydrate-protein diet, for which products are
available commercially. Both of these dietary modifications enhance the
transport of levodopa across the blood-brain barrier and, consequently, at
the dopamine nerve terminals.
   Enteral infusion--In rare cases in which pronounced, disabling
fluctuations cannot be stabilized with other techniques, continuous enteral
infusion of levodopa through a percutaneous gastrojejunal tube may be
warranted.20 (Reference) The challenge is to convince patients of the
benefits of this invasive delivery method.

Dyskinesia
   After 3 years of treatment with levodopa, about half of patients have
dyskinesia.11 (Reference) Muenter and associates21 (Reference) described
dyskinesia as occurring in two patterns: dystonia-improvement-dystonia and
improvement-dystonia-improvement. Treatment is often problematic, but
several strategies may be helpful.
   Peak-dose dyskinesia--The improvement-dystonia-improvement pattern, or
peak-dose dyskinesia, is relatively common. Choreic or dystonic movements
of the head, trunk, limbs and, occasionally, respiratory muscles are
characteristic. Lowering each individual dose of carbidopa/levodopa by a
small amount may help. If motor response deteriorates, a dopamine agonist,
such as bromocriptine or pergolide, may be added. The use of
sustained-release rather than standard carbidopa/levodopa may be beneficial
for this type of dyskinesia because lower peak-dose levodopa blood levels
are achieved. Finally, for patients taking selegiline, discontinuation of
the drug may help reduce dopamine concentrations in the brain.
   Diphasic dyskinesia--The dystonia-improvement-dystonia pattern, or
diphasic dyskinesia, develops with advanced Parkinson's disease and is more
difficult to correct. Abnormal movements are often coarser, associated with
limb pain, and observed when plasma levodopa levels are increasing or
decreasing. This pattern of dyskinesia may respond to more frequent dosing
of carbidopa/levodopa, which helps to achieve a more steady ``on'' state.
Increasing each dose may help, but this approach usually fails over time.
Another strategy is to switch patients with diphasic dyskinesia to an
agonist drug for primary therapy and then supplement the regimen with
smaller doses of carbidopa/levodopa. Use of sustained-release
carbidopa/levodopa may aggravate this pattern of dyskinesia, most likely
because a slower flux of levodopa levels in the blood may contribute to
development rather than treatment of dyskinesias.
   Foot cramps--Patients with advanced Parkinson's disease may have painful
foot cramps in the morning or occasionally late in the afternoon because of
dystonic posturing of the foot. During the cramps, blood levels of levodopa
are critically low. Administration of baclofen (Lioresal),
sustained-release carbidopa/levodopa, or dopamine agonist therapy provides
relief.

Summary
   Motor fluctuations and dyskinesia often develop in patients with
Parkinson's disease after 3 to 5 years of levodopa therapy. Dosage
adjustments, addition of a second medication to the drug regimen, and
dietary modifications may help maximize response to symptomatic therapy.
Given the dramatic variability of symptoms and response to treatment, drug
regimens must be individualized according to the patient's needs.
   In newly diagnosed cases of Parkinson's disease, administration of
selegiline hydrochloride (Eldepryl) may slow symptom development and delay
the need for levodopa therapy. Many physicians prescribe selegiline
initially for its symptomatic and potential neuroprotective benefits.

PNEUMONIA, A FIVE ARTICLE SYMPOSIUM
COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: WHAT'S NEEDED FOR ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS

By:
Thomas M. File Jr, MD

Preview
   Community-acquired pneumonia remains a leading cause of morbidity and
death, particularly in the elderly and in patients with underlying disease.
Identification of a specific cause on clinical grounds often is not
possible, and even extensive studies may not reveal the responsible
pathogen. In this article, the authors concentrate on the factors that
contribute to a reliable diagnosis.

   Several important changes have made diagnosis and management of
community-acquired pneumonia a greater challenge than ever. These include
an expanding number of possible pathogens, increasing antimicrobial
resistance, the influence of HIV infection, and the rising prevalence of
tuberculosis in US communities.1-4 (Reference) There is also a stimulus to
be as cost-effective as possible, and the primary care physician must try
to balance reasonable use of diagnostic tests with empirical therapy. This
review focuses on diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia in the context
of these changes.

Clinical diagnosis
   The diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia is based on a combination
of clinical and laboratory data. These include characteristic clinical
findings (fever, cough, and rhonchi or rales on auscultation), the presence
of a new infiltrate on chest films, and documentation of a causative
microorganism.
   Although patients with community-acquired pneumonia usually present with
cough and fever, the differential diagnosis is extensive and includes upper
and lower respiratory tract infections as well as noninfectious causes (ie,
reactive airways disease, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary malignancy).
Because most upper respiratory tract infections are of viral origin and are
self-limited, little diagnostic testing or antimicrobial therapy is
warranted, thus reducing the use of resources. Similarly, antibiotics are
not warranted for acute bronchitis.5 (Reference) In contrast, antimicrobial
therapy is usually indicated for pneumonia.
   Chest films--The definition of community-acquired pneumonia includes the
finding of new infiltrates on chest films. However, the prevalence of
pneumonia among adults with respiratory symptoms ranges from only 3% in a
general outpatient setting to 28% in emergency departments.1 (Reference)
Several factors have been found to be predictors of the presence of
pneumonic infiltrates on chest films: temperature higher than 37.7 degrees
C (100 degrees F), pulse rate more than 100 beats per minute, rales,
locally de-creased breath sounds, sputum production, and the absence of
asthma, sore throat, and rhinorrhea. Although these predictors serve as
guidelines, they certainly do not replace clinical judgment.
   We recognize that it is not practical to obtain a chest film in all
situations, but it can be helpful in differentiating conditions that mimic
pneumonia, and the findings may suggest causes or conditions such as
pneumocystic disease, tuberculosis, lung abscess, and pleural fluid.
Elderly patients with pneumonia may present with nonspecific
manifestations, such as a change in mental status, and the threshold for
considering pneumonia and obtaining chest films in such patients must be
lowered. Finally, pulmonary ``infiltrates'' may be falsely interpreted as
acute pneumonia if old chest films are not available to differentiate acute
from chronic changes; this is also a risk in patients with noninflammatory
causes of infiltration (ie, congestive heart failure, atelectasis). Thus,
appropriate evaluation of the chest film relies on accurate clinical
assessment.
   Hospital admission--Once pneumonia is suggested by findings on chest
films, the primary care physician must determine who can be safely treated
as an outpatient and who should be hospitalized. Indications for hospital
admission have been defined by a modified version of the appropriateness
evaluation protocol, a validated instrument used widely by quality
assurance organizations.6 (Reference) The specific indications for hospital
admission and risk factors for death are listed in table 1. Laboratory
studies that help clarify the severity of community-acquired pneumonia
include a hemogram, electrolyte determinations, and pulse oximetry or
measurement of arterial blood gases.

Etiology
   As noted, determining a specific cause of community-acquired pneumonia
has been made more challenging by the growing number of possible pathogens.
Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the leader, but recent reports have
recognized other microorganisms, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella
species, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis and, very recently, sin nombre
virus, which causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.1-4,7 (Reference) Other
known causes include Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, oral
anaerobes (associated with aspiration pneumonia), and viruses (influenza
virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus).
Penicillin-resistant strains of S pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing
strains of H influenzae and M catarrhalis have been isolated with
increasing frequency.
   Although secondary bacterial pneumonia after influenza is most commonly
due to S pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus also needs to be considered.
Gram-negative bacilli should be suspected when the patient is from a
nursing home. Pneumonia due to Pneumocystis carinii and other opportunistic
patho-gens has emerged in the past several years in association with HIV
infection and should be included in the differential diagnosis. In
addition, pulmonary tuberculosis has been increasingly implicated in cases
of community-acquired pneumonia over the past several years and deserves
consideration whenever the cause cannot be readily explained. Table 2 shows
the expanding list of pathogens to be aware of when evaluating
community-acquired pneumonia in either immunocompetent or immunocompromised
patients.
   Several recent studies have determined the relative proportion of
specific causes of community-acquired pneumonia; table 3 shows data from
three such studies3,4,8 (Reference) and distinguishes between pneumonia
treated on an outpatient basis and that treated in a hospital. Traditional
pathogens such as S pneumoniae and H influenzae account for 25% to 40% of
cases. Pneumonia due to Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, or Legionella species (often
referred to as ``atypical'') comprise another 15% to 30% of cases. In table
4, the most common causes are correlated with patient categories that are
based on disease severity and comorbidities.
   In most studies, a specific cause is not found for 30% to 50% of cases
of community-acquired pneumonia. A percentage of such cases may indeed not
be infectious pneumonia. It is well known that other conditions, such as
vasculitis, drug reactions, and pulmonary infarction, may present with
manifestations mimicking infectious pneumonia. Unrecognized pathogens
undoubtedly account for a certain percentage of undefined cases.
   Detailed history taking may be helpful in establishing a diagnosis.
Epidemiologic clues to possible pathogens are listed in table 5. A
controversial issue concerns whether the cause of pneumonia (eg,
pneumococcus versus mycoplasma versus legionella) can be differentiated on
the basis of clinical features. Certain findings are likely to be
associated with specific causes: Acute onset and a single shaking chill
(rigor) are cardinal features of streptococcal pneumonia; markedly elevated
temperature (higher than 39.4 degrees C [103 degrees F]) is more common
with legionella pneumonia; prodromal fever and myalgia followed by
pulmonary edema and hypotension are characteristic of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome; diarrhea is more common with atypical pneumonia; and underlying
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is more often seen with bacterial
pneumonia.3,8 (Reference) In addition, there are reports of associated
asthma in patients who have elevated chlamydial antibody titers.9
(Reference) It is our experience, however, that asthma is unlikely to be
associated with the primary infection, and recent data from others do not
support a significant role for acute C pneumoniae infection in provoking
acute bronchospasm in adults.10,11 (Reference) Despite these clinical
clues, recent studies have shown that clinical findings overlap in cases of
pneumonia caused by different agents, rendering distinction on a clinical
basis unreliable.5,6 (Reference)

Specific diagnostic evaluation
   Once the clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia has been
made, consideration should be given to the microbiologic diagnosis. Such
information can be useful for both prognosis and therapy. Unfortunately,
rapid diagnostic tests are not available for many of the microorganisms,
and initial therapy is usually empirical. However, diagnostic procedures
that provide information on a specific cause within 48 to 72 hours can
still help define continuing therapy.
   Identification of the specific cause relies on isolating the
microorganism or on determining the presence of a specific antigen or
antibody. Table 6 lists the diagnostic tests that we recommend for
evaluation of community-acquired pneumonia. However, it must be
reemphasized that even after extensive studies are done, the pathogen
remains unidentified in 30% to 50% of cases.
   The extent of diagnostic evaluation that is undertaken depends to a
degree on the severity of illness. Patients under age 60 who do not have
underlying disease can often be safely treated without diagnostic tests;
oral antimicrobial agents directed against the pathogens that are most
commonly seen in this group (S pneumoniae, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia
species) can be given.
   Because of the greater potential for serious morbidity (and mortality),
patients who require hospitalization should have diagnostic evaluation. The
difficulty in specifying a cause on clinical grounds and the awareness of
antimicrobial resistance that reduces the predictability of response to any
given antibiotic are additional important reasons to define the pathogen in
these patients.
   Sputum evaluation--Although sputum evaluation may be helpful, often it
is not available. Studies of sputum include both staining procedures and
cultures. The significance and predictability of Gram's stain are
debatable.12 (Reference) Nevertheless, we believe that it can be useful in
diagnosis and therapy when there is a predominance of gram-positive or
gram-negative organisms from an appropriate specimen (ie, one with a large
number of neutrophils and a paucity of squamous epithelial cells). All too
often, however, sputum smears demonstrate only normal oral flora, are of
poor quality, or are unobtainable. Nonetheless, the direct results of a
sputum stain may be helpful in defining some pulmonary infections,
including those caused by mycobacteria.
   Similarly, routine sputum cultures are neither sensitive nor specific.
They often show pathogens that are only colonizing the respiratory tract,
and even in cases of bacteremic pneumonia, the causative pathogen can be
isolated from sputum culture in only 40% to 60% of cases.
   In contrast, recovery from cultures of organisms that are never part of
the respiratory flora may be meaningful; therefore, in appropriate
circumstances, sputum should be cultured for mycobacteria, legionellae, and
fungi. (The physician must be aware that special, selective media are
needed for such organisms and that the laboratory must be advised in these
situations.) Isolation of penicillin-resistant pneumococci and other
antibiotic-resistant microorganisms can also be very meaningful and helpful
in directing subsequent therapy. Culture of M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae is
possible, but it is difficult and requires specialized techniques. Because
of this, most microbiology laboratories are not set up to culture these
organisms, and diagnosis is usually based on serologic tests.
   Blood and pleural fluid cultures--Blood cultures should always be done
when a patient requires hospitalization. Although they are positive in only
about 10% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, diagnosis is specific.
Similarly, cultures of pleural fluid, if it is present, are highly specific
and should be done to rule out complicated parapneumonic fusion or empyema
as well as to establish the cause of community-acquired pneumonia.
   Invasive techniques--More invasive diagnostic techniques, such as
fiberoptic bronchoscopy, can be very sensitive in identifying the pathogen.
Although such techniques are expensive and impractical for routine use,
they should be considered for patients with a fulminant course, those who
require admission to the intensive care unit, and those who are at risk for
opportunistic pathogens or have complex pneumonias that are unresponsive to
antimicrobial therapy.
   Serologic tests--These are usually not helpful in the initial assessment
of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. They can be worthwhile for
epidemiologic purposes when they show a fourfold rise between acute and
convalescent paired specimens. Cold agglutinins may be present in cases of
mycoplasmal infection, but tests are positive in only a minority of cases
and are not specific. IgM antibodies may be present in serum within the
first week of mycoplasmal infection, but the serologic response to
chlamydia and legionella takes longer. The most reliable antibody test for
C pneumoniae is a microimmunofluorescence technique. Complement-fixation
antibody tests are available but are not as specific. In cases of primary
infection due to C pneumoniae, the IgM antibody response may take up to 4
weeks and the IgG antibody response up to 8 weeks to appear. Therefore, the
absence of detectable antibodies (even IgM) several weeks after infection
does not exclude the diagnosis. During reinfection, the IgG antibody level
rises rapidly, whereas the IgM antibody level may not change.
   Results of the acute antibody test for legionella in cases of
legionnaires' disease are usually negative or of low titer because it is
too early in the course of illness to engender a response; thus, a negative
result on an acute antibody test does not exclude this diagnosis.
Unfortunately, we have observed cases of community-acquired pneumonia in
which appropriate therapy was not administered because of misinterpretation
of the ``negative'' acute antibody test. An elevated acute antibody titer
suggests a diagnosis of pneumonia due to Mycoplasma, Legionella, or
Chlamydia species, but it is not definitive. It has been acceptable to
label a case as ``probable'' or ``presumptive'' if the acute titer is
highly elevated (see following section on diagnostic criteria); however, it
is our experience that a single elevated titer (without confirmation by
another test such as culture or antigen detection) often reflects old
rather than acute infection. In a study of legionnaires' disease in Ohio,
we found that an acute antibody titer of more than 1:256 had a positive
predictive value for acute legionnaires' disease of only 15%.13 (Reference)
The percentage of patients with elevated acute titers who had confirmed
legionnaires' disease was not significantly different from that of patients
who did not. Thus, on the basis of our own experience, we believe that
acute-phase serum specimens should be obtained for patients with
community-acquired pneumonia and saved. If the pathogen remains in
question, a convalescent-phase specimen can be obtained and paired studies
performed.
   Rapid diagnostic tests--The urinary antigen test, which has recently
become available in most reference laboratories, has been shown to be very
valuable for rapid identification of legionella. Present techniques test
only for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, but this organism accounts for
about 80% of clinical cases of community-acquired pneumonia due to
legionella. The urinary antigen test is positive in about 80% of cases
within the first days of illness and is highly specific. A negative test
does not exclude legionella pneumonia (particularly if caused by organisms
other than serogroup 1), but a positive test is diagnostic.
   Several rapid diagnostic tests, such as DNA probes or polymerase chain
amplification for evaluation of respiratory secretions or serum, are being
developed (especially for chlamydial, mycoplasmal, and legionella
pneumonia) but are not routinely available at present. Once such tests
become available, they should be extremely helpful in allowing directed
therapy at presentation.
   Diagnostic criteria--The specificity of diagnosis varies with the test
used. For example, a positive blood culture for S pneumoniae is much more
specific than a positive sputum culture without a positive blood culture.
Accordingly, the following would generally be considered as evidence of
definite infection by a specific microorganism:
   1. Blood or pleural fluid yielding a pathogen
   2. A fourfold rise in antibody titer to L pneumophila, M pneumoniae, C
pneumoniae, or other specific pathogen
   3. Isolation of L pneumophila, influenza virus, or Mycobacterium
tuberculosis from respiratory secretions
   4. Positive legionella urinary antigen test
   Isolation of a pathogen from purulent sputum with identification of a
compatible organism on Gram's stain is generally considered to be evidence
of probable cause. Similarly, presence of a single elevated antibody titer
(legionella immunofluorescent antibody titer greater than 1:250 or C
pneumoniae microimmunofluorescent antibody titer greater than 1:512 [IgG]
or 1:16 [IgM]) has been considered evidence for presumptive diagnosis by
several authorities. However, as we have stated previously, it is our
experience that these criteria are often unreliable.
   In conclusion, the physician must consider the usefulness of various
diagnostic tests when formulating an initial plan of management for a
patient with community-acquired pneumonia. While the results of certain
procedures (blood culture or legionella urinary antigen test) are specific,
the results of others (sputum culture and initial serologic tests) are only
presumptive. With the exception of the sputum Gram stain (with its
acknowledged pitfalls), there are no immediately available rapid diagnostic
tests; thus, initial therapy is usually empirical.

Summary
   Characteristic clinical findings of fever, cough, and rhonchi, together
with a new infiltrate on chest films and documentation of a pathogen,
establish a diagnosis of infectious pneumonia. Several factors have had an
impact on the approach to diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia by the
primary care physician. These include the expanding number of possible
pathogens as well as their increasing resistance to antimicrobial therapy.
   Although the clinical presentation may suggest a specific cause,
findings often overlap too much for reliable identification of the specific
agent on clinical grounds alone. Isolation of the micro-organism or
determination of the presence of a specific antigen or antibody is
necessary. However, even after extensive studies are performed, the
pathogen remains unidentified in 30% to 50% of cases. The primary care
physician therefore needs to balance reasonable use of diagnostic tests
with empirical therapy.

PNEUMONIA, A FIVE-ARTICLE SYMPOSIUM: INTRODUCTION

By:
Burke A. Cunha, MD, SYMPOSIUM COORDINATOR

   Pneumonia is one of the most common infectious diseases encountered in
practice. The first step in evaluation should be to determine whether the
patient does, in fact, have pneumonia. Patients usually have a variety of
nonspecific respiratory symptoms, which should be sorted out as originating
in either the upper or lower respiratory tract. Upper respiratory tract
infections (eg, sinusitis, pharyngitis, tracheobronchitis) cause no
pulmonary signs. The presence of pulmonary findings, with or without
symptoms of upper respiratory infection, points to pneumonia.
   Clinical diagnosis of pneumonia rests on auscultatory and chest film
findings. Laboratory findings may be absent very early in the infection and
in the presence of leukopenia or dehydration. Similarly, the lungs are
conspicuously quiet in viral or interstitial pneumonia (eg, viral
influenza).
   Sputum may originate in the bronchi or alveoli, and findings on testing
of such samples are helpful in suggesting pneumonia only if they relate to
the infiltrate or chest film. Testing of a properly collected sputum
specimen from the lower respiratory tract is useful in suggesting the
causative agent in community-acquired pneumonia but is useless in
nosocomial pneumonia. In the right clinical context, a sputum Gram stain is
helpful, but unless it is absolutely diagnostic, initial treatment should
be empirical. Characteristics of sputum may provide diagnostic clues to the
type of community-acquired pneumonia. For example, thin, mucoid sputum
suggests atypical pneumonia, compared with the frankly purulent sputum that
suggests a bacterial process.
   Chest films are key in investigation of community-acquired pneumonia.
They confirm the diagnosis, and specific findings often suggest a
particular organism. For example, pleural effusion, cavitation, and lobar
involvement are helpful findings when interpreted in the proper clinical
context. The behavior of infiltrates over time may be diagnostically
useful. Those that clear rapidly (1 or 2 days) probably are not infectious,
but rapidly progressive asymmetric infiltrates suggest legionella
infection. Infiltrates may be absent if chest films are obtained very early
in the disease process but usually appear within 24 hours after the patient
presents for medical attention.
   Even when an infiltrate is present, the diagnosis of community-acquired
pneumonia may be uncertain. Many conditions mimic pneumonia, and unless the
cause is quickly recognized as noninfectious, needless expense, potential
antibiotic resistance, and delay in proper treatment may result.
   Failure of pneumonia to resolve represents another issue. Delayed
resolution of community-acquired pneumonia is being recognized increasingly
in elderly and immunocompromised patients.
   Because virtually any antibiotic with an appropriate spectrum provides
adequate treatment of pneumonia, the challenge is to find the most
cost-efficient approach and monitor clinical effectiveness. An important
new development, particularly in terms of cost-effectiveness, is the
capability to switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy. For
example, at Winthrop-University Hospital, Mineola, New York, the difference
between intravenous and oral therapy with one particular antibiotic is $74
versus $5.44 per day. The goal is to select an oral antibiotic that is
active against both typical and atypical pathogens, has good
bioavailability and low resistance potential, and is cost-effective.
Unfortunately, relatively few oral agents meet these criteria.
   In patients requiring hospital admission, antibiotic therapy should be
started intravenously and then, if clinically possible, switched after 3
days to an oral form for completion of therapy. Recent studies have shown
that oral therapy is effective in a variety of infectious diseases, even in
very ill patients. Although oral therapy will never be possible in all
patients, the era of oral antibiotic therapy is clearly upon us, not only
because of economic pressures but also because of new knowledge. This
symposium presents an overview of the latest research findings, as well as
practical information gained from the school of clinical experience.

ATYPICAL PNEUMONIA: EXTRAPULMONARY CLUES GUIDE THE WAY TO DIAGNOSIS

By:
Burke A. Cunha, MD
Antonio M. Ortega, MD

Preview
   As the name implies, atypical pneumonia does not follow the usual form.
However, infecting organisms do cause characteristic patterns of organ
involvement, which provide important clues to clinicians. The authors
describe clinical diagnosis of the most common causative organisms of
atypical pneumonia by means of a syndromic approach. They also discuss
which antimicrobial agents have been found to be useful against these
organisms.

   Certain pathogens are typically associated with community-acquired
pneumonia, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococci,
Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and, less
often, Klebsiella species. In patients recovering from viral infection and
occasionally in diabetic patients, Staphylococcus aureus infection is
found.
Community-acquired pneumonia can also be caused by less common pathogens.
These atypical pneumonias are divided into two forms: nonzoonotic (ie, not
transmitted from animals to humans) and zoonotic (transmissible from
animals). Nonzoonotic forms are the more common and are an important
diagnostic consideration in evaluation of community-acquired pneumonia.
   This article presents an overview of the clinical approach to three
nonzoonotic atypical pneumonias: legionnaires' disease (caused by
Legionella species), mycoplasmal pneumonia (caused by Mycoplasma
pneumoniae), and Chlamydia pneumoniae (strain TWAR) pneumonia (table 1).
Although zoonotic pneumonia is not discussed in detail, characteristics of
three forms are summarized in table 2 for use in differential diagnosis:
psittacosis (caused by Chlamydia psittaci), Q fever (caused by Coxiella
burnetii), and tularemia (caused by Francisella tularensis).
   Thorough reviews of both typical and atypical causes of
community-acquired pneumonia are available in the literature.1-4
(Reference)

Diagnostic approach
   Although the microorganisms in atypical pneumonia usually cause
prominent pulmonary manifestations, the illness should be viewed as a
systemic infectious disease with a pulmonary component. Indeed, it is the
extrapulmonary manifestations that are a hallmark, so if a case of
pneumonia is accompanied by otherwise unexplained extrapulmonary signs,
symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities, atypical pneumonia should be
presumed.
   Whether a patient has nonzoonotic or zoonotic atypical pneumonia should
be established if possible. A history of contact with animals or animal
products is usually available to suggest a zoonotic form. If no
epidemiologic associations or diagnostic clues point to a zoonotic atypical
pathogen, the working diagnosis is quickly narrowed to the more common,
nonzoonotic forms.5-8 (Reference)
   Carefully conducted history taking and physical examination should be
completed in an attempt to define organ involvement by the putative
pathogen. All organisms causing atypical pneumonia have a characteristic
pattern of organ involvement that provides clues to diagnosis of these
pneumonias. Key findings include relative bradycardia, upper respiratory
tract involvement, diarrhea, abnormalities in liver function tests,
elevation of cold agglutinin titer, and decreased serum phosphorus level.
Very few findings are in themselves pathognomonic of any disease process;
it is the pattern of occurrence that makes the constellation of findings
diagnostically specific.5-7 (Reference) Thus, a syndromic approach, in
which history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are combined,
is best in establishing a working diagnosis of atypical pneumonia. For
example, assume a patient with community-acquired pneumonia and
extrapulmonary findings has atypical pneumonia. If he or she also has
diarrhea, the diagnosis is clearly limited to legionnaires' disease or
mycoplasmal pneumonia. If the patient has a pulse-temperature deficit (ie,
relative bradycardia), diagnostic possibilities include legionnaires'
disease, psittacosis, or Q fever. Similarly, even a slight unexplainable
abnormality in results of liver function tests in a patient with atypical
pneumonia limits diagnostic possibilities to legionnaires' disease,
psittacosis, or Q fever. Hyponatremia is a common but nonspecific finding,
but the finding of hypophosphatemia points to legionnaires' disease.
   Since legionnaires' disease, mycoplasmal pneumonia, and C pneumoniae
pneumonia are the most often encountered atypical pneumonias, the main
diagnostic thrust should be to identify the pathogens responsible for these
forms. Mycoplasmal infection in normal hosts and C pneumoniae pneumonia in
young adults are rarely fatal, so workup should first focus on identifying
or eliminating legionnaires' disease, which can be fatal if left
untreated.
   Serologic diagnosis of all these atypical pathogens is made on the basis
of a single initial high titer or a fourfold increase between acute and
convalescent titers.

Legionnaires' disease
   Legionnaires' disease may be caused by any of the Legionella species.
The highest incidence is in late summer and early fall, but cases can occur
at any time of the year. Legionnaires' disease is transmitted by
aerosolized droplets of water. For example, outbreaks have occurred in
hospitals as a result of contaminated water sources or nearby excavation or
construction. Although legionnaires' disease is treatable with
tetracyclines and macrolide antibiotics, fatalities still occur in elderly
patients and compromised hosts. Therefore, early presumptive diagnosis is
essential so appropriate treatment can be started as soon as possible.
   Legionnaires' disease presents clinically and radiologically as atypical
pneumonia. Its onset is usually subacute but may be fulminant. Pulmonary
manifestations are not sufficiently different from those caused by other
pulmonary pathogens to permit a specific diagnosis. As noted earlier, the
clinical clues lie in extrapulmonary findings, as they do in other types of
atypical pneumonia.
   Signs and symptoms--Legionnaires' disease is characterized by relative
bradycardia, mental status changes or mild headache, abdominal discomfort
or pain, and diarrhea. The signs and symptoms do not respond to beta-lactam
antibiotics. Ear pain, sore throat, or rash argues strongly against the
diagnosis of legionnaires' disease.
   Chest films--With atypical pneumonia, a specific diagnosis cannot be
made from the appearance on chest films. However, legionnaires' disease
should be suspected in patients who have pneumonia and rapidly progressive
asymmetric infiltrates.5,6 (Reference)
   Laboratory findings--Certain laboratory tests are helpful in making a
presumptive diagnosis of some atypical pneumonias. A slight increase in
serum transaminase levels (without antecedent alcoholic cirrhosis or liver
disease) in a patient presumed to have atypical pneumonia immediately
limits diagnostic possibilities to legionnaires' disease, psittacosis, or Q
fever. Hyponatremia is more common in legionnaires' disease than in other
atypical pneumonias but is not specific for legionella infection.
Hypophosphatemia (except in patients who have other causes of a low serum
phosphorus level) strongly implicates a Legionella species as the infecting
organism in patients with atypical pneumonia.
   Moderate to high elevation of cold agglutinin titers argues strongly
against the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease. (Elevation of these titers
is useful primarily in diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia.)
   Initial serum legionella titers are diagnostically helpful only if
highly elevated (ie, greater than or equal 1:256) in a patient with illness
compatible with legionnaires' disease. The usual situation is that the
physician suspects legionnaires' disease and orders serologic workup, only
to find that initial results are normal. In most patients with
legionnaires' disease, titers are not elevated early in the disease;
therefore, normal levels should not exclude the diagnosis. About 6 to 8
weeks after the onset of disease, titers should be obtained; at this point,
a diagnostic elevation is usually present.
   If a patient with legionella pneumonia has a productive cough and has
not received prior antimicrobial therapy, a diagnosis of legionnaires'
disease may be rapidly confirmed with a direct fluorescent antibody stain
for legionella organisms in the sputum. However, legionella positivity on
this stain decreases rapidly after effective antibiotic therapy has begun.
Some patients do not have effective antibody responses, and antimicrobial
therapy itself may blunt, delay, or eliminate antibody responses so that
there is little or no elevation in legionella titers. Therefore, without a
positive sputum direct fluorescent antibody test for legionella, the
initial working diagnosis must be made on the basis of clinical findings by
using the syndromic approach mentioned.

Mycoplasmal pneumonia
   M pneumoniae infection is one of the most common causes of atypical
pneumonia. This agent and the Legionella species are capable of growth in
cell-free media, which sets them apart from all other causative agents in
atypical pneumonia. Mycoplasmal pneumonia occurs at any time of the year,
although small epidemics during the late fall or winter, coincident with
the school year, are common. This finding is not surprising, given the fact
that transmission of the disease is from person to person via respiratory
droplets.
   Patients with mycoplasmal pneumonia seen in the office probably
represent a small proportion of cases, since most infections are benign and
self-limited. Many patients do not appear to be very ill, despite
abnormalities on chest films. This observation has led to the term
``walking pneumonia'' to describe the illness. On the other hand, patients
may appear very ill yet have only small, wispy infiltrates on chest films.
   Signs and symptoms--Onset of the disease is insidious and follows a 2-
to 3-week incubation period. The most characteristic sign is a dry cough,
which is usually unproductive. Other symptoms include mild headache,
malaise, nonpleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fever (usually between 101
and 102 degrees F [38.3 and 38.8 degrees C]). Patients often report
chilliness, but frank chills are uncommon. Chest pain is uncommon but, if
present, is due to muscle strain from repeated coughing.
   Its subacute onset and the absence of severe myalgias are important
clues distinguishing mycoplasmal pneumonia from viral pneumonia. Diarrhea
is common in mycoplasmal pneumonia, legionnaires' disease, and some of the
adenoviral pneumonias.
   Chest films--Despite the severity of cough, there is usually a paucity
of chest findings and no evidence of consolidation. Chest films usually
show infiltrates in the lung interstitium.
   Physical examination--Extrapulmonary manifestations are different from
and less evident than those of legionnaires' disease. Practically all organ
systems can be involved, since mycoplasmal pneumonia is a systemic
infectious disease.
   Skin manifestations are common and range from maculopapular eruptions to
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which occurs in 5% to 10% of patients. Cardiac
involvement is the next most common extrapulmonary manifestation;
abnormalities may include arrhythmias, conduction defects, and congestive
heart failure. Neurologic complications are uncommon and include
meningoencephalitis and reversible transverse myelitis.
   Laboratory findings--Except for demonstration of elevated cold
agglutinin titers, routine laboratory tests are generally unhelpful in
diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. Cold agglutinins, which also occur in
viral infections, are not specific for mycoplasma, and they are elevated in
less than 75% of patients with the infection. However, the degree of cold
agglutinin response is greatest in mycoplasmal pneumonia; the higher the
titer is above 1:64 in a patient with pneumonia, the more likely the
diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia.
   The agglutinin-dissociation test is a quick bedside procedure for making
this determination. It consists of collecting blood in an oxalated tube and
immersing it, along with a control specimen, in wet ice for 1 to 2 minutes.
Agglutination of erythrocytes (with a negative control) on the side of the
glass tube and their disappearance on rewarming to 98.6 degrees F (37
degrees C) indicate that cold agglutinins are present in a titer of 1:64 or
more. Repeated agglutination on repeated immersion after rewarming
indicates the presence of mycoplasma, since viral cold agglutinins do not
exhibit this agglutination-dissociation behavior.
   The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgG antibodies can
cause much diagnostic confusion. An elevated mycoplasma titer (otherwise
uncharacterized) is invariably an IgG determination. An elevated titer
indicates past exposure rather than active disease, and patients should not
be diagnosed or treated on the basis of this finding. In contrast, an
elevated IgM titer usually indicates active disease, especially when
accompanied by extrapulmonary signs of mycoplasmal pneumonia.6,7
(Reference)

C pneumoniae pneumonia
   C pneumoniae is a common causative agent in respiratory tract diseases;
those seen most often by physicians are pneumonia and severe upper
respiratory tract infection. C pneumoniae pneumonia occurs sporadically but
may also present as outbreaks among college students or military recruits.
Transmission is from person to person via respiratory droplets. Children
are less likely than adults to acquire pneumonia; however, seropositivity
increases after the second decade of life, reflecting subliminal childhood
illness.
   It is important to consider C pneumoniae pneumonia early in the illness,
because macrolide antibiotics are relatively ineffective. The
characteristic presentation of C pneumoniae pneumonia is a mycoplasmal
pneumonia-like illness with laryngitis and failure to improve with use of
erythromycin. Tetracyclines (eg, doxycycline [Doryx, Vibramycin]) are the
preferred therapy for chlamydial pneumonias (eg, C pneumoniae pneumonia,
psittacosis).
   Signs and symptoms--C pneumoniae pneumonia may present in a manner
similar to mycoplasmal pneumonia, except for the frequent finding of
concurrent upper respiratory tract illness (eg, laryngitis). Sinusitis and
pharyngitis sometimes precede the onset of C pneumoniae pneumonia by a few
days to a week. Although pharyngitis and otitis are common findings in
mycoplasmal pneumonia, sinusitis is not. The presence of laryngitis and
hoarseness points to C pneumoniae pneumonia; laryngitis is not a feature of
other atypical pneumonias.
   Chest films--Patchy consolidation or interstitial infiltrates may be
revealed on chest films. Infiltrates are sometimes described as
funnel-shaped and, if present, may be a clue to the diagnosis. In C
pneumoniae pneumonia, unlike in mycoplasmal pneumonia, auscultation of the
chest may reveal evidence of consolidation; however, like in mycoplasmal
pneumonia, pleural effusions are uncommon.
   Laboratory findings--Diagnosis is usually made by serologic testing,
because the organism grows poorly in cell culture media and laboratory
findings are not specific. Primary infection produces a rise in IgM titer
within 2 to 4 weeks of onset of illness and a rise in IgG titer within 6 to
8 weeks. Reinfection may not cause an IgM response, but an IgG increase
occurs earlier than in primary infection. Complement fixation testing is
sensitive but not species-specific. Antibody testing specific for C
pneumoniae, rather than general chlamydial testing, should be requested.9
(Reference)

Therapy
   The main problem for physicians has been to differentiate typical
bacterial from atypical community-acquired pneumonia. The distinction is
particularly important because of therapeutic implications.
   Beta-lactam antibiotics have been used most often for typical
community-acquired pneumonia, and doxycycline or erythromycin is used if
the probable clinical diagnosis is an atypical pneumonia. If a case could
not be established as typical or atypical pneumonia, doxycycline or
erythromycin was added to the beta-lactam regimen.3,7 (Reference)
Monotherapy is highly desirable, since adding a second antibiotic greatly
increases the cost of treatment as well as the risk of side effects and
drug resistance.
   Fluoroquinolones have been suggested as monotherapy for
community-acquired pneumonia. However, some investigators have voiced
reservations regarding coverage against activity of S pneumoniae as well as
Legionella and Mycoplasma species. Ofloxacin (Floxin) is the most active
fluoroquinolone against S pneumoniae and is also effective clinically
against Legionella and Mycoplasma species.10,11 (Reference) In addition, it
is the least expensive fluoroquinolone and is available in both intravenous
and oral forms. For these reasons, at Winthrop-University Hospital,
Mineola, New York, we use ofloxacin as the first-choice fluoroquinolone for
respiratory infection and as monotherapy for typical and atypical
community-acquired pneumonia. Further savings may be possible by switching
from intravenous therapy to oral administration after 3 days.
   Switching from intravenous to oral therapy may also be accomplished with
azithromycin (Zithromax) or doxycycline. Azithromycin has the advantage of
providing 2 weeks' worth of therapy with only 5 days' worth of medication,
because drug levels in blood and tissue are so prolonged. After the initial
loading dose of 500 mg, only a single 25-mg capsule daily for 4 days is
required. It is more expensive than erythromycin but causes fewer
gastrointestinal side effects. However, azithromycin is not yet available
in parenteral form.
   Doxycycline has excellent bioavailability, making it an ideal agent for
transfer from intravenous to oral therapy. It is relatively inexpensive and
is the most cost-effective form of monotherapy for community-acquired
pneumonia. It has a high degree of activity against both typical and
atypical pathogens. If properly diluted, doxycycline is not associated with
phlebitis, and if taken with food, it causes few if any gastrointestinal
side effects.

Summary
   In atypical pneumonia, causative organisms are difficult to isolate, so
careful clinical assessment is essential in arriving at a working
diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis through serologic testing is usually
retrospective. Either a high initial titer or a fourfold or greater rise
between the acute and convalescent titer is considered diagnostic in a
patient with compatible illness. Legionella and mycoplasma organisms may be
cultured from respiratory secretions if plated on appropriate culture
media. Using a syndromic approach, physicians can almost always
differentiate typical from atypical community-acquired pneumonia and narrow
diagnostic possibilities among the atypical pathogens, making possible
institution of early, possibly lifesaving, empirical therapy.

Preview
   Community-acquired pneumonia can now be treated by selecting a single
antibiotic that is active against both typical and atypical pulmonary
pathogens. In the past, it was necessary to use two agents if the type of
pathogen could not be determined. In this article, Dr Cunha discusses his
approach to management using cost-effective monotherapy that can be started
intravenously and then switched to the oral route.

   Community-acquired pneumonia is a frequent problem in the ambulatory and
hospital setting. The common respiratory pathogens are usually responsible
(see box on page 110).1-4 (Reference)

Factors in antibiotic selection
   The main difficulty presented by community-acquired pneumonia is
selection of a cost-effective antibiotic regimen.5-7 (Reference) Today, in
the managed care era, cost-effectiveness is second only to antibiotic
efficacy as a consideration in the selection process. A corollary implied
by the concept of cost-effective treatment is that intravenous therapy must
be switched to oral therapy as soon as possible to maximize cost savings in
hospital patients.
   The most important factor in the empirical selection of an antibiotic is
proven effectiveness in vivo. The antibiotic should readily penetrate
bronchopulmonary secretions and be pharmacologically active at the site of
infection. Virtually all antibiotics used for pulmonary infections show
good penetration of the lungs. Aminoglycosides, for example, concentrate
well in the lung but are less active at the site of infection, where there
is local hypoxia, acidosis, and white blood cell debris.
   The antibiotic chosen should have an appropriate spectrum of activity.
Optimal coverage should be provided for the usual respiratory pathogens,
but unnecessary coverage of every possible pulmonary pathogen should be
avoided. The expensive and potentially harmful practice of ``adding
coverage'' results from an underappreciation of the potential for pathogen
resistance. The wasteful custom of adding antibiotics for unneeded
``gram-negative'' coverage also has important implications in the
development of resistant organisms in an institution, particularly in
intensive care areas.
   If the proper antibiotic monotherapy has been selected, there is no need
to add anything.5-9 (Reference) For example, doxycycline may be chosen for
initial empirical monotherapy. This agent is active against all relevant
gram-negative pulmonary pathogens, such as ampicillin-sensitive and
ampicillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella
(Branhamella) catarrhalis, and oral anaerobes (eg, Bacteroides
melaninogenicus). Doxycycline is also effective against
penicillin-resistant and penicillin-sensitive strains of Streptococcus
pneumoniae as well as all atypical organisms (Chlamydia pneumoniae,
Mycoplasma and Legionella species).10 (Reference) The only gram-negative
organism not covered by doxycycline is klebsiella, which is uncommon as a
cause of pneumonia in the general population. If this organism is suspected
clinically, another agent, such as a fluoroquinolone or a cephalosporin,
should be selected5,7,9 (Reference) (table 1).
   When typical and atypical organisms cannot be differentiated, clinicians
often elect to protect against both by using double-drug coverage. Although
coinfection is rare, a few patients have both pulmonary and extrapulmonary
findings, and double coverage is reasonable in these cases. Fortunately,
with the advent of intravenous-to-oral ``switch'' therapy (see the later
discussion), double coverage, which is not cost-effective, is almost never
necessary if the right single agent (ie, doxycycline, ofloxacin [Floxin],
or azithromycin [Zithromax]) is selected. These three antibiotics are
effective against all of the common typical and atypical pathogens that
cause community-acquired pneumonia. Prescribing a second antibiotic for
additional gram-negative coverage is expensive and unnecessary.
   Although a number of factors are very important prognostically, they
have no bearing on selection of an antibiotic for community-acquired
pneumonia.3,7 (Reference) (The author acknowledges that this is at variance
with the American Thoracic Society's approach.) These factors include age
of the patient, severity of illness, host defense status, potential for
beta-lactamase-producing organisms, and site of infection acquisition
(table 2). For example, pneumococcal infection is treated the same way in
young as in old adults, even though there are differences in prognosis.
Similarly, community-acquired pneumonia in a non-leukopenic cancer patient
is caused by the same pathogens as in a normal host and needs the same
coverage.

Choosing an oral antibiotic
   Because most beta-lactam agents are active against the usual pathogens,
there are many parenteral antibiotics for treating community-acquired
pneumonia. The choice among oral antibiotics, however, is restricted. Oral
penicillin, for example, is ineffective against ampicillin-resistant H
influenzae, penicillin-resistant pneumococci, Klebsiella species, M
catarrhalis, and all of the atypical pathogens. Its other disadvantages
include poor oral absorption and only moderate bioavailability, not to
mention the inconvenience of dosing four times a day. Amoxicillin (Amoxil,
Wymox) is given three times a day and has good bioavailability, but it
lacks activity against H influenzae, M catarrhalis, and all atypical
pathogens. Newer oral cephalosporins may be given less frequently and have
enhanced activity against H influenzae, but they are more costly and miss
atypical pathogens. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) (Bactrim,
Cotrim, Septra) is an ideal oral antibiotic unless the patient is allergic
to sulfa drugs, but it is suboptimal for community-acquired pneumonia
because of its lack of anti-klebsiella and antistreptococcal activity. The
commonly used erythromycin has limited activity against streptococci, H
influenzae, M catarrhalis, and Klebsiella species and is also an
unsatisfactory choice because of poor bioavailability, short half-life, and
gastrointestinal side effects. It is active against most atypical
pathogens. Penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae often is also
erythromycin-resistant.
   While many antibiotics have been used successfully to treat
community-acquired pneumonias, the three best antibiotics in terms of
spectrum, bioavailability, safety profile, and cost are ofloxacin,
doxycycline, and azithromycin (table 3). These antibiotics permit optimal
monotherapy of community-acquired pneumonias, which has tremendous
cost-saving implications.7 (Reference)
   Because community-acquired pneumonia caused by atypical pathogens has
clinically distinguishable features, specific rather than empirical therapy
is possible. For example, group A streptococcal pneumonia is characterized
by a large pleural effusion in addition to infiltrates; Staphylococcus
aureus pneumonia rapidly cavitates in 1 to 2 days; and klebsiella
pneumonia, which is usually in the upper lobe, cavitates after 3 to 5 days.
In these circumstances, an antistaphylococcal cephalosporin would be
recommended as the initial antibiotic selection.4,5 (Reference)

Inpatient versus outpatient therapy
   Traditionally, hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia is based
on how ill the patient is as well as on the need for intravenous therapy.
As intravenous-to-oral switch therapy and oral therapy alone become more
widely accepted, the rationale for intravenous therapy diminishes.
Critically ill patients requiring ventilatory support will always need
hospitalization. These patients are likely to be given intravenous therapy
initially and then switched to oral therapy as soon as possible.
   When it is generally realized that antibiotics with excellent
bioavailability are equally effective intravenously or orally, oral therapy
will become the standard of care. Third-party payers also need to recognize
that oral antibiotic therapy in the hospital saves money and that the cost
should be reimbursed.7,11,12 (Reference)

Intravenous-to-oral switch therapy
   Without compromising clinical effectiveness, oral antibiotics that are
well absorbed achieve essentially the same blood and tissue levels as such
intravenous drugs as fluoroquinolones, doxycycline, clindamycin (Cleocin),
and chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin). Only a few antibiotics that have an
appropriate spectrum for community-acquired pneumonias are available for
both intravenous and oral use. Ofloxacin is unique among fluoroquinolones
in being most active against Chlamydia species and, like other
fluoroquinolones, is also effective against Legionella and Mycoplasma
species.11 (Reference)
   The therapeutic approach we use at Winthrop-University Hospital,
Mineola, New York, is outlined in table 4. We begin intravenous therapy
with ofloxacin, 400 mg every 12 hours, and after 72 hours switch to oral
ofloxacin therapy, 400 mg every 12 hours. Patients who are unable to take
medications orally or who improve slowly may need intravenous therapy for
more than 3 days.
   Doxycycline and azithromycin are also ideal agents for empirical
monotherapy of community-acquired pneumonias and are most cost-effective
when given as part of an intravenous-to-oral switch program. Ofloxacin is
our preferred respiratory fluoroquinolone because of its high degree of
activity against S pneumoniae and, as was mentioned, Chlamydia, Legionella,
and Mycoplasma species. Furthermore, it is the least expensive
fluoroquinolone currently available.12 (Reference)
Theoretically, ofloxacin eliminates bacteria in a concentration-dependent
fashion and works optimally as a single 800-mg daily dose.* Recently, it
has been shown that oral administration of 400 mg of ofloxacin once daily
is as effective as and less expensive than 500 mg of ciprofloxacin (Cipro)
twice daily for moderate to severe infections, including community-acquired
pneumonia.12 (Reference)

Determining costs
   As noted, the most effective cost-cutting measure in managing
community-acquired pneumonia is making a change from intravenous to oral
antibiotic therapy as soon as clinically possible. For example, TMP-SMZ
costs $72 a day when given intravenously but only $0.75 a day orally.
Similarly, ciprofloxacin costs $74 a day intravenously and $5.68 a day
orally (table 5).
   Determining the true cost of antibiotic therapy to an institution is
complex, and it is not simply based on an accounting of pharmacy
acquisition costs. Hidden expenses include the administrative costs per
dose, cost of side effects, cost of monitoring antibiotic therapy, and cost
of measures to control outbreaks by resistant organisms. The total cost of
antibiotic therapy, therefore, is the sum of the charges for all these
factors.5-8 (Reference)

Summary
   At present, three antibiotics (doxycycline, ofloxacin [Floxin], and
azithromycin [Zithromax]) provide optimal therapy for both typical and
atypical community-acquired pneumonias. These agents permit a
monotherapeutic approach and are also ideal for intravenous-to-oral switch
therapy, which results in great cost savings for an institution and an
earlier discharge for the patient.
   The era of oral therapy has been ushered in because of economic
imperatives. Fortunately, bioavailability of these three antibiotics is
essentially the same when administered intravenously or orally. Moderately
to severely ill patients may be safely and effectively treated via the oral
route alone; however, most patients who require admission to the hospital
are initially given intravenous therapy, after which a change is made to an
oral antibiotic equivalent as soon as possible.13 (Reference)

Which pathogens are the culprits in community-acquired pneumonia?
   Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of
community-acquired pneumonias, but Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella
(Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Mycoplasma and Legionella species are
important also. Community-acquired pneumonias due to Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Staphylococcus aureus, and group A streptococcus are seen less frequently
and are usually associated with specific population subgroups. For example,
S aureus pneumonia occurs almost entirely in diabetic patients or in those
who have had viral influenza. Similarly, community-acquired pneumonias due
to K pneumoniae are seen primarily in alcoholics and, less commonly, in
nursing home patients.

DELAYED RESOLUTION OF PNEUMONIA: WHEN IS SLOW HEALING TOO SLOW?

By:
Hugh Cassiere, MD
John C. Rodrigues, MD
Alan M. Fein, MD

Preview
   Some cases of pneumonia can be expected to respond slowly to treatment.
For example, resolution of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia in an
85-year-old patient who smokes and has heart disease, diabetes, and
multilobar infiltrates is much more likely to be prolonged than is
mycoplasmal pneumonia in a 25-year-old, healthy, nonsmoking patient with a
unilobar infiltrate. The authors describe risk factors for and causes of
delayed resolution and present a workup strategy for cases that do not
respond within expected time limits.

   Community-acquired pneumonia is seen often by primary care physicians in
their daily practice, but in as many as half of cases, the causative
pathogen remains unidentified even after extensive initial diagnostic
testing. Recently published guidelines of the American Thoracic Society1
(Reference) recommend a more limited initial workup than has been used
traditionally and empirical antibiotic therapy aimed at the most common and
probable pathogens in a given patient. Although this approach is likely to
prove cost-effective, it might not work in all situations. When it is used,
clinical response must be diligently evaluated so patients who are
responding slowly or not at all are identified promptly.

When is resolution considered delayed?
   Most often, pneumonia responds to antibiotic therapy, with patients
experiencing gradual resolution of symptoms (eg, cough, sputum production,
fever, shortness of breath). However, in some cases pneumonia resolves more
slowly than expected or fails to resolve. The length of time that is
considered normal for resolution is estimated on the basis of the natural
history of the common pneumonias. In evaluating resolution, two fairly
distinct parameters are used: symptomatic improvement and radiologic
clearing of infiltrates.
   Symptom resolution--If a patient's condition is responding appropriately
to therapy, improvement in clinical findings is usually noted within 48 to
72 hours.1 (Reference)Thus, if fever or leukocytosis, for example,
persists for 48 to 96 hours, resolution of the pneumonia may be considered
delayed. Empirical therapy, chosen on the basis of symptoms, should not be
changed until 72 hours have passed unless clinical deterioration is
identified. Clinical deterioration may result from treatment failure or one
of many possible causes, discussed later.
   Radiologic resolution--In most infectious processes, radiologic
resolution lags behind symptomatic improvement. In general, patients who
have some response to therapy but persistent symptoms or radiologic
abnormalities beyond the expected limits of resolution are considered to
have slowly resolving pneumonia. For example, Kirtland and Winterbauer2
(Reference) defined slowly resolving pneumonia as symptomatic improvement
but less than 50% radiologic clearing after 4 weeks of therapy.
Nonresolving pneumonia shows little or no clinical improvement or
radiologic clearing after 4 weeks.
   Radiologic deterioration during therapy for community-acquired pneumonia
is common. However, a change in antibiotic coverage or initiation of an
extensive diagnostic workup is not necessary unless clinical deterioration
is also present.

Which coexisting conditions affect resolution of pneumonia?
   When delayed resolution of pneumonia has been established, the first
step in management is to determine whether certain medical conditions
coexist. Conditions shown in table 1 can cause myriad host- defense defects
that impair the body's response to infection.
   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and alcohol abuse are the
most common contributing factors in delayed resolution of pneumonia.
Alcohol's effects on host defenses are complex because coexisting factors,
such as malnutrition, can impair immune function on their own.

What causes delayed resolution of pneumonia?
   When pneumonia caused by a common pathogen fails to respond to therapy,
likely explanations include impaired host response, bacterial resistance
(eg, penicillinase-producing organisms), and inadequate empirical coverage
(eg, staphylococcal pneumonia). Nonresolving pneumonia may also be caused
by an uncommon or resistant pathogen, a noninfectious condition, or a
complication (table 2).
   Common pathogens--The nature of the host response plays a significant
role in resolution of pneumonia; normal resolution is often prolonged in
patients with significant coexisting conditions (eg, diabetes, COPD)
(figure 1).
   For example, in pneumococcal pneumonia (the most common type of
community-acquired pneumonia), half of patients have clear chest
radiographs at 5 weeks; most cases resolve in 8 to 12 weeks. However, the
resolution process is prolonged in bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia. By 9
weeks, only half of patients have clear chest radiographs, and most cases
are not resolved until 18 weeks have passed. In the study by Jay and
associates,3 (Reference) 60% of patients with bacteremic pneumococcal
pneumonia and coexisting disease still had abnormalities on chest x-ray
films more than 3 months after initiation of therapy. Resolution was even
more prolonged in patients over age 55 who had COPD and alcoholism.
   Mittl and colleagues4 (Reference) found that radiologic clearing of
community-acquired pneumonia was influenced most by age and the number of
lobes involved: Clearing decreased by 20% per decade, and multilobar
involvement cleared more slowly than unilobar involvement.
   Uncommon pathogens--Infection with an uncommon pathogen, such as a
species of Nocardia or Actinomyces, may cause nonresolving pneumonia. In
one study on nonresolving pneumonia, eight patients using long-term
corticosteroid therapy for COPD were found to have opportunistic fungal
infections.5 (Reference) Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with lavage or
transbroncheal biopsy is useful in ruling out such pathogens.
   Noninfectious causes--Conditions that mimic pneumonia but are actually
noninfectious may produce slowly resolving or nonresolving infiltrates.
Some, such as bronchogenic carcinoma (figure 2), may be found during the
diagnostic workup, and others, such as Wegener's granulomatosis (figure 3),
may require open lung biopsy for diagnosis. Congestive heart failure can
produce signs that mimic pneumonia.
   Pulmonary complications--Such complications of pneumonia as abscess,
empyema, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary vascular congestion may delay
resolution of pneumonia. Computed tomography of the chest is helpful in
evaluating patients for these complications.

What is known about the natural history of pneumonia?
   Legionella infection has the longest resolution process of all the
community-acquired pneumonias. Its course is severe and rapidly progressive
and often ends in residual scarring and fibrosis. Its incidence is doubled
in patients who require mechanical ventilation. Macfarlane and associates6
(Reference) noted that only half of patients who have Legionella infection
have radiographic resolution at 10 weeks, and in some, 12 to 20 weeks are
required.
   Mycoplasmal infection is at the other end of the resolution spectrum.
Considered to have the shortest process, mycoplasmal pneumonia usually
resolves completely in 2 to 4 weeks. Residual scarring and fibrosis are
rare.6 (Reference)
   To a large extent, resolution processes of other pathogens that may
result in community-acquired pneumonia are unknown or poorly characterized.
Among these pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, enteric gram-negative
bacilli, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia species, Moraxella (Branhamella)
catarrhalis, and certain viruses. Extensive and detailed discussions are
available elsewhere.7,8 (Reference)

How should workup be decided?
   The unfortunate clinical reality is that the causative pathogen remains
unknown in many cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Thus, natural
history patterns are often unhelpful, and all pneumonias end up being
lumped together in the workup process. However, with use of a diagnostic
strategy such as that shown in figure 4, busy physicians can identify and
categorize patients who need further workup and consultation.
   In patients with significant coexisting disease, host-defense impairment
can delay the normal resolution process. Therefore, an early goal is to
differentiate impaired host responses from other causes of slowly resolving
and nonresolving infiltrates. Infiltrates that fail to clear at all over a
4-week period of observation or that take more than 12 weeks to resolve
require further workup. In such cases, uncommon pathogens and noninfectious
mimicking diseases must be ruled out.

Is there a typical presentation?
   At our institution (Winthrop-University Hospital, Mineola, New York),
nonresolving pneumonia accounted for 15% of all pulmonary consultations and
10% of all diagnostic bronchoscopies over a recent 2-year period. About 60%
of patients had community-acquired pneumonia that was slow to resolve
because of an impaired host response. About 20% had infection with an
uncommon pathogen (tuberculosis, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia,
actinomycosis, or cytomegalovirus) and 20% had a noninfectious cause
(Wegener's granulomatosis, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing
pneumonia, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, or pulmonary infiltration
eosinophilia).9 (Reference) In our experience, a typical patient with
delayed resolution is an elderly man who has had symptoms for a month or
more before being referred for bronchoscopy.

Summary and conclusion
   Slowly resolving or nonresolving pneumonia is a clinical challenge, but
we believe it can be dealt with in a rational and decisive manner. The
following risk factors have been established for delayed radiographic
resolution of pneumonia and should be considered in patient evaluation:
Coexisting medical conditions
History of smoking
Advanced age
Multilobar involvement
Persistent fever or leukocytosis
Diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, and alcohol
abuse can impair immune function, which slows normal clearing of
infiltrates. Common and uncommon infectious agents, conditions that mimic
pneumonia (eg, a neoplasm, congestive heart failure), and pulmonary
complications (eg, abscess) can also result in delayed resolution.

RADIOGRAPHIC MIMICS OF PNEUMONIA: PULMONARY DISORDERS TO CONSIDER IN
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

By:
Lorie J. Cabreros, MD

Preview
   Pinpointing the source of roentgenographic lung abnormalities can be
challenging because many noninfectious pulmonary disorders mimic pneumonia.
The authors of this article discuss the most common radiographic
presentations of lung disorders that may be mistaken for pneumonia,
including focal and diffuse infiltrates, nodules, cavities, and pleural
effusion. They also outline the role of thorough history taking and
examination in prompt and accurate diagnosis of pulmonary disorders.

   Many organisms can cause serious pneumonias. Early suspicion and prompt
diagnosis and management are essential to minimize morbidity and reduce
mortality. Clinicians often prescribe antibiotics empirically on the basis
of various clinical, radiographic, and laboratory signs of infection (table
1). The choice of antibiotics is influenced by the patient's age, the
presence of comorbid factors, the need for hospital admission, and the
severity of illness. In most patients whose symptoms resolve with
antibiotics, a causative organism is not identified on culture, though
clinical improvement suggests an infectious cause.
   Various noninfectious pulmonary disorders can mimic infectious
pneumonia. When such a disorder is present but is not considered at the
time antibiotics are prescribed, the true source of symptoms and
radiographic abnormalities may remain elusive. Thus, even when infectious
pneumonia is strongly suspected, the possibility of a noninfectious
disorder should always be considered at the time a chest radiograph is
obtained.
   With AIDS more than with any other disease, roentgenographic
abnormalities are thought to signify infection. Radiographic patterns
typical of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia often prompt initiation of
antiprotozoal therapy, with or without corticosteroids. Clinical and
roentgenographic evidence of improvement usually indicates successful
therapy; lack of such improvement raises suspicion of another infection,
usually one caused by an opportunistic organism. ``Drug failures'' and
autopsy findings have made it clear, however, that AIDS patients are prone
to numerous noninfectious pulmonary complications that mimic pneumonia
radiographically, including idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis and
lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (table 2).
   Awareness of the most common radiographic presentations of noninfectious
pulmonary diseases--focal and diffuse infiltrates, nodules, cavities, and
pleural effusion--might lead to a better outcome for all patients with
pulmonary ailments.

Focal infiltrates
   Localized infiltrates are the most commonly recognized roentgenographic
pattern in infectious pneumonia, so it is not surprising that noninfectious
pulmonary disorders that cause a similar pattern are sometimes overlooked.
Clinical signs and symptoms of these noninfectious lung ailments also may
be identical to those of infectious pneumonia. In these circumstances, the
key to correct diagnosis is an accurate history. For example, a history of
smoking in a patient with fever, cough, and radiographic evidence of a
focal infiltrate should raise suspicion of bronchogenic carcinoma. Alveolar
carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma may present in this way, with or
without postobstructive infection.
   Noninfectious pulmonary disorders are commonly missed in patients with
congestive heart failure and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. Consider, for example, a patient with cough, shortness of breath,
and a focal infiltrate who is hospitalized and treated with antibiotics for
presumed infection and an increase in diuretic dose. The next day, the
patient feels remarkably better and a chest radiograph demonstrates
clearing of the infiltrate. In such a case, the likely source of the
infiltrate is asymmetric pulmonary edema, not infection. With certain types
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the parenchyma of the lung is
greatly disturbed, resulting in widespread perfusion abnormalities. When
congestive heart failure occurs, edema develops principally in regions
where perfusion is maximized because of ventilation inequalities. The area
where the infiltrate occurs has the best ventilation-perfusion match. This
relationship is compromised by edema that occurs with heart failure, which
leads to cough and shortness of breath.

Diffuse infiltrates
   Many noninfectious disorders are known to cause diffuse pulmonary
infiltrates. Thorough history taking is essential to identify these
diseases early in their course. This is especially true in occupational and
drug-induced lung disease; knowledge of illicit drugs ingested,
particularly poisons, is critical to a good outcome. A misdiagnosis of
infectious pneumonia could obviously delay the benefit of appropriate
treatment, such as an antidote or even lung transplantation, which would be
required for accidental paraquat (herbicide) ingestion.
   Most noninfectious pulmonary disorders responsible for bilateral
infiltrates do not have a known cause and consequently pose a diagnostic
challenge. Diffuse parenchymal disorders are most often mistaken for
infectious disease. Many such disorders are progressive, so prompt
diagnosis and treatment are important. The collagen vascular disorders may
present with fever, productive cough, and marked shortness of breath. They
are usually suspected in patients with a history of either systemic lupus
erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. However, these diseases can present
initially with pulmonary manifestations, which can be a diagnostic
challenge.
   Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a final common pathway for many forms
of severe lung injury and is often overlooked in differential diagnosis of
bilateral diffuse infiltrates. Although its pathogenesis is unknown,
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may be, in part, immunologic in origin,
resulting from a complex series of cellular and biochemical events.
Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents may help to control the
disease process, as is true with many noninfectious pulmonary disorders of
unknown cause that produce bilateral infiltrates. Early diagnosis (usually
by open lung biopsy) is imperative to exclude infectious and malignant
disorders.
   A noninfectious pulmonary disorder that is gaining attention in the
literature is bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP). It
has been linked to connective-tissue disease, drug therapy, organ and
marrow transplantation, infection, and toxic fume inhalation. However, it
may occur without known parenchymal insults. Masses of granulation tissue
form in the lumina of small airways and in alveolar ducts, and organizing
pneumonia occurs distal to these obstructions. Figure 1 shows diffuse
infiltrates on the chest radiograph of a 36-year-old woman with BOOP and
lymphomatoid granulomatosis, which were diagnosed on open lung biopsy.
Specific chemotherapy was administered, and dramatic radiographic clearing
of the infiltrates occurred.
   Vasculitic disorders, such as Wegener's granulomatosis and Churg-Strauss
syndrome, are often mistaken for infectious respiratory diseases.
Confluence of infiltrates on chest radiographs in both alveolar and
interstitial patterns may be observed. Fever, cough, and productive sputum
are often present. Open lung biopsy is required for diagnosis.

Pulmonary nodules
   Far more noninfectious than infectious pulmonary disorders cause diffuse
pulmonary nodules, which range in diameter from about 1 mm to 5 mm. Some
experts classify lesions smaller than 3 cm as nodules and those 3 cm or
larger as masses. Radiographically, nodules appear simply as patchy
consolidation, but careful analysis of the periphery of the lung--where
there is less superimposition of abnormalities--should allow assessment of
the nodular character. Table 3 lists, according to their location on chest
radiographs, noninfectious pulmonary disorders that may present with
multiple pulmonary nodules.
   Noninfectious diseases that have been known to cause nodular development
include allergic alveolitis and sarcoidosis and vasculitic processes, such
as Wegener's granulomatosis. Sarcoidosis and vasculitic disorders may be
particularly elusive early in their course. Extrapulmonary manifestations,
supported by serologic evidence of angiotensin-converting enzyme and
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, may suggest the diagnosis. Lung
biopsy is necessary for confirmation.
   Allergic alveolitis is a hypersensitivity reaction that affects the
parenchyma of the lung. Causative agents are usually organic but may be
reactive inorganic compounds. An increasing number of occupational,
avocational, and even iatrogenic environments are responsible for this
noninfectious disorder. Signs and symptoms resemble those of common
bacterial pneumonia, but a striking preponderance of complaints comes from
patients who are exposed to the offending antigen (eg, dusts, molds) in the
workplace. Flexible bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy reveal
noncaseating granulomas. Cortico-steroids are the treatment of choice.
Ideally, the source of the antigen should be identified, and the patient
should be removed from the offending environment.

Pulmonary cavities
   Parenchymal cavities may be fluid-filled or thick-walled (figure 2) or
possess an air-fluid level (figure 3). Presence of a parenchymal cavity, no
matter what the cause, implies necrosis and tissue breakdown. Cavitary
disease occurs most often with infection, but a number of noninfectious
pulmonary disorders may be overlooked in initial diagnosis.
   When an air-fluid level is not visible in a cavity, a noninfectious
cause should be considered. A history of smoking should raise suspicion of
a bronchogenic carcinoma (eg, squamous cell carcinoma), and if multiple
cavities are present, metastatic cancer from a distant primary site (eg,
head, neck, cervix) should be considered. Wegener's granulomatosis often
presents with multiple cavitary lung nodules. Also, occupational exposure
to coal (pneumoconiosis) by patients with rheumatoid lung disease may
result in Caplan's syndrome and large cavitary nodules. Finally, upper-lobe
cavitary disease in a patient with risk factors for pulmonary
thromboembolism should raise suspicion of pulmonary infarction.

Pleural effusions
   Most pleural effusions occur with a noninfectious disease process.
Nonspecific symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, and pleuritic
pain, arise from inflammation of the pleura, compromise of pulmonary
mechanics, or interference with gas exchange. They should prompt
consideration of noninfectious disorders in differential diagnosis.
   Metastatic disease of the pleura is the most common noninfectious cause
of pleural effusions. Carcinoma of the lung and breast and lymphoma account
for about 75% of pleural effusions related to malignant processes. Rarely,
a neoplastic lesion causes occlusion of a large airway, prompting
development of postobstructive infectious pneumonia. Analysis of pleural
fluid obtained by thoracentesis may demonstrate a high percentage of
polymorphonuclear cells, organisms on Gram's stain, or bacterial growth on
culture. Infection may coexist and go unrecognized.
   Collagen vascular diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus
and rheumatoid arthritis, are notorious for their inflammatory nature and
ability to cause exudative pleural effusions. When there is also evidence
of a parenchymal infiltrate, an infectious cause is most often initially
considered. Thoracentesis should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of a
collagen vascular disease (eg, an extremely low glucose level and a low pH,
as found in rheumatoid arthritis) and rule out an associated infection.
   Adverse reactions to drugs produce only a small percentage of all
pleural effusions. A level of suspicion is required so that the offending
medication can be identified and discontinued. Hydralazine hydrochloride
(Apresoline), procainamide hydrochloride (Pronestyl), isoniazid (Nydrazid),
and phenytoin sodium (Dilantin) have been linked to lupuslike symptoms,
including pleuritis. Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin), methysergide maleate
(Sansert), and methotrexate (Folex, Rheumatrex Dose Pack) may cause
accumulation of pleural fluid and minimal nonspecific signs and symptoms.

Conclusion
   The appearance of any abnormality on a chest radiograph calls for a
complete differential diagnosis, no matter how straightforward a diagnosis
may seem. Noninfectious pulmonary disorders are the most common sources of
radiographic abnormalities. Prompt recognition and timely, appropriate
treatment are essential to minimize morbidity. Because signs and symptoms
of pulmonary disorders are usually nonspecific, a complete history and
thorough physical examination are the best tools for identifying and
managing noninfectious pulmonary disorders.

ANOREXIA NERVOSA AND BULIMIA NERVOSA: WHEN THE PURSUIT OF BODILY
`PERFECTION' BECOMES A KILLER

By:
Kathryn J. Zerbe, MD

Preview
   The stereotypical picture of an anorexic or bulimic patient as a driven
young woman is no longer valid, if it ever was. The diseases may be
manifest in an athlete who insists on training despite injury, or in a
painfully thin grandmother who thinks she's holding onto her youthful
figure. Most of those affected are too obsessed with their appearance, as
they see it, to realize the medical damage being done. Dr Zerbe describes
behavioral clues to eating disorders and the role of primary care
physicians in intervention.

   Anorexia nervosa and its cousin bulimia nervosa are on the rise in
Western industrial societies and now afflict about 1.2 million young women
in the United States. The morbidity and mortality associated with these
diseases are high; anorexia alone carries a mortality rate of 18% to 20%.
Although lethality in an index year may be 1%, anorexia is often a chronic
condition and the probability of death increases over time.1,2 (Reference)
The death rate for bulimia may be equally high, although, since bulimia was
first described as a syndrome in 1979, long-term studies are only now being
carried out. Both disorders are devastating medically, socially, and
psychologically.

Diagnostic considerations
   A wasted, cachectic appearance is the obvious signifier of anorexia.
Typically, female patients note the lack of menstrual periods for at least
several months. Patients usually place undue emphasis on their appearance
and body image. While others observe that patients look like victims of
starvation, patients insist that they are fat. They may exercise to the
point of exhaustion and diet incessantly to get thinner and thinner. They
talk constantly about food, being fat, and losing weight (table 1) and may
alienate loved ones and health professionals with their relentless pursuit
of bodily ``perfection.'' Their psychological obsession with weight is the
most reliable historical guideline in helping rule out other medical causes
of cachexia, such as cancer, infection (eg, AIDS), or hyperthyroidism.
   Making the diagnosis of bulimia is trickier. Patients can be
underweight, normal weight, or overweight and still engage in binge eating
and purging, and they often keep bulimic symptoms secret. To fulfill
diagnostic criteria of bulimia, patients must eat excessively with an
accompanying sense of loss of control and attempt to compensate with such
measures as vomiting, excessive exercise, and misuse of laxatives to
prevent weight gain (table 2).
   Also preoccupied with weight, appearance, and body image, bulimic
patients may seek out physicians for ``help with their diet'' or for
medications to help them lose weight. Even when physicians have a high
index of suspicion and ask patients if they are bingeing or are purging by
vomiting, laxative or diuretic abuse, or misuse of insulin or thyroid
medication, patients may not tell the truth. Bulimic behaviors occur on a
continuum, from a few times a month to several times a day. Studies suggest
that as many as 17% of college-aged women engage in bulimic behaviors.3,4
(Reference)
   No single cause has been found for either anorexia or bulimia. The
spectrum of symptoms is generally conceded to result from an amalgam of
emotional, physical, sociologic, and family factors, and recent analyses
support the hypothesis that in some cases they may be genetically based.5
(Reference) From a clinical perspective, it is wise to stress to patients
and their families that these disorders represent a common end point of
some type of emotional turmoil. Because eating disorders are often
accompanied by depression, anxiety disorders (especially
obsessive-compulsive traits), and personality disorders, diagnosis and
treatment may be complex. The presence of comorbid conditions significantly
impacts prognosis and must be recognized for treatment to be effective.

Special populations
   Once believed to be afflictions of female adolescents and young adults,
eating disorders are increasingly seen in both sexes over the course of the
entire life cycle. In addition, they are now being found more often than
they were in earlier decades, in special populations, and in all
socioeconomic and cultural groups.
   Infants and children--Like adults who have gotten the media message that
a thin body is desirable in women and a muscular build is desirable in men,
young children have been influenced by the sociologic shift toward
overvaluing appearance as a measure of personal worth. Eating disorders are
being seen at a growing rate in young children.6-8 (Reference)
   Sometimes failure among infants to gain weight and to thrive is called
``infantile anorexia nervosa,'' but the roots of this problem are
distinctly different from the obsessive emphasis on thinness and the
disordered body image of children, adolescents, and adults with anorexia.
Common contributors to this condition are a rift in the parents'
relationship with each other or psychological difficulties of a parent.
Occasionally, an infant or child loses weight or refuses food after an
incident of choking or a painful diagnostic procedure (eg, suctioning).
   In childhood anorexia, a common and important cause is unwitting
introduction of disturbed attitudes about food by mothers who themselves
have an eating disorder or are preoccupied with weight and appearance.
Sometimes, parents insist that children be placed on a diet or even
withhold food during the years of most rapid growth. Occasionally, parents
request diet pills for chubby youngsters, unaware that increasing activity
and establishing appropriate eating habits are the best tools to prevent
later obesity. These parents must be instructed about the potential of
inducing eating disorders in their children.
   Males--One in every ten patients with an eating disorder is male. Young
men who participate in seasonal sports that specify a particular weight
(eg, wrestling) or that stress appearance and body build (eg, running,
skating) are at special risk. In addition, physicians should be aware of
the increased incidence of eating disorders in the male homosexual
population,9 (Reference) which may be first noted by excessive exercise and
relentless attempts to maintain a slender physique.
   Some research suggests that male patients with eating disorders have a
high incidence of substance abuse. This behavior appears to be part of an
impulse-control problem, in which alcohol, drugs, and food are misused to
calm emotional storms.
   Athletes--Young women and men who participate in dance, gymnastics,
running, rowing, or other sports that emphasize thinness and appearance are
at special risk for anorexia and bulimia. Coaches or teammates may note
progressive weight loss in an athlete or may report the smell of vomitus in
the locker room. Athletes may confide that their sport is their life and
that they feel driven to achieve at any cost.10 (Reference) Primary care
physicians can help athletes, coaches, and parents see the potential for
disaster if this fixation with an athletic identity persists despite
negative consequences.
   Some people use a high level of physical activity in an almost medicinal
way to combat depression (through endorphin ``highs''). Many anorexic
patients misuse exercise; they expend enormous amounts of energy by staying
in almost constant motion (eg, fidgeting, running in place). Often they can
be stopped from doing so only by admission to the hospital for continuous
bed rest and observation. Thus, compulsive exercise may accompany a bona
fide eating disorder or be analogous to it. Such ``activity disorders'' may
account for the addiction to exercise that some patients experience; for
example, they exercise excessively despite exhaustion, multiple injuries,
and warnings from physicians and coaches to stop.10 (Reference)
   older women--Eating disorders are not uncommonly seen in women in their
fourth through eighth decades.11 (Reference) Some women have harbored a
distorted body image since youth but could bring themselves to seek out
treatment only at mid life, when daughters, nieces, or granddaughters were
recognized to also have an eating disorder. More often, women begin to
experience long-term physical side effects of the eating disorder (table 3)
and recognize the negative influence it has had on their social and work
lives. Often, they have kept their eating problems a secret for years and
confess their struggles to their physician with much guilt and shame.
   In the elderly, anorexia must be differentiated from major depression
with melancholia. Depressed patients may have the delusional belief that
food is poisonous. Somatic delusions about the body (eg, ``I cannot eat
because I do not possess a stomach'') arise when primary depression has not
been adequately diagnosed or treated. In contrast, elderly anorexic
patients may be preoccupied with losses sustained during their lifetime or
a need to maintain a youthful figure as long as possible. Treatment methods
for elderly, delusional, depressed patients range from carefully regulated
antidepressant and antipsychotic medications to electroconvulsive therapy.
The latter treatment is particularly effective in elderly patients who are
medically compromised and imminently suicidal. Response of older anorexic
patients to psychotherapeutic intervention is best after nutritional
difficulties have been corrected.

Sexual abuse
   Recent studies suggest that a significant number of patients with eating
disorders have a past or present history of physical and sexual abuse.12,13
(Reference) Eating disorders in adolescents or young adults should prompt a
suspicion that normal intergenerational boundaries in the home may have
been breached. Traditionally, fathers, grandfathers, and uncles have been
suspected as the perpetrators of violence leading to eating disorders.
However, recent studies suggest that maternal incest may be a
little-recognized factor.
   Women who have been the victims of rape may attempt to cope with the
trauma by restricting their eating or purging after a meal. These women
often feel significant shame about what has happened to them and are more
likely to turn to their primary care physician than to a mental health
provider for support and understanding.

Medical complications
   Medical complications of anorexia and bulimia can affect all of the body
systems (table 3).
   In patients with anorexia, physical examination often reveals
bradycardia, hypotension with systolic blood pressure as low as 70 mm Hg,
and electrocardiographic abnormalities. Replenishing circulatory volume in
the feeding process can precipitate congestive heart failure. Anorexic
patients have an increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias and mitral
valve prolapse. Death occurring after long-term anorexia is likely to have
a cardiac cause and may be sudden and unexpected.14 (Reference)
   In patients with bulimia, cardiac and electrolyte disturbances secondary
to vomiting or to laxative or enema abuse are common. Most authorities
stress that serum magnesium and potassium levels be routinely monitored in
bulimic patients12 (Reference); however, sudden death has occurred even
after cardiac status and electrolyte levels have been routinely monitored
and found to be normal.
   The most common medical complications of bulimia are parotid gland
hypertrophy, dental caries, and erosion of tooth enamel. Enamel can become
eroded from the acidic effects of gastric contents in only a few months of
vomiting. Patients who cannot refrain from purging may be urged to rinse
the mouth with a neutralizing agent, such as sodium bicarbonate or tap
water. In addition, bulimia can lead to esophageal or gastric rupture.
Excessive laxative use may damage the mesenteric plexus of the intestinal
wall and cause persistent loss of bowel activity. Chronic pancreatitis,
although rare, has also resulted from bulimia.

Treatment considerations
   Most important, patients must be educated that their eating disorder has
significant medical complications. Before underlying psychological issues
can be tackled, patients need to be stabilized medically. For a significant
minority of patients, hospitalization is necessary, and because the eating
disorder may be so entrenched, a psychiatrist or psychologist must be
consulted.3 (Reference)
No pharmacologic agent has been found to be a panacea for either anorexia
or bulimia.15-17 (Reference) Some recent studies suggest that fluoxetine
hydrochloride (Prozac) in daily doses of 60 mg lessens the number of binge
episodes and the dysphoria accompanying bulimia. Fluoxetine has had
ameliorative effects in some patients with anorexia; however, it has also
been associated with weight loss in some.
   All anorexic or bulimic patients need psychotherapy to reverse their
entrenched ideas and distorted body image and to achieve other life goals.
Cognitive behavioral interventions and interpersonal therapies have both
been found to be helpful.18 (Reference) Patients should be taught ways to
prevent relapse, such as minimizing exposure to high-risk foods and
developing appropriate additional supportive methods. Other highly
effective techniques involve helping patients challenge negative beliefs
about body size and shape, examine and restructure thoughts about food, and
acquire assertiveness and social skills. Aiding them in developing an
eating pattern that focuses on regular balanced meals, particularly in an
interpersonal or group setting, may also be beneficial.19 (Reference)
Patients learn to replace with companionship the comfort they had received
from food, and they find role models in other people who eat normally
without preoccupation over every morsel, calorie, or new diet technique.
   Studies show that with psychotherapeutic help, as many as 75% of
patients with eating disorders improve significantly over time. Thus, it is
important for physicians to assume a firm, directive approach and to help
patients see the short- and long-term consequences of their disordered
eating. Using food diaries, seeking nutritional counseling, and planning
meals at least a day in advance help counter abnormal eating
behaviors.20,21 (Reference)
   In the case of severe anorexia, enteral or parenteral nutritional
intervention may be necessary. Although such intervention may help patients
temporarily increase their weight so therapy can proceed, it is not without
medical and psychological risks. Some patients react vehemently to having
control taken away, even though they may be near death. Thus, it is
advisable to seek consultation with an eating-disorder specialist in a
tertiary setting, enlist family support whenever possible, and be prepared
to advise temporary commitment for patients in acute jeopardy. After
several weeks, when the starvation state is ameliorated and the nutritional
status normalized, patients become more receptive to psychological work.
Therapy must be paced to enlist patients' strength and motivation in
building an identity less reliant on appearance as the source of
self-esteem and competence.

Summary
   Eating disorders probably result from a combination of emotional,
physical, and sociologic factors and are encouraged by a society that
values appearance as a measure of worth. Once believed to be a problem
largely among young women, the disorders are being found increasingly among
children, young athletes, men, and elderly women.
   Often accompanied by depression, anxiety, and personality disorders,
eating disorders may be difficult to diagnose. Patients with anorexia
nervosa often deny that they have a problem, despite obvious physical
signs. Patients with bulimia nervosa may hide their bingeing and purging
and have no overt signs. Primary care physicians may be the first to
suspect potential problems, including a patient's fixation on food, weight,
dieting, physique, and exercise. Sometimes, patients who have struggled in
silence for years turn to their trusted physician for support and
understanding. The first step in treatment is to address the medical
complications caused by the unhealthy eating habits. Once nutritional
health has been restored, patients need to reverse their entrenched and
distorted body-image ideas through psychotherapy.

TREATING PRURITUS: WHAT'S NEW IN SAFE RELIEF OF SYMPTOMS?

By:
Larry E. Millikan, MD

Preview
   Have you ever had poison ivy or another intensely pruritic condition? If
so, you can probably sympathize with sufferers' common cry: ``It's driving
me crazy!'' Unfortunately, few pharmacologic agents have proven to be
routinely effective for pruritus. This article provides an overview of
current therapeutic strategies, including use of a new topical agent.

   Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of pruritus are always
necessary, but prompt relief of pruritus itself is also important.
Discomfort can be considerable. Patients scratch in an effort to relieve
pruritus, but ironically, this may contribute to skin damage, inflammation,
and recurrence. Interruption of the destructive itch-scratch cycle is a
primary goal in treatment of pruritus.

Pruritic conditions
   Pruritus is a common symptom of many dermatologic disorders and several
systemic diseases.1 (Reference) Table 1 summarizes important diagnostic
considerations.
   Xerosis--By far, the most common cause of pruritus without rash is
xerosis, or winter itch. This condition is characterized by moderate to
severe itching of dry, cracked, scaly skin, most often on the lower legs.
Bathing too often, old age, and high temperatures with low humidity can be
causative factors.
   Infestations, bites, infections--Many patients experience moderate to
severe itching during such infestations as scabies or seabather's eruption
(caused by jellyfish larvae) or after insect or other bites (figure 1).
Although these conditions are self-limiting or amenable to pharmacologic
intervention, some form of antipruritic therapy is usually employed for
symptomatic relief.
   Viral exanthems (eg, varicella), superficial fungal infections, and
occasionally even cutaneous bacterial infections (eg, hot-tub folliculitus)
can cause great discomfort. Again, treatment of the underlying condition is
crucial, but from the patient's standpoint, so is relief of symptoms.
   Neurogenic disorders--Notalgia paresthetica may cause prickling,
burning, and pruritic sensations in the region supplied by the lumbar
nerves.
   Inflammatory disorders--Intense, unrelenting pruritus is the hallmark of
several chronic cutaneous inflammatory disorders, ranging from atopic
dermatitis to urticaria (figure 2). Historically, the terms ``eczema,''
``dermatitis,'' and ``eczematous dermatitis'' have been used to describe
the final common expression of various conditions, such as contact
dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, lichen simplex chronicus, nummular eczema,
and dyshidrotic eczema.2 (Reference) Other commonly encountered pruritic
inflammatory skin diseases include lichen planus, nodular prurigo, and
dermatitis herpetiformis. Patients with psoriasis may also be troubled by
pruritus.
   From the patient's perspective, the intensity of the pruritus determines
how severe he or she considers the dermatitis to be. Often, pruritic
dermatitis elicits repetitive scratching, which leads to excoriations
followed by opportunistic infections, hyperkeratotic skin changes, and
lichenification.1-3 (Reference)
   Contact dermatitis--Accounting for up to 40% of all occupational
illnesses,3 (Reference) contact dermatitis consists of two types: irritant
and allergic. Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by a direct toxic
effect on the skin. Implicated substances include cosmetics, industrial
chemicals, cleansers, and lubricants. Allergic contact dermatitis results
from a type IV hypersensitivity reaction to substances found in plants (eg,
poison ivy), rubber, wool, nickel, or topically applied drugs (eg,
``caine''-type anesthetics).
   Atopic dermatitis--Up to 5% of children under age 7 experience atopic
dermatitis (figure 3), and more than 90% outgrow the disease by
adolescence. The etiology of this condition is unknown. There is an
apparent genetic predisposition that can be exacerbated by such external
factors as food allergy, irritating clothing, dry air, and emotional
stress. Patients tend to have a personal or family history of asthma,
seasonal or perennial rhinitis, and various allergies.
   Pruritus is the most distressing and prominent symptom of atopic
dermatitis. Many physicians feel that pruritus may be the primary or
initiating event in a flare-up of atopic dermatitis and that rubbing and
scratching damage the skin and induce inflammatory lesions. Acute flare-ups
are generally followed by long quiescent periods. In infants, atopic
dermatitis manifests as intensely pruritic lesions on the head and extensor
areas. In older children and adults, the flexural folds are more often
affected4 (Reference) (figure 4).
   Lichen simplex chronicus--In this localized disorder, repeated
scratching leads to a patch of chronic dermatitis that subsequently becomes
lichenified and takes on a thickened, barklike appearance (figure 5). The
patches of lichenified skin are intensely pruritic, leading to perpetuation
of the itch-scratch cycle.
   Lichen simplex chronicus seems to be precipitated by stress, depression,
and frustration. Some patients have a history of emotional or psychiatric
problems, but most often, the condition begins simply as a nervous habit.
   Nummular eczema--The elderly are most often affected by this form of
eczematous dermatitis. Lesions appear as coin-shaped eczematous plaques,
and pruritus is the primary symptom.
   Dyshidrotic eczema--This condition can be acute or chronic and is
characterized by sudden onset of pruritic vesicles followed by scaling,
fissures, and lichenification.3 (Reference) Dyshidrotic eczema most often
affects the hands (figure 6) and feet.
   Systemic disorders--Several chronic conditions may be characterized by
localized or generalized pruritus, including renal failure, cholecystitis,
cholestasis, diabetes mellitus, mastocytosis, hyperthyroidism,
hypothyroidism, polycythemia vera, iron deficiency, and malignant tumors.
Pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to pruritus in these conditions are
ill-defined.1 (Reference)
miscellaneous disorders--Anogenital pruritus (eg, pruritus ani, scroti, and
vulvae) is a relatively common condition that is difficult to treat.
Pruritic patches of lichenified skin are self-perpetuating and may be
secondary to irritant dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, or infection.5
(Reference) Senile pruritus and aquagenic pruritus are idiopathic
conditions. Drug-induced eruptions can also result in bothersome pruritus.

Treatment methods
   Treatment of pruritus is directed at interruption of the destructive
itch-scratch cycle, control of the underlying condition, and relief of
cutaneous inflammation, if present (table 2). The most often prescribed
treatments for pruritus are oral antihistamines and topical
corticosteroids.
   Nonpharmacologic--Although some patients respond to nonpharmacologic
measures (eg, trimming the nails, using cool-water compresses, avoiding
irritants, behavior therapy), pharmacologic intervention is usually
required.
   Localized--Ultraviolet B phototherapy is effective in a wide variety of
pruritic conditions, although it is not very practical for most patients
and physicians.1,6 (Reference) In some situations, intralesional injections
of corticosteroids are useful.
   Systemic--Several classes of orally administered drugs can be effective
in relieving pruritus.
   Antihistamines--Histamine1 (H (subscript) 1) antagonists, such as
diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl) and hydroxyzine, are occasionally
beneficial against pruritus. However, this is an untargeted pharmacologic
approach; histamine receptors are blocked in both the central nervous
system and the periphery. As a result, somnolence is a common side effect
with antihistamines and can restrict their daytime use. To minimize these
effects, physicians routinely prescribe low-dose therapy, and whether this
provides adequate cutaneous histamine-receptor blockade to produce
localized antipruritic effects is questionable.
   Second-generation, nonsedating antihistamines (terfenadine [Seldane],
astemizole [Hismanal], loratadine [Claritin]) circumvent many of the
central nervous system effects associated with traditional antihistamines,
but studies of their use for pruritus have yielded inconsistent results.7
(Reference) Additionally, terfenadine and astemizole can cause serious
toxicity when given with certain macrolide antibiotics (eg, erythromycin)
and imidazole antifungals (eg, ketoconazole [Nizoral]). Ironically, this
finding has led some to suggest that success with the older agents may be
attributable to their sedative effects rather than to their peripheral
antihistamine properties.
   Corticosteroids--Corticosteroids (eg, prednisone, dexamethasone
[Decadron, Hexadrol]) are used only as a last resort or for temporary
control of a flare. Side effects preclude more extensive use.
   Topical--Several years ago, topical H (subscript) 1-receptor antagonists
were in widespread use. However, the discovery that the compounds were
associated with a high incidence of contact sensitization and
cross-reactivity has all but eliminated their use in dermatology.1,2
(Reference) Several of these agents (topical ``caine''-type anesthetics and
topical antihistamines) are still available, but their use should be
avoided. Several topical agents that are safer and more effective are now
available.
   Corticosteroids--Local application of low- to medium-potency
corticosteroids (eg, hydrocortisone, triamcinolone acetonide [Aristocort,
Flutex, Kenalog]) may be effective in moderately severe cases of
dermatitis. High-potency topical corticosteroids can be used for a short
period for more severe conditions. However, the antipruritic activity of
corticosteroids is secondary to their anti-inflammatory and
immunosuppressive properties. Even topical corticosteroid therapy can cause
undesirable local and systemic effects.
   In spite of cautions regarding skin atrophy and hypothalamic pituitary
axis suppression, some physicians continue to overuse and misuse topical
corticosteroids for many self-limiting disorders. Many physicians are
inclined, in an effort to provide rapid relief of pruritus, to prescribe
high-potency corticosteroids for conditions that normally respond to
lower-potency analogues. For treatment of pruritic dermatoses, an
antipruritic agent should be combined with the lowest-potency
corticosteroid that controls inflammation. This combination of agents often
provides quick symptomatic relief while maintaining a relatively high
margin of safety.
   Pramoxine formulations--Pramoxine hydrochloride (Itch-X, PrameGel,
Tronothane HCl) is a topical agent that seems to have an important role in
controlling mild to moderate pruritus, although frequent application is
usually required. Pramoxine is often combined with other agents (eg,
menthol, petrolatum, benzyl alcohol) to heighten effectiveness of the
formulation.
   Tricyclic compounds--These agents administered orally, in particular
doxepin hydrochloride (Adapin, Sinequan) and amitriptyline hydrochloride
(Elavil, Endep), have proven to have antipruritic properties in a variety
of conditions, notably chronic urticaria. The exact pharmacologic action
responsible for this effect is unknown but may be, in part, related to
their potent antagonistic properties at histamine-receptor sites. As with H
(subscript) 1 antihistamines, sedation may be problematic, however.
Tricyclic compounds are unique in their ability to block both histamine H
(subscript) 1 and H (subscript) 2 receptors. Doxepin's affinity for H
(subscript) 1 and H (subscript) 2 receptors exceeds that of other tricyclic
compounds and histamine-receptor antagonists, such as hydroxyzine and
diphenhydramine (which block H (subscript) 1 receptors) and cimetidine
(Tagamet) (which blocks H (subscript) 2 receptors).7-9 (Reference) Other
antipruritic mechanisms of doxepin may include antagonism of alpha
adrenoceptors and muscarinic and serotonin receptors (5-HT (subscript) 2
subtype), inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin neuronal reuptake, and
inhibition of the production of platelet-activating factor.7-13 (Reference)
In addition, orally administered doxepin decreases histamine-induced wheal
reactions.
   Unfortunately, orally administered tricyclic compounds are dose-limited
and poorly tolerated because of their anticholinergic and central nervous
system effects.14 (Reference) Therefore, topical application, which targets
the affected site and causes minimal side effects, is attractive. Solutions
of doxepin and amitriptyline have been shown experimentally to be effective
antipruritic agents.15 (Reference) Recently, 5% doxepin cream (Zonalon) was
introduced for treatment of pruritus. It differs from many other topical
antipruritics in that it has a low potential for sensitization reactions.
In addition, although some systemic absorption can occur, clinical
experience has shown that it is much better tolerated than the oral form of
doxepin.
   In two major clinical trials involving more than 500 patients with
moderate to severe pruritus secondary to eczematous dermatitis, those
treated with doxepin cream (as monotherapy) experienced rapid and
significant relief. Doxepin cream appeared to be equally effective for
atopic dermatitis, lichen simplex chronicus, contact dermatitis, and
nummular eczema.16 (Reference) In a preliminary report,17 (Reference)
doxepin cream was found to be an effective adjuvant to topical
corticosteroids. The only side effects reported were mild, temporary
drowsiness (for 1 to 2 days) and transient, local irritation at the site of
application.
   The possible roles of doxepin cream in treatment algorithms for pruritus
are numerous (table 2). In acute or self-limiting conditions, the agent
could be used instead of a corticosteroid to provide rapid relief as well
as safe and targeted treatment. In chronic conditions, concomitant use of
doxepin cream and topical corticosteroids could have a steroid-sparing
effect by allowing for the use of low-potency corticosteroids or shorter
treatment courses.
   Adjunctive--Emollients are sometimes used as monotherapy in mild
pruritus or as an adjunct in more severe cases. Tar compounds (eg, carbonis
detergens solutions, coal tar emulsions) can be efficacious when used along
with topical corticosteroids but are aesthetically objectionable.

Summary
   In several cutaneous disorders, pruritus is both the primary symptom and
the cause or perpetuating factor. Therefore, one focus of therapy should be
on treating pruritus and thereby preventing or aiding in the resolution of
skin lesions. Several treatment options are available, including
nonpharmacologic methods; use of emollients, tar preparations, and other
topical agents; ultraviolet B therapy; and use of oral antihistamines or
corticosteroids. A new topical tricyclic agent is now available that adds a
promising therapeutic approach.

THE MECHANISMS OF PRURITUS

   Biopsies of eczematous lesions in patients with chronic dermatitis
reveal increased density of nerve fibers and mast cells compared with
normal skin.1,2 (Reference) Studies have also found increased density of
nerve fibers in lichenified skin.3 (Reference) These alterations indicate a
significant primary or compensatory role of mast cells together with C
fibers in the pathophysiology of pruritus caused by dermatitis.
   Pruritic sensations arise from stimulation of nerve endings in the
dermoepidermal junction. They are transmitted as electrical impulses to the
central nervous system along unmyelinated C fibers (figure 1). When C
fibers are stimulated, they release substance P and other putative
neurotransmitters (calcitonin gene-related peptide, somatostatin,
neurokinins, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and glutamate) into synaptic
junctions at the spinal cord and into the extracellular milieu from
peripheral collateral nerve terminals.4,5 (Reference)
   C fibers often terminate in the skin close to cutaneous mast cells,
which contain potentially pruritic mediators, including histamine. Under
basal conditions, histamine is stored in granules within mast cells; its
release can be caused by various immunologic or nonimmunologic stimuli.
After release, histamine acts on H (subscript) 1 and H (subscript) 2
receptors in the skin to stimulate sensory nerve C fibers, cause cutaneous
vasodilation, and increase vascular permeability. These activities produce
pruritus accompanied by erythema and edema.4,5 (Reference)
   Other possible endogenous pruritic mediators are numerous. In general,
these substances can be considered (1) mast cell constituents, (2)
compounds causing pruritus secondary to mast cell stimulation and release
of histamine and other mediators that activate C fibers, or (3) compounds
that directly stimulate C fibers.

ACUTE BRONCHITIS

   Bronchitis is inflammation of the air passages (called the bronchial
tubes or the bronchi) that lead from the windpipe to the lungs. Acute
bronchitis comes on suddenly and lasts a short time. Another type, called
chronic bronchitis, lingers and often gets worse as years go by.

What causes acute bronchitis?
   Very often, what begins as a cold or influenza turns into bronchitis
when the virus spreads to the bronchial tubes. Sometimes the virus
responsible for a childhood disease, such as measles or whooping cough,
causes acute bronchitis at the same time or after the childhood disease has
passed. People whose lungs are already irritated, such as those who smoke,
breathe in a lot of pollution or dust, or have lung disease, are especially
susceptible to bronchitis.

What are the symptoms?
   Persistent coughing that brings up plentiful amounts of phlegm is
probably the most typical symptom. Inflammation makes the bronchial tubes
secrete sticky mucus, which your body tries to get rid of through coughing.
Since this sticky substance blocks the normal flow of air, you may have
trouble getting your breath or you may wheeze (make a whistling sound) when
you breathe. Pain behind your breastbone or in your back, especially when
you cough, is common. So is congestion in your chest and a mild fever.

Do I need to visit a doctor?
   Most times, acute bronchitis takes care of itself in a week or so.
Though it may get tiresome, coughing is nature's way of clearing the
secretions from your lungs, so try not to use cough medicine. If you feel
that you must (for example, to get some sleep), choose an expectorant,
which is a type of medicine that helps loosen the mucus from the bronchial
walls. Drinking lots of fluids thins the mucus and makes it less sticky so
it is easier to cough up.
Keeping the bronchial tubes moist by running a humidifier or taking steamy
showers may help you breathe more easily, and acetaminophen or aspirin
reduces fever.
   Most people start feeling better after following these measures for 3 or
4 days. If you do not improve or if you have a temperature of more than 101
degrees F, blood in the phlegm, or serious trouble breathing, see your
doctor.
If you have repeated attacks of acute bronchitis, mention them to your
doctor. They may lead to chronic bronchitis if not treated.

THE NEED FOR URGENT MANAGEMENT

By:
Joseph Varon, MD Robert E. Fromm Jr, MD, MPH

Preview
   Because hypertension is a common disorder in the United States, primary
care physicians may well see cases of hypertensive crisis. Patients may
present to the office or clinic as well as to the emergency department. In
this article, the authors emphasize the necessity of prompt recognition and
management of severe acute hypertension to limit end-organ damage.

   An estimated 60 million people in the United States have hypertension,
which is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disability and death.1
(Reference) The high prevalence of the condition makes it of great concern
to primary care physicians, who on occasion can expect to see cases of
hypertensive crisis.
   Fortunately, the incidence of hypertensive crises has decreased since
the 1940s, when hypertension was not considered a disease of major clinical
consequence. Indeed, it was viewed by many as an ``essential element'' to
force blood through sclerotic arteries to end-organs. The introduction of
effective pharmacologic treatment in the late 1940s decreased morbidity and
mortality associated with hypertension, and as a result it is currently
estimated that less than 1% of Americans with the condition are likely to
have hypertensive crises.2 (Reference)
   Recognition and management of hypertensive crises may be a challenge to
even the most astute clinician. Unlike the chronic risks conferred by
hypertension, these crises have the potential to be acutely
life-threatening,3,4 (Reference) and inadequate treatment increases both
morbidity and mortality.5 (Reference)

Definitions
   A myriad of terms have been applied to acute elevations in blood
pressure. Unfortunately, definitions have not always been uniform, and the
same clinical presentation may be included under more than one descriptive
heading. The following common definitions are provided to clarify our
subsequent discussions on recognition and management of patients with acute
elevations of blood pressure.
   Hypertensive crises. Situations resulting from elevated blood pressure
that are potentially life-threatening or organ-threatening
   Hypertensive emergencies. Clinical situations in which blood pressure
should be lowered within 1 hour to avoid serious end-organ damage
   Hypertensive urgencies. Elevations of blood pressure that can usually be
treated with antihypertensive agents to reduce pressure within 24 hours of
presentation
   Malignant hypertension. A syndrome characterized by elevated blood
pressure accompanied by encephalopathy or nephropathy or by papilledema
and/or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.4 (Reference) The term
``accelerated hypertension'' has been used to describe acute elevations of
blood pressure with hemorrhages or exudates on funduscopy. These syndromes
do not connote different clinical features or prognoses, and thus the term
``malignant-accelerated hypertension'' has been used.

Causes
   Common causes of hypertensive crises are shown in table 1. Most patients
who present with hypertensive crises have essential hypertension. In these
patients, the most common cause for acute elevation of blood pressure is
withdrawal from an antihypertensive drug (eg, clonidine).1-3 (Reference)

Diagnosis
   Hypertensive crisis is not defined by a specific blood pressure reading;
rather it is a clinical syndrome of end-organ disease that is associated
with acute elevations of blood pressure.5,6 (Reference) As is the case with
many other conditions in clinical practice, the diagnosis depends on the
results of history taking, physical examination, and laboratory testing.
After these initial evaluations, patients can be categorized into those
with hypertensive emergencies, those with hypertensive urgencies, and those
without evidence of end-organ damage.
   History taking--The primary focus of history taking in patients with
hypertensive crises is assessment of end-organ dysfunction (table 2). The
physician should obtain historical information on neurologic,
cardiovascular, and renal symptoms. Specific manifestations, such as
headaches, seizures, chest pain, dyspnea, and edema, should be ascertained.
In addition, a history of antihypertensive drug use and withdrawal should
be elicited, because as previously mentioned, abrupt discontinuation of
antihypertensive medications is one of the most common causes of
hypertensive crises.1,6 (Reference)
   Other medication use should also be examined. Prescription and
nonprescription drugs, including sympathomimetic or anticholinergic agents
(eg, decongestants, antidepressants) may produce acute elevations of blood
pressure. Previous and current drug abuse should also be noted; agents such
as amphetamines and cocaine may precipitate hypertensive crises. Some
herbal preparations may also elevate blood pressure.
   Physical examination--As in patients with any other critical illness,
physical examination starts with evaluation of the airway, breathing, and
circulation (ABCs) and is followed by assessment of mental status and level
of consciousness.6 (Reference) Blood pressure is measured in both arms with
a cuff of appropriate size. A standard sphygmomanometer should be used to
verify blood pressure levels in patients with readings outside normal
range. Automatic blood pressure recording devices may be inaccurate and
should not be routinely used when hypertensive crises are suspected.6
   All patients with elevated blood pressure should have a funduscopic
examination to detect papilledema, hemorrhages, or exudates. A careful
cardiovascular examination should be followed by complete neurologic
assessment to identify focal symptoms and signs.
   Laboratory studies--These are guided by the results of history taking
and physical examination. A complete blood cell count, measurement of
electrolytes and blood urea nitrogen, and urinalysis should be considered.
In addition, an electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and computed
tomographic scan of the head are obtained in selected patients with
evidence of chest pain, shortness of breath, or neurologic changes. It must
be emphasized that in many instances these tests are performed
simultaneously with the initiation of antihypertensive therapy.

Principles of management
   In the successful management of patients with hypertensive crises,
primum non nocere should be the rule. The initial goal of antihypertensive
therapy is not to achieve a normal blood pressure, but rather to gradually
decrease the mean arterial pressure to minimize the risk of hypoperfusion,
particularly in cerebral, coronary, and renal vascular beds.7 (Reference)
   Patients who present with hypertensive emergencies should be considered
critically ill and treated in an intensive care environment.6,8 (Reference)
They are placed at bed rest, and intravenous access is established for
administration of medication and fluid. Continuous blood pressure
monitoring, electrocardiographic readings, and frequent assessments of
neurologic status are routine. Continuous blood pressure monitoring is
achieved by placing intra-arterial lines. When properly applied, this
technique provides the most accurate and most frequently updated blood
pressure information.6,9 (Reference) We recommend intra-arterial line
placement in all patients who receive fast-acting, potent vasodilators (eg,
sodium nitroprusside).
   A reasonable approach for most patients with hypertensive emergencies is
to lower the mean arterial pressure by 25% over the initial 2 to 4 hours.1
(Reference) Some investigators recommend decreasing the diastolic blood
pressure to no less than 100 to 110 mm Hg because of the potential for
cerebral and coronary hypoperfusion.2,6 (Reference)

Specific agents
   A number of pharmacologic agents are available in the United States for
the management of hypertensive crises. As mentioned before, the appropriate
therapeutic approach depends on the form and clinical presentation. We
generally recommend short-acting parenteral agents for patients with
hypertensive crises (table 3).
   Sodium nitroprusside--Still one of the most commonly used agents for
hypertensive crises, especially in patients with documented severe,
long-standing chronic hypertension,10 (Reference) sodium nitroprusside
(Nitropress) stimulates the formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate and
relaxes vascular smooth muscle. The drug is very potent, and cerebral blood
flow may decrease in a dose-dependent manner. Onset of action is within
seconds, with a duration of 1 to 2 minutes and a plasma half-life of 3 to 4
minutes.11 (Reference) Blood pressure may rise abruptly when the drug is
stopped. Sodium nitroprusside is light-sensitive, and the infusion
reservoir should be covered.
   One of the main concerns in using sodium nitroprusside in clinical
practice is that it metabolizes into cyanogen and thiocyanate. Therefore,
in patients with acute or chronic renal failure, cyanide poisoning may
occur after prolonged administration. In most cases, toxic effects occur
after several days of infusion but may be seen within the first 24 hours of
high-dose administration (infusion rates higher than 2 mcg/kg per minute).
   Calcium-channel blockers--These agents have been used worldwide in the
treatment of acute hypertension.12 (Reference)
Nifedipine--Administration of 10 mg of nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia) every
5 minutes has been suggested by some investigators as an adequate form of
therapy in patients with hypertensive crises.1,3,4 (Reference) It is
important to mention that nifedipine is not absorbed through the buccal
mucosa and that patients should bite and swallow the medication rather than
use it sublingually.13 (Reference) Nifedipine causes arteriolar
vasodilatation and rapidly reduces systemic vascular resistance. Onset of
action is within 15 minutes of oral administration, and maximum effect
occurs at 30 minutes. A major word of caution: Administration of nifedipine
may precipitate ischemic events by sudden reduction in blood pressure.14
(Reference) In our experience, particular caution should be exercised in
patients with preexisting coronary artery disease.
   Nicardipine hydrochloride--An intravenous form of nicardipine (Cardene
I.V.) has been approved for treatment of acute severe hypertension in the
United States. This agent is a dihydropyridine derivative that differs from
nifedipine by addition of a tertiary amine structure in the ester side
chain. Because this makes nicardipine 100 times more water-soluble than
nifedipine, it can be administered intravenously.15 (Reference) In a recent
paper, Halpern and associates16 (Reference) reported on a multicenter,
prospective, randomized trial comparing the effect of this agent with that
of sodium nitroprusside in patients with severe postoperative hypertension.
They found nicardipine to be as effective as sodium nitroprusside.
   Nicardipine offers some unique advantages in the emergency treatment of
hypertensive crises. For example, it has been shown to reduce both cardiac
and cerebral ischemia.17 (Reference) In addition, its dose is not dependent
on the patient's weight. The manufacturer's recommendation for rapid
control of blood pressure is to give a continuous infusion that starts at 5
mg/hr and increases by 2.5 mg/hr every 5 minutes (maximum, 15 mg/hr) until
the desired reduction in blood pressure is achieved. Oral nicardipine
(Cardene), 20 mg, can also be given for hypertensive urgencies, and its
efficacy is similar to that of nifedipine.18 (Reference)
   Adrenergic-blocking agents--Three adrenergic-blocking agents may be
considered for hypertensive crises: esmolol hydrochloride (Brevibloc),
labetalol hydrochloride (Normodyne, Trandate), and phentolamine
(Regitine).
   Esmolol--This agent is a pure beta-adrenergic blocking agent that has an
extremely short half-life of less than 10 minutes. Esmolol can be
administered both as an intravenous bolus and as an infusion. The
recommended initial dose is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg, followed by infusion at 50 to
300 mcg/kg per minute.
   Labetalol--When given intravenously, this blocker of both alpha- and
beta-adrenergic receptors produces a prompt and controlled reduction of
blood pressure in patients with hypertensive crises.2,19 (Reference)
Antihypertensive effects start within 5 minutes of administration and may
last at least 4 to 6 hours. The fall in blood pressure results from a
combined decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a slight fall in
cardiac output. Initial parenteral treatment can be followed by oral
administration. A reasonable intravenous protocol is an initial bolus of
0.25 mg/kg, followed by larger boluses (0.5 mg/kg) every 15 minutes until
either blood pressure is controlled or a total dose of 3.25 mg/kg has been
given.
   Phentolamine--This adrenergic-blocking agent is used for management of
catecholamine-induced hypertensive crises. Intravenous administration of 5-
to 10-mg boluses is recommended.6,20 (Reference) The effect is immediate
and may last up to 15 minutes. Unfortunately, phentolamine may cause
tachyarrhythmias or angina, and its use is contraindicated in patients with
preexisting coronary artery disease. Once blood pressure is under control
with phentolamine, oral phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline), a long-acting
alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, may be given.
   Trimethaphan camsylate--A non-depolarizing ganglionic blocking drug,
trimethaphan (Arfonad) blocks transmission of impulses at the sympathetic
and parasympathetic ganglia.11 (Reference) The initial dose is 0.5 to 1
mg/min by continuous infusion, titrated to therapeutic effect. The agent is
potent and has numerous side effects. Tachyphylaxis is a common occurrence
and usually is seen within the first 2 days of administration.
   Diazoxide--Chemically related to the thiazide diuretics, diazoxide
(Hyperstat IV) directly relaxes the arteriolar smooth muscle and thus
reduces peripheral vascular resistance.21 (Reference) When urgent treatment
is required, diazoxide is given intravenously. The onset of action is
immediate, with peak action at 5 to 10 minutes and total duration of action
ranging from 3 to 18 hours.11 (Reference) The current recommended dose is a
minibolus of 1 to 3 mg/kg (to a maximum 150-mg single dose) injected over
10 to 15 seconds. It was previously believed that larger doses (ie, 300 mg)
were needed for therapeutic effect because this agent is 90% protein-bound.
However, larger doses were associated with severe hypotension in up to 10%
of patients. Diazoxide has other significant side effects that additionally
limit its use; salt and water retention is commonly seen, and hyperglycemia
and hyperuricemia may be significant.
   Clonidine--Oral clonidine (Catapres), 0.1 mg every 20 minutes (to a
maximum of 0.8 mg), has been used for the treatment of hypertensive crises,
particularly hypertensive urgencies.22 (Reference) Oral ``loading'' allows
a smooth, rapid, predictable reduction of blood pressure.23 Sedation is a
common side effect and may be a useful adjunct in some patients. In our
experience, this medication is an excellent choice when blood pressure
control within a few hours is desired.6 (Reference)
   Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors--Captopril (Capoten) is the
prototype of these agents and has been compared with several other agents
for treatment of hypertensive crises. In a study by Angeli and
associates,24 (Reference) the effects of sublingual captopril were compared
with those of nifedipine, and it was found that sublingual captopril could
be effectively used as an alternative to nifedipine. The effects of
sublingual captopril occur within 5 minutes of its administration and
persist for about 4 hours.
   Intravenous enalapril maleate (Vasotec I.V.) is now gaining popularity
for use in hypertensive crises.25,26 (Reference) In our experience, initial
intravenous treatment followed by oral administration is a safe means of
management.
   Other agents--A number of other agents are used for hypertensive crises,
including nitroglycerin (Nitro-Bid IV, Nitrostat) and hydralazine
hydrochloride (Apresoline). Reserpine (Serpasil), methyldopa (Aldomet), and
guanethidine monosulfate (Ismelin) have largely been replaced by newer
agents and in our experience have no role in current treatment of
hypertensive crises.
   Nitroglycerin--Although nitroglycerin has disadvantages, including
unpredictable antihypertensive effects, it may have a significant role in
patients with coronary artery disease.6 (Reference) It is still widely used
because it is inexpensive when compared with other agents.
   Hydralazine--This agent is an arteriolar vasodilator that is commonly
used in pregnancy-related hypertensive crises. It may cause marked reflex
tachycardia and increase myocardial oxygen demand, which can lead to
anginal symptoms in patients who have preexisting coronary artery disease.

Special diagnostic and treatment situations
   Hypertensive encephalopathy, aortic dissection, and myocardial ischemia
present special management considerations in patients with hypertensive
crises.
   Hypertensive encephalopathy--The central nervous system is one target
organ that is damaged by acute elevations in blood pressure. The cerebral
vasculature constricts and dilates as necessary to maintain a relatively
constant level of cerebral blood flow. This process, also known as
autoregulation, protects the brain from changing levels of systemic blood
pressure.27 (Reference) However, significant elevations of blood pressure
overcome the homeostatic process and lead to cerebral hyperperfusion and
the development of cerebral edema. Chronic elevations of blood pressure
shift the entire regulatory curve to the right.
   The manifestations of hypertensive encephalopathy may be those of focal
or diffuse cerebral dysfunction. In the management of this hypertensive
emergency, attention must be paid to the rate of decrease in blood pressure
in order to avoid cerebral ischemic complications. Although drugs such as
clonidine have been used in these patients, we prefer intravenous
titratable agents.6,28 (Reference)
   Aortic dissection--About 80% of patients who develop aortic dissection
have a history of hypertension. The mechanism of aortic dissection involves
not only elevations of blood pressure per se but also pressure waves
associated with the pulsatile waveform of systemic blood pressure.29
(Reference) The rate at which the pressure wave rises is important to the
propagation of aortic dissection and an important factor to consider in its
treatment. Physicians who treat aortic dissection should administer agents
that not only reduce the mean arterial pressure but also reduce the rate at
which pressure rises. Classically, vasodilators have been used with the
addition of beta blockers; more recently, beta blockers with vasodilatory
properties have been advised. Some investigators still advocate the use of
ganglionic-blocking agents for this disorder.
   Myocardial ischemia--Acute elevations of blood pressure may result in an
imbalance between oxygen demand and supply in the coronary circulation and
in the development of ischemia. Thus, in patients with acute myocardial
infarction or unstable angina, acute blood pressure elevations may be
deleterious and should be managed promptly. Nitrates, which have been a
mainstay of therapy for myocardial ischemia for a number of reasons,
including their ability to dilate vessels of the coronary bed, are also
efficacious for the management of hypertension and may have a special place
in the treatment of this syndrome.6 (Reference)

Summary
   Although hypertensive crises are now relatively uncommon, they often are
life-threatening when they do occur and demand early recognition and
management to minimize morbidity and mortality. Most patients have
essential hypertension, and withdrawal from an antihypertensive drug is the
most common cause of acute elevation of blood pressure.
   Short-acting parenteral agents are generally recommended for management
of hypertensive crises. In most patients with hypertensive emergencies, the
mean arterial pressure is lowered 25% over 2 to 4 hours. Both cerebral and
coronary hypoperfusion must be avoided.

FOUL-SMELLING TODDLERS

By:
Rashmi R. Abhyankar, MD, Terre Haute, Indiana

   Toddlers have a tendency to push objects up their nose. When a small
child is brought in for investigation of a foul odor of recent onset,
inspect both of his or her nostrils well and ask if any foreign bodies have
been noted before you make a referral or prescribe antibiotics.

IS IT ULCERATIVE COLITIS?

By:
Monjur Ahmed, MD, Kew Gardens, New York

   Amebic colitis may mimic or precipitate an attack of ulcerative colitis.
Therefore, the stool should be examined for Entamoeba histolytica in any
patient with an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis before prescribing
corticosteroids, which disseminate this organism. The presence of E
histolytica trophozoites in a fresh stool specimen justifies treatment with
metronidazole.

APICAL EXAMINATION FOR LEFT VENTRICULAR ENLARGEMENT

By:
Arup Achari, MD, Houston

   Precordial examination is often considered less important than an
electrocardiogram (ECG) or a chest film in the evaluation of left
ventricular size and volume. However, an impulse of more than 3 cm in
diameter during palpation of the apex with the patient in the left lateral
decubitus position is 92% as sensitive and 91% as specific as an
echocardiogram in indicating left ventricular enlargement* and is far
superior to the ECG and chest film for this purpose.
   The normal apical impulse covers an area of about 1 cm (the size of a
penny). If the area is more than that of your stethoscope (about 3 cm), you
can be fairly sure that the patient has an enlarged left ventricle.

BURNS FROM DEFIBRILLATION

By:
I. K. Parikh, MD, Cincinnati

   At an advanced cardiac life support meeting I attended at a local
hospital, it was mentioned that a patient was burned during a
defibrillation procedure. This happened because the patient had been
sponged with tepid alcohol to lower his temperature before cardiac arrest
occurred.

D NJ JURY FINDS NO DEFECT IN ABSENCE OF KEYBOARD WARNING

     A 10-member federal district court jury in Trenton, NJ, on
Dec. 22 found that a plaintiff had not shown that the defendant's
keyboard was defective due to the absence of a warning that using
it could cause repetitive stress injuries.  Oliver v. AT&T
Teletype Corp., No. 93-1806 (D NJ).

     Plaintiff Janet C. Oliver, a service representative with New
Jersey Bell, had used an AT&T keyboard in her employment since
1980.  She filed a complaint in New Jersey Superior Court, Mercer
County, on Dec. 18, 1992, maintaining that AT&T was negligent in
failing to warn "of the dangers and hazards of the [keyboard],
and the dangers posed to the health and welfare of those coming
in contact with or using the [keyboard]."  Oliver also advanced a
theory of strict products liability, claiming that she suffered
her injury "[a]s a proximate result of the defective, unfit,
unsuitable, unsafe and unreasonably dangerous condition of the
[keyboard]."  Oliver sought compensatory and punitive damages.

     The litigation was removed to the U.S. District Court for
the District of New Jersey on April 26, 1993.  The trial went to
the jury before Judge Garrett E. Brown Jr. on Dec. 5.

     The jury, in reaching its verdict, answered "no" to the
question, "Do you find that AT&T's keyboard was defective due to
the absence of a warning that the product could cause the type of
injuries claimed by the plaintiff?"  Apparently the jury did not
accept the testimony of Oliver's expert witness, Dr. Sandra Mohr,
linking repetitive stress injury to keyboard use.

     In a May 30, 1995, order, Magistrate Judge John J. Hughes
barred evidence in the nature of Bureau of Labor Statistics data
regarding the proliferation of repetitive stress syndrome
excepting through testimonial reference.  Judge Hughes opined
that the prejudice to AT&T resulting from the admission of such
evidence far outweighed its probative value.  Judge Hughes did
allow evidence pertaining to workers' compensation claims filed
by AT&T employees based on keyboard use, as well as evidence of
alternative keyboard designs and warnings utilized by other
manufacturers.

     Oliver was represented by Moshe Maimon of Levy Phillips &
Konigsberg in New York City; and by Bill Mathesius of Szafer,
Lakind, Blumstein, Walter & Bader in Lawrenceville, NJ.  AT&T was
represented by Ira Greenberg and Andrew Fishkin of Edwards &
Angell in New York City.

D RI PLAINTIFFS' COUNSEL CITES REASONS FOR MISTRIAL MOTION

     Citing the lack of a "level playing field" in the
presentation of the parties' cases, counsel for an RSI plaintiff
whose jury trial ended with a verdict adverse to her cause filed,
on Dec. 11, an affidavit supporting his motions for a new trial
and a mistrial.  Piester v. IBM Corp., No. 94-470 (D RI).

     Counsel for plaintiffs Patricia and Richard Piester, Steven
J. Phillips, based his motion on his belief that "the Court at
critical junctures displayed what appeared to be an animus toward
plaintiffs' cause generally, and toward [plaintiffs' counsel]
especially."  Furthermore, Phillips asserts that Judge Raymond J.
Pettine evidenced "an unmistakable approach of extreme liberality
favoring all proofs and scheduling needs desired by defendant and
harsh restrictiveness with respect to plaintiffs' proofs and
scheduling needs."  These "simply cannot be squared with any
notion of basic fairness," Phillips argues.

     For example, Phillips cites what he alleges is a disparity
in the approach taken by Judge Pettine to the parties in pretrial
proceedings.  Phillips asserts that Judge Pettine "promptly
forgave" IBM's failure to timely file a pretrial memorandum.
Judge Pettine reopened discovery and otherwise let IBM "prepare
for trial at a time after plaintiffs had already filed their
pretrial memo," Phillips says.  Phillips avers that this
contrasts greatly with Judge Pettine's order finding inadmissible
the testimony of plaintiffs' expert witnesses, Dr. Laura Welch
and Dr. Laura Punnett.

     Phillips asserts that IBM ignored Judge Pettine's
admonishment to raise "serious" issues in limine prior to trial
by not raising the admissibility issue until after the trial
began.  "This tactic was richly successful, without once the
Court questioning why IBM had waited so long without waiving its
rights," Phillips says.

     Phillips cites a number of examples of what he claims were
Judge Pettine's unequal treatment of the parties during trial
proceedings.  Phillips says that he was told by Judge Pettine
that there would be no time set for openings, yet he asserts that
Judge Pettine suddenly imposed a time limit while his opening was
in progress.

     Phillips also avers that he was frequently admonished to
"get to the point" while he was trying to lay the foundation of
the plaintiffs' case.  "In essence, the Court was mercilessly
rushing plaintiffs and preventing the careful laying of
foundations and bases for opinions on the one hand and then
sustaining objections for failing to lay such foundations on the
other," Phillips says.

     This contrasts with the latitude given IBM in its
questioning of Patricia Piester, Phillips says.  He says that
"the record will reveal that IBM counsel was given an
unbelievable and unfettered freedom to make speeches and testify
rather than ask questions throughout these proceedings."

     "It is not plaintiffs' belief that the Court intended [to
deny a fair trial] or consciously acted with any impropriety,"
says  Phillips, but he argued that that is precisely what
occurred.

     According to the original complaint, Patricia Piester used
an IBM keyboard in her employment as a medical secretary for a
Providence medical practice.  She began to experience numbness
and tingling in her upper extremities in August 1990 and
underwent carpal tunnel surgery in January 1991.

     The jury in the Piester trial said on Oct. 20 that the
plaintiff did not prove that a computer keyboard manufactured by
IBM was a proximate cause of her repetitive stress injuries.

     On Oct. 16, prior to the jury's verdict, Judge Pettine ruled
on the admissibility of the testimony of Welch, a medical doctor,
and Punnett, an occupational epidermologist and ergonomist.
Judge Pettine ruled that Welch had sufficient knowledge and
scientific foundation, under the standard of Daubert v. Merrell
Dow Pharmaceuticals, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (1993), to testify on the
cause of Piester's injuries and on whether IBM's keyboard was
unreasonably dangerous.  However, the judge found her not
qualified to opine on the value of keyboard warnings in
preventing injury or on the desirability of alternative keyboard
designs.

     As to Punnett, Judge Pettine said that her testimony "lacks
the required scientific reliability mandated by Daubert and
presents the conundrum of how you bridge the gap from subjective
symptoms and objective signs to a defined disease."  Judge
Pettine found Punnett's testimony inadmissible, observing that
"Dr. Punnett is not an M.D. and yet she jumps from symptoms to
disease.  I find that bridging this hiatus is dependent on
medical expertise."

     Attorneys for Piester were Steven J. Phillips of Levy
Phillips & Konigsberg, New York City; Robert Corrente of
Corrente, Brill & Kusinitz, Providence; and Mark C. Hadden of
Gidley, Sarli & Marusak, Providence.  IBM was represented by
Michael A. Cerussi Jr. and Joseph A. D'Avanzo of Cerussi &
Spring, White Plains, NY; and by Matthew F. Madeiros of Flanders
& Madeiros, Providence.

DC FED. COURT CONSIDERS PLAINTIFFS' PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION
OBLIGATIONS

     The defendants in a repetitive stress injury product
liability action filed separate briefs Dec. 11 opposing the
plaintiff's motion to compel further discovery.  Fort et al. v.
IBM et al., No. 95-20 (D DC).

     The defendants say that the plaintiff has no ground for
further discovery in light of her failure to provide required
specific product identification information to the defendants.

     In its brief, defendant NEC Technologies points out that to
date "no product identification information concerning NEC
Technologies has been produced by [Fort]."  This is so despite
Fort's being ordered by Judge Norma Holloway Johnson to present
this information by June 30, 1995, says NEC.  NEC says that it is
not obligated to respond to Fort's interrogatories because the
disputed facts at issue had not been alleged with particularity.
NEC argues that Fort's latest filing is nothing more than an
attempt to forestall court action on the defendants' Sept. 7
motion to dismiss based on Fort's failure to produce product
identification information.

     NEC maintains that FRCP 26(a)(1) is inapplicable to the
instant litigation, pursuant to Local Rule 207(a), since it had
been assigned to the "complex track" by mutual consent of the
parties.  Under Local Rule 207(a), the burden is on the parties
"to make specific discovery requests to obtain the information
and material that is truly relevant...," says NEC.  Fort has not
demonstrated how additional discovery will help it meets its
product identification burden, adds NEC.

     The opposition filed by IBM largely echoes the sentiments of
its co-defendant NEC on the applicability of FRCP 26(a)(1), the
validity of Fort's interrogatories and Fort's delays in providing
product identification information.  In addition, IBM asserts
that Fort seeks "to shift the burden of product identification to
IBM in an attempt to avoid the results of the failure of their
own efforts."

     IBM and NEC filed their briefs in response to Fort's Nov. 29
motion to compel discovery.  In that motion, Fort argued that the
defendants have done "nothing to meet their obligations under
Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(1) to disclose information within their
control which would permit the identification of the keyboards
and terminals used...."  Fort maintained that the defendants,
even accounting for Local Rule 207(a), were obligated to disclose
information pertaining to, among others things, (1) the types of
equipment sold to her employer, the Chesapeake & Potomac
Telephone Co. (C&P); (2) sales information relevant to the
products; and (3) sales and maintenance contracts with C&P.

               Fort noted that she had served a second set of
interrogatories in an attempt to moot the defendants' refusal to
comply with FRCP 26(a)(1), but that the defendants have filed
objections to these interrogatories.

     In the alternative, Fort asked that should the court find
the defendants exempt from FRCP 26(a)(1), and from responding to
the second set of interrogatories, that she be granted leave to
file more interrogatories and requests for production of
documents.  "Otherwise, plaintiffs will effectively have been
denied any discovery on product identification because an oral
determination by the Court placing the case on a complex track
had the unintended retroactive effect of terminating discovery
which the Federal Rules contemplate plaintiffs should have as a
matter of right," Fort said.

     On Dec. 18, Fort filed a reply in support of her motion to
compel discovery, disputing IBM's and NEC's categorizations of
her obligation to provide product identification information.
Fort says that the order issued by U.S. Magistrate Judge John L.
Caden of the Eastern District of New York, the court from which
the instant litigation was transferred, called for her to provide
product identification information only to the extent known.
That order clearly rejected the defendants' argument that product
identification must include model and serial numbers, Fort said.
Fort argues that "[t]he model and serial numbers of [defendants']
19th century-style keyboards is irrelevant or at best marginally
relevant to repetitive stress/carpal tunnel syndrome injuries."

     Most recently, on Dec. 29, IBM filed a motion to strike
Fort's reply of Dec. 18.  IBM argues that the memo should be
stricken because it did not address Fort's earlier motion to
compel discovery, but instead raised issues that were immaterial
to that motion.  IBM contends that Fort improperly used the reply
memo "to oppose the defendants' motion to dismiss " even though
that opposition had already been filed on Sept. 21, 1995."

     Fort filed her complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of New York on March 25, 1993, seeking
compensatory and punitive damages for the repetitive stress
injuries she allegedly incurred while using certain typewriter
and computer equipment while working for C&P.  The complaint
named IBM as the manufacturer of the typewriter equipment and NEC
and AT&T Corp. as the manufacturers of the computer equipment.
The case was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia on April 20, 1994.

     Counsel for Fort is Bardyl R. Tirana, Washington DC.
Counsel for IBM are J. Hardin Marion, John B. Isbister and
Stephen Weissman of Tydings and Rosenberg, Baltimore.  Counsel
for NEC are James E. Gray and Colleen Rathbun of Goodell,
DeVries, Leech & Gray, L.L.P., also in Baltimore.

ND GA JUDGE SAYS PLAINTIFF NEEDED TO CITE ALTERNATIVE DESIGN

     U.S. District Judge Frank M. Hull of the Northern District
of Georgia on Dec. 7 granted summary judgment in favor of the
manufacturer of a check encoding machine in the product liability
case brought by a bank employee who asserted that the machine had
caused her repetitive stress injuries.  Little v. NCR Corp.,
No. 93-1555 (ND GA).

     Gwenette Little began working for Wachovia Bank in December
1986 as an encoder operator.  According to her complaint, she
began to experience pain and swelling in her hands in
August 1991.  She was diagnosed with overuse syndrome in January
1992 and with carpal tunnel syndrome in December 1992.  Little
attributed her condition to her use of the encoding machine
manufactured by NCR.  In her job, Little fed a check into a
machine track with her left hand while typing on a keypad with
her right hand.

     Little's July 8, 1993, complaint alleged seven causes of
action: (1) breach of implied warranty of merchantability;
(2) breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular
purpose; (3) breach of express warranty; (4) strict liability;
(5) negligent design; (6) failure to warn; and (7) gross
negligence in the failure to warn.  Little sought actual and
punitive damages as well as special damages in the amount of
$1 million.

     First, Judge Hull agreed with NCR's argument that Little's
complaint was time-barred under Georgia's two-year statute of
limitations.  While Little argued that her cause of action did
not accrue until she was diagnosed with overuse syndrome in early
1992, Judge Hull noted that "Georgia law requires only that
[Little] knew or should have known through reasonable diligence
that she was injured and that [NCR's] conduct caused the injury."
Since her doctor had suggested that her problems with her hands
were likely related to her job, Little was aware of the likely
cause of her injuries more than two years prior to filing her
complaint, said Judge Hull.

     In addition to lack of timely filing, the judge indicated
that there were other grounds to grant NCR's motion for summary
judgment.

     Judge Hull said that summary judgment in favor of NCR was
appropriate with respect to Little's strict liability and
negligent design claims, since Little failed to meet her burden
to show defect and causation.

     The judge agreed with NCR that the testimony of Little's
expert witness, Dr. Ruston M. Hunt, was inadmissible because it
was not reliable under the U.S. Supreme Court's teaching in
Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 113 S.Ct. 2786, 2795
(1993).  Judge Hull said that Hunt's testimony "suffers from not
just unreliable methodology, but the complete absence of any
discernible methodology."

     The judge noted that Hunt: (1) had no experience with
encoding machine design; (2) had never conducted original
research into overuse syndrome nor had he published or testified
on that topic; (3) had spent only 10 to 12 hours on forming his
expert opinion prior to being deposed; and (4) had never met
Little or her physicians nor had he seen her workstation.

     Judge Hull rebuffed Little's attempt to support her claim
with statistical evidence showing a purportedly high incidence of
overuse syndrome among encoder operators.  She stated that
Little's use of statistical evidence "does not raise a genuine
issue on the elements of (1) defect in the check-encoding
machine, and (2) causation between a defect in the check encoding
machine and [Little's] injury."

     Judge Hull granted NCR's motion for summary judgment also
with respect to Little's claim of breach of express warranty.  He
noted that under Georgia law, "an express warranty extends only
to the original purchaser, unless the warranty 'makes it clear
that it is also intended to extend to some identifiable third
party or parties'" (quoting Stewart v. Gainesville Glass Co.,
Inc., 131 Ga.App. 747 [1974]).  Here, there is nothing in NCR's
sales agreement with Little's employer, Wachovia Bank, "that any
warranties extend to [Little], as an employee," said Judge Hull.

     Little's failure to warn theory of liability also fell
victim to NCR's motion for summary judgment.  Judge Hull found
summary judgment in favor of NCR to be appropriate, as Little
"has not produced evidence on defect and causation."  Further,
Judge Hull noted that Little's suggestions on an appropriate
warning, i.e., "maintaining proper posture," did not relate to
the encoding machine but related to Little's job.

     Judge Hull offered yet another basis to enter summary
judgment in favor of NCR.  He found that Little failed to meet
her burden, under Georgia law, to "produce proof to a reasonable
degree of medical certainty that [her] injury resulted from her
use of [NCR's] machine."

     Finally, Judge Hull said that Little's suit must fail due to
her failure to propose an alternative design for the encoder.
Following the "risk-utility analysis" set forth in Banks v. ICI
Americas, Inc., 264 Ga. 732, 734-37 (1994), an alternative design
is one factor in determining whether a product's utility
outweighs the risks inherent in its design, noted Judge Hull.
Absent an alternative, Judge Hull concluded that Little did not
show that NCR's "design choice" was unreasonable.

     When contacted by the Repetitive Stress Injury LR, NCR's co-
counsel, Max Hess, opined that adoption of the "alternative
design" requirement would make it much harder for RSI plaintiffs
"down the road."

     Little's breach of implied warranty claims were dismissed by
an earlier order filed by Judge Hull on Feb. 22, 1995.  He ruled
that Little's lack of privity to NCR's sales contract with
Wachovia barred recovery under breach of warranty.  Also
dismissed at that time was Little's allegation that NCR was
grossly negligent in its duty to warn and, by extension, Little's
claim for punitive damages.  Judge Hull noted that, under Georgia
law, punitive damages are available only for "willful misconduct,
malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or that entire want of
care which would raise the presumption of conscious indifference
to consequences."

     While Little alleged that NCR "intentionally failed to
warn," Judge Hull observed that Little's allegations "do not rise
to the level of conscious indifference of the consequences so as
to support [her] prayer for punitive damages."

     Representing Little was Armando Rois-Mendez, Duluth, GA.
Representing NCR were Max Hess and John Taylor of Vincent,
Chorey, Taylor & Feil, Atlanta.

CAUSE OF ACTION DID NOT ACCRUE FROM SYMPTOM ONSET, ARGUES
PLAINTIFF

     The question of whether her action is time-barred is not
proper for summary judgment, repetitive stress injury plaintiff
Bernice Bush says in her Dec. 18 memorandum in opposition to
defendant IBM's motion for summary judgment.  Smith et al. v.
Memorex Corp. et al., No. 94-1163 (D DC).

     In her Dec. 21 response to IBM's motion to dismiss for
failure to allow complete discovery, Bush maintains that she "has
not deliberately failed to respond."

     Bush argues that since she "continued to use [IBM's]
products during the three-year period prior to filing her action,
and because she has sustained new injuries caused by her use of
those products in that three-year period, her claim is timely
under New York law."

     Bush rejects IBM's argument that her cause of action accrued
from the date she first experienced symptoms of injury.  This
issue is not settled in New York, Bush says, citing cases pending
before New York courts.

     Bush also argues that summary judgment is inappropriate in
this case.  Quoting Ford v. AT&T, 154 Misc.2d 894, 586 N.Y.S.2d
721, 724 (NY Sup. Ct., New York Cty. 1992), Bush asserts that the
question of whether symptoms noticed before a diagnosis was made
"were indications of the existence of the diagnosed [injury]," is
purely a question of fact to be resolved by a jury.
Additionally, Bush claims that she "did not experience a single
injury, but rather an accumulation of injuries through the period
of her use of the defendant's equipment."  Each of these
subsequent injuries "gives rise to a new cause of action," Bush
contends.

     Bush also cites "the aggravation of pre-existing injuries
during the same period" in support of the timeliness of her
action.  "It is well-settled in New York that defendant may be
held liable to plaintiff not only for causing injury, but for the
aggravation of a pre-existing condition," Bush says.

     Bush discounts IBM's reliance on Wallen v. AT&T,
No. 12336/91 (NY Sup. Ct., Bronx Cty., Sept. 17, 1992), and its
progeny in support of its proposition that a cause of injury
accrues from the onset of symptoms.  "In Wallen, onset of
symptoms were never discussed and only uncontested dates of
diagnoses were considered for accrual purposes," says Bush.  In
this case, "where diagnosis and symptom onset are explicitly
different and unlinked," Wallen is not controlling, Bush says.

     Finally, Bush asserts that her claim is timely under New
York's discovery statute, C.P.L.R. Section 214-c, which states,
in pertinent part:

     ...the three year period within which an action to
     recover damages for personal injury or injury to
     property caused by the latent effects of exposure to
     any substance or combination of substances, in any
     form...shall be computed from the date of discovery of
     the injury by the plaintiff...

     Bush maintains that this statute applies because she "did
not discover, and should not have discovered, the nature or cause
of any of her new injuries until she was diagnosed with them
during the three-year period prior to filing suit."

     Anticipating IBM's possible response to her statutory
argument, Bush denies that C.P.L.R. Section 214-c is applicable
only to injuries stemming from exposure to toxic substances.
Bush cites the court in DiMarco v. Hudson Valley Blood Services,
147 A.D.2d 156, 542 N.Y.S.2d 521 (1st Dept. 1989) as emphasizing
that it applies to injuries from the "latent effects of exposure
to any substance or combination of substances, in any form."

     In her response to the motion to dismiss, Bush contends that
she has answered all questions regarding her medical history to
the best of her ability.  In addition, she maintains that she has
provided IBM with medical records and information about her
medical expenses and wages lost.

     Bush further asserts that an upcoming expert report "will
provide a basis for establishing IBM's liability."  IBM, says
Bush, has been in possession of an affidavit that lists
"documents that support [her] claims for punitive damages, strict
liability and negligence."

     "The documents set forth...were either produced by IBM
itself in other litigation or provided to IBM in other
litigation," says Bush.  "IBM, therefore, is fully aware of the
facts set forth in those documents and their relationship to its
liability in this matter," she adds.

     Bush was one of several individuals to file product
liability actions against a number of computer equipment
manufacturers in the Eastern District of New York on April 5,
1993.  Bush seeks compensatory and punitive damages, alleging
that her repetitive stress injuries were caused by her use of
computer equipment manufactured by defendant IBM and others while
she was employed by the Potomac Electric Power Co.  Her claim, as
well as that of lead plaintiff Joan P. Smith and another
plaintiff, was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia on May 27, 1994.

     IBM moved for summary judgment on Dec. 6, arguing that
Bush's complaint was untimely filed.  IBM asserted that New
York's three-year statute of limitations is controlling and,
citing to Wallen and In re New York County Data Entry Workers
Litigation, No. 499000/93 (NY Sup. Ct., New York Cty., Aug. 17,
1994), argued that a repetitive stress injury plaintiff's cause
of action accrues from the onset of symptoms.  IBM argued that
both Bush's medical records and her own deposition indicate that
she had symptoms of repetitive stress injury as early as March
1985, some eight years prior to filing suit.

     IBM also filed a motion to dismiss, maintaining that Bush's
response to Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson's order to
compel Bush to respond to discovery was "woefully inadequate."
In the motion, IBM argued that it still lacked "(1) any evidence
of wrongdoing on the part of IBM; (2) a complete medical history
of the plaintiff; and (3) an itemized list of the damages at
issue."

     Counsel for Bush are Marc P. Weingarten and Kim Palavoy
Kutler of Greitzer and Locks in Philadelphia; and Bardyl R.
Tirana, Washington, DC.  Counsel for IBM are John B. Isbister and
Jennifer Holmes of Tydings & Rosenberg in Baltimore.

D NJ DECLINES TO APPLY DISCOVERY EXCEPTION TO CAUSE OF ACTION
ACCRUAL

     In a letter opinion filed Dec. 12, U.S. District Judge
Nicholas H. Politan of the District of New Jersey granted summary
judgment in favor of manufacturers of the computer equipment
cited as the cause of a plaintiff's repetitive stress injuries.
Sprueill v. NCR Corp. et al., No. 94-2233 (D NJ).
               The judge held that the complaint was time-barred under New
York's three-year statute of limitations.

     In their motions for summary judgment, defendants NCR Corp.,
Applied Digital Data Systems, an NCR subsidiary, and Hazeltine,
Inc. argued that since plaintiff Mary Sprueill admitted to having
ceased using their equipment more than three years before she
filed her complaint, the complaint was clearly untimely.

     Sprueill argued that the complaint was timely with respect
to these defendants because it was filed within one year of her
discovery of the defendants' fault in causing her injuries.
However, Judge Politan disagreed.  Citing to Wallen v. AT&T,
No. 12336/91 (NY Sup. Ct., Bronx Cty., Sept. 17, 1992), Judge
Politan held that the discovery exception to the statute of
limitations is not applicable to repetitive stress injury claims.
Also rejected was Sprueill's argument that her claim was timely
under the theory of a continuing duty to warn.  "This theory has
repeatedly been rejected by courts," Judge Politan said.

     Defendants Digital Equipment Corp. and Wyse Technology moved
for summary judgment as well, arguing that Sprueill's action
against them was also time-barred because her cause of action
accrued from the date of injury or symptoms of injury.  Sprueill
admitted to having pain as early as 1979, noted the defendants.

     Sprueill argued against summary judgment on the basis that
she had suffered new injuries during the statutory period that
were qualitatively different from her prior injuries.  Sprueill
cited the certification of Dr. Sandra N. Mohr to the effect that
she had been diagnosed with tenosynovitis in her right fingers,
flexor tenosynovitis of the wrists, and ulnar neuritis within the
last three years.

     However, Judge Politan found Mohr's certification to be
inadequate to deflect the defendants' motions for summary
judgment.

     "Dr. Mohr...never examined plaintiff before August of 1991,"
said Judge Politan.  "Additionally, Dr. Mohr admits that there
were no medical records in existence prior to Oct. 9, 1989, which
she could have reviewed regarding plaintiff's injuries," he
added.  "Hence, the certification is based on Dr. Mohr's pure
speculation, rather than any relevant medical facts," Judge
Politan concluded.

     Sprueill filed her complaint in the U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of New York on March 29, 1993.  In the
complaint, Sprueill contends that her use of computer equipment
manufactured by the defendants during her employment was the
cause of her cervical radiculopathy, bilateral carpal tunnel
syndrome, and trigger finger syndrome.

     The complaint cites causes of action in negligence and
strict products liability.  Sprueill asserts that she used
computer equipment manufactured by Unisys Corp. (formerly
Burroughs Corp.) until 1970; equipment manufactured by NCR until
1979; equipment manufactured by Applied until 1989; equipment
manufactured by Hazeltine until 1989; equipment manufactured by
Wyse through 1990; and equipment manufactured by Digital until
1991.  Sprueill's action was transferred to the U.S. District
Court for the District of New Jersey on April 20, 1994.  Unisys
Corp. was dismissed as a defendant by order of Aug. 7, 1995.

     Counsel for Sprueill was Arnold Carl Lakind of Szaferman,
Lakind, Blumstein, Watter & Blader, P.C., Lawrenceville, NJ.
Counsel for NCR and Applied was Lynne J. Urbanowicz of Edwards &
Angell, Newark, NJ.  Counsel for Hazeltine was Thomas R. Curtin
of Ribis, Graham, Verdon & Curtin, Morristown, NJ.  Counsel for
Wyse was Michael J. Tartini of Minichino & Mautone, P.A.  Counsel
for Digital was Peter Russell Freed of Smith, Stratton, Wise,
Heher & Brennan, Princeton, NJ.

EEOC SAYS RSI SCREENING TESTS VIOLATED ADA

     The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has accused
Rockwell International Corp. of violating the Americans with
Disabilities Act by conducting pre-employment testing designed to
screen out applicants with repetitive stress injuries and other
disabilities.  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v.
Rockwell International Corp. et al., No. 95-3824 (ND IL).

     In its amended complaint filed Dec. 14, the EEOC seeks
injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages for the
12 rejected applicants who filed charges with the EEOC.

     According to published reports, the 12 who filed charges had
applied for work at Rockwell's auto parts plant in Centralia, IL,
but were denied employment when they failed nerve conduction
studies designed to reveal RSIs or a propensity to incur RSIs.
ADA regulations require that medical tests given to job
applicants be job-related and consistent with the needs of the
business.  The EEOC has questioned the validity of nerve
conduction studies as an indicator for RSIs.

     The complaint alleges that Rockwell violated Sections
102(a), 102(b)(1), and 102(b)(6) of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. Sections
12112(a), 12112(b)(1), and 12112(b)(6), by "(a) failing to hire
the individuals listed...and other individuals because it
perceived them to have a disability within the meaning of the
ADA; (b) using employment tests that screen out a class of
individuals perceived to have disabilities; [and] (c) failing to
hire the individuals listed...and other individuals because they
had a record of a disability within the meaning of the ADA."

     The complaint asserts that Rockwell's engagement in
discriminatory employment practices was intentional and was done
with "malice or reckless indifference to the federally protected
rights of a class of individuals perceived to have disabilities."

     Also named in the complaint is Cambridge Industries, Inc. as
the successor to Rockwell at its Centralia facility.  Cambridge
purchased the facility from Rockwell in August 1994 and has
continued the operation since then.  According to the complaint,
Cambridge had notice of the charges at the time of the purchase.

     Representing the EEOC are Jean Powers Kamp, Gordon G.
Waldron and John C. Hendrickson of its Chicago office.
Representing Rockwell International are Richard H. Schnadig and
Nina G. Stillman of Vedder, Price, Kaufman & Kammholz in Chicago.

MANUFACTURERS GROUP REPORTS ON RSIs

     "Many misconceptions exist concerning the association
between upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders and office
work," the Office Ergonomics Research Committee (OERC) said in a
report released Jan. 4, entitled "Musculoskeletal Disorders in
the U.S. Office Workforce."

     "There is little scientific evidence on the exact causes of
[repetitive stress injuries] and the value of prescribed
interventions," the OERC says.  It adds that "[a] long term,
international research strategy is required to fill the voids in
our understanding."

     The OERC makes note of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data
that shows growth in the number of RSIs reported from 1990 to
1994.  The statistics show that the number of these injuries has
almost doubled in that period from 185,000 annually to 332,000.
However, the OERC notes that RSIs accounted for only 4.9% of all
occupational injuries in 1994, and that the rate of increase in
these injuries has lessened since 1993.

     The report goes on to examine the state of research into
input devices, such as computer keyboards; pointing devices, such
as computer mouses; workstation ergonomics; psychosocial
influences; medical considerations; and exercise.

     For example, the report cites a University of Rochester
study that found that keyboard users strike the keys four to five
times harder than necessary to activate the key.  The report
notes that the same study revealed that workers with symptoms of
RSIs strike the keys harder than do workers without symptoms.

     The report also cites a study by the National Institute on
Occupational Safety and Health that evaluated 127 exercises
recommended for keyboard users.  While the exercises were easily
performed in the office environment, 90% were seen as
questionable for workers with acute or chronic musculoskeletal
disorders, and 40% were judged to duplicate the "biomedical
demands" of keyboard use, says the OERC.

     The report concludes with descriptions of research projects
in the areas that the OERC has fully or partially funded.  One
such study by the University of California at San Francisco (UC-
SF) seeks to determine whether using a computer mouse causes
muscle fatigue and whether there is a difference in the fatigue
resulting from using a mouse with a drag lock compared to a
normal mouse.  The report says that an earlier UC-SF study showed
that mouses are being used 31% of the time in word processing
applications and 65% of the time in graphics applications.

     The OERC, a group composed of U.S. companies "concerned by
reports of an increasing number of [RSIs] among office workers,"
was formed in April 1991.  Its members include 3M, Apple
Computer, AT&T Global Information Solutions Corp., Compaq
Computer Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp.  The OERC lists as its
objectives: (1) the development of "an understanding of office
related [RSIs]"; (2) determining "the effect, if any, that office
work has on causing or exacerbating them"; (3) identifying the
interventions that "are successful in preventing or resolving
them"; and (4) ascertaining "whether appropriate medical
treatment is generally available to deal with them."

8TH CIR.: EVIDENTIARY ERROR WAS OF APPELLANT'S MAKING

     A panel of the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals Dec. 20
declined to overturn a district court ruling that found no bad
faith in an employer's initial refusal to pay workers'
compensation to a worker disabled by carpal tunnel syndrome.
Roth v. Homestake Mining Co. of California, No. 95-1073
(8th Cir.).

     The district court's alleged error in allowing the fact of
the employer's eventual agreement to settle the workers'
compensation claim was of the plaintiff's own making and was not
reversible, the panel said.

     According to the record before the panel, Monty L. Roth
became permanently and totally disabled in 1990 due to the
effects of carpal tunnel syndrome after 18 years of employment
with Homestake Mining Co.  When Homestake refused to pay his
workers' compensation claim, Roth filed a petition with the South
Dakota Department of Labor's Division of Labor and Management.
Some three years later, during an administrative hearing
conducted by that agency, Homestake agreed to settle Roth's claim
for $326,000.

     However, Roth had filed a bad-faith action in federal
district court prior to the settlement.  In this suit, Roth
sought actual and punitive damages.  A jury subsequently returned
the verdict that Homestake had not acted in bad faith.

               Roth appealed, arguing that the district court abused its
discretion in allowing the fact of the settlement into evidence
while not allowing him to show that one-third of the settlement
amount had been given to his attorney.

     The Eighth Circuit panel, in a decision written by Judge
Pasco M. Bowman, affirmed the judgment of the district court.

     The panel held that Roth's argument was "fatally flawed
because it proceeds from the premise that Homestake introduced
the evidence of the settlement amount."

     "The record reveals, however, that Roth, not Homestake,
introduced the exhibit that included the settlement amount...when
he included the exhibit in his pre-trial exhibit book," the panel
said.  Roth was aware that the district court had ruled to
exclude the payment to the attorney, but failed to withdraw the
exhibit in a timely manner, noted the panel.  The panel held that
there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the district
court where the complained-of error was invited by the party
seeking reversal of the judgment.

     Absent a showing of bad faith on the part of Homestake, the
panel declined to consider Roth's argument that the district
court erred when it refused to submit the issue of punitive
damages to the jury.  "Homestake cannot be liable for punitive
damages absent a finding of bad faith," the panel said.

     Representing Roth was Charles Lefholz in Rapid City, SD.
Representing Homestake were Bradley Paul Gordon and A. Peter
Fuller of Fuller & Tellinghuisen in Lead, SD.

MO CT. APP. FINDS INSURER AT TIME OF DISABILITY LIABLE FOR
BENEFITS

     The workers' compensation insurer at the time a repetitive
stress disability begins is liable for benefits, even if the
disease is diagnosed earlier while a different policy is in
effect, the Missouri Court of Appeals said in a unanimous Dec. 12
opinion.  Oberg v. American Recreational Products et al.,
No. 67026 (MO Ct. App.).

     The panel declined to impose liability on the predecessor
insurer whose policy was in effect at the time of diagnosis but
not of disability.

     Kathryn Oberg started work at American Recreational Products
in October 1987, sewing rope into tent hems.  In December 1988,
she was diagnosed with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.  The
next month, she underwent release surgery on her right hand only.
She resumed work after surgery.  She underwent release surgery on
her left hand on Oct. 3, 1989, three days after Liberty Mutual
Insurance replaced Home Insurance Co. as her employer's workers'
compensation carrier.

     After Oberg applied for disability benefits, an
administrative law judge found Liberty Mutual to be the insurer
at risk and awarded benefits for 17.5% permanent partial
disability.  The Labor and Industrial Relations Commission
modified by holding Home Insurance Co. liable rather than Liberty
Mutual.  Home was not a party to the claim.

     The Court of Appeals, Eastern District, reinstated Liberty
Mutual's liability in an opinion by Judge Kent E. Karohl.
Because Liberty Mutual's policy was in effect when Oberg's left
carpal tunnel syndrome became disabling, Liberty Mutual is
responsible for the award of benefits, the court said.  Although
the diagnosis predated that policy, there was no evidence of
disability until after the Liberty Mutual policy took effect, the
court said.  As a result, Oberg would have been unable to file a
claim until a disability existed.

     It also noted that Liberty Mutual was the insurer when Oberg
was last exposed to the risk, namely the day before surgery.

     Last, the court found the Commission's award against Home
improper because Home was never a party and did not participate
in the case.

     There was no dispute over the amount of the award or whether
Oberg's RSI was an occupational disease caused by the repetitive
activity of her job.

     Nile Griffiths of St. Louis represented Oberg.  Deborah L.
Hellmann of St. Louis appeared for Liberty Mutual.

PHYSICIAN'S INPUT TO DISABILITY RATING DEEMED INADMISSIBLE

     A panel of the New Mexico Court of Appeals has reversed and
remanded a workers' compensation judge's determination of the
disability rating of a worker with carpal tunnel syndrome.
Jurado v. Levi Strauss & Co., No. 15,396 (NM Ct. App.)

     The panel ruled that the testimony of a physician, on which
the rating was partially based, was inadmissible under New Mexico
law.

     Olga Jurado suffered an injury to her wrists and hands while
working at the "hem line" station of the Levi Strauss plant in
Roswell, NM, on Dec. 11, 1991.  She ceased working on March 5,
1992, and has not returned to work.  She had carpal tunnel
release surgeries in March and June 1992.  On May 14, 1993,
Jurado's orthopedist, a Dr. Allegretto, adjudged that she had
reached maximum medical improvement.  Allegretto assigned a 5%
impairment rating to each upper extremity, which translated to a
6% impairment for the "whole person."
               However, Jurado also complained of pain in her neck since
her injury.  After a number of doctors could find no explanation
for her symptoms, Jurado sought out the opinion of an independent
medical examiner, Dr. Guy R. Fogel.  Fogel examined Jurado and
established her permanent partial impairment rating to the body
as a whole at 5% for her neck and shoulder condition.

     A workers' compensation judge (WCJ), Peter L. Dinelli,
subsequently awarded Jurado a 14% permanent partial disability
rating by adding the ratings established by Drs. Allegretto and
Fogel to a 3% rating for Jurado's "specific vocational
preparation."

     Prior to determining Jurado's disability rating, the WCJ had
denied Levi Strauss's motion in limine to exclude Fogel's report.
Levi Strauss had argued that Fogel's report was inadmissible
testimony under NMSA Section 52-1-51(C) because Fogel was neither
Jurado's "authorized health care provider" nor an independent
medical examiner (IME) agreed to by the parties or selected by
the WCJ on petition by the parties.  The WCJ determined that
Fogel's report was not "testimony" within the meaning of Section
52-1-51(C) since it was "undertaken to determine impairment
ratings needed to calculate disability pursuant to the statutory
formula."

     Levi Strauss appealed, arguing that the WCJ erred in finding
Fogel's report admissible under Section 52-1-51(C).

     In its Nov. 1 opinion, the appellate panel agreed with Levi
Strauss and reversed the WCJ's denial of its motion in limine.
It noted that NMSA Section 52-1-51(C) limited physician testimony
at workers' compensation hearings to providers who had treated
the workers and to IMEs agreed to by the parties or selected by
the WCJ on petition by the parties.

     The panel said that it was clear, as did the WCJ, that Fogel
had not provided continuing medical care to Jurado.  The panel
also ruled that Fogel was not selected as an IME under the
statute since he was unilaterally chosen by Jurado.  The WCJ had
noted this fact as well.  However, the panel held that the WCJ
had misconstrued Workers' Compensation Act Rule 92.4.3E as
standing "for the proposition that the medical opinions of a
health care provider prepared in the form of a written report do
not constitute testimony under Section 52-1-52(C)."

     "The fact that it was 'undertaken to determine impairment
ratings needed to calculate disability pursuant to the statutory
formula' does not mean that it is admissible," said the panel.
It added that "[t]he Act does not authorize such an evaluation
except in connection with ongoing care from authorized treating
health care providers, ...or IMEs in situations where medical
issues are in dispute."

     Counsel for Jurado was James G. Chakeres in Albuquerque.
Counsel for Levi Strauss was Bryan D. Evans of Atwood, Malone,
Mann & Turner, P.A. in Roswell.

Baboon bone marrow recipient Jeff Getty leaves
hospital three weeks after historic transplant

Three weeks after undergoing an historic transfusion of baboon bone
marrow, AIDS patient Jeff Getty walked out of San Francisco General
Hospital with a smile and an admonition - "To the naysayers who
said that I would never recover from this procedure, well, here I
am.  And you were wrong."

While the long-term prognosis on the success or failure of the
experimental procedure remains anybody's guess, the 38-year-old
Getty left the hospital with no signs of diseases endemic to
baboons, telling wellwishers, "It feels like I just came from the
moon."  

"So far, the only thing we can really conclude is that the
procedure was safe, safer than we had initially expected. Jeff
tolerated everything very well," said Steven Deeks, MD, who
performed the procedure.  "The more critical question, about
whether or not this procedure actually provided any benefit for
Jeff, remains unclear.  Quite honestly, we just don't know."

Getty will be seen as an outpatient three times a week for the next
few weeks and if his recovery is deemed satisfactory, on a weekly
basis thereafter.  Blood drawn will be routinely sent to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Susan Ilstad,
MD, the University of Pittsburgh researcher who developed the
unique procedure and led the fight to get the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to approve the transplant. 

"We'll monitor him for six months at a minimum and hope to find the
baboon blood all through his blood stream looking for the virus,"
Dr. Ilstad said in a Jan. 17 interview on ABC's Prime Time Live. 
In response to a question about the chance of an outbreak of a
unknown baboon virus in humans, Dr. Ilstad answered curtly, "zero."

However, the media was rife with articles and interviews
questioning whether the transplant might lead to an "ebola-like"
virus outbreak.  

"This is a serious mistake," said Jonathan Allen, a primate
virologist, in an interview with Time magazine.  "It only takes one
transmission from one baboon to a human to start an epidemic.
There's no way you can make it safe." 

Allen, who works for the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical
Research in San Antonio, TX, the institution that supplied the
baboon for the experiment, also told the Washington Post that
"baboons are an infectious disease nightmare."

The FDA and CDC, the government agencies in charge of monitoring
public health safety, are both said to be close to finalizing draft
guidelines researchers and transplant teams will be urged to follow
"voluntarily." 

Late last year, CDC's Louisa Chapman, MD, and five colleagues
observed that a formal system of oversight must be established to
study the implications of xenografting on society .

"Clinicians and policy makers alike must recognize that although
xenotransplantation promises benefits for specific patients, that
promise is accompanied by an unquantifiable but undeniable
potential for harm to the wider community," wrote Dr. Chapman and
five colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine (33 (22):
1498-1501).  "Thus, in this new field the determination of what
constitutes an acceptable risk in the balance between caution and
progress is a matter of public concern, not merely a private matter
for individual scientists, physicians and patients to decide."

Alluding to Getty's (then) pending transplant, Dr. Chapman, et.al
added:  "If the risk of xenotransplant-associated infections is
restricted to the recipient, it simply constitutes one more factor
affecting the risks and benefits of transplantation.  However,
there may be wider implications for the human community."

Providing a preview of what the transplant community may expect to
see in the guidelines, the authors wrote: "Therefore, before
proceeding further with xenotransplantation, we need a
multidisciplinary consensus to facilitate the development of
measures designed to protect the safety of all, to indicate the
directions of further research, and to advance well-designed
clinical trials as the use of xenogeneic tissue makes the
transition from animal models to medical practice."

Phil Noguchi, MD, director of the FDA's division of cell and gene
therapy and one of the authors of the report, told Transplant News
the NEJM article was not aimed at reining in current research being
conducted by biotech companies.

"Some companies took hits after the article but they have all been
working closely with the FDA over the past year and half and the
concerns listed in the article are not aimed at them," Dr. Noguchi
said.

Dr. Noguchi said the FDA guidelines will concentrate on how the
xenografting process is carried out (could human's be infected with
an animal virus), quality control to protect the patient, and does
the process work (efficacy).

"The process doesn't need to be a pharmaceutical model as in the
past," Dr. Noguchi added.  "There is a challenge to come up with
a community based model.  We want to create a real revolution where
patient need is the center of the regulation, not the product
maker."

In the meantime, the transplant industry, AIDS community and
federal regulators will closely follow Getty's progress.

"If I let everyone have a sample of me who wants one, I'd be cut
up in a million pieces," Getty told Prime Time Live.

When asked his opinion of what had happened, Getty responded: "I
have an intuitive feeling we have engraftment.  However, I do know
this, we are going the learn something no matter what."

Conservative physician group seeks
investigation of Getty Transplant

The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, described as a
conservative think tank for 3,500 physicians, has asked the federal
Office for Protection from Research Risks, to investigate whether
the baboon bone marrow transplant to AIDS patient, Jeff Getty,
could endanger the public.

The group told the agency baboons carry numerous pathogens they
fear could infect people through such operations.

The Physicians Committee specifically asked the Risks office to
study whether the approval to go ahead with the operation by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was appropriate.  The Risks
office is part of the National Institutes of Health and has a
charge of guarding against dangerous medical research.

Responding to the charges, Mary Pendergast, FDA deputy
commissioner, noted, "The FDA's role was to build in more caution
to make (the experiment) safer than when it came to us," adding the
agency is sure the experimental operation can withstand the
scrutiny.

After death sentence overturned,
convicted confict causes controversy
by seeking liver transplant

A 400-pound convicted murderer who was spared the hangman's noose
because a federal judge ruled his weight might have resulted in his
decapitation has triggered yet another controversy in the state of
Washington because he needs a liver transplant.

The unusual case has generated considerable media attention both
on the judge's ruling and the need for a transplant. 

The state's Attorney General Christine Gregoire is seeking to have
the medical records of the inmate, Mitchell Rupe, opened so
taxpayers and the victims' families should know more about it,
United Press International reported.

"The public has a right to know Rupe's medical condition," Gregoire
said.  "Mitch Rupe already has made his medical condition a matter
of public record...He can't have it both ways."

Rupe, who was convicted of slaying two women bank tellers in
Olympia, WA, gained notoriety last year when a federal judge
overturned his death sentence, ruling he could not be hanged
because his weight might cause decapitation, and that would be
cruel and unusual punishment, UPI reported.

Under Washington law, a condemned inmate has the choice of hanging
or lethal injection and if he does not choose - as Rupe did 
not -he must be hanged.  It was that loophole that got the death
sentence overturned.  The state has appealed to the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeal.

Citing a provision of state law that says medical records are
confidential, corrections officials have refused to confirm a
report saying Rupe was undergoing evaluation for a liver
transplant.

The case has created an uproar in the media and the public, a
spokesperson for the Department of Corrections told Transplant
News.  "It has raised the blood pressure of the general public,"
she said.

"The issue is confidentiality of medical records and it is a
dilemma," said the spokesperson.  "We have read the law and it
contradictory on the matter so we have asked the courts to decide."

A ruling on the confidentiality is expected Jan. 26 or 27 the
spokesperson said.  "If they rule we can release the data, we will
do so ASAP," she added.

The furor also is fueling the threat of legislation being passed
in the Washington legislation to ban any incarcerated offender from
receiving a transplant.

"That would be a real problem," the spokesperson pointed out. 
"What if someone is on dialysis and a transplant could reduce the
costs of treatment significantly?  Or what if it is a mother with
a couple of children who is a first time offender?  If legislation
is passed it could cast a wide blanket over all."

The Northwest Organ Procurement Agency has received only a few
calls and only one torn up donor card, Karyn Denton, the OPO
director told Transplant News.

"We were asked to refer all calls to the Department of Corrections
and that's what we have done," Denton said.

Is the public outraged?  "We have just received a stack of mail
from the governor's office," the corrections spokesperson said. 
"Many are sending in torn up donor cards.  People are so angry. 
We're telling people it is a personal decision but we hope they
won't hurt someone else by not donating just because of this case."

Rupe is not on the waiting list for a liver at this time. 
However the courts decide, a thorny question will remain to be
answered: given the current donor shortage, should an expensive,
life-saving liver transplant be considered to keep Rupe alive when
he may eventually be executed?

Japanese effort to pass donation legislation 
tabled again; 1995 controversies may have hurt cause

While the Japanese Diet is still struggling to come to adopt
legislation that will allow organ transplants from patients
declared brain dead, two scandals in recent months have possibly
added to the difficulties of gaining passage any time soon.

On Dec. 14 the Committee on Health Welfare of the Lower House
decided that the Organ Transplant Bill, first presented in April
1994, should be deliberated on a continual basis in future
committee meetings.  The action marked the sixth time the bill has
been shelved, according to Comline Japan Daily.

Two weeks later, the Japanese official in charge of overseeing
Japan's kidney transplant network admitted a faulty computer system
had prevented three patients from receiving transplants after 1,006
names were deleted from the waiting list and 395 were erroneously
listed as deceased.

Teruo Omae, executive director of the network, explained the old
computer system at the national hospital in Sakura, Chiba
Prefecture, was defective and there had been problems with the
transfer of new information to a new system initiated last April,
the Kyodo News Service reported.

There are approximately 18,000 patients registered as waiting for
a kidney in Japan.  Omae said the 1,006 lost names resulted in the
patients not receiving laboratory tests when a potential donor was
found and three were apparently passed over who would have been
given priority for the organs.

The Health and Welfare Ministry has ordered an investigation into
the irregularities.

The computer mishap caused a minor stir compared to a major
controversy that occurred in June which led to one of Japan's most
renowned transplant surgeons, Professor Kazuo Ota, to apologize
for performing at least 13 transplants using kidneys that had
previously been rejected by the United Network for Organ Sharing
(UNOS).

In an article in the Lancet (Vol. 346: 41-2) and reprinted in the
November issue of the ETCO Newsletter (European Transplant
Coordinators Organization), Catrien Ross reported "at least four
of the operations done by Ota were unauthorized because they took
place" after the National Kidney Transplant Network had been
launched last April.  

Ross reported the UNOS-like network, had "specifically asked that
kidneys rejected in the U.S. not be used by Japanese surgeons. 
Some transplantations were allegedly done as much as 72 hours after
the organs had been removed from the donors."

Professor Ota defended his actions by saying he had been unable to
contact the network and that "he had to do the operations to ensure
that the U.S. continued to provide kidneys." UNOS has not provided
organs to Japan since early June, Ross said.

Ota, a professor at Tokyo Women's Medical College, apologized for
"causing trouble," and resigned as head of Japan's Hemodialysis
Society.

Newspaper poll reveals 70% of Japanese
support organ transplants from brain dead donor

More than 70% of Japanese polled in December said they supported
organ transplants if the donor is declared brain dead and 46% were
willing to accept brain death as the death of a person, according
to a report in the Lancet written by Catrien Ross.

The nationwide poll of 3,000 eligible Japanese voters was conducted
in December by the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun.

The poll also revealed about 61% supported passage of a law
permitting transplants from patients declared brain dead, 20%
opposed them, and 51% approved if the individual had given prior
written consent.

Ross also reported Soka Gakkai, Japan's largest lay Buddhist
organization, announced it will recognize brain death as the
termination of life "once the medical community has reached such
a consensus." Soka Gakkai has a membership of 8.3 million families
- there are 124 million people in Japan.

A report compiled by Soka Gakkai physician members said
transplantation is "not in conflict with the organization's
Buddhist teachings," and recommends "a donor registration and donor
card-carrying system, creation of a transplant information network,
training medical coordinators to arrange transplantations, and a
law to prohibit the sale of organs."

The organization also favors the donation of organs from brain dead
people only if the person has previously indicated their wish to
donate.  This differs from the legislation being proposed in the
Diet which would permit donation if the family of the deceased
gives consent.

Transplant coordinators society formed
to increase international communication

A new international society for transplant coordinators has been
formed to increase communication and collaboration between
individual transplant coordinators and international associations
and societies.

The society, dubbed the International Transplant Coordinators
Society (ITCS), has elected a board and plans to hold meetings and
seminars to provide professional education for its members.

Leo Roels, scientific program director of the ITCS, told Transplant
News the aims of the society include:

"*fostering communication and collaboration amongst transplant
coordinators individually as well as with national and
international associations or societies interested in the field of
transplantation, transplant coordination and related subjects;

*providing its membership and the general public information on an
international level concerning organ/tissue donation and the
benefits of organ and tissue transplantation;

*providing professional education to its membership with a goal of
enhancing the profession of transplant coordinator.  The education
may take the form of a biennial meeting with the presentation of
abstracts, formation of specific educational meetings, or
endorsement of existing educational programs of transplant
coordinator societies and/or organizations;

*promoting research and providing a forum for the presentation of
research findings on organ and tissue donation, procurement and
transplantation."

Roels says the ITCS hopes to organize an international meeting in
conjunction with the 4th International Meetings of the Society for
Organ Sharing (SOS), 4th International Samuel L. Kountz Symposium
and 2nd International Non-Heart-Beating Donor Workshop, to be held
July 9-13, 1997 in Washington, DC.

The "founding board" of the ITCS includes: President - Seigo
Hiraga, MD, Tokai University School of Medicine, Bohsaidai,
Isahara, Kanagawa, Japan; Vice President - Greg Armstrong, RN,
Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia; Secretary - Sally
Kong, LSW, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore; 
Treasurer - Teresa Shafer, LifeGift Organ Donation Center, Fort
Worth, TX; Scientific Program Director - Leo Roels, CPTC,
University Hospital, Leuven, Belgium.

New Jersey law requires hospitals to
report all deaths to state's OPO

A new law which contains a provision requiring hospitals to report
every death when it occurs to the state's organ procurement
organization (OPO) has been passed and signed into law in New
Jersey. 

The new law is similar, but not as far-reaching, as legislation
passed in Pennsylvania last year.

The Donor Enhancement Act streamlines the state's donation process
with the hope of easing the state's donor shortage, according to
the New Jersey Organ and Tissue Sharing Network.

Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed the act into law on Nov. 6.  The
act was sponsored by Sen. Jack Sinagra (R-Middlesex) and
Assemblyman Alex DeCroce (R-Morris).

Hospitals are now required to report every death when it occurs to
The Sharing Network so it can determine donor suitability.  To
simplify the donation process, the law also eliminates the need for
hospitals to complete an Organ Donation Option Certificate.

Other provisions of the law include:

*training for transplant coordinators on how to seek consent;

*allows certified surgical specialists to perform the procurement
of tissues;

*mandates medical record audits of all hospital deaths (practice
had been voluntary).

Pennsylvania implements law which appropriates
$300,000 to donor awareness trust fund

Pennsylvania has implemented a new law which appropriated $300,000
to the Organ Donation Awareness Trust Fund to administer the Organ
Donor Card Program.  Gov. Tom Ridge signed the bill releasing the
appropriation on Dec. 20.

Senate Bill 1303, sponsored by Sen. Melissa Hart (R-Allegheny),
reimburses the Department of Transportation for the administrative
costs of implementing the Organ Donor Law (Act 102 of 1994).  

The law also created an Organ Donor Advisory Committee to advise
the Health Department of ways to encourage organ donation. (TN,
11/30/95)

Gov. Ridge is encouraging Pennsylvania residents to send in
contributions to the Organ Donor Awareness Trust Fund, Department
of Health, P.O. Box 90, Harrisburg, PA 17108-0090.

Wisconsin swine center fire kills 700 pigs;
many had been used in transpalnt research

A fire at the swine center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's
Agricultural Research Station in Arlington killed 700 pigs,
including some that were being used in organ transplant research.
The fire, which occurred on Dec. 20, also 80 killed pigs that had
been used in a 20-year research project on cholesterol.

The blaze reduced the building that housed hogs, laboratories, a
surgery room, gestation, maternity and nursery wards into a
smoldering pile of ashes, the Knight-Ridder Business News reported. 
Officials said the cost of replacing the structure would be more
than $350 million.

The fire destroyed decades of agricultural, biomedical and
environmental research as well as animals that resulted from 30
years of genetic selection.

"I think the toughest loss is the number of years some of the
scientists had invested in their research here," said David Jensen,
research program manager for the Swine Research and Teaching
Center.  "These animals were indispensable to their work."

AMA "temporarily suspends" policy regarding
procurement of organs from anencephalics

Responding to criticism from its own membership, the American
Medical Association (AMA) has "temporarily suspended" its policy
of regarding it ethically acceptable to procure organs from
anencephalic babies.

The change, which is expected to remain for the next several years,
will result in reinstatement of the AMA's previous policy which
favors prohibiting the use of anencephalic babies as organ donors
until they meet the legal criterion for brain death - the complete
cessation of brain function.

In June 1994, the AMA Council on Judicial and Ethical Affairs
issued its opinion that anencephalic babies could be organ donors
as long as the request to donate came from the child's parents and
not the medical establishment caring for the baby.  

The original opinion read in part:  "It is ethically permissible
to consider the anencephalic as a potential organ donor, although
still alive under the current definition of death only if: (1) the
diagnosis of anencephaly is certain and is confirmed by two
physicians who are not part of the organ transplant team; (2) the
parents of the infant desire to have the infant serve as an organ
donor and indicate such in writing; and (3) there is compliance
with the Council's Guidelines for the Transplantation of Organs."

Charles Plows, MD, council chairman, said the change reflected
concern about the organ donors, especially children's organs, and
the case of parents who wanted to donate the organs of their
anencephalic newborn but were not allowed to by a Florida court,
the New York Times reported.

"They were, if you want to call it that, actually deprived of
salvaging something from this tragic experience," Dr. Plows said,
"and we were left with nothing as far as feeling that they could
contribute something in the way of transplants."

While the 1994 opinion never led to any anencephalic donations
before brain death, the council's opinion drew heavy criticism
because it broke the "dead donor rule."  

The American Academy of Neurology had requested that the AMA change
its position.

"Whatever little benefit might occur from the organs would be more
than outweighed by the damage to society," said James Bernat, MD,
a neurologist at the Dartmouth Medical Center and chair of the
academy's Ethics Committee.  "Once you start killing people for
their organs, people would begin to push the envelope.  We felt it
was better to maintain the dead donor rule even if there would be
fewer organs around."

The AMA says the change will give researchers time to do more
research on the brain function of anencephalic babies.  Of
particular interest is whether the babies have the potential to
experience any degree of consciousness.

Immunex receives FDA clearance to market Leukine as 
growth factor for peripheral blood progenitor cells 

Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA, announced it has received marketing
clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
Leukine(R) (sargramostim), as the first growth factor indicated for
use in mobilizing peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) and for
use after PBPC transplantation.

The company reports in a study of 196 patients, Leukine given to
mobilize PBPCs significantly increased the number of progenitor
cells collected.  When Leukine was given after transplantation with
mobilized PBPSs, there was further acceleration in white blood cell
recovery.  In addition, the number of platelet transfusions and
red blood cell transfusions needed was decreased and patients were
discharged from the hospital earlier when compared to patients not
receiving Leukine. 

Leukine was originally licensed by the FDA in March, 1991 for use
following autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and was
licensed in Dec. 1991 to prevent death following BMT engraftment
delay or failure. In Sept. 1995 Leukine was licensed to prevent
early death from infection following induction chemotherapy for
older patients suffering from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) 
In Nov. 195, Immunex also received FDA marketing clearance for
Leukine's use in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. (TN,
11/30/95)

CellPro says FDA advisory committee will review
its PMA for CEPRATE in late February 

CellPro, Inc., Seattle, WA, has received notification from the FDA
that the company's pre-market approval application (PMA) for the
CEPRATE(R) SC Stem Cell Concentration System will be reviewed by
the FDAs Biological Response Modifiers Advisory Committee in late
February.  The CEPRATE SC System completed a Phase III clinical
trial in autologous bone marrow transplantation in May 1993, and
CellPro filed a PMA with the FDA in December of that year.  In Dec.
1994, the FDA requested additional information from the company,
which was provided in Aug. and Sept. 1995.

The CEPRATE SC System is CellPro's first product to complete
clinical testing in the U.S.  The CEPRATE SC System is a medical
device that separates human stem cells from the other cells of the
bone marrow of peripheral blood.

CellPro began sales of the CEPRATE SC System in Europe during 1993. 
The product received the CE mark for marketing approval from the
18-nation European Economic Union in July 1995 and ISO 9002 quality
certification in Sept. 1995.  In addition to countries in Europe,
the company has marketing approval for the CEPRATE SC System in
Canada.

The system is currently being used in clinical trials for various
applications at over 175 institutions in the U.S. and Europe.  The
company's CEPRATE LC Laboratory Cell Separation System line of
products for nonclinical research is available worldwide.

SEOUL HOPES CEAUSESCU'S FALL MAY ENCOURAGE N. KOREA REFORM+

     SEOUL, DEC. 26 KYODO - THE DRAMATIC DOWNFALL OF ROMANIA'S
PRESIDENT NICOLAE CEAUSESCU WILL BRING HEAVY PRESSURE TO NORTH KOREA
TO REORIENT ITS CLOSED SOCIETY TOWARD OPENNESS AND REFORMS, ANALYSTS
HERE SAID TUESDAY.
     IT MUST HAVE COME AS A BIGGER SURPRISE THAN ANY DEVELOPMENT IN
OTHER EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SINCE PYONGYANG HAS MAINTAINED CLOSE
TIES WITH ROMANIA.
     NORTH KOREAN LEADERS ARE, HOWEVER, CONCENTRATING THEIR EFFORTS
ON MORE INTENSIVE INDOCTRINATION OF THE PEOPLE RATHER THAN COMPLYING
WITH A WAVE OF DEMOCRATIC CHANGE AND ECONOMIC REFORMS SWEEPING THE
EAST BLOC, ACCORDING TO THE OBSERVERS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE SOUTH
KOREAN GOVERNMENT.
     "THE NORTH NOW SEEMS TO FEEL A SENSE OF ISOLATION FROM THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WITH THE FALL OF THE STALINIST ROMANIAN
LEADER WITH WHOM NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM IL SUNG HAD SO FAR FELT
AFFINITY," SAID CHOI MOON HYUN, DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR POLICY AT THE
NATIONAL UNIFICATION BOARD.
     NORTH KOREA SENT A CONGRATULATORY MESSAGE TO CEAUSESCU ON THE
OCCASION OF THE 14TH ROMANIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS LAST MONTH IN
WHICH IT STRESSED A JOINT STRUGGLE AGAINST CAPITALISM.  EARLY THIS
MONTH, FOREIGN MINISTER KIM YONG NAM VISITED BUCHAREST TO REAFFIRM
SOLIDARITY IN THE FACE OF DRASTIC CHANGES IN EASTERN EUROPE, CHOI
NOTED.
     "PYONGYANG WILL FIND NO OPTION BUT TO TAKE A POSITIVE POSTURE
IN GLASNOST AND PERESTROIKA IN THE LONG RUN.  THERE ARE SIGNS THAT IT
WOULD EMERGE FROM THE LONG-HELD ISOLATION POLICY DURING THE FIRST
HALF OF NEXT YEAR, IT MAY BE SENSED IN DIALOGUE WITH THE SOUTH,"
HE SAID.
     CHOI BYUNG BO, SPOKESMAN FOR THE BOARD, SOUTH KOREA'S TOP
UNIFICATION AUTHORITY, SAID THE NORTH MIGHT EXPERIMENT WITH OPENNESS
IN ITS SLUGGISH ECONOMY AMONG OTHER FIELDS, LIKE CHINA.
     "WE HEAR THAT THE PACE OF OPENNESS WAS ON THE AGENDA FOR THE
MEETING KIM IL SUNG HAD WITH DENG XIAOPING DURING HIS SUDDEN VISIT TO
BEIJING EARLY LAST MONTH," THE SPOKESMAN SAID.
     THE ANALYSTS GENERALLY RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A SURGE FROM
BELOW, SAYING THOUGH THE LEADERSHIP IS EXPECTED TO ADOPT GRADUAL
REFORMS FROM ABOVE.
     SHIN YOUNG SUK, DIRECTOR OF THE PRIVATE, PEACE RESEARCH
INSTITUTE, ATTRIBUTED THE COLLAPSE OF CEAUSESCU TO THE ROMANIAN
PEOPLE, AWAKENED BY A SERIES OF DEMOCRATIC CHANGES AND THE EAST-WEST
THAW IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES AND A LOT OF "PRO-SOVIET"
GENERALS IN THE ARMED FORCES WHO SUPPORT REFORMS.
     "THE CASE IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF NORTH KOREA.
PYONGYANG'S DEPENDENCY ON MOSCOW IS NOTABLY LOW IN ITS ADROIT
EQUI-DISTANCE DIPLOMACY.  THE MILITARY IS LOYAL TO KIM IL SUNG, AND
THE PEOPLE ARE NOT WELL AWARE OF CURRENT EAST EUROPEAN EVENTS DUE TO
TIGHT CONTROL OF INFORMATION," HE SAID.
     THE NORTH KOREAN MEDIA ON SUNDAY BRIEFLY REPORTED ON UPRISINGS
IN "A FEW" ROMANIAN CITIES WITHOUT MENTIONING ABOUT
CEAUSESCU'S ARREST.
     THE RODONG SHINMUN, THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF NORTH KOREA'S
WORKERS' PARTY, CARRIED A LENGTHY EDITORIAL IN ITS FRONT AND SECOND
PAGES FRIDAY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO "DRIVE AWAY IMPERIALIST
CHALLENGES AND MARCH ON THE PATH OF SOCIALISM WITH MORE VIGOR,"
THE VERY DAY THE ROMANIAN SITUATION CAPTURED HEADLINES IN MOST PAPERS
AROUND THE WORLD.

INDONESIAN PAPER COMPARES CEAUSESCU TO DRACULA+

     JAKARTA, DEC. 27 KYODO - AN INDONESIAN DAILY NEWSPAPER COMMENTED
ON THE EXECUTION OF ROMANIAN PRESIDENT NICOLAE CEAUSESCU ON
WEDNESDAY, COMPARING HIM TO DRACULA AND SAYING NOBODY WHO IS SANE

HARD TO EXPECT A ROMANIAN CITIZEN, OR ANYBODY SANE FOR THAT MATTER,
TO MOURN THE DEATH BY A FIRING SQUAD OF ROMANIAN LEADER, DICTATOR
NICOLAE CEAUSESCU AND HIS WIFE, ELENA."
     IT ADDED, "SOME PEOPLE, WHILE SAYING 'GOOD RIDDANCE,' MIGHT
HAVE WISHED THE EXECUTION TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE YEARS BEFORE CEAUSESCU
AND HIS SECRET POLICE HAD THE CHANCE TO COMMIT SUCH GENOCIDE AGAINST
ROMANIAN PEOPLE EVEN COUNT DRACULA WOULD HAVE BEEN REAL SICK OF."
     COUNT DRACULA WAS A FICTIONAL VAMPIRE WHO LIVED IN
TRANNSYLVANIA, A REGION IN WESTERN ROMANIA.
     THE EDITORIAL SAID CEAUSESCU HAD NOT ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED AS
"SATANIC," AND AT ONE POINT IN HISTORY HE EVEN DELIGHTED THE
WEST WITH HIS INDEPENDENT VIEWS AS FAR AS MOSCOW-LED COMMUNISM WAS
CONCERNED.
     "CEAUSESCU WAS AFTER ALL ANOTHER DICTATOR WHO HAS FOUND HIS
DEMISE IN A WAY THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME A SOMBER PROMISE FOR RULERS
REFUSING TO CLIMB OFF THE TIGER THEY ARE RIDING WHILE THE DISMOUNTING
IS STILL SAFE," THE EDITORIAL CONCLUDED.
     INDONESIAN NEWSPAPERS HEADLINED THE EXECUTION OF CEAUSESCU AND
HIS WIFE IN THEIR WEDNESDAY EDITIONS.

CHINESE ARMY REFUSED TO CRUSH BEIJING DEMOS, PAPER SAYS+

     HONG KONG, DEC. 28 KYODO - OVER 1,500 SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS OF
CHINA'S 38TH GROUP ARMY REFUSED ORDERS OR DESERTED THEIR POSTS
DURING THE MILITARY CRACKDOWN ON BEIJING'S PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT IN
APRIL AND JUNE, HONG KONG'S SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST SAID THURSDAY.
     THE BEIJING-BASED 38TH GROUP ARMY WAS FIRST ORDERED BY SENIOR
CHINESE LEADER DENG XIAOPING, THE THEN CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY'S
CENTRAL MILITARY COMMISSION (CMC), TO SEVERELY RESTRICT
DEMONSTRATORS' ACTIVITIES IN LATE APRIL THE REPORT SAID.
     BUT THE 38TH GROUP'S ARMY'S COMMANDER AND 110 OTHER OFFICERS
"BREACHED DISCIPLINE IN A SERIOUS MANNER DURING THE STRUGGLE TO
CRUSH THE COUNTER-REVELUTIONARY REBELLION," ACCORDING TO A SENIOR
PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY (PLA) LEADER QUOTED BY THE DAILY.
     THE REVELATION CAME IN AN UNPUBLISHED SPEECH MADE IN BEIJING
EARLIER THIS MONTH BY YANG BAIBING, CHIEF POLITICAL COMMISSAR OF
CHINA'S PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY, THE REPORT SAID.
    YANG BAIBING, YOUNGER BROTHER OF CHINESE PRESIDENT YANG SHANGKUN,
MADE THE SPEECH AT A CONFERENCE TO BOOST THE ARMY'S POLITICAL
PROGRAM.
    IN THE SPEECH -- COPIES OF WHICH ARE SAID TO BE CIRCULATING AMONG
SENIOR ARMY AND PARTY OFFICIALS -- YANG STRESSED THE NEED FOR
INCREASED IDEOLOGICAL WORK TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE OF DISCIPLINE
PROBLEMS, THE REPORT SAID.
     THE NEWSPAPER QUOTED YANG AS SAYING THAT 1,400 SOLDIERS OF THE
38TH GROUP ARMY "SHED THEIR WEAPONS AND RAN AWAY."
     YANG NAMED 38TH GROUP ARMY COMMANDER XU QINXIAN AS ONE OF 21
SENIOR OFFICERS WHO DISOBEYED CMC ORDERS.
     XU QINXIAN WAS COURT-MARTIALED AND GIVEN A STIFF SENTENCE IN THE
AUTUMN, THE REPORT SAID.
     YANG'S SPEECH MARKS THE FIRST TIME CHINESE AUTHORITIES HAVE
ADMITTED THE EXTENT TO WHICH ARMY OFFICERS DISOBEYED TOP-LEVEL ORDERS
TO ENFORCE MARTIAL LAW IN BEIJING AND OTHER PARTS OF CHINA.
     PREVIOUS STATEMENTS HAVE STRESSED ARMY AND PARTY UNITY OVER THE
WAY THE PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMEMT WAS PUT DOWN, ANALYSTS SAID.
     THE TOPPLING AND EXECUTION OF HARD-LINE ROMANIAN COMMUNIST
LEADER NICOLAE CEAUSESCU, IN WHICH THE ROMANIAN ARMY PLAYED A MAJOR
ROLE, HAS PROMPTED THE CMC TO TIGHTEN ITS CONTROL OVER THE PLA THEY
SAID.
     YANG BAIBING ALSO MADE A STRONG ATTACK ON FORMER CHINESE
COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF ZHAO ZIYANG, THE REPORT SAID.
     ZHAO -- WIDELY SEEN AS THE ARCHITECT OF CHINA'S ECONOMIC REFORM
POLICIES -- WAS STRIPPED OF ALL POSTS FOR HIS SUPPORT OF THE
PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT IN JUNE.
     YANG ACCUSED ZHAO OF HAVING UNDERMINED THE WORK OF THE PLA'S
GENERAL POLITICAL DEPARTMENT.
     ZHAO'S AIM WAS "TO MEET THE POLITICAL NEEDS OF THOSE WHO
ADVOCATE BOURGEOIS LIBERALIZATION," YANG WAS QUOTED AS SAYING.
     "THEIR GOAL IS TO OVERTHROW (THE EXISTING ORDER) AND TO BUILD
UP A NEW ONE," YANG ADDED IN THE STRONGEST CRITICISM YET OF THE
FORMER LIBERAL LEADER.

INDIA TO WITHDRAW TROOPS IN SRI LANKA BY NEXT MARCH+

     NEW DELHI, DEC. 28 KYODO - INDIA WILL POSSIBLY WITHDRAW ITS
PEACE-KEEPING FORCE FROM SRI LANKA BY MARCH 31 NEXT YEAR, FOREIGN
MINISTER INDER KUMAR GUJRAL INFORMED THE LOWER HOUSE THURSDAY.
     THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT THE INDIAN PEACE-KEEPING FORCE
WOULD VACATE MOST OF THE NORTHEASTERN PROVINCE OF THE ISLAND NATION
BY DECEMBER 31.
     EARLIER, SRI LANKAN FOREIGN MINISTER RANJAN WIJERATNE VISITED
INDIA FROM DECEMBER 6-8 FOR DISCUSSIONS WITH NEW DELHI'S NEW
NATIONAL FRONT GOVERNMENT ON THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE PEACE-KEEPING
FORCE.
     INDIA HAD UP TO 52,000 TROOPS IN THE NORTHEASTERN PROVINCE OF
SRI LANKA IN LINE WITH THE 1987 INDO-SRI LANKA PEACE ACCORD WHICH
SOUGHT TO END A BLOODY TAMIL SEPARATIST CAMPAIGN.
     THE LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM, THE LARGEST AND MOST
MILITANT OF TAMIL GROUPS, REPUDIATED THE PEACE PACT PROMPTING A MAJOR
INDIAN OFFENSIVE TO DISARM THE GROUP AND PROTECT TAMILS IN THE
REGION.
     HOWEVER, TO CURB THE ETHNIC VIOLENCE WHICH HAS CLAIMED OVER
17,000 LIVES IN THE LAST SIX YEARS, SRI LANKAN PRESIDENT RANASINGHE
PREMADSA HAS DEMANDED THAT THE INDIAN TROOPS LEAVE BY JULY 29, THE
SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIGNING OF THE PEACE ACCORD.
     THE THEN INDIAN PRIME MINISTER, RAJIV GANDHI, REJECTED THE
DEMAND, SAYING A HASTY WITHDRAWAL COULD LEAD TO MORE BLOODSHED.
     THE THREE-MONTH DIPLOMATIC DEADLOCK ENDED ON SEPTEMBER 18 WHEN
THE TWO COUNTRIES SIGNED AN AGREEMENT IN WHICH INDIA AGREED TO
WITHDRAW ITS REMAINING 43,000 TROOPS AND TO END HOSTILITIES WITH THE
MILITANT TAMIL GROUP.

REPERCUSSIONS OF THE FALL OF THE HARD-LINE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT IN
ROMANIA, ANALYSTS SAID.

     Friday's market plunge after credit card capping reveals the

     Friday's market plunge after credit card capping reveals the
extent of Administration dismay on economic policy and shows a
split between the President's advisers.
     Pat Buchanan's sudden appearance as a challenger signals real
problems for Bush presidential campaign, which is a long way from
getting started. He also may face David Duke and possibly others.
     Is this the week for Mario Cuomo? Nobody knows for sure. It is
unthinkable that he won't announce after all the backing and
filling, but it is still not a done deal.
     Despite being badly beaten, David Duke still poses serious
problems for the Republican Party and George Bush.
     Senate outlook for Republicans is so grim that Majority Leader
Robert Dole is dead serious in possibly bowing out rather than
seeking re-election.

BUSH ADMINISTRATION
     Economic Policy: Amid all the confusion, it is now clear that
Bush will not press for a tax cut package until the State of the
Union address. In so doing, the President has put himself in the
middle of three groups inside his Administration on strategy about
how to handle the recession.
     Group #1: This is largely Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
all by himself. He is into optimism on the economy, contending that
recovery is at hand and arguing against "talking down" the economy.
His comments on Meet the Press Sunday were viewed as "not helpful"
by one key Republican insider but nobody wants to take on the
President's close associate.
     Group #2: The economy is in bad shape and it's absolutely
essential that something be done now. HUD Secretary Jack Kemp is
the only cabinet member who publicly takes this position, but he
has substantial support from conservatives in Congress led by Rep.
Vin Weber (R-Minn.).
     Group #3: The economy is poor, but this is not the time to
move. Since it will be very difficult to make any progress in the
Democratic Congress at any rate, why not wait until next year? This
is the view of a majority inside the Administration (including
Budget Director Richard Darman) and much of the Congressional
Republican leadership.
     Bush has moved quietly from Group #1 to Group #3. On his
political travels he has heard the sad story of economic woe from
"Team 100" members (GOP heavy financial contributors) who tell him
they simply no longer have the resources to put out the
contributions that they used to. He wants action, but doesn't
really know what to do and isn't ready to do it now.
     Against this backdrop is deep irritation, particularly from
Chief-of-Staff John Sununu, that Kemp went public in declaring his
wishes for an immediate tax cut. Kemp has no intention of quitting,
and the President has no intention of firing him. But the tension
is such that it is hard to imagine how the current state of affairs
can continue indefinitely.
     Kemp is privately urging Bush to call for a special session of
Congress to deal with the economy, but his status is shown by the
fact that the President signed the bill gouging Kemp's efforts to
privatize public housing.
     Credit Card Cap: The President's support of a "voluntary"
credit card cap and subsequent Senate passage of a "mandatory" cap
reflect the lack of economic strategy both in the White House and
on Capitol Hill.
     1) The idea originated at a secret political planning meeting
Nov. 6 by formal and informal Bush advisers. Ex-White House Chief-
of-Staff Ken Duberstein urged that the President start "demagoging"
on credit card interest rates. The reaction around the dinner was
mixed.
     2) Duberstein's idea crept into the White House bloodstream
and got some support from Sununu. Although it was not officially
part of the text, the President included it in a New York
speech.
     3) Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R.-N.Y.), facing a tough re-election,
took off with the idea and ran; and a Senate wanting to do
something passed the proposal. Speaker Thomas Foley (D.-Wash.)
responded that he would hurry the bill through the House pronto.
Bush's economic gurus were apoplectic, and CEA Chief Michael Boskin
railed against it at the senior staff meeting two days later.
     4) That set up two distinct schools of thought in the Bush
camp. The policy people--Brady, Darman, Boskin, Kemp--are appalled
by the whole idea. The politicians--Republican National Chairman
Clayton Yuetter, Charlie Black, Craig Fuller and Duberstein--think
it's a terrific idea.
     5) Last Saturday after the credit card cap appeared to have
played its part in the Friday market drop, Kemp--appearing on the
Evans & Novak program on CNN--declared Bush would veto the D'Amato
bill. It is extremely doubtful that Kemp had a real authorization
from the President to go this far, but he is a fearless soul not
averse to taking chances. The next day, Brady and VP Dan Quayle
took the same stance, though a little bit more chary about
predicting a veto.
     6) That leaves Bush in the position of making sure that a bill
will not pass that embodies the position he wanted the banks to
take voluntarily. It is a straddle that would make any politician
look uncomfortable.
     7) It is clear now that the credit card cap will not become
law, but the mischief of a policy vacuum becomes obvious. With the
economy down, deadlock between the branches of government and the
budget deal impeding action, frustration both downtown and on the
Hill can cause severe trouble.
     RTC Financing: The coming battleground, perhaps this week, is
the attempt by Weber and other House conservatives not to let the
RTC financing bill pass without aa economic growth package
attached. Weber is insisting on a capital gains rate reduction and
an elimination of the "passive loss" provision from  the '86 reform
act.
     Kemp, as befits his character, has jumped in to support the
Weber proposal. Establishment Republican Senators, intimidated by
Democratic power, think messing around with the bailout is sheer
madness. This is the kind of proposal that the Bush Administration
would veer away from quickly, but oddly it has said nothing about
it one way or another as we go to press.
     The question is whether the House GOPers can even bring this
onto the floor under the right rules there, which is why they would
like some collaborators in the Senate to take advantage of the
easier rules there. Conservative House members are looking at House
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) to see which way he will go on
this one; some colleagues see him trying to straddle the Bush White
House and the House bomb-throwers.
     U.S-China: If Secretary of State James Baker has actually
succeeded in reducing China's arm sales proclivity, not many in
Washington believe it. But there is no doubt that Beijing's
hardliners are not as powerful as they were in the aftermath of
Tiananmen Square. Outside Beijing, the Chinese are paying very
little attention to their government and the free-market
experiments continue in the South.
     This is the China that White House advocates of continued MFN
status point to whenever the topic is broached. Denying those
potential markets to U.S. business, they say, will guarantee that
the Japanese and other Asian players will dominate the Pacific for
years to come. Both the Japanese and Taiwanese believe they can use
the coming integration of Hong Kong into China as a springboard for
ventures in South China.
     All of this will come to the fore when Congress reacts to
Baker's failure to get human rights pledges from the Chinese. With
only limited success on other fronts, the Administration will
likely fall back on economic arguments to keep the MFN window to
China open. Beijing's conditional pledge not to sell missiles to
Syria or Pakistan won't carry much weight with Congressmen who
think such sales shouldn't even be contemplated and does nothing to
address nuclear assistance to Iran. But the White House is helped
by the Democrats' insistence on focusing on domestic events.

PRESIDENTIAL '92

     Buchanan: His sudden appearance at the door, presumably to
run, makes life difficult for the White House. What does he have in
mind?
     1) Almost certainly, he will run. He cannot again pull up to
the line as he did in '87 and then pull away. His announcement is
expected at the end of next week.
     2) He is not merely interested in pulling Bush back to the
Reaganite conservative positions that Buchanan thinks the President
has abandoned (notably the tax issue and quotas) but to stake out
the nationalistic "America First" agenda he has been airing out
over television and in his column: protectionist on trade,
exclusionist on immigration, isolationist on foreign intervention.
     3) A realist, Buchanan knows he cannot be nominated. But an
impressive performance would put him on the top of the '96 list,
where he would now be an also-ran. His underlying premise must be:
can '92 do for Buchanan in '96 what '76 did for Reagan in '80?
     4) That means Buchanan is not interested in a quick pop in New
Hampshire but wants to stay in as long as possible, picking up lots
of delegates to take to Houston.
     All this hinges on how Buchanan does in N.H.:
     1) Apart from the Manchester Union Leader and possibly ex-Rep.
Chuck Douglas (R), Buchanan does not have much in the way of
conventional endorsements. Even State Sen. (and ex-U.S. Sen.)
Gordon Humphrey (R) is not helping.
     2) Sununu, who guided Bush to victory there in '88, is less
influential as Chief-of-Staff and has not enhanced his popularity
with repeated political interventions from the White House the past
three years.
     3) Buchanan's right-wing populism--and anti-foreign aid
strictures--should play well in New Hampshire's deep recession.
     4) His opposition to Desert Storm is a negative, but less so
today than it would have been nine months ago.
     5) The question of how Bush reacts to Buchanan is a difficult
one, and has not even been addressed at the White House.
     Duke: There has never been any doubt that once Duke lost his
race for Governor of Louisiana, he would enter the presidential
primaries. It looks as though he will stay out of N.H. to see how
Buchanan does there but enter all the southern primaries.
     Other Republican Candidates: Critics of Bush who don't care
for Buchanan would like a supply-side, pro-Israel, free trade, free
immigration, internationalist alternative. Kemp and former
Education Secretary William J. Bennett both fill the bill, but
neither has the slightest intention of running against Bush.
     Bush: He is his own campaign manager and all reports show that
he is not happy about the way things are going. The delay in naming
the proposed triumvirate of Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher,
political consultant Robert Teeter and businessman Fred Malek leads
to musing that he is not happy with that set-up.
     Reports from the inside suggest that Sununu may be brought
over from the White House to run the campaign with either Brady or
Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner taking over at the White
House. But the odds are against it. Another version has a more
important role for Charlie Black.
     Cuomo: Almost everybody thinks this is the week he will
announce his candidacy, but nobody is sure. They are swimming
upstream but two astute Mario-watchers think he will say
no--figuring in the end his unsureness will lead him not to run.
     No other figure in American political life would go through
the process that Cuomo has for the last month and then destroy
himself by saying no, but with the Governor that is barely
possible.
     If on the other hand, he does what is rational and announces
his candidacy shortly before or after Thanksgiving, here is the
outlook:
     1) By design or not, Cuomo's delay has radically shortened the
game--to his advantage and to the disadvantage of lesser known
candidates. In a short campaign for the New Hampshire primary, he
has a huge edge in name i.d., money and campaigning experience. If
he wins comfortably in New Hampshire, he could be off and running
for the nomination.
     2) How much Cuomo has hurt himself with this minuet is hard to
say. The reporters don't like it and neither do many politicians,
but it shouldn't make much difference to politicians.
     3) The conventional wisdom of six months ago, that Cuomo was
the only Democrat who could have a chance to overtake an invincible
Bush, has turned into the current conventional wisdom that he is
the one of the least effective challengers of a wounded Bush.
     4) Cuomo's greatest liability is the fiscal crisis of New
York. Whereas Dukakis in '88 campaigned with the benefit of the
Massachusetts Miracle, Cuomo this time would have to campaign with
the burden of the New York Nightmare. Cuomo was a bit rough two
weeks ago in answering questions from his own constituents over the
televised ombudsman's program. Think what it will be like with the
media.
     Clinton: Mario-mania has eclipsed Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton,
but so far he looks like the pick of the Demo litter. He has his
act in order and impresses everywhere. He is a long way from being
a regional candidate and is on the verge of locking up some big New
York money.
     Kerrey: Those who expected Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) to be the
salvation of the Democratic party are a little disappointed. One
party insider told us he personally looks a little "weak"--a
strange description for a war hero. He did attract some attention
for audacity this week, however, by going after some anti-Mario
public employees' unions in New York.

POLITICS '91

     Louisiana Governor: Edwin Edwards (D) prevented what was
widely regarded across the political spectrum as a political
catastrophe in the election of David Duke. But neither party can
take much satisfaction in the results--particularly the Republicans
(who from Washington provided more strategic and logistic help in
beating Duke than was generally realized).
     1) Even with all the incredibly heavy baggage carried by Duke,
Democrats still showed they have a terrible time getting white
votes in the South--particularly white, middle-class males. While
Duke's 55 per cent of the white vote was lower than conventional
Republican candidates get in Louisiana, he collected more than 60
per cent of white males, white Protestants and middle-income
voters.
     2) Apart from the catastrophe of Duke running as the GOP
candidate for governor, the state GOP was nearly wiped out. Lt.
Gov. Paul Hardy (R) was defeated for re-election, and Secretary of
State Fox McKeithen's (R) re-election was the only statewide win.
The state party is set back about 12 years by Duke.
     3) The GOP is not through with Duke. He seems set on
continuing his '92 game plan of running against Bush in the
southern primaries and then running back in La. either against Sen.
John Breaux (D) or Rep. Jerry Huckaby (D).
     4) Worst of all, Bush did not get the specter of DD off his
back. Democrats now will accuse any Republican, including the
President, who raises the quota issue of imitating David Duke (even
Edwards attempted it in his victory statement Saturday night).

SENATE '92
     In the wake of the Pennsylvania debacle, Senate GOP Campaign
Committee Chairman Phil Gramm (R-Tex.)is putting the best face on
it, saying the race showed that insiders are vulnerable and there
are more Democratic insiders than Republicans. The key, however, is
for Republicans to run on "issues not on your resume" as Gramm
thinks Dick Thornburgh did in Pennsylvania. But the bottomline
remains that the GOP has not been able to recruit top-drawer
candidates for several vulnerable seats.
     Dole was really stricken by the Thornburgh loss and what it
means for his leadership in the Senate. He never really expected to
be returned to Majority Leader after the '92 election, but worries
now of forces so depleted that he will be leading a corporal's
guard. If Thornburgh can go down in Pennsylvania, can the Demos
pick up open seats in Utah and Idaho?

SPECIAL REPORT FROM ISRAEL

     With bilateral talks between Israel and, separately, Jordan-
Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese likely to start soon, Israel
confronts severe problems. Reporting from the scene, we make the
following points:
     1) Pressures grow from American Jewish leaders for territorial
and political compromises with Palestinians, who gained stature out
of the Madrid meeting. An Israeli poll shows 70 per cent of Israeli
voters favor the land-for-peace concept, but leaders say no.
     2) Record unemployment plus huge costs of handling Soviet
Jewish emigres threaten Israel's worst economic crisis. Current
record jobless of 145,000 will swell close to 250,000 in 1992. The
state-controlled economy does not seem able to convert fully to
free-market.
     3) Despite a new settlement on the Golan Heights and three on
the West Bank, doubts increase as to long-term viability of
settlements. Jewish immigrants are being quietly steered to
settlements despite U.S. warnings. Government officials now fear
another major battle with President Bush in January over the $10
million loan guarantees denied Israel in September.
     4) But there is an up-beat note: private talks with top
leaders show definite movement toward a general agreement that
Israel not only must but will make real compromises at least on the
Palestinian question. Heavy political pressures from the Bush
Administration, U.S. Jewish lobby and Western Europeans are helping
change winds here in Israel, the most politically sensitive country
in the world.

DiStaso and the RNC Counsel's Office:

1/6:   SC debate, carried by CNN.
1/7:   NH GOP fund-raiser, $1,000/head, each candidate expected

MATCHING FUNDS:  DOLE CERTIFIED FOR BIGGEST PAYOUT TODAY

     The FEC has certified more than $37 million in matching
funds to go to 10 pres. candidates in the first pay-out for the
primaries.  The Treasury Dept. will make the disbursements today
but due to a shortfall in the presidential campaign fund, the
actual amounts sent will be less than the certified amount.  The
campaigns will receive the full allotment once the the fund is
replenished from checkoffs from '95 income tax returns.  During
the primaries, campaigns can qualify for federal matching funds
if they receive $5,000 in contributions of $250 or less per
indivudal in 20 states.  The govt. then matches contributions of
$250 or less raised by qualified campaigns.  In return,
candidates must abide by spending limits in the different states.

           AMOUNT CERTIFIED 12/27
Dole         $ 9,265,291
Clinton        9,014,645
Gramm          6,653,919
Buchanan       3,977,007
Alexander      3,226,450
Lugar          2,275,051
Wilson         1,591,393

NEW HAMPSHIRE:  DOLE RISES IN LATE-DECEMBER POLL

     16 delegates.  An American Research Group poll, conducted
12/19-22, surveyed 560 likely GOP primary voters; margin of error
+/- 4.2% (release, 12/27).

       12/19-22   12/5-7   11/8-9
Dole      42%       30%     27%
Forbes    11         9       7
Buchanan  10        13      17
Gramm      9         3       3
Alexander  6         5       6
Lugar      2         2       6
Dornan     1         0       0
Keyes      1         0       3
Taylor     1         0       0
Undec.    17        37      31

     Pollster Dick Bennett said the poll and focus groups "show
the negative advertising by Forbes aimed at Dole and Gramm has
backfired. ... Bennett said the ads have only strengthened the
loyalty of voters previously leaning toward Dole and Gramm"
(Rezendes, BOSTON GLOBE, 12/29).
     FINAL STAGE:  Manchester UNION LEADER's DiStaso writes the
NH primary "moves into its final, frenzied stage" today as NH
voters will be "bombarded" with TV, radio and mail messages for
the next six weeks (1/1).  Both Dole and Buchanan attended
Concord's famed "First Night" festivities.  300 revelers waited
in line to have their pictures taken with Bob and Liddy.  An
estimated 12,000 attended (Schmitt, CONCORD MONITOR, 1/1).

IOWA:  SIX WEEKS TO GO, LAST HURRAH FOR THE HAWKEYE STATE?

     25 delegates.  DES MOINES REGISTER's Yepsen writes for
"political addicts" it's already been a "long campaign" in IA and
the "most intense phase is just starting."  For "real people" the
campaign thus far has been "background music" and they are just
now tuning in.  It is possible '96 will mark the last time the IA
caucuses will "amount to much" as LA has successfully supplanted
IA's first in the nation status.  Up to now, "there's been little
movement.  Bob Dole is ahead."  But there is a "softness" to
Dole's support which leaves him "vulnerable."   The current
"flavor-of-the-month" challenging Dole is Steve Forbes, but
history shows such flavors "melt on caucus night for lack of
organization."  Forbes, Gramm, Alexander and Buchanan are all
"bunched up" behind Dole and anyone of them could finish second.
Polls currently show it will be Forbes, but county GOP officials
say it will "probably" be Gramm.  "The truth is, no one knows."
One thing certain: "whoever finishes in fourth place or below can
start to shut down their campaigns" (1/1).

SOUTH CAROLINA:  DOLE SLIPS, BUT SO DOES GRAMM

     37 delegates.  A Columbia STATE/WIS-TV poll, conducted
12/26-27 by Mason-Dixon/PMR, surveyed 427 likely GOP primary
voters; margin of error +/- 4.7% (1/2).  The SC primary is 3/2.

GOP PRIMARY   NOW   5/95      FAV/UNFAV    ID
Dole          40%   49%       46%/19%      100%
Gramm         17    22        35 /18       81

Buchanan       8     4        31 /32       93
Alexander      3     5        20 /11       59

Undec.        16    16

     ANALYSIS:  While Gramm "has practically moved into South
Carolina, turning it into a make-or-break state," he "has failed
to make any headway" against Dole.  Gramm SC dir. Jim Merrill
"downplay[ed] the lack of movement, saying things will turn
around when they start buying their own TV time this year":
"There's no doubt Forbes is climbing.  Let's face it: If you took
Gumby and spent a quarter of a million dollars, he would also
reflect well in the polls.  [Forbes is] kind of like a crazy
professor out there saying nice things about himself.  People
don't know that he's pro-choice, that he's probably more liberal
than Bob Dole is."  Pat Buchanan's "poor showing isn't
surprising, considering the issues driving the electorate."  The
poll shows voters are "far more interested in economic issues
than in the social issues he's more closely identified with"
(Scoppe, Columbia STATE, 1/2).
     DEBATE:  The SC GOP will hold a one-hour debate 1/6, to be
televised on CNN and WIS-TV.  At the close of filing 12/31, the
party reported Alexander, Gramm, Lugar, Buchanan, Forbes, Dole,
Taylor and Keyes will be on the SC primary ballot (SC GOP
release, 12/31).  Dornan did not file.

OTHER EARLY STATES:  A RHODE TO NOWHERE

     LOUISIANA (30 delegates):  USA TODAY's Keen profiles the 2/6
LA caucus battle between Phil Gramm and Pat Buchanan.  The other
candidates have pledged to stay out in deference to IA.  GOP
activist Bryan Wagner: "Unfortunately for Buchanan, Louisiana is
located next to Texas, and Gramm has spent years doing
fundraisers and making himself known and appreciated in
Louisiana."  Buchanan predicts he'll "take delegates away from
Gramm in his own back yard": "[Gramm] came down here on the
proposition that he's the only one who can beat Dole.  Well, Phil
knows he's now in the race with an authentic conservative. ... If
we can come out of Louisiana with a dramatic showing, I think
it's all over for Phil Gramm" (1/2).  Morry Taylor and "several
Louisiana residents" filed a lawsuit to block the LA caucuses,
contending the event violates the Voting Rights Act,
discriminating against minorities by making it more difficult for
them to participate.  LA also holds a 3/12 primary, but the bulk
of delegates are selected 2/6.  IA GOP Chair Brian Kennedy
"praised" Taylor for "taking action" (Yepsen, DES MOINES
REGISTER, 12/23).
     DELAWARE (12 delegates):  Only Phil Gramm and Steve Forbes
have filed for the GOP primary so the chairs of DE's two parties
want the DE legislature to pass a law that allows the parties to
have the power to place candidates on the ballot (DiStaso,
Manchester UNION LEADER, 12/28).  At the 12/27 filing deadline,
ex-Gov. Elbert Carvel, 85, filed as the only other candidate on
the Dem primary ballot, besides Lyndon LaRouche.  Carvel is on
the ballot to keep LaRouche from winning delegates.  Carvel said
he would surrender his delegates to Pres. Clinton.  Clinton did
not file due to the state's decision to hold its primary inside
the NH's one-week "window" on 2/24.  If LaRouche were to win
delegates, the DNC would undoubtedly deny credentialling them, as
the party has not sanctioned DE's primary date.
     RHODE ISLAND (16 delegates):  Three candidates failed to
qualify for the 3/5 RI GOP primary ballot.  The official ballot,
as announced 12/28 by RI Sec/State James Langevin (D), does not
contain the names of Phil Gramm, Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes.
1,000 valid signatures were required to qualify.  The Buchanan
campaign, just 19 signatures short, said it would challenge the
decision.  The Gramm campaign said RI was not a big priority and
would focus on other states that day.   Alexander manager Dan
Pero: "The Gramm campaign has spent $20 million winning straw
polls, but it doesn't even get on the ballot in a state with real
delegates" (release, 12/29).
     MINNESOTA (33 delegates):  Dole "has largely fallen off the
radar screen" in MN, a state he won in '88.  His once "small
presence" in MN "disappeared completely" when a small office was
shut down.  Dole aides "dispute that it was even a campaign
office, but backers see the move as virtually conceding" the 3/5
MN caucuses to Phil Gramm.  MN GOP chair Chris Georgacas:
"There's no question Gramm's got a very strong organization built
down to the lower echelons of the party."  Conservative activist
Allen Quist: "Dole does not receive much enthusiasm from
conservatives" (Glover, AP, 12/30).

NATIONAL ISSUES CONVENTION:  LIST OF NO-SHOWS GROWS

     The Nat'l Issues Convention -- a four-day conference to take
place in Austin, TX 1/18-21, billed as an "experiment in informed
democracy" -- is "having difficulty wooing presidential
candidates to participate."  Bob Dole and Lamar Alexander have
already declined invitations, and a Phil Gramm spokesperson said
Gramm "likely will not participate."  Only Steve Forbes said he
would go; neither Pres. Clinton nor Pat Buchanan has announced a
decision on attending.  Univ. of TX's James Fishkin, one of the
convention organizers (along with PBS), said the NIC was supposed
to be a "social science experiment and not a candidate forum,"
with about 600 people picked randomly from across the nation to
learn about issues.  Fishkin: "The candidates who want to speak
to the concerns of the public can do so. ... We think that in the
long run we will have more participation than you think" (Walt,
HOUSTON CHRONICLE, 12/28).

DOLE:  GET READY FOR THE CAVALCADE OF GOVS

     DES MOINES REGISTER's Yepsen reports the Dole campaign is
planning a 1/6 rally in Des Moines to showcase some of the 20 GOP
gov. endorsements they have.  There are currently 31 GOP govs.
nationwide (including LA's Foster).  IA Dole manager Darrell
Kearney expects "at least" 9 or 10 govs. will attend, that will
be followed by "caucus training session" in some of IA's larger
cities to work on "boosting turnout" and generating some media
attention.  Kearney: "It's quite a coup for us to have these
governors here blitzing the state" (12/29).
     THE FEAR FACTOR:  Dole Dep. Chair Bill Lacy: "I am more
scared of this campaign making a mistake than anything the other
guys can do. ... We are in control of or own fate at this point.
I don't think there is a single thing out there that Phil Gramm
or Steve Forbes or Lamar Alexander or Pat Buchanan can do that
could sort of alter the dynamics of the race so fundamentally
that it would deny us the nomination" (Raasch, GANNETT, 12/28).
     THE AGE FACTOR:  BOSTON GLOBE's Nyhan, urging Lamar
Alexander to utilize the age issue, notes the Pope was born
5/18/20, Dole 7/22/23 (12/27).  NEWSWEEK's Fineman profiles Bob
and Liddy Dole under header, "This is their Washington life --
the one you won't see in Dole's campaign ads" (1/8 issue).
     NEW ADS:  Dole's campaign began running new ads 12/22 in NH
and IA.  IA FULL TEXT ("One of Us/Midwestern Values"; 30 secs.,
produced by Stuart Stevens) -- DOLE: "As a young man in a small
town, my parents taught me to put faith in God, not government
and never confuse the two."  ANNCR: "Bob Dole's midwest values
make him one of us.  He's fighting for our conservative agenda:
1) Demanding Hollywood stop corrupting our children; 2)
Protecting our children's future with a balanced budget;  3)
Strengthening working families with a $500 per child tax credit.
Bob Dole. The character and courage to lead America" (AP, 12/28).

FORBES:  IN PERSON AND ON THE TUBE

     In a profile, N.Y. TIMES' Kolbert notes in his public
remarks, Forbes "mentions his opponents only in passing.  But in
his commercials, he takes aim at them directly.  He was the first
candidate in the race to run negative commercials, and his media
campaign has been devoted at least as much to attacking Mr. Dole
and Mr. Gramm as it has been to touting his own ideas."  Forbes'
ad strategy "is unusual for someone so little known.  Generally,
candidates try to establish their own credentials before starting
to attack their opponents, and even some of Mr. Forbes' allies
worry privately that the approach is flawed.  But at least for
now, it appears to be having the desired impact."  GOP consultant
Sal Russo, "who has conducted focus groups for Mr. Forbes but is
not working on his campaign": "He's rewriting the Presidential
rules."  Forbes manager Bill Dal Col "predicted Forbes would do
'exceptionally well'" in DE 2/24 and "forecasted a strong
showing" in the 2/27 AZ primary, "where the Forbes campaign
appears to be breaking spending records."  Gramm media adviser
Alex Castellanos: "Nobody wants to get chased down the street by
a mad billionaire with a squash racket. ... Money can buy you
love.  But it can't buy you the Presidency" (1/1).
     LATEST ANTI-DOLE AD:  The Forbes campaign began airing a new
TV ad.  ANNCR: "A choice for Republicans on wasteful spending.
Million dollar pensions for Congress paid for by taxpayers?
Steve Forbes says no, politicians shouldn't receive taxpayer-
funded pensions.  Bob Dole says yes.  Bob Dole voted to increase
tax-payer-funded congressional pensions.  Two men.  Different
values.  Bob Dole -- Washington values.  Steve Forbes --
conservative values" (Forbes release, 12/21).
     FLAT TAX:  TIME's Birnbaum writes "the flat tax is becoming
the hottest new issue" in the race.  On 1/9, Jack Kemp's tax
reform commission "will make its own proposal to flatten the
federal income tax."  Bob Dole, a co-sponsor of the commission,
"is expected to endorse it."  The idea "is picking up so much
steam that the real estate lobby is planning" to broadcast radio
ads in IA and NH "to pressure candidates not to make their tax
plans too flat" (1/8 issue).

GRAMM:  FAULTS DOLE IN BUDGET BATTLE

     At breakfast with 150 IA supporters, Phil Gramm "criticized"
GOP leaders -- Bob Dole "in particular -- for bungling the
federal budget battle."  Gramm "said Dole ... has failed to get
the Republican Party's point across in the debate": "This is one
of those deals where virtually everything our leadership has done
has been a mistake and everything Bill Clinton has done has been
right politically. ... When was the last time you heard Bob Dole
give a response to Bill Clinton where you said, 'That hit is
exactly on the head'?  I can tell you I don't remember the last
time it happened."  Gramm added that failure to deliver the GOP
message to voters is giving Clinton the edge in opinion polls,
and may lead to his re-election: "If we're going to deliver it,
we're going to win or lose against Clinton based on our ability
to communicate with independents, conservative Democrats, blue-
collar workers, people who get their hands dirty working for a
living.  I believe I can do that.  I think there's no chance in
this world Senator Dole can do it."  He said a GOP compromise on
the budget would cause voters to lose confidence in the party:
"Republicans did not say we would balance the budget only if Bill
Clinton joins us.  We didn't say we'd balance the federal budget
if it's easy.  We didn't even say we would do it if it was
popular.  We said we would do it. ... If we don't live up to the
commitment we made in 1994, how is anybody going to believe
anything we say in 1996?" (Hartman, DES MOINES REGISTER, 12/29).
     WINS DOLE BACKERS IN IA:  Two of Dole's IA county chairs
have switched to Gramm, "who they say is stronger anti-abortion
advocate."  Dallas Co. co-chair Peggy Hermann and Warren Co. co-
chair Terri Hall "said Dole has waffled on the abortion issue."
Hall: "[Dole] led me to believe he was 100 percent pro-life --
clearly he is not" (REGISTER, 12/29).
     TRASHES THE BUREAUCRATS:  Gramm, on "Brinkley": "Have you
missed the government?  I mean, doesn't it strike you funny that
200 government -- 280,000 government employees -- are furloughed,
large segments of the government are shut down.  I think this
proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that we need to go back and
eliminate another 150- to 200,000 bureaucratic positions in the
federal government."  Gramm asked whether his campaign was
"washed up": "I believe that I am in good shape in Iowa, I think
we're building a base of support in New Hampshire.  There are
only two candidates that have a nationwide organization.  There
are only two candidates that in the end can win the nomination,
and they're Bob Dole and myself" (ABC, 12/31).

ALEXANDER:  SAYS FOCUS ON BALANCED BUDGET HURTS GOP

     Lamar Alexander in IA 12/28 said the "preoccupation" of
other GOP candidates with balancing the federal budget is
"playing into President Clinton's hands."  Alexander said neither
Bob Dole nor Phil Gramm is providing voters with "a vision of
America's future."  Alexander: "We've got nobody talking about
what kind of country we're going to have or how we're going to
get there.  We've got a lot of people talking about less from
Washington and nobody is talking about more from us.  If all we
can talk about in the next year is balancing the budget, if we
have no more vision than that, Bill Clinton is going to be the
next president of the United States of America and he's going to
have a Speaker Gephardt to work with."  The budget impasse in
Washington has given Alexander a "fresh context for his anti-
Washington theme."  He stressed GOP leaders should "stand firm"
on their budget priorities, but he said he would focus on other
goals like creating jobs and rebuilding communities (Roos, DES
MOINES REGISTER, 12/29).
     "SEVERITY WITH A SMILE":  NEWSWEEK's Klein writes Alexander
"has a rare political talent, the ability to make the radical
sound reasonable."  This ability would "seem a marketable quality
in our overripe era.  But it hasn't clicked ... One problem
Alexander won't -- can't -- acknowledge is that he's chosen the
wrong central organizing gimmick for his campaign.  He is running
as that hoariest of political cliches, the 'outsider.'  It seems
a threadbare conceit, too slick by half for the '90s. ... A more
profitable route might have been to emphasize his low-key style;
a calm, smart, reasonable person in a party that seems mesmerized
by its lunatic fringe."  Still, despite his problems, the race
"may be ready for a late-breaking dark horse" and Lamar has
"begun to position himself cleverly" by "courting the GOP's
smarter cadres, the neoconservatives and 'empowerment' activists
who cluster around Newt Gingrich and Bill Kristol."  Lamar will
give a speech incorporating their ideas and offering a "New
Citizenship" this week.  Alexander "has belatedly recognized
Ronald Reagan's great secret: Republican primary voters like
their severity with a smile."  He ran "the cleverest ad of the
campaign so far" over the holidays "tweaking" Gramm and Forbes
for their negative ads and offering a "different message in
rebuttal" (1/8 issue).
     THE AD:  The 30-sec. "5th Grade" spot featured Lamar walking
between TV monitors showing the Gramm and Forbes negative ads.
The spot ran over the holidays and is now off the air.  TEXT
(produced by Murphy Pintak Gautier): "Here they go -- Washington
mudslinging.  These guys act like they are running for president
of the 5th grade.  I'm Lamar Alexander.  My campaign is
different.  In January, I'll be talking about my ideas for good
jobs, better schools, and strong citizenship.  Where we expect
less from Washington and more from ourselves.  But this week,
while the others are so busy telling you their best insults, I
have something to say to you as well.  Have a Merry Christmas and
a Happy New Year!" (release 12/21).
     RESN REWIND:  In a front page story, W. POST' Marcus &
Babcock reported on the Alexander campaign's release of documents
showing the candidate raised "millions of dollars" for the
Republican Exchange Satellite Network -- which he founded in 1993
-- and that those donors "later formed the financial base" of his
campaign.  Center for Public Integrity's Charles Lewis called
RESN "a rather thinly disguised campaign mechanism" which was not
subject to FEC rules.  Alexander comm. dir. Mark Merritt called
Lewis' assertion "totally false" and said while it might have
offered him a platform, the primary purpose of RESN "was never to
elect Lamar Alexander president."  The POST ran a list of those
who gave RESN $100K or more (12/30).

BUCHANAN:  AIRS RADIO AD IN NEW YORK, WANTS TO REACH BALLOT

     Pat Buchanan released a "last-minute" radio ad attacking
NY's GOP leadership and primary process.  Only Bob Dole, who is
supported by Sen. Al D'Amato (R) and Gov. George Pataki (R) is
expected to "easily qualify" for NY's ballot.  The rest of Dole's
rivals, except Buchanan and Steve Forbes, have "written off" NY
and its 102 delegates.  Buchanan spokesperson K.B. Forbes said
the ads were designed "to boost up numbers" on petitions to reach
the ballot in each of NY's 31 counties.  The petitions are due
1/4.  AP's Humbert: "Notable is that Buchanan avoids attacking
D'Amato and Pataki ... by name in the ad. ... The late appearance
of the radio ad in select markets across the state indicates two
things:  Buchanan believes New York could be a key battleground
and he is worried about being kept off the battlefield" (12/28).
     "FACE"-ING DOLE:  Buchanan, on "Face the Nation," when asked
if he could support Bob Dole as the GOP nominee if he chooses a
pro-choice VP: "Bob Dole's a friend of mine. ... I deeply regret
that he moves around on every single issue. ... If Bob Dole picks
a liberal running mate, he will risk a real debacle at the
convention, but we're not going to have that problem because Bob
is going to be standing up there nominating me for president of
the United States" (12/31).
     WON'T BE EXCLUDED FROM WMUR DEBATE:  After announcing 12/20
that Buchanan would be excluded from a 2/15 debate, WMUR-TV
reversed itself 12/22.  Buchanan will be allowed to participate
(Manchester UNION-LEADER, 12/22).
     WON'T MISS DEFECTORS:  Responding to the defection in IA  of
Marlene Elwell and Guy Rodgers, Buchanan aides said the two are
"consultants who went to work for candidates who paid them more
 ... [but] have no knowledge of campaign secrets that might be
turned against Buchanan" (Yepsen, DES MOINES REGISTER, 12/27).

LUGAR:  MIXED REVIEWS OF BOMB THREAT ADS

     A Manchester UNION LEADER editorial: "Whoever Dick Lugar
hired to produce his latest series of TV ads raising the specter
of nuclear terrorism should be given the boot. ... The ad
campaign is a dud. ... Even as a scare tactic the ads come a
cropper.  The 'spine chilling' spots are so hokey as to be funny.
Somewhere Ed Wood is grinning ear to ear" (12/26).  W. POST
editorial: "A certain amount of the tut-tutting the ad has
occasioned seems to us misfocused.  The sensationalistic quality
of the message ... does not fit with the persona of Mr. Lugar and
diminishes him by making him look a bit desperate. ... But that
is not the most troublesome part of the story.  What's
troublesome is what the ad says ... about the apparently
universal understanding of what it finally takes to win attention
-- and support -- in politics" (12/31).

CLINTON:  A SPRING OFFENSIVE?  THE REAGAN PLAYBOOK?

     NEWSWEEK's "Periscope" reports Pres. Clinton's re-election
strategists are focusing on a likely Dole nomination and "expect
Dole ... to be cash-strapped by early spring ... and they're
hoping that moment of weakness will allow Clinton, already flush
with about $28 million, to 'do some real damage' to Dole, who
will be 'out of money and a sitting duck" (1/8 issue).  U.S.
NEWS' "Washington Whispers" reports strategists are urging
Clinton to formally announce for re-election the week before the
2/12 IA caucuses.  "The reason: to make political mischief."
They say announcements in IA and NH on 2/8-9 "would divert
publicity from the GOP.  It would also let Clinton fire a few
rhetorical shots that might capture voters' attention. ... Aides
believe that an effective theme" against Dole would be to cast
Clinton as "the future," Dole as "the past" (1/8 issue).
     REAGAN REDUX:  In an interview with AP's Fournier, Clinton-
Gore dep. chair Ann Lewis pulled out a binder entitled, "Reagan-
Bush '84, Review and Analysis," and said, "This is my Bible.
These are my secrets."  Although saying she was using hyperbole,
Lewis admitted, "I use the Reagan campaign for a lot of my
pointers.  What they did well was make it clear what Ronald
Reagan did, and why he did it."  Fornier reports one Clinton
campaign slogan "under discussion" is "Leadership for the
Future," which is meant to "create the same warm, fuzzy feeling
conjured" by Reagan's "Morning in America" (12/28).
     HAPPY NEW YEAR:  U.S. NEWS' Barone calls Clinton "The dead-
end kid": "Clinton, who campaigned in 1992 as a champion of
change, seeking to win younger voters, is now campaigning as an
enemy of change trying to scare older voters. ... His previous
arguments -- that the [CBO] numbers that were the only good ones
in 1993 need not be used in 1995, that smaller increases in
Medicare spending like the ones his wife proposed are now vicious
cuts -- cannot be sustained. ... Clinton does well enough in the
polls when voters are asked about Republican proposals.  But in
the electoral endgame 11 months from now, voters will be asking
what both parties will do, and for that Clinton has no clear
answers -- or perhaps too many" (1/8 issue).

A FEW YEAR-END THOUGHTS

     BOSTON GLOBE'S SHRIBMAN: "For Bill Clinton, 1995 was the
year everything changed -- and yet nothing did. ... He is, in
short, once again strongly positioned to conduct a political
campaign but weakly positioned to exert political leadership"
(12/28).  N.Y. TIMES' MITCHELL & PURDUM:  "Clinton ... will run
on the record of a very different Presidency than he and his
supporters seemed to imagine when the man from Hope, the youngest
President since [JFK], came into office speaking of generational
and social change" (1/2).  ANALYST KEVIN PHILLIPS writes 1996
"looks like a minefield": "With no more than a bit of bad luck,
1996 could bring a recession, an unpopular U.S. military
involvement in Bosnia and the first case in U.S. history of the
president of one party and the speaker of the other party both
facing special investigative counsel."  As for the economy, "The
recovery that began in 1991 will be starting its sixth year in
1996 -- about as long as most cycles run.  But the GOP's
unpopular budget package puts the Republicans in a position to
pay for what may be a cyclical downturn, something they should
have thought of whne they approved the script.  A 1996 recession,
occurring while the Repoublicans have grabbed the economic-policy
ball, could make the Democrats' 1994 congressional election
disaster one of the great forward fumbles of modern politics"
(L.A. TIMES, 12/31).  TIMES' "Chronicles" flips the argument and
calls Bob Dole a winner of the week: "Worst season in decades
fuels talk of slowing economy on eve of election year" (1/8
issue).  BOSTON GLOBE'S CANELLOS: "So far ... the surprise is how
mild and statesmanlike the race has been ... Candidates seem to
be fighting to claim two titles, tax-cutter -- and nice guy.
Wedge issues are locked away, at least for now" (1/2).  BOSTON
GLOBE'S LEHIGH rates the GOP pres. candidates on the "substance"
of their candidacies:  Alexander "D";  Buchanan "A-";  Dole "C+";
Forbes "B-";  Gramm "B";  Lugar "F" (12/24).
     ELECTORAL COLLEGE COUNT:  W. TIMES' Lambro sees the GOP
nominee with a 197-153 electoral vote edge over Clinton.  But
when leaning states are added, the count is tied 242-242, with 54
EVs considered "tossup."  Tossup states: WA, IL, OH (1/2).

WHITEWATER:  WHILE YOU WERE AWAY ...

     NEWSWEEK's Hosenball & Isikoff report that one month after
Bill Clinton's election in '92, Tyson Foods general counsel James
Blair, the family friend who assisted Hillary Rodham Clinton in
her highly lucrative cattle futures investments in '79 and a
member of a "defensive research team" to fend off Whitewater
allegations, loaned Jim McDougal $1,000 so that McDougal could
buy the Clintons out of their Whitewater investment.  Atty Vince
Foster "handl[ed] the transaction."  Blair: "I didn't think the
Clintons should go to Washington tied in to McDougal."  Blair's
loan "is one more sign of the Little Rock crowd's strange
sensitivity about the scandal that would not die."  While an aide
to Senate Whitewater chair Al D'Amato (R-NY) said Clinton may
have violated financial disclosure laws by failing to report
Blair's loan as a "gift" to the Clintons, Clinton atty David
Kendall disagreed: "The money came from McDougal.  Legally,
there's no issue."  But just-released notes from a 11/93 meeting
by then-WH Assoc. Counsel William Kennedy say, "Blair could have
knowledge.  Could be source of money to allo McD to purchase
stock."  Writes NEWSWEEK, "The emerging record suggests that the
Clintons' friends were worried about something -- and the
behavior of the First Couple's advisers, both before and after
Foster's suicide, looks like a bungled cover-up" (1/8 issue).
     MCDOUGAL TO D'AMATO:  After a federal court refused
McDougal's demand that D'Amato "be subpoenaed to answer questions
about his Senate probe," McDougal called D'Amato a "crook,"
adding that he was disappointed D'Amato wasn't coming to Little
Rock "because nobody in Arkansas has seen a member of the Mafia."
He challenged D'Amato "to dueling lie-detector tests" that would
cover D'Amato's past ethics problems and "mob ties" (Galvin, N.Y.
POST, 12/29).
     NEW SUBPOENAS:  The Senate Whitewater cmte issued subpoenas
to hear from 16 Arkansans, including Gov. Jim Guy Tucker (D) and
Jim and Susan McDougal.

GINGRICH:  A HAPPY NEWT YEAR?

     Speaker Newt Gingrich, appearing on CNN's "Evans & Novak,"
was asked about his high disapproval ratings: "If I were the
person they see in seven-second sound bites, I wouldn't like me
either" (12/30).  U.S. NEWS' Borger writes, "The professor needs
time to explain himself, but that is not how his world works.
Unless the networks invent the 35-minute sound bite, Gingrich
will remain difficult to stomach" (1/8 issue).  Gingrich, on the
Air Force One incident: "There's no question that there are times
that I describe that were like throwing an interception straight
into the other team's defense.  And on several occasions, and
that's one, I did things that weren't wise."  Gingrich, on what
he will do differently in '96: "Listen more carefully and try to
be more precise in what I'm saying. ... I think, frankly, I'm
going to work harder at interacting with individual editors and
individual reporters to try to see if we can't get our story
through, if by no other means, than just embarrassing them into
being professional."  Commenting on the president's persona,
Gingrich said that it is "almost impossible to be in a room with
Bill Clinton and not have some sense that you're dealing with
just an extraordinarily charming person" (CNN, 12/30).
     FROSH FOLLOWERS:  Rep. Zach Wamp (R-TN), asked whether
Gingrich has the freshmen's "proxy" in the budget negotiations:
"The Republican freshmen are the ones that have forced the
principal issues time and time again.  And the leadership has
come back to us, over and over again, and said: what will you
agree to? ... If we stick to the agenda of the Republican
revolution, not the personality of the speaker or the president
or other personalities, we're going to win because we're on solid
ground."  Rep. Mark Neumann (R-WI), asked if he was prepared to
go the last mile for Gingrich: "I always look at Speaker Gingrich
kind of like I look at a basketball team, where Speaker Gingrich
is the point guard, and maybe [House Budget Chair] Mr. Kasich and
Gingrich together are the point guard on this team.  The rest of
us make up the rest of the team" ("Meet the Press," NBC, 12/31).

OTHER STUFF:  SCHUNDLER SPILLS THE BEANS

     AT THE RENAISSANCE/DARK AGES WEEKENDS:  Pres. and Mrs.
Clinton arrived in Hilton Head, SC on New Year's Eve in time to
keep their 12-year streak of attending the event alive.  Perhaps
the most interesting revelation of the weekend came from Jersey
City Mayor Bret Schundler (R).  NEWSWEEK's Kosova reports
Schundler "sheepishly admitted he had cut taxes too quickly,
leaving his city with a budget shortfall" (1/8 issue).   About
1,200 attended Renaissance Weekend; about 300 attended the new
GOP-only "Dark Ages Weekend" at Miami's Doral Golf Resort,
organized by DC attys Laura Ingraham and Jay Lefkowitz.  Guests
received a set of rules including: "No group hugs" and
encouragement for wearing furs and using chlorofluorocarbons
(Burleigh, TIME, 1/8 issue).
     RUSH:  L.A. TIMES' Randolph reported "there is a faint whiff
of trouble" in Rush Limbaugh's "formidable kingdom."  Program
managers at radio stations that carry Limbaugh's show "have begun
complaining about a slight dip" in his ratings.  Why?  "In sum,
he is now a member of the conservative political establishment;"
the outsider is now an insider (12/28).

1996 PREDICTIONS

     GEORGE WILL: "The Republicans will gain seats in the House
and the Senate and will have enough to pass a balanced budget
constitutional amendment."
     SAM DONALDSON: "There'll be a serious effort to say NATO no
longer needs to exist because the Soviet Union doesn't exist."
     JIM WOOTEN: "If nothing goes badly wrong [in Bosnia], Bill
Clinton does not profit from that.  That becomes a kind of
political wash.  If something goes wrong, Bill Clinton is
seriously damaged by that" ("Brinkley," ABC, 12/31).
     DAVID BRODER: "I'm afraid that we may be in for another
negative campaign year, with a lot of talk about character and
age, and things that are a lot less important to most Americans."
     WILLIAM SAFIRE: "The Democrats are going to try to make the
issue abortion and gun control, and divide the Republicans on
that.  I don't think the Republicans will bite.  I think they'll
fuzz it up."
     ANDREA MITCHELL: "I wouldn't bet the ranch on this being a
Clinton-Dole race.  Republicans are getting increasingly nervous
about Bob Dole's ability to defeat a revitalized Bill Clinton.
 ... Since none of the other Republican candidates look like
winners, I wouldn't rule out ... Colin Powell."
     CHARLIE COOK: "You'll see Republicans picking up two to four
seats in the Senate, minimal changes in the House ... and a
presidential election between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole that will
be much, much closer than it looks right now."
     AL HUNT: "The presidential race will be very close -- that
Bill Clinton and the Republican nominee will go right to the
wire.  I also suspect there will be, at least, a third-party
candidate, probably Mr. Perot, and maybe one or two others."
     LISA MYERS: "Two of the biggest issues in 1996 will be
leadership and character, which is one reason I think Senator
Dole has a lot better chance against President Clinton than a
whole lot of people now think."
     PAUL GIGOT: "The big issue of 1996 is going to be character
-- President Clinton's and the country's. ... 1996 is going to
show that Dan Quayle was a man ahead of his time when he put
these issues on the table, or tried to, in 1992."
     JACK GERMOND: "If we assume that Bosnia doesn't go sour,
which would probably destroy the president's chances of being
re-elected ... I don't think the campaign of '96 is going to turn
on any of the things they're talking about now -- not the budget
or foreign policy. It's going to turn on Clinton's ...character."
     JAMES CARVILLE: "In the vice presidential selection -- my
prediction is Dole is going to pick John Engler of Michigan."
     JIM MIKLASZEWSKI: "Even though he says he's not interested,
Colin Powell will be Dole's running mate.  There could be as many
a four candidates on the ballot, including two independents. ...
As long as the economy's good and Bosnia and Whitewater are
quiet, he's still the favorite, because Bill Clinton is still the
best campaigner to ever hit the White House" ("Meet the Press,"
NBC, 12/31).
     KEN DUBERSTEIN: "Big political story of the year is going to
be the House freshmen and that they will by and large be re-
elected. ... Bob Dole is going to be elected president. ... No
Democrat, with the exception of Jimmy Carter in 1976, has gotten
more than 45.6 percent of the vote.  Bill Clinton can't get above
that, period."
     FRANK RICH: "I have to go with conventional wisdom and say
it looks pretty good for Clinton right now" ("Face the Nation,"
CBS, 12/31).

ILLINOIS:  DURBIN CHALLENGES KRISLOV PETITIONS

     Rep. Richard Durbin (D-20) has asked state election
officials to bar Clinton Krislov (D), a millionaire atty, from
the ballot because of "alleged wholesale nominating petition
irregularities."  Krislov filed 10,080 signatures by the 12/18
deadline and Durbin is challenging 9,200 of them.  Krislov called
the allegations "evidence that his candidacy was giving the
jitters" to Durbin (Secter, CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 12/27).  More
Krislov: "I am the only serious candidate in this race who is 100
percent pro-choice, no restrictions."  He said Durbin, "who now
says he is pro-choice, 'voted 25 times with the radical right' on
abortion issues."  Durbin "has said he went to Congress as a pro-
life candidate, but switched to pro-choice in part because he
found that some pro-life advocates there were also against family
planning to reduce the number of abortions" (Schoenburg,
Springfield STATE JOURNAL-REGISTER, 12/28).  Other Dems: ex-
Treas. Pat Quinn, p.r. exec. Ron Gibbs, businessman Paul Park,
and Jalil Ahmad.  GOPers: LG Bob Kustra, state Rep. Al Salvi,
radiologist Robert Marshall, Wayne Kurzeja, and Martin Paul
Gallagher.  Primary: 3/19.

KANSAS:  FRAHM FROWNS ON SENATE BID

     LG Sheila Frahm (R), a moderate, said she would not run for
the seat being vacated by Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R): "The right
thing for me to do in 1996 is to continue to serve my state as
lieutenant governor."  Frahm's decision leaves conservative state
Sen. Eric Yost (R) as the only announced candidate (Petterson,
K.C. STAR, 12/27).  Frahm acknowledged that her decision "leaves
the moderate wing of the Republican Party without a candidate":
"It's a very difficult decision. ... If I was the moderate
candidate, maybe there are others who were hesitant and may be
interested in stepping forward" (AP/WICHITA EAGLE, 12/27).
Possibles: frosh Rep. Sam Brownback (R-02), real estate exec/'90
gov. primary cand. Nestor Weigand (R), retiring Rep. Jan Meyers
(R-03), Treas. Sally Thompson (D), stockbroker Jill Docking (D),
and Dole aide Dan Stanley (R).  Filing deadline: 6/10.

LOUISIANA:  TAUZIN WON'T RUN, SHAKES UP POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

     The battle for the seat being vacated by Sen. J. Bennett
Johnston (D) was "turned on its ear" by the decision of Rep.
Billy Tauzin (R-03), a recent GOP convert who was considered the
"leading" Republican candidate, not to run.  Tauzin was seen as a
likely candidate when he switched parties in 8/95, but "said he
decided to stay out of the race because he is up for a key
chairmanship in the House": "I have been looking at the race for
some time, but there has been a new development."  He said the
retirement of Rep. Jack Fields (R-TX) "puts him in line" to chair
the subcmte on Telecommunications and Finance, which he called
the "most important subcommittee post in the House."  Tauzin said
he has been assured by the GOP leadership that he will head the
panel, assuming of course he wins re-election and the GOP
maintains control of the House.  Tauzin: "I think I can help
Louisiana better in that position than as a freshman senator.
The decision is best for me, personally, too."  The decision came
just three days after the release of a poll conducted of 800 LA
voters by Southern Media & Opinion Research, which showed Tauzin
and outgoing Treas./'95 gov. hopeful Mary Landrieu (D) the
"front-runners" in the race: Landrieu received 19% to Tauzin's
14%, with 22% undecided.  AG Richard Ieyoub (D) got 12%, with
everyone else in single digits (Wardlaw, N.O. TIMES-PIC, 12/27).
     OPEN THE GATES:  Rep. Jimmy Hayes (R-07), like Tauzin a
recent GOP convert, said he would get in and insisted he wasn't
dismayed by early poor numbers: "When I first ran for Congress,
my poll was 2 percent.  I won with 57 percent of the vote.  But I
ran when I thought I could win.  I wasn't interested in the
competition" (AP, 12/27).  Baton Rouge consultant Bernie Pinsonat
said that the election of Gov.-elect Mike Foster (R) "proved that
there's no longer any penalty for party-switching."  Ex-Gov. Dave
Treen (R), who flirted with the '95 gov. race, said he is
"interested if he can take care of the business obligations that
caused him to get out" of the gov. campaign.  Rep. Bob Livingston
(R-01), who had considered a Senate bid until he was named House
Appropriations chair, said Treen will be the "front-runner if he
gets in."  Also announced is ex-state Rep. David Duke (R), who
hasn't run for office since he "fared poorly" in the '92 GOP
presidential primaries.  State Rep. Woody Jenkins (R), the
"darling of religious conservatives" who has twice run for the
Senate, is interested in running, as are New Orleans
Councilmember Peggy Wilson (R) and oilman Pat Taylor (R).  Taylor
had announced but then withdrew because of illness; Livingston
"said he is recovering and may change his mind."  Ex-Gov. Buddy
Roemer (R) "has long wanted" a Senate seat, and some of his
backers "urged him to sit out the 1995 governor's race and wait
for the 1996 Senate race."  But Roemer ran and finished fourth.
No Republican has won a Senate seat in LA since Reconstruction.
On the Dem side, Landrieu said she is looking at the race, "but
at this time I'm leaning against it."  Rep. Bill Jefferson (D-02)
said he would run for the Senate when he pulled out of the gov.
race last summer, "but he would have to leave a safe House seat
to do so."  Pinsonat "said he thinks Fields will more likely"
run, especially if he loses in his battle to keep his CD intact
(Wardlaw, TIMES-PICAYUNE, 12/28).  Other possible cands.: Rep.
Richard Baker (R-06) and Insurance Commis. Jim Brown.

MASSACHUSETTS:  WELD DOES AN ABOUT-FACE ON PACS

     Gov. Bill Weld (R) is "tossing aside some of his political
principles" by agreeing to accept PAC funding for his race
against Sen. John Kerry.  Weld said in 9/93 that PACs "just try
to buy influence and buy incumbents. ... I'd like to see an end
to this type of money funding" in MA.  Now Weld is justifying his
switch on the grounds that Kerry -- not a "paragon of
consistency" either -- "refused to agree" to a $5M campaign
spending cap.  Kerry, a "self-styled advocate of campaign
reforms," has in the past promoted spending caps (BOSTON GLOBE,
12/24).

     ANALYSIS:  Although the poll shows Campbell within the
margin of error of Thurmond, Campbell insisted he will not run
against him: "I'm for Strom Thurmond.  As long as he runs, I
support him."  Miles "is more elusive" about his plans.  When
asked the chances of his entering the race, Miles "side-stepped
the question entirely."  Although Miles "couldn't topple"
Thurmond, "his interest could spur others to run.  Associates say
Campbell will jump into the race if Miles does" (Scoppe, Columbia
STATE, 12/31).  Southern political analyst Earl Black: "The only
way for Republicans to lose that seat is for the Senator to go
for one more term when his day is past. ... People are looking
for somebody younger."  Although only educator Charlie Thompson
has entered the GOP primary, Miles, "a maverick Republican, is
believed to be positioning himself to run."  Miles recently
mailed a "cleverly worded fund-raising letter saying" SC's next
senator will be one "who can energetically advance the
conservative values of our state."  Left unsaid in the letter is
whether the next senator will be elected in '96 or '98 (Bandy,
STATE, 12/31).  Announced Dem: businessman Elliott Close.  Filing
deadline: 4/30.

ILLINOIS:  FILING DEADLINE 12/18, PRIMARY 3/19

     4th CD:  Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D) gets a primary challenge
from John Holowinski (D).
     5th CD:  Frosh Rep. Michael Flanagan (R) will face primary
challenges from Chester Hornowski and Charles Prignano.  On the
Dem side, state Reps. Rod Blagojevich and Nancy Kaszak are
considered the favorites; other Dems to file were Ray Romero and
Eric Puchala.
     7th CD:  Retiring Sen. Paul Simon (D) has endorsed Cook Co.
Commis. Danny Davis for the seat being vacated by Rep. Cardiss
Collins (D).  Simon: "I think he has the stuff that real leaders
are made of" (Kuczka, CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 12/18).  Other major Dem
candidates in the overwhelmingly Dem CD: Chicago Aldermen Dorothy
Tillman, Ed Smith & Percy Giles, and Cook Co. Commis. Bobbie
Steele.
     8th CD:  Don Huff (R), a political neophyte who was laid off
last summer as a manufacturing sales mgr., filed against 14-term
Rep. Phil Crane (R), calling for a "less confrontational
atmosphere" in DC and taking "more moderate positions" than
Crane.  Huff called the uphill battle a "Donald versus Goliath
fight" (Martinez, CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 12/19).
     9th CD:  Given the large number of Dem retirements, "no one
would have second-guessed" Rep. Sidney Yates (D) if he decided to
join the crowd; Yates is 86 and was first elected to the House in
'48.  But "to the surprise, and mild consternation" of some, he
filed for a 24th term.  Atty J.B. Pritzker (D) filed but "said he
would withdraw by the January deadline if Yates remains a
candidate."  Other Dems: Terrence Gilhooly, Mark Matheney and
Seth Tillman (Pearson/Fegelman, CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 12/12).
     10th CD:  Businessman Richard Rinaolo (R) has filed against
Rep. John Porter (R), calling for a "sweeping joint agreement to
prohibit acceptance or use of out-of-district PAC money."
Rinaolo: "It's time to stop preaching about campaign finance
reform and start practicing it. ... Porter, despite his pious
professions, has been part of the problem, not part of the
solution."  Rinaolo calls himself a "staunch supporter" of the
GOP Contract, while Porter "has alienated many Republicans by
voting against half of the Contract" (Rinaolo release, 12/26).
     20th CD:  In the race to succeed Senate candidate Dick
Durbin (D), the top ballot spots went to Bill Owens (R) and John
Glynn (D).  Also running: state Rep. Jay Hoffman (D), Madison Co.
Treas. John Shimkus (R), state official Patrick Baikauskas (R),
Sangamon Co. Circuit Clerk Carl Oblinger (R), student Dave Green
(R), atty James Zerkle (R), Rick Angel (R), and Sam Cahnman (D)
(Springfield STATE JOURNAL-REGISTER, 12/28).

MD 07:  THIRTY-TWO VIE TO REPLACE MFUME

     A record 32 candidates -- 28 Dems, 4 GOPers -- filed by the
12/26 deadline to succeed Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D), who is resigning
effective 2/15 to head up the NAACP.  The field includes state
Sens. Delores Kelley (D) & Nathaniel McFadden (D), Dels. Clarence
Davis (D), Elijah Cummings (D), Salima Mariott (D) & Kenneth
Montague Jr. (D), plus several clergy members including Baltimore
City Register of Wills Mary Conaway (D) and Rev. Frank Reid III
(D), who leads a 10,000 member church and is the brother-in-law
of Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke (D) (Zorzi, Balto. SUN, 12/27).
The seat has "historically been" held by a resident of West
Baltimore City, but with a large field and redistricting that
extended the CD further into E. Baltimore and Baltimore Co.,
nothing is certain.  The only major candidate with ties to
Baltimore Co. -- "where nearly a third of the vote lies" -- is
Kelley, who "could be the beneficiary of a race with a large
number of city candidates" because her district "straddles"
Baltimore City and Baltimore Co.  State Del. "Pete" Rawlings (D):
"It is creating a situation where [Kelley] has an excellent
chance.  Reid lives in the County, but has few political or
church ties there" (SUN, 12/26).  Mfume said he did not think he
would make an endorsement (SUN, 12/29).  Special primary: 3/5.

HOUSE HUNTING:  CHANGE OF HEART FOR BATEMAN

     TX 05:  Two Dems who were expected to run for the seat of
Senate hopeful John Bryant (D), Dallas school board pres. Sandy
Kress and atty Ken Molberg, will not.  A third potential Dem,
John Pouland, who like the other two is an ex-Dallas Co. Dem
chair, "said he is still on the fence."  Dems thought that Kress
"might have been the best-positioned to finance a Democratic
campaign."  He was expected to run in '90 when Bryant toyed with
a bid for AG.  Molberg said he didn't have enough money to make
the race: "That was the only thing that stayed in the way.  This
is a district that is tailor-made for an anti-Gingrich message"
(Stahl, DALLAS MORNING NEWS, 12/29).  Two GOPers are already
running: businessman Pete Sessions, who won 48% of the vote
against Bryant in '94, and ex-Dallas City Councilmember Glenn
Box.
     TX 15:  State Rep. Renato Cuellar (D), a 68-year old nine-
year veteran of the TX legislature, became the third Dem to
announce for the seat being vacated by Rep. Kika de la Garza (D).
Other Dems in race: atty Jim Selman and businessman Ruben
Hinojosa (AP, 12/27).
     VA 01:  Rep. Herb Bateman (R), who during the '94 campaign
said that would be his last race, changed his mind and will run
for an eighth term.  He said the GOP sweep of Congress "has made
him more powerful and effective -- and eager to stay in office."
Bateman said his "health is not an issue," but he had bypass
surgery in '89, underwent radiation for prostate cancer in '92,
and "discovered during a routine examination this past July that
he had suffered a minor heart attack without realizing it while
the House was keeping a busy schedule."  1st CD Dem chair John
McGlennon said no Dems have come forward to run but promised an
"aggressive recruiting effort" (Petkofsky, RICHMOND TIMES-
DISPATCH, 12/30).

Komatsu residents file suit demanding halt to fighter flights+

KANAZAWA, Japan, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Residents around the Komatsu base of the Air Self-Defense Force
(ASDF) filed a suit Monday against the state demanding a halt to
fighter flights and compensation for distress caused by aircraft
noise.
     This is the third suit filed by residents of Komatsu, Ishikawa
Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast, demanding halt to flights to
military aircraft.
     In the suit lodged with the Kanazawa District Court, the 1,653
plaintiffs call for a halt to flights of both ASDF and U.S. military
aircraft between noon and 2 p.m. and between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m.
     They also demand 1.2 million yen for each of the plaintiffs for
the past distress caused by noise and 50,000 yen per month for future
distress.
     The plaintiffs say the Self-Defense Forces is unconstitutional.
     They also cited two incidents as illustrating dangers from the
base.  In October an F-15 fighter burst into flames after failing to
take off, and in November an F-15 fighter fired a missile which hit
and downed another F-15 while the two fighters were engaged in a
drill over the Sea of Japan.
     In December last year the Kanazawa branch of the Nagoya High
Court ordered the state to pay 180 million yen compensation to 213
residents out of 330 plaintiffs from Komatsu but rejected the
plaintiffs' pleas filed by 1975 and 1983 for a halt to flights and
compensation for future distress caused by noise.
     Neither the plaintiffs nor the government appealed the ruling.

Metropolitan panel calls for 'realistic' project review+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A panel advising Tokyo Gov. Yukio Aoshima recommended Monday
that a ''realistic review'' be conducted of the Tokyo metropolitan
government's waterfront development project.
     In a report submitted to Aoshima, the panel said the project is
already well under way, with a huge amount of money invested for
construction of a 63,000-population ''city'' in the area surrounding
the Tokyo Bay.
     The report also called for measures aimed at advancing
internationalization, more effective disaster handling, solving
various urban problems and deregulation of business activities.
     During the seven meetings since September, the panel was split
between members calling for a sweeping review of the project and
those arguing for maintaining it, panel members said.
     The panel was established as a private advisory group by
Aoshima, who pledged a review of the project in his election campaign.
     Aoshima has reassured executives of companies planning to invest
in the waterfront development project, saying he plans to continue
the project.
     Aoshima dismayed some business concerns when he canceled an
international city expo that was set to open next spring, a pledge he
had made during his election campaign.

Clinton likely to visit Japan April 16-18+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     U.S. President Bill Clinton is likely to make a three-day state
visit to Japan on April 16-18, rescheduling one that was canceled in
November, the top government spokesman said Monday.
     ''We will officially announce the schedule tomorrow afternoon,''
Chief Cabinet Secretary Koken Nosaka told a press conference, adding
that the Japanese and U.S. governments are close to agreeing on the
schedule.
     Besides meeting Emperor Akihito, Clinton will hold talks with
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and they will issue a joint
statement on the bilateral security system.  He also hopes to talk
directly to the Japanese public to stress the importance of the
security arrangements, Nosaka said.
     The joint statement is expected to include mention of the two
governments' efforts to reduce U.S. bases in Okinawa, following the
rape of a local schoolgirl in September, for which three U.S.
servicemen are on trial.
     Clinton was scheduled to visit Japan in November to attend the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum gathering in Osaka, western
Japan, and for a summit meeting with Murayama but postponed the visit
because of a federal budget crisis.
     The United States previously hoped to reschedule the visit for
early January, but Japan has declined the proposal because of the
emperor's tight schedule.  In February and March, Clinton will be
busy with presidential primaries.
     There still is a possibility that the April visit could be
changed because Clinton plans to attend a Moscow summit meeting on
nuclear safety in late April, government sources said.

SDP member resigns as head of policy research panel+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A member of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) resigned Monday
as chief of the party's policy research panel in protest over an
earlier decision by the SDP's policy-making Central Executive
Committee to postpone disbanding the party and forming a new party
as originally set for Jan. 19.
     Nobuyuki Sekiyama, chairman of the SDP Policy Board, handed in
his resignation to SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, an advocate of
a scheme to change the SDP into a new ''liberal'' party with a better
chance of winning coming elections.
     Sekiyama is the second SDP member to quit a key party post in
protest over the Central Executive Committee's decision earlier this
month.
     SDP members are at odds over when to form such a new party, with
Prime Minister and SDP head Tomiichi Murayama cautious about setting
up such a party early but Kubo willing to see the SDP make the change.
     Kubo and his followers have failed in several attempts to build
a new party around the SDP out of concern over the party's sinking
profile in a political landscape dominated by the Liberal Democratic
Party, the biggest group in the tripartite ruling coalition, and the
main opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party).
     Kubo himself has suggested he may step down as the party's No. 2
man at a party convention set for Jan. 19.

Okinawa mayor to refuse signing land-lease contract+

NAHA, Japan, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Okinawa Mayor Shusei Arakawa said Monday he will refuse to sign
a contract for renewal of leasing the municipality's land to the
U.S. military.
     The mayor told the city assembly that he will not agree to the
renewal of the lease of the land for use as an ammunition dump in
view of public opinion calling for scaling down of the U.S. military
bases in the prefecture.
     Okinawa will be the second city in Okinawa Prefecture to refuse
to renew a lease of municipal land to the U.S. military, following
the capital city Naha, which has decided not to renew a lease for a
naval facility.
     The city of Okinawa has to begin legal proceedings as early as
1997 for the renewal of the land lease, the contract for which
officially expires in 2000.
     The city owns 474 hectares of land which accounts for about
one-sixth of the Kadena ammunition depot of the U.S. forces.
     The city concluded the present lease contract before Arakawa
was elected mayor in 1991.

AIDS: no finished problem in Japan+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A Health and Welfare Ministry official was recently quite
puzzled when she was asked a question, ''Is the AIDS problem in
Japan over now?''
     ''The questioner said, 'I haven't seen any AIDS-related stories
in newspapers or magazines recently,'' said Tamami Umeda, deputy
director of the ministry's AIDS, TB and Infectious Diseases Control
Division.
     Of course, the issue is not over.  According to the latest
announcement by the ministry's AIDS Surveillance Committee, 85 new
people with HIV and AIDS were reported in September and October in
Japan, bringing the official total to 4,003.
     The 85 cases comprised 60 Japanese and 25 foreigners.  The 60
Japanese cases were the largest number ever for a two-month period,
the committee said.
     The record, which would have made banner headlines a few years
ago, was almost invisible in the domestic newspapers.
     The only prominent news reports about the disease this year were
those about people, mostly hemophiliacs, who were infected with HIV
after being treated with contaminated blood-clotting agents.
     Of some 4,500 hemophiliacs in Japan, an estimated 2,000 have
contracted the virus in the 1980s from HIV-contaminated blood
products imported mainly from the United States.
     Public calls for redress for those infected people have mounted
after the Tokyo and Osaka District courts in October proposed a
solution to suits filed by HIV-infected hemophiliacs, asking the
state and five pharmaceutical companies to compensate the plaintiffs.
     Umeda, while admitting the grave nature of the issue, criticizes
the media for being ''badly balanced'' in reporting on AIDS.
     ''The media focus on HIV infections caused by blood products is
increasing the number of people who do not think of AIDS as their own
problem,'' she said.
     ''Not many people are aware of the simple fact that anyone can
catch the virus through sexual contact,'' she added.
     Marii Goto, secretary general of the Japan HIV Center, a
nonprofit private group supporting AIDS patients, is also concerned
about growing public apathy.
     Since 1990, the group has been organizing the annual ''36 Hours
AIDS Hotline'' campaign around the Dec. 1 World AIDS Day, in which
volunteers throughout the nation offer information and counseling by
telephone.
     She said ''the telephones never stopped ringing'' during the
events in the first three years, with the 181 calls in 1990,
increasing to 1,771 in 1991 and further rising to 3,100 in 1992.
     However, to the volunteers' disappointment, the responses have
kept decreasing since 1993 to some 1,100 calls this year, Goto said.
     A government survey on the number of people who have visited
public health centers for HIV tests forms a similar curve -- peaking
in 1992.
     Goto said although less people are coming forward to undergo the
tests, the percentage of those tested who were found HIV positive
keeps increasing, indicating that the virus is spreading certainly in
Japan.
     Umeda said Japan may be in the stage of seeing HIV spreading
slowly, but steadly, a symptom which in the experience of many
countries was the precursor of a sudden surge.
     Goto said out of all the problems related with AIDS, she is most
anxious about the public becoming indifferent to the disease.
     ''I believe the antonym of love is not hatred, but disregard.
People who discriminate against AIDS patients can change their
thinking,'' she said.
     In explaining the transition of the public's attitude toward
AIDS, Goto said, ''First there was fear, which aroused interest.  The
level of interest peaked in 1992 when several foreign celebrities
like Magic Johnson announced they were infected, because Japanese
people love to keep up with foreign news.''
     But at the same time, the Japanese are the owners of transient
enthusiasm, and their interest in AIDS has faded, she said.
     ''Some people say the recurrence of fear, by telling how
horrible the disease is, would create public interest again.  But
such a method would only promote discrimination,'' she said.
     Goto believes that providing information on AIDS constantly is
the only solution, which is very dependent on the media and
administration.
     Umeda said the government expects private support groups to
reach out to certain communities in need of information about the
disease, such as gay people and foreigners.
     ''Our words would not influence them easily because they would
be guarded toward us,'' she said, adding the government hopes to help
private groups create a network among them by creating situations in
which they can exchange information.

Gov't adopts administrative reform program+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's cabinet Monday adopted a
program on administrative reform that calls for scrapping or merging
seven public corporations by the end of March 1997.
     The seven concerns include Livestock Industry Promotion Corp.
and the Japan Raw Silk and Sugar Price Stabilization Agency, both
under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries.
     The program comes in line with a pledge made by Murayama to
streamline public corporations as part of administrative reform, a
policy target given priority by Murayama.
     The program also sets an April 1, 1997 deadline for the
government to abolish the salt monopoly under Japan Tobacco Corp. and
privatize a mutual fund for compensation of job-related injuries for
firefighters.
     It also stipulates that the cabinet's functions be strengthened
with the introduction of up to three advisers to the prime minister
so that the premier can receive vital information more quickly.
     The program requires the government to take into account
proposals by the Administrative Reform Committee, a government
advisory body, in reviewing the current deregulation program by the
end of next March.
     Among other policy targets, the program calls for reducing the
number of public servants even after the current retrenchment program
expires at the end of March 1998.
     It also points to the need to streamline the postal service,
state forest business and national hospitals.

Gov't approves defense personnel shifts+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government defense council on Monday adopted minor
personnel shifts from the Self-Defense Forces to the Joint Staff
Council in fiscal 1996, beginning April 1.
     The Security Council of Japan, headed by Prime Minister Tomiichi
Murayama, decided to cut the number of staff members of the Ground
Self-Defense Force (GSDF) by 570, the Maritime Self-Defense Force
(MSDF) by 333, the Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) by 349, and to
increase the Joint Staff Council staff by 1,202.
     The set number of members for the GSDF is 180,000, 46,085 for
the MSDF and 47,556 for the ASDF, but their actual numbers currently
fall short of the fixed figures.
     The council also endorsed equipment procurement plans under the
government plan for the fiscal 1996 budget, including 11 F-2 fighter
support planes and four F-15 fighter-interceptor planes.

Japan disappointed at French objection to its CE status+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     France's opposition to Japan's bid for observer status on the
Council of Europe (CE) is ''regrettable,'' Vice Foreign Minister
Sadayuki Hayashi said Monday.
     The Foreign Ministry's top bureaucrat made the remark at a news
conference, replying to a question about Japan's failure earlier this
month to acquire the status due to the French objection.
     Hayashi said Tokyo will ask Paris the reason for its opposition
and continue to seek to participate in the council's activities as an
observer.
     He brushed aside speculation that France's opposition was due to
Japan's criticism of French nuclear tests.
     The 38-member council, founded in 1949, aims to achieve a
greater unity among its members, to facilitate their economic and
social progress and to uphold the principles of parliamentary
democracy and respect for human rights.

Princess Chichibu's memoirs to be published in English+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The English translation of the memoirs of the late Princess
Chichibu, widow of Prince Chichibu and an aunt of Emperor Akihito,
will soon go on sale in Britain and the United States.
     It is the first time that memoirs of a member of the Imperial
Family have been translated into English for sale abroad.  The 1991
book, originally titled ''the silver bonbonniere'' will be called
''Silver Drum'' in English and published by the British publishing
house Global Oriental.
     The princess, whose given name was Setsuko, died in August at
age 85 of complications resulting from chronic heart disease.
     An acquaintance who knew her from her work as honorary president
of the Japan-Britain Society said, ''(Unfortunately) the translation
did not come out while she was still alive, but I think she would
have been delighted.''
     In the book the princess, who was born in London as the daughter
of a Japanese diplomat, describes her life with Prince Chichibu, whom
she married in 1928.  The prince, younger brother of the late Emperor
Showa, contracted tuberculosis in 1940 and died of the disease in
1953 at the age of 50.
     She also provided some detail about the realities of life as a
member of Japanese royalty.  British author Dorothy Briton, who lives
in Hayama, Kanagawa Prefecture, translated the memoirs upon
initiative by the son of Prince Mikasa, a cousin of the Emperor.
     Briton said she consulted the princess, who was fluent in
English, on the manuscript when about one third of the English
version had been completed.  She said the translation is a loose one
aimed at deepening understanding of Japan.
     Just four days before her death the princess was shown the cover
picture for her English-language memoirs.
     The first copy of the book was sent over from Britain at the end
of November and was put in front of the princess' mortuary tablet.
Briton said the book shows how Prince Chichibu's love helped turn her
arranged marriage into a fairy-tale love story.

Murayama aims to discuss Okinawa with Clinton+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama said Monday he will discuss
requests from the southernmost Japanese prefecture of Okinawa to
reduce the number of local U.S. bases with U.S. President Bill
Clinton when he visits Japan in April.
     Murayama told reporters, ''We will discuss the adjustment and
reduction of bases giving due thought to the feelings of the people
of Okinawa.''
     ''We will discuss Japan-U.S. bilateral issues well, and the
Okinawa issue in particular.  It is important for us to speak
candidly with each other,'' he said.
     Tokyo and Washington are close to agreeing to reschedule
Clinton's state visit to April 16-18, following the cancellation of a
visit in November.
     The rape of a local schoolgirl in Okinawa in September, for
which three U.S. servicemen are currently on trial, stirred the local
Japanese populace to demand reductions in the large number of U.S.
bases which are concentrated there.

Kono lauds Japan's U.N. 'achievements' in '95+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said Tuesday Japan largely
succeeded in showing an active stance at the United Nations in 1995
on global peace and socioeconomic development.
     ''We made some achievements as far as our U.N. diplomacy is
concerned,'' he told a news conference in looking back on the past
year.
     As its major victory in the 185-member world body, Kono singled
out adoption of peace- and disarmament-related U.N. resolutions that
Japan proposed along with other countries, including a resolution
calling for an immediate halt to nuclear testing.
     ''I can safely say Japan is now in a position to take the
initiative in promoting disarmament, peace, nuclear nonproliferation
and stemming nuclear testing,'' he said.
     The foreign minister also said Japan played an active role in
the field of economic and social development in the past year, which
marks the 50th anniversary of the U.N.'s founding.
     Kono expressed disappointment, however, at a slower pace in U.N.
reform efforts.  He also said Tokyo will have to set a new strategy
for its U.N. diplomacy for 1996.

Murayama to meet Clinton, Yeltsin in April++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama will meet with U.S. President
Bill Clinton in Tokyo in April and is expected to confer with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow immediately thereafter,
the government said Tuesday.
     Clinton will make a three-day state visit to Japan on April
16-18 in place of one canceled in November, a top government
spokesman said.
     The Japanese and U.S. governments have officially agreed on the
schedule, with Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and Secretary of State
Warren Christopher discussing it over the phone, Chief Cabinet
Secretary Koken Nosaka told a press conference.
     Clinton will meet Murayama on April 17 and the two leaders will
issue a joint statement reconfirming the Japan-U.S. security
alliance, Nosaka said.
     The statement is expected to give a fresh significance to the
security system, while mentioning efforts to respond to wishes from
the southernmost Japanese prefecture of Okinawa to reduce the
concentration of U.S. bases there.
     Okinawa has stepped up demands for local base cutbacks following
the rape of an Okinawa schoolgirl in September, for which three U.S.
servicemen are currently on trial.
     The president also hopes to speak directly to the Japanese
public on the importance of the bilateral security arrangements,
according to government sources.
     Despite an international summit on nuclear safety set for April
19-20 in Moscow, the schedule of Clinton's visit will not be changed,
Nosaka said, adding that Japan and the United States have arranged it
very carefully.
     Murayama will attend the Moscow summit and a meeting with
Russian President Yeltsin is likely to take place, he said.
     Clinton originally planned to visit Japan in November to attend
a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in
Osaka, western Japan, and stay on for the state visit but postponed
the trip amid a federal budget crisis.
     The U.S. side previously hoped to reschedule the visit for early
January, but Japan declined the proposal because of the tight New
Year schedule of Emperor Akihito, with whom Clinton is to meet as a
state guest.
     In February and March, Clinton will be busy with presidential
primaries.

Hiroshima, Nagasaki to send A-bomb expo to U.S., France+

HIROSHIMA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only cities ever hit by an atomic
bomb, announced plans Tuesday to send an exhibition around the world
on a three-year mission to promote an end to nuclear weapons,
starting in the United States and France next year.
     City officials said they plan to stage the exposition for about
two weeks in the two cities a year over the coming three years.
     The two cities will send photographs and atomic bombing
artifacts for the first exposition in U.S. and French cities next
year, adding they want people to know the actual situation of
atom-bomb victims.
     The sites will be determined with the cooperation of 410 members
of the World Conference of Mayors for Peace Through Inter-City
Solidarity, an antinuclear group formed and headed by Hiroshima Mayor
Takashi Hiraoka.
     The mayor, through the cooperation of the two cities, took part
in an exhibition held at a university in Washington in July.
     In October, Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito visited France to protest
over the series of nuclear tests planned by Paris in the South
Pacific, the first of which was carried out in September.
     Both mayors expressed the feeling that there is a difference in
awareness concerning nuclear weapons between the citizens of the two
atom-bombed cities and nations that possess nuclear arms.
     They decided to organize the exhibition in order to inform more
people of the terrors of nuclear weapons, hoping this will eventually
lead to their elimination in the future.
     ''We are currently planning to hold this exhibition for three
years, but we would like to continue until nuclear weapons are
eliminated,'' said Hiraoka.
     Last week the mayors called on Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama
to make the holding of the exposition in various countries a national
project.
     They asked that the state cover the costs associated with
providing photographs and other materials about the 1945 atomic
bombings of the cities to other countries.

MOF releases transparent, stricter auditing measures++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura announced Tuesday a set of
measures to help Japanese banks strengthen their risk management,
auditing and checking systems as a way to prevent illicit financial
operations like the Daiwa Bank scandal.
     ''It is necessary for Japan to make a drastic shift in its
financial policy,'' Takemura said at a news conference, acknowledging
the Finance Ministry's failure in the past to adequately check
expanding bank operations after the onset of the ''bubble'' economy
in the late 1980s.
     To try to remedy the situation, he said the ministry will make
sure that two key principles will be established in Japan's banking
system -- self-responsibility of the sector and transparent financial
policy based on market mechanisms.
     Specifically, Takemura said, the ministry will introduce an
early warning system meant to detect irregularities in the banking
sector, such as the use of objective criteria for ordering business
improvements at faltering financial institutions.
     Banks with their capital-to-asset ratio below certain levels,
for example, would be ordered to rectify the situation under the
warning system, Takemura said.
     As a means to accurately assess the capital ratio and other
financial standings of certain banks, the new system will require
banks to entrust outside accountants with the auditing of their
financial records, Takemura said.
     The package also features expanding financial inspectors within
the ministry by 66 from some 400 people at present, Takemura said,
citing a larger scale of about 8,000 at U.S. financial authorities.
     The Daiwa scandal, which involved the cover-up of 1.1 billion
dollars in U.S. Treasury securities trading over 11 years from 1984,
undermined Japan's financial sector already battered by a series of
financial failures this year.
     Reflecting global concern over Japan's banking system, Japanese
banks have been slapped with the so-called ''Japan premium,'' or an
extra interest rate on their fund raising overseas.
     Takemura said the Finance Ministry's slowness in shifting its
policy from regulation-oriented protectionism to a policy based on
market forces has been partly responsible for the current lack of
self-responsibility at Japan's financial institutions.
     The recent series of financial failures and the Daiwa Bank
scandal stemmed from the banking sector's inadequate risk management
as they mistakenly perceived the extraordinary financial expansion of
the bubble economy as sound financial development, Takemura said.
     The Finance Ministry was looking the other way while the
situation was deteriorating, Takemura said, confirming the ministry's
role in the current problem with the banking system.
     Takemura also admitted that relations between the ministry and
the financial sector could be seen as ''nontransparent'' as its
instructions on key policies were not explained to the public.
     ''The early warning system and the outside auditing under the
new package will ensure objectivity in banking inspections and
increase a certain level of distance between authorities and
financial institutions,'' Takemura said.
     Takemura said the Finance Ministry promises immediate reporting
to local financial authorities in the case of new overseas scandals
involving Japanese financial institutions.
     ''The package will fundamentally change Japan's financial
policy,'' Takemura said.
     The introduction of the early warning system means that any bank
operating ineffectively would go under as a natural consequence of
the market mechanism, ministry officials said, in briefing reporters
on the package.
     ''The package is absolutely indispensable for Japan's financial
system.  The Japan premium will not be abolished unless Japanese
financial institutions correct their attitude,'' a senior ministry
official said.
     The package pushes financial institutions to improve their
internal inspection systems from fiscal 1996 starting next April, as
a lesson learned from the Daiwa scandal, the ministry officials said.
     To this end, the ministry will draw up a set of guidelines on
soundness of assets, operation in compliance with related laws and
regulations, risk management of market trading, including derivatives
deals, and computer system management, they said.
     The package also asks financial institutions to have outside
experts inspect their overseas operations, as well as to employ
internal auditors and compliance officers at their overseas branches,
who are to be independent from branch managers and report directly to
headquarters.
     As part of measures to secure sound banking operations,
financial institutions are also requested to give longer vacations of
some two weeks to employees.
     The Finance Ministry will translate data from internal
inspections by banks into credit ratings that show the soundness of
their capital and other financial conditions, the officials said.
     Banks with lower credit ratings will face closer scrutiny by the
ministry on their overall risk management, they said.
     With an eye to ways to prevent the recurrence of incidents such
as the Daiwa scandal, the ministry will increase the number of
overseas inspections, the officials said.
     For that purpose, the ministry will form a team specialized in
overseas examinations, the officials said, noting that some
inspectors will be stationed abroad.
     The Finance Ministry will keep in touch with its overseas
counterparts and share information on a regular basis, the officials
said.
     The range of mandatory reporting of financial accidents and
irregularities to authorities will expand to cover subsidiaries with
an equity holding by a parent firm of more than 50%, the ministry
officials said.
     Takemura said he hopes the fresh package will help lift
auditing and inspection levels in the Japanese banking sector to U.S.
levels in the near future.
     He said bills to revise relevant laws for the package will be
presented to the ordinary Diet session to be convened in January next
year.
     He added that steps that do not require any legal revision will
be implemented immediately.

100 new plaintiffs join HIV-hemophiliac suit in Tokyo+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Another 100 hemophiliacs who contracted HIV from contaminated
imported blood products joined a large-scale compensation suit
Tuesday against the state and five pharmaceutical makers that
marketed the products.
     The new group, which brings the total number of plaintiffs to
218, demands a total of 11.3 billion yen in compensation, swelling
the overall damages sought to 24.7 billion yen in the suit, pending
at the Tokyo District Court.
     The move comes after the Tokyo and Osaka District courts in
October proposed a solution to suits filed by HIV-infected
hemophiliacs, asking the state and five pharmaceutical makers to
compensate the plaintiffs.
     Some 1,800 people across Japan, almost all of them hemophiliacs,
have contracted the AIDS-inducing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
from contaminated imported blood products.
     According to the plaintiffs' lawyers, more victims are
considering joining the suit in the wake of the proposed out-of-court
settlement.
     The latest plaintiffs group, the eighth, includes people from
five prefectures not previously represented in the suit -- Aomori,
Gifu, Mie, Tokushima and Kumamoto.
     The number includes a woman who contracted the virus when she
accidentally pricked herself with a syringe needle while
administering an injection to her hemophiliac HIV-infected child.
     Both courts are currently negotiating with the plaintiffs and
the defendants in an effort to reach an out-of-court settlement by
next spring.  The most recent plaintiff group would be covered by
such a settlement.
     In a first proposal the pharmaceutical makers have offered to
compensate each plaintiff with 45 million yen for the time being.
The courts are, however, expected to come up with a second proposal
mapping out a final settlement of the matter.

Agency warns of rising sentiment against U.S. military+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Public Security Investigation Agency predicted Tuesday that
the domestic movement against the U.S. military presence in Japan
and the U.S.-Japan security alliance will grow stronger in 1996, and
did not rule out illegal acts.
     ''Political extremists and the Japanese Communist Party are
expected to continue to try to fan the struggle against the U.S.
(military presence) and the bilateral security treaty,'' the agency
said in its outlook on domestic and international security risks.
     It warned that extremists could stage attacks particularly in
protest at the forced lease of private land to U.S. bases in Okinawa
Prefecture.
     Calls for a reduction of the heavy U.S. presence in the
prefecture have grown louder since the Sept. 4 rape of an Okinawan
schoolgirl, for which three U.S. servicemen are on trial.
     The report says that the religious cult AUM Shinrikyo emerged
this year as the perpetrator of an unprecedented series of crimes
such as the March 20 sarin attack on Tokyo subways.
     The agency launched measures toward dissolving the cult based on
the Antisubversive Activities Law because ''there is an evident
danger that the cult will engage in similar activities in the
future,'' the report said.
     Noting that ultranationalist extremists staged three guerrilla
attacks in 1995, which abounded with World War II commemorations, the
agency cites concerns that such activities might become more
pronounced depending on government and opposition politicians' views
on the nation's war guilt.
     As for the situation abroad, the report says North Korea has as
yet apparently refrained from officially naming a new head of state
following the death in July 1994 of President Kim Il Sung so as to
make use of the late leader's charisma, as the nation is faced with
natural disasters and international scrutiny over its nuclear program.
     It also said that the North's de facto leader, Kim Jong Il,
might hide behind the power of his late father, who wielded strong
influence over the military, to ensure the continuity of the
country's system.
     In China, a September reshuffle in the Communist Party's Central
Committee has strengthened President Jiang Zemin's camp, the report
said, while warning that domestic trouble first of all on the
economic front could unleash another struggle about the nation's
direction.

Shinshinto's new head likely to be chosen Wed.+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Ballot counting will begin Wednesday morning for the
presidential election of the main opposition Shinshinto (New
Frontier Party), with observers seeing the party's Secretary General
Ichiro Ozawa leading his rival Tsutomu Hata.
     If the counting go smoothly, the winner will be known within the
day and the new president will officially assume office at a general
assembly of the party's Diet members Thursday.
     Both declaring that, if elected, they would aim to wrest power
from the ruling coalition, Ozawa, 53, and Hata, 60, have run the
two-horse race since Dec. 16.
     Ending the campaign, Ozawa told reporters, ''I am pleased that
the party could discuss policy issues'' during the campaign.  Hata, a
former prime minister, said, ''I feel confident of victory.''
     By Tuesday, when postal voting ended, some 1.68 million votes
had been cast -- 220,000 by party members and associated members plus
some 1.46 million by other Japanese citizens aged 18 or older who
paid 1,000 yen each to vote.
     Ozawa's camp has expressed confidence of winning a majority by
securing at least one million votes, while Hata's camp predicts votes
ranging from 600,000 to 900,000 have already been obtained.
     According to a survey conducted by Kyodo News Service on
Shinshinto's senior local chapter members, Ozawa led Hata, but there
is uncertainty about how ordinary Japanese citizens have voted.
     Ozawa and Hata, though long-time allies, are seeking the
presidency after the first president, Toshiki Kaifu, decided not
to seek reelection, having thrown his weight behind Ozawa.
     Ozawa was instrumental in creating Shinshinto a year ago through
a merger of all the main opposition forces, excluding the Japanese
Communist Party.  Hata briefly served as prime minister while serving
as the head of one of Shinshinto's predecessor parties.

Member of SDP left-wing runs for party leadership+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     A leading member of the Social Democratic Party's staunch
left-wing said Tuesday that he will run for the party leadership
next month when Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's term as party
chairman expires.
     Tadatoshi Akiba, a House of Representatives member from
Hiroshima, telephoned Murayama of his decision to run for the
chairmanship in an intraparty election scheduled for Jan. 14-15.
     The outcome of the poll is to be announced Jan. 16 and a new SDP
leadership selected at an annual party convention set for Jan. 19.
Applications for candidacy will be accepted Jan. 5.
     Murayama, 71, has suggested he will run for another term as the
party's leader and different quarters in the SDP have been floating
different names as potential opponents.
     Akiba, 53, has been a member of an SDP group opposed to policy
changes within the party and to the formation of a new liberal party
sought by a right-of-center group led by the party's No. 2 man,
Secretary General Wataru Kubo.
     Akiba's group opposes the dispatch of Self-Defense Forces troops
to the Golan Heights in the Middle East on a U.N. peacekeeping
mission and is against any increases in Japanese military might.
     The group, the Roundtable to Guard the Constitution, went so far
as to hold its own celebrations in November to mark the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the socialist party.
     Eligible to vote in the January election are some 110,000 SDP
members and supporters who have been cooperating with the party for
more than a year.
     The SDP is a partner in the tripartite ruling coalition that
also includes the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and New Party
Sakigake, an LDP splinter group.

Local political funds hit 160 bil. yen+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Political parties and fund-raising organizations collected a
total of 159.5 billion yen in local political funds in 1994,
according to a count by Kyodo News Service from reports to
prefectural election administration committees.
     The amount was larger, for the first time ever, than the total
of political funds collected in Tokyo and reported to the Home
Affairs Ministry, which was 148.4 billion yen.
     In total, the political funds collected in 1994 amounted to
307.9 billion yen, down 6.8% from the previous year, for the
third consecutive year-on-year decline since peaking at 359.1 billion
yen in 1991.
     Local fund-raising parties with proceeds of 10 million yen or
more numbered 225, for total funds of 7.7 billion yen, marking a
2.9-fold jump.
     The Japanese Communist Party topped the list of the fund raisers
in the prefectures, with 29.2 billion yen, followed by the Liberal
Democratic Party with 14.9 billion yen, and the Social Democratic
Party with 6.6 billion yen.

Dailies cautiously welcome new Shinshinto chief Ozawa+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Major Japanese dailies gave a cautious welcome in their
editorials Thursday to the election of Ichiro Ozawa as president of
the main opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party).
     ''Although there are various concerns, it is a good thing that
Mr. Ozawa has emerged as the starring figure at center stage from
backstage,'' the Asahi Shimbun said, referring to Ozawa's role as the
party's backstage power broker.
     ''It can at least be appreciated that Ozawa has tried to meet a
request for creating (two) opposing axes over ideology and policy,''
the Asahi said, in reference to Ozawa's claim that the Japanese
political system should become one dominated by two major political
parties.
     ''What the Japanese people should welcome is that 'the Ozawa
method' will be easier to be seen on the surface,'' the Mainichi
Shimbun said in reference to Ozawa's behind-the-scene political
maneuvering.
     ''Mr. Ozawa has never stood in the Diet for questioning as party
chief and for questioning before (the House of Representatives)
budget committee...Since he became secretary general of Shinshinto,
he has noticeably acted in secret as he has often been absent (at
party meetings)...This has provided an excuse for criticism of a dual
power structure (in Shinshinto), but it cannot be tolerated in a
party chief,'' the Mainichi said.
     The Yomiuri Shimbun said, ''With the election of Ozawa, said to
have been the party's backstage power broker, we expect Shinshinto's
'dual power structure' to end and the transparency in party
management to increase.''
     ''We also hope he delivers the 'easy-to-understand politics and
powerful execution' that he has been campaigning for.  Many of those
who voted for him must think the same way,'' the Yomiuri said.
     On Wednesday, Ozawa scored an overwhelming victory over his
long-time political ally, former Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, to
become the head of Shishinto.

Murayama's new year visit to shrine OK, gov't says+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The government sees no problem in Prime Minister Tomiichi
Murayama paying a visit to Ise Shrine in Mie Prefecture in western
Japan on Jan. 4, a top government spokesman said Thursday.
     ''There are various arguments against visiting Yasukuni Shrine,
but prime ministers' visits to Ise have already become a customary
annual event,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary Koken Nosaka told a press
conference.
     Answering questions about whether Murayama's Ise visit does not
violate the constitutional principle of separation of state and
religion, Nosaka said Murayama's Social Democratic Party has also
discussed the problem and agreed to sanction the visit.
     During the 38-year period to 1993 of single-party rule under the
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), LDP premiers made it a rule to pay a
New Year visit to Ise.
     Ise Shrine enshrines the goddess Amaterasu, the legendary
ancestor of the imperial family, while Yasukuni Shrine enshrines the
Japanese military war dead.
     Murayama, who came to power in June last year, did not go to Ise
in January this year because of a cold.

Takemura said Thursday the next general election is likely to take
place by next fall.
     Takemura, appearing on an NHK TV program to be broadcast during
the New Year holidays, said the House of Representatives would not be
dissolved until the end of the Diet's 150-day regular session
beginning in late January.
     He also hinted that Sakigake, a splinter group of the Liberal
Democratic Party, may join a new party with members of Prime Minister
Tomiichi Murayama's Social Democratic Party, depending on its
policies.

Japan deplores 5th French nuclear test+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Japan expressed strong dissatisfaction Thursday over the fifth
nuclear test this year carried out by France in the South Pacific on
Wednesday.
     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama told reporters that France ''has
said it will stop nuclear testing upon the conclusion of a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, but nuclear testing is
meaningless and France should stop it immediately.''
     Chief Cabinet Secretary Koken Nosaka also expressed regret over
the nuclear testing, saying France's nuclear tests run counter to
international efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament.
     ''France said it would conduct one more test, but 'enough' is
the call of the world,'' said Nosaka, the chief government spokesman,
in a press conference.
     France detonated a nuclear device at Mururoa Atoll in French
Polynesia at 12:30 p.m. Wednesday local time, the fifth test since it
resumed nuclear tests in the South Pacific in September.
     France originally planned to conduct a total of seven or eight
tests, but the government said the number would probably be reduced
to six and that the current series of tests will be completed by the
end of February.
     Foreign Minister Yohei Kono summoned Denis Gauer, acting French
ambassador to Japan, to the ministry to protest the latest nuclear
detonation.
     Gauer told Kono that the sixth test would be conducted earlier
than the end of February.  Kono told the envoy that he cannot condone
further testing by France, officials said.
     Takashi Hiraoka, the mayor of Hiroshima, sent a letter of
protest over the nuclear test to French Ambassador to Japan
Jean-Bernard Ouvrieu on Thursday, urging France to immediately halt
its nuclear testing.
     Hiraoka said he feels ''strong anger'' that France defied the
Dec. 12 U.N. resolution calling for an end to nuclear testing.
     ''It is an action betraying the trust of the people of the
world, and is French egoism,'' Hiraoka said at a news conference.
     Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito said he cannot understand why French
President Jacques Chirac, ''who experienced wars,'' is still unable
to search for coexistence of the human race.
     Nagasaki Mayor Isamu Takada has also sent a letter of protest to
Ouvrieu, stating that the test ignores the world community's desire
for the abolition of nuclear weapons.
     The statement urged France to immediately cease the tests and
work for the early abolition of nuclear weapons.
     About 45 people, members of the Nagasaki Peace Workers' Center
and the Nagasaki chapter of the Japan Congress Against A and H Bombs,
staged a one-hour sit-in to protest the test in front of the bronze
Statue of Peace in Nagasaki Peace Park.
     About 30 members of the Nagasaki branch of a union of
prefectural workers staged a sit-in outside the prefectural
government headquarters and adopted a resolution urging nuclear
powers to promote nuclear disarmament and accept responsibility for
the continued existence of the earth and humankind.
     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura released a statement in his
capacity as leader of New Party Sakigake, saying France's dignity in
the international community ''fell to the ground'' in 1995.
     No matter excuses France makes, it conducts nuclear tests just
to protect itself and that can never be justified, Takemura said.
     Takemura drew international attention when he went to the French
Polynesian island of Tahiti in September to join in a rally to
protest against the French nuclear tests.
     Murayama's Social Democratic Party also denounced the nuclear
test, saying it ''could in no way tolerate'' the repeated testing,
urging the government to recall its ambassador to Paris.
     The party will appeal directly to the French people for support
to stop the testing through an advertisement it plans to run in a
French newspaper, party officials said.
     Meanwhile, a Hiroshima-based group of pacifist mayors around the
world sent a statement criticizing the test to Chirac and other
French leaders.
     The statement by the World Conference of Mayors for Peace
Through Inter-City Solidarity voiced ''strong disappointment'' and
lodged ''a strong protest.''
     In Tokyo, scores of protesters gathered in front of the French
Embassy in Tokyo, renewing their appeal for an immediate halt to
nuclear testing.

13 Diet members to leave for Palestine election monitoring+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Thirteen Diet members will make up a bipartisan delegation to
visit Palestinian self-rule areas as election monitors at the
request of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser
Arafat, officials said Thursday.
     The delegation, which includes members from both houses of the
Diet, will leave Japan on Jan. 16 in time to visit polling stations
during the Jan. 20 election, the officials said.
     The election will establish a Palestinian council to act as
parliament under self-rule.
     Keizo Obuchi, former vice president of the Liberal Democratic
Party, will lead the delegation, the officials said.
     They said the delegation will meet Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres before returning to Tokyo on Jan. 23.

GSDF says 30 garrison towns could be streamlined+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) has drawn up a report,
saying about 30 of its 160 garrison towns nationwide could be
streamlined under Japan's new defense program, according to a copy
of the report made available Thursday.
     The streamlining will be possible because the number of GSDF
members will be reduced to 1,000 or fewer at some 100 garrison towns
under the proposed new defense program, the report says.
     The new defense program outline, which is to replace the current
Cold War-era version mapped out in 1976, is expected to set the
number of GSDF personnel at 145,000, down from the present 180,000.
     The new outline calls for cutting the number of GSDF divisions
to nine from the current 13.
     The GSDF will decide which garrison towns will be streamlined
within five years in the hope that the plan will be carried out in 10
years' time after making adjustments with the municipalities
concerned.
     The government is now working on details of the new defense
program outline so as to have it adopted in time for the start of
fiscal 1996 in April.

Hashimoto says he will push for LDP gov't+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Ryutaro Hashimoto said
Thursday he would fight the next general election with the aim of
achieving a majority of seats for the LDP.
     ''In the next election, we will give it all we've got to win the
people's support for an LDP government,'' Hashimoto said in a
prerecorded New Year program for Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK).
     Hashimoto, the international trade and industry minister, has
apparently articulated his ambition of winning a monopoly on power in
place of the current ruling coalition with the Social Democratic
Party (SDP) and New Party Sakigake, political analysts said.
     But Hashimoto's words are not viewed by LDP watchers as
signaling a new party policy of breaking up the tripartite alliance
any time soon.
     Hashimoto has only paid lip service to some combatant LDP
lawmakers who do not relish being in coalition with the socialists
and have made clear their desire for a monopoly on power, they said.
     Hashimoto also said in the NHK program that the House of
Representatives should not be dissolved for a snap election at least
until the budget for the next fiscal year passes the Diet.
     He added that a dissolution of the lower house is unlikely to
come until after a Group of Seven summit meeting in France at the
end of June.
     The LDP leader said Ichiro Ozawa, the newly elected head of the
main opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), harbors some
ideas that are ''diametrically opposed'' to the LDP's policies.

Kuwaiti-Palestinian gains rare refugee status in Japan+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     A Palestinian whose original application for refugee status in
Japan was turned down in 1992 on Thursday became the first and only
person among hundreds of such applicants to be granted the status on
appeal to the justice minister.
     Fawaz Housein El Hanafy, 29, of Ichikawa, Chiba Prefecture,
first applied for refugee status after arriving in Japan in November
1991.  The application was rejected in November 1992 and he appealed.
     Between 1982 and June this year, 357 people have used a system
which allows applicants to appeal directly to the minister if their
application is turned down.  Fawaz is the first whose appeal has been
accepted.
     Makoto Iwai, manager of the Japanese branch of the human rights
organization Amnesty International, told a press conference shared
with Fawaz in Tokyo that the case could signify a change in the
appeals system.
     ''I would like to see this case serve as the catalyst for a
change in the way Japan recognizes refugees,'' Iwai said.
     The ministry has not clarified its reasons for granting the
status to Fawaz.
     But supporters of Fawaz said it appeared the ministry had not
appreciated the need to grant him refugee status at the time of his
initial application because an Iranian interpreter used by the
ministry did not understand his Arabic.
     They said another possible reason for the decision to grant him
refugee status was Fawaz's statelessness which meant there would be
no diplomatic repercussions.
     Fawaz was born stateless in Kuwait to parents who left the Gaza
Strip after the foundation of Israel in 1948.
     After Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in 1990 and the Palestine
Liberation Organization threw its support behind Iraq, feeling
against Palestinians in Kuwait ran high and Fawaz said he was forced
to flee the country fearing the Kuwaiti government was about to
apprehend him.

U.S. forces to ease 'off-limits' for Okinawa servicemen+

NAHA, Japan, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The U.S. military informed the city of Okinawa on Thursday that
it will relax Saturday a ban on its personnel from entering busy
streets, a measure taken after the indictment of three of its
servicemen on charges of raping a local schoolgirl.
     ''Off-limits'' hours, which stretch from midnight to 6 a.m. at
present, will be shortened to between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m.
     Out of concern over the effect on local restaurants and other
entertainment businesses, however, city authorities are still
demanding the total lifting of the ban, which the U.S. forces imposed
Oct. 14
     It was the first ''off-limits'' measure taken by the U.S.
military in Japan since the southwesternmost Japanese prefecture was
returned to Tokyo in 1972 after 27 years of U.S. occupation.
     The measure was not welcomed by proprietors in the area whose
businesses depend largely on U.S. service personnel.
     Noting that about 10 restaurants and bars have already been
forced to close due to the measure, city officials think it is
unlikely that the partial relaxation will dramatically change the
situation.
     Japanese prosecutors have indicted three U.S. servicemen on
charges of abducting and raping an Okinawa schoolgirl in early
September.
     The case has caused anger among Japanese, especially in Okinawa
Prefecture where three quarters of U.S. military facilities in Japan
are concentrated in terms of land space.

Ozawa gets 3 ex-premiers to accept party jobs+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Ichiro Ozawa, the newly elected president of the main
opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), said Thursday he
has secured commitments from three former prime ministers within
Shinshinto to accept senior party posts and support the party in the
next election.
     After successive talks with Tsutomu Hata, who lost the party's
presidential election to Ozawa, Toshiki Kaifu and Morihiro Hosokawa,
Ozawa said, ''I obtained agreements from the three'' to assuming
''significant party posts.''
     Ozawa, who was formally named president of Shinshinto at a
meeting of party Diet members earlier Thursday, underlined his
readiness to launch an all-out fight against the coalition government
of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.
     The hard-line new opposition leader also made no secret of his
intention of resorting to every possible means to force Murayama to
dissolve the House of Representatives for a snap general election.
     The 53-year-old Ozawa, previously the party's secretary general,
will serve a two-year term, replacing outgoing Shinshinto President
Kaifu, who did not seek reelection.
     Following the inauguration, Ozawa immediately started forming
the new party leadership, with the primary aim of restoring party
unity ahead of the next election.
     Ozawa told a press conference that he plans to create a new
advisory panel for the party chief to incorporate the views of the
three former prime ministers.
     Their presence in party machinery will help consolidate a united
front, he said.
     He also said at the press conference that Shinshinto has an
important ''mission'' in the face of many problems confronting Japan
both at home and abroad.
     ''I am not necessarily very confident that I can fulfill this
responsibility as party head, but I will do my best,'' he said.
     He called the Murayama government ''irresponsible'' for adopting
a controversial plan to use 685 billion yen of taxpayers' money to
liquidate seven moribund housing loan companies and reiterated his
intention of forcing him into an early election.
     Hardly had Ozawa begun attempting to heal the party rift when
rival Hata apparently moved to keep his distance from the chief.
     Hata's supporters set up a preparation committee for a new
policy study group, which a close Hata aide said is aimed at helping
young members to win elections but which could become a faction-like
grouping.
     The group will seek to make Shinshinto ''a fair and open party''
by incorporating opinions from rank-and-file members and discussing
Ozawa's policy proposals, according to the supporters.
     They said the study group will be established before a regular
Diet session starts in January.
     Meanwhile, Ozawa made the round of greetings with the leaders of
other parties.
     At the headquarters of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), to
which Ozawa once belonged, President Ryutaro Hashimoto, trade
minister, greeted Ozawa by saying, ''Welcome back and
congratulations.''
     ''It is really a long time (since I left the party),'' Ozawa
said, adding he felt as if he had come home.
     When Ozawa asked for Hashimoto's ''guidance,'' the LDP head
said, ''We both bear responsibility for the Japanese people and for
the world.  Let's put our shoulders to the wheels.''
     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, who heads the Social
Democratic Party, congratulated Ozawa on his ''overwhelming victory.''
     At the headquarters of New Party Sakigake headed by Finance
Minister Masayoshi Takemura, acting party chief Shusei Tanaka courted
Ozawa, saying the two parties may strike an alliance on some
important issues.
     Ozawa responded by saying, ''I have no intention of engaging in
mere Diet maneuverings.  We can work together on some high-level
problems.''

U.S. serviceman indicted for possession of rifle+

AOMORI, Japan, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     A U.S. serviceman from Misawa base in northern Japan was
indicted Thursday for alleged possession of a rifle and bullets
without a permit.
     The serviceman, Airman 2nd Class John Turner, 25, was released
the same day on bail of 1 million yen after he was indicted by
prosecutors in Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture.
     Prosecutors allege the rifle and 12 bullets were found in a car
Turner was driving Dec. 13.  Police arrested him that day.
     Police said Turner is also suspected of firing a hunting rifle
in a park in Misawa on Dec. 10 and that once sufficient evidence is
collected they could send papers to the prosecutors on the case early
next month alleging he fired the rifle in an area banned to hunting.
     They said Turner has already admitted to most of the details in
the prosecution case.
     Police said at the time that a park worker heard four gunshots
and immediately saw two foreigners in the park holding a rifle.
     The two men then left in a car with a U.S. forces number plate,
according to the worker.  Nobody was injured in the incident.

Japanese envoy protests at French nuclear test+

PARIS, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     A senior Japanese diplomat protested Thursday against the
latest French nuclear test conducted in the South Pacific late
Wednesday.
      Charge d'Affaires to France Yutaka Iimura told a French Foreign
Ministry official in charge of Asian affairs that it is extremely
regrettable that France has conducted another nuclear test at Mururoa
Atoll, the fifth in the recent series, Japanese officials said.
     Pointing out that the United Nations passed a resolution in the
General Assembly on Dec. 12 calling for the immediate termination of
all nuclear tests, Iimura called on France to stop such tests.
     The French official only reiterated that Paris is ready to sign
a comprehensive test ban treaty soon after the current series of
tests is complete, the officials said.

U.S. plans int'l investment forum for ex-communist states+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The United States is likely to propose setting up a forum to
allow former Soviet Union and East European governments to exchange
information with companies in industrialized nations that are
interested in investing in the region, trade ministry officials said
Friday.
     The proposal will be made when trade ministers of the Group of
Seven (G-7) major industrialialized nations meet their counterparts
from Russia, Poland and 12 other ex-communist states in Baltimore,
Maryland, on Jan. 8-10 to discuss support for their economic reforms
efforts.
     The U.S. is sounding out other participating nations about the
forum, which could be a key issue at the meeting, the officials of the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.
     The East-West trade ministers' conference, which will also be
attended by business representatives, started in 1992 and the
upcoming session will be the fourth such meeting.
     At the meeting, the ministers will gauge achievements under last
year's Warsaw Declaration which calls for cumulative investment in
the former Soviet and East European states to hit 200 billion dollars
by the turn of the century, the officials said.
     The participants, meanwhile, will discuss the target countries'
tax systems relative to trade and investment as well as concrete
steps to improve business practices in the region, they added.
     Also on the agenda will be practical advice on accounting
procedures and market surveys for promoting privatization of
state-run enterprises and conversion of military contractors into
civilian corporations, according to the officials.
     The Japanese mission will consist of MITI Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto as well as executives from trading houses, banks and other
relevant companies, the officials said.
     After the trade gathering, Hashimoto will go to Washington and
stay there until Jan. 13 to meet ranking U.S. government officials
and Congressional leaders.  The trade ministry is also planning to
include a meeting with President Bill Clinton in his itinerary, they
said.

Ozawa names Yonezawa, Hata's aides for key party posts+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Ichiro Ozawa, newly-elected president of the main opposition
Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), on Friday named Takashi Yonezawa as
the party's secretary general and gave senior party posts to two
aides of his rival Tsutomu Hata, party officials said.
     In forming the new party leadership, Ozawa apparently placed
priority on healing the wounds left by the bitter battle with Hata in
the presidential election.
     Yonezawa was previously chairman of the now-defunct Democratic
Socialist Party, one of nine parties and groups that merged to form
Shinshinto in December last year.
     Ozawa named Hajime Funada, a close aide to Hata, as acting
chairman of the Political Activities Council under Kozo Watanabe, who
continues to head the key council.
     Another Hata follower, Kazuo Aichi, was appointed as chairman of
the Policy Research Council.
     Ozawa was formally named party president Thursday after
overwhelming his sole rival, former Prime Minister Hata, in the party
presidential race.
     The new party executive line-up was announced by the new
secretary general Yonezawa at a press conference in the Diet building.
     Shinshinto chief Ozawa also created a ''supreme advisory
council'' within the party and appointed to it as members three
former prime ministers -- Toshiki Kaifu, Morihiro Hosokawa and Hata.
     Ozawa himself also took the post of the chairman of the
''tomorrow cabinet.''
     New Secretary General Yonezawa said at a press conference that a
''well-balanced'' executive body has been formed.

MOF vice minister to quit over ministry scandals++

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Administrative Vice Finance Minister Kyosuke Shinozawa will
resign at the beginning of next year amid a storm of criticism of
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) following a series of financial
scandals, including the involvement of ministry officials in
improper activities.
     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura on Friday accepted
Shinozawa's offer of resignation.
     Shinozawa, who took the ministry's top administrative post last
May, offered to resign after the ministry presented its draft fiscal
1996 budget Dec. 20.
     Tadashi Ogawa, director general of the National Tax
Administration Agency, will succeed Shinozawa as vice finance
minister.
     Shinozawa's resignation and the appointment of his successor
will be formally approved at a cabinet meeting Jan. 5.
     At a hastily arranged press conference, Takemura said, ''I have
accepted Shinozawa's resignation to improve the morale of the
ministry, which is under an oppressive atmosphere following scandals
involving ministry officials.''
     ''Shinozawa is not quitting to take the blame for any individual
incident, such as the failure of two Tokyo credit unions or the
ministry's decision to use taxpayers' money for the liquidation of
ailing housing loan companies,'' he said.
     In talks with reporters after the press conference, Shinozawa
said, ''I have decided to step down to let some fresh air into the
ministry from the start of the New Year.''
     Shinozawa said he is not resigning to take responsibility for
the ministry's response to any individual incident.
     The ministry has been under fierce criticism at home and abroad
for its lack of transparency in dealing with a series of incidents
that have hit the financial industry, including the bad loan issue at
housing loan companies and a huge loss cover-up at Daiwa Bank's New
York branch.
     Domestic criticism is focused on a series of scandals involving
ministry officials.
     So far this year, two senior ministry officials, including
Yoshio Nakajima, head of the Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy,
a Finance Ministry affiliate, have quit after they were found to have
had cozy relations with people linked to the two failed Tokyo credit
unions involved in illicit loan scandals.
     Shinozawa said he had pondered whether he should resign at a
time when the ministry was about to proceed with a liquidation scheme
recently mapped out for struggling housing loan companies.
     But he thought it necessary for him, as the top-ranking
bureaucrat, to take action after a year which saw so many incidents
take place, Shinozawa said.
     At the news conference, Takemura said he currently has no
intention to resign to take the blame for the series of financial
scandals.
     ''It is my responsibility to flesh out the liquidation scheme
for ailing housing loan companies,'' he said.
     Since Takemura became finance minister in June 1994, Shinozawa
is the second vice finance minister to resign before the expiry of
his term of office.
     Shinozawa's predecessor, Jiro Saito, resigned in May under
strong pressure from the Liberal Democratic Party, the largest of the
three coalition parties, for his strong ties with key opposition
leader Ichiro Ozawa and their joint campaign to legislate a
''national welfare tax'' that he and Ozawa reportedly devised to
replace the 3% comsumption tax.
     Takemura told the news conference Friday he has selected Ogawa
as Shinozawa's successor and added Ogawa will be replaced at the
National Tax Administration Agency by Sohei Hidaka, director general
of the ministry's Securities Bureau.

Upper house VP agrees to pay debts with expense money+

AOMORI, Japan, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     House of Councillors Vice President Kanpei Matsuo has reached
an agreement with a credit union to pay back some 700 million yen in
loans using part of his public expense account, informed sources
said Friday.
     Matsuo has promised the credit union in Aomori Prefecture that
he will use part of the 29 million yen annual expense allotment for
the vice presidential post to pay back loans owed by himself and
related companies.
     Matsuo has been in arrears on the loans, with principal now
totaling 700 million yen.  Some of the loans date back 20 years.
     Matsuo said his own loans amount to only about 40 million yen,
adding that the rest is owed by those for whom he has given
guarantees.
     ''There is no legal problem to the arrangement,'' he said.
