CONGRESSIONAL MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS ARE VALUABLE INFO SOURCES

Congressional member organizations-including caucuses and 
informal groups-can be valuable information resources for the 
savvy business researcher, yielding wealths of foreign and 
domestic industry, regional, and other intelligence.
 
Currently 165 such groups grace Capitol Hill and although the 
member Senators and Representatives themselves are generally tough 
to approach, all have at least one-often several-staff members 
who are highly approachable.
 
The level of cooperation with which you'll be greeted will vary.  
In many cases you'll encounter an open-door to virtually all the 
information on hand and available to members themselves.
 
In other cases, your caucus staff contact may simply be a 
launching pad, referring you to his stable of information 
resources on Capitol Hill, in government agencies, and in private 
sector organizations.
 
In some cases, you'll find that the group from which you're 
soliciting information will have actually published reports.  
While these were likely prepared for internal distribution, modest 
persuasion can often pry them loose.
 
On pages 4-5 of this issue of THE INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION REPORT 
you'll find a directory of "Congressional Member Organizations with 
International Focus."  We've divided the entries into two categories:
 
Those with direct foreign interests, such as a focus on a specific 
foreign country or region, and 
 
Those with indirect foreign interests, such as industry-oriented 
caucuses that are concerned with-for example-competition from 
abroad.
 
For each, we provide contact information including at least one 
staff member directly concerned with caucus interests.

MEXICO CHANGES TELECOMMUNICATIONS LAW

Mexico has revamped its telecommunications regulatory authority and 
laws governing telephone and broadcasting companies.  The changes 
have major impacts on U.S. and other firms seeking to participate in 
these service industries.  An increase in foreign ownership limits 
and authority to privatize the satellite industry are but two of many 
key changes.
 
A FREE report on the changes, SPECIAL REPORT ON MEXICO:  1995 FEDERAL 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS LAW AND REORGANIZATION OF THE SECRETARIA DE 
COMUNICACIONES Y TRANSPORTES, is available from the Planning and 
Negotiations Division, International Bureau, Federal Communications 
Commission, 2000 M Street, N.W., Washington, DC  20554, 202-418-2150.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
------------------------
1.  THE BELGIAN PARLIAMENT APPROVED THE COALITION'S L997
BUDGET OCTOBER 4 ON A STRAIGHT PARTY VOTE.

THE BUDGET, BASED ON A CONSERVATIVE L997 GROWTH FORECAST
OF 2.1 PERCENT (NET), INCLUDES BF80 BILLION (USDOLS 2.55
BILLION) OF MEASURES AIMED AT CUTTING THE BUDGET DEFICIT
TO 2.9 PERCENT, BELOW THE 3 PERCENT MAASTRICHT CRITERION
FOR EMU.  IT ALSO INCLUDES BF 367 BILLION IN REVENUE
FROM ASSET SALES TO REDUCE THE CUMULATIVE DEBT BY FOUR
PERCENTAGE POINTS TO L27 PERCENT OF GDP BY THE END OF
1997.  PRIMARY FEDERAL SPENDING IS TO BE CUT BY F L7
BILLION, INCLUDING CUTS IN SUBSIDIES TO PUBIC
COMPANIES, IN INTERNATIONAL AID AND MILITARY SENDING.
SOME CUTS ARE MORE REAL THAN OTHERS, THEVAST MAJORITY
HOWEVER INVOLVES CUTS AGAINST BASEINE EXPENDITURE
PROJECTIONS.

2.  SOCIAL SECURTY SPENDING WILL BE CUT BY BF 23
BILLION, INCLUDNG HEALTH CARE SAVINGS, REDUCED CHILD
ALLOWANCE RTES, AND A GRADUAL INCREASE IN THE
RETIREMENT AG OF WOMEN TO 65 YEARS (MATCHING THAT FOR
MEN).  EDERAL REVENUES ARE PROJECTED TO INCREASE BY BF
3 BILLION, INCLUDING EXCISE AND PETROL TAX INCREASS,
AS WELL AS TAX CHANGES ON SOME SAVINGS INSTRUMNTS.
WHILE MOST COMMENTATORS THINK THE L997 BUDGT IS A
REALISTIC ONE, THEY ALSO POINT OUT THAT PIME MINISTER
DEHAENE SEEMED UNABLE TO ESCAPE FRO THE DEMANDS OF HIS
COALITION PARTNERS, MAKING IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO
USE THE SPECIAL POWERS GRANTED IN THE SUMMER ALLOWING
HIM TO BY-PASS PARLIAMENT.  END INTRODUCTION AND
SUMMARY.

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
-------------------------

3.  WHILE SOME OF THIS COALITION'S EARLIER BUDGETS ERRED
IN BEING BASED ON OVERLY OPTIMISTIC MACROECONOMIC
ASSUMPTIONS, THIS CANNOT BE SAID FOR THE L997 BUDGET:

-- NET GDP GROWTH L.2 PERCENT IN L996 AND 2.1 PERCENT IN
   L997;
-- INFLATION L.9 PERCENT FOR BOTH L996 AND L997;
-- SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATE FOR L997: 4.1 PERCENT;
-- PRIMARY SURPLUS (I.E., NET OF INTEREST EXPENDITURES):
   6 PERCENT OF GDP;
-- TOTAL FEDERAL DEFICIT BF 212 BILLION, I.E., 2.7
   PERCENT OF GDP, TO WHICH THE DEFICITS OF THE SOCIAL
   SECURITY SYSTEM AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE REGIONS AND
   COMMUNITIES HAVE TO BE ADDED, BRINGING THE OVERALL
   TOTAL TO 2.9 PERCENT OF GDP.

BOTH THE GDP AND SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES SEEM TO BE
PRUDENT, E.G., THE OECD AS WELL AS THE EUROPEAN
COMMISSION USE 2.5 PERCENT NET GROWTH AND 5 PERCENT
SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES IN THEIR FORECASTS FOR
BELGIUM.

SPENDING GROWTH HELD BELOW INFLATION
------------------------------------

4.  OVERALL, THESE ASSUMPTIONS RESULT IN THE FOLLOWING
KEY EXPENDITURE FIGURES FOR THE 1997 BUDGET (IN BILLIONS
BF):
                  1996       1997   PCT.  PERCENTAGE OF
                                    INCR.  GDP (1997)
PROGRAM EXPEND.    788.0     811.2   1.2     8.1
SOC. SECURITY    1,492.6   1,514.3   1.4    15.1
INTEREST           668.0     676.4   1.2     6.7
REGIONAL TRANSF.   829.8     886.4   6.8     8.8
EU TRANSFERS        91.2      82.9  -9.2     8.3

TOTAL:           3,869.6   3,971.2   2.6    38.8

5.  INDIVIDUAL BUDGET FIGURES FOR THE VARIOUS MINISTRIES
(E.G. DEFENSE, DEVELOPMENT AID, FOREIGN AFFAIRS) WILL
ONLY BECOME AVAILABLE AROUND NOVEMBER - TOTAL PROGRAM
SPENDING IS BUDGETED TO DECREASE FROM 39.4 PERCENT OF
GDP IN 1996 TO 38.8 PERCENT IN 1997.
-
NEW RECEIPTS
------------

6.  THE TOTAL REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP WILL BE
MAINTAINED IN L997 AT THE SAME LEVEL AS IN L996 (A
POLITICAL TENET OF THE CHRISTIAN-DEMOCRATIC COALITION
PARTNERS).  NEW FISCAL MEASURES ARE INCLUDED IN THE L997
BUDGET, INCLUDING A BF 7.3 BILLION INCREASE IN PETROL
TAXES, BF 3.7 BILLION EXCISE TAXES ON BEER AND A BF L.2
BILLION TURNOVER TAX LEVIED ON THE BANK'S SMALL SAVINGS
ACCOUNTS HELD BY INDIVIDUALS, AND BF 5.5 BILLION THROUGH
COMBATTING FISCAL FRAUD.  A MORE STRUCTURAL MEASURE IN
THIS CATEGORY IS THE CONTINUED NON-INDEXATION OF TAX
BRACKETS FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW.
MOST OF THESE MEASURES ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET CONTINUING
DECLINES IN FISCAL RECEIPTS FROM A REDUCTION IN THE
TOTAL SALARY MASS AND MEASURES SUCH AS A CUT IN
EMPLOYERS' SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTION FOR LOWER WAGES.

EXPENDITURE RESTRAINT.AGAIN
-----------------------------

7.  THE BUDGET CONCLAVE PRODUCED BF L7 BILLION IN
EXPENDITURE CUTS, THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES BEING A
REVISED SUBSIDY TO THE POSTAL SYSTEM (BF 5.3 BILLION), A
BF 5.8 BILLION CUT IN THE SUBSIDIES TO PUBLIC COMPANIES,
A BF L BILLION REDUCTION EACH IN FOREIGN AID AND DEFENSE
(FROM BF 98 BILLION TO BF 97 BILLION), AND A BF L
BILLION FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR NUCLEAR WASTE.
PUBLIC INVESTMENT WAS ALSO CUT BY BF 700 MILLION,
BRINGING IT TO ONLY L.5 PERCENT OF GDP, LESS THAN HALF
THE EUROPEAN UNION AVERAGE.  THIS MEANS THAT SUCCESSIVE
BELGIAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE REDUCED THEIR PUBLIC
INVESTMENTS BY TWO-THIRDS SINCE THE LATE SEVENTIES, AND
BY 50 PERCENT SINCE THE EARLY EIGHTIES.  NEVERTHELESS,
THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE SOME ROOM FOR EXTRA EXPENDITURES,
SUCH AS A BF 2.5 BILLION INCREASE IN THE JUSTICE
MINISTRY BUDGET (TIED TO THE REFORM OF BELGIUM'S JUSTICE
SYSTEM) AND A BF 2 BILLION (OVER 4 YEARS) INCREASE IN
AIRBUS SUBSIDIES.

SOCIAL SECURITY
---------------

8.  THE L997 CUTS MAINLY AFFECT HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES
(BF L9.6 BILLION) AND UNEMPLOYMENT (BF 2.5 BILLION).
OTHER MEASURES REFORMING DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE
SYSTEM SUCH AS FAMILY ALLOWANCES AND PENSIONS ARE FAR
MORE MODEST IN L997, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE
STRONGER IMPACT IN LATER YEARS, TOTALLING BF 34 BILLION
(IN L997 FRANCS) BY THE YEAR 2000.  YET, IT IS HERE THAT
THE COALITION SEEMS TO HAVE EXPERIENCED MOST OF ITS
DIFFICULTIES, CAUSING A DELAY BY ALMOST TWO MONTHS IN
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE L997 BUDGET.  (ALTHOUGH THE
GOVERNMENT DID MEET THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE OF
OCTOBER 1, THE DRAFT BUDGET FOR THE NEXT YEAR IS
TRADITIONALLY FINALIZED BY THE END OF JULY). THE DEHAENE
GOVERNMENT HAD ASKED FOR AND OBTAINED SPECIAL POWERS
ALLOWING IT TO BYPASS PARLIAMENT ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF A
STRUCTURAL REFORM OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, BUT THE
COALITION REMAINS GRIDLOCKED OVER FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES
SUCH AS REFORMING THE PUBLIC SECTOR PENSIONS, TAXING
FAMILY ALLOWANCES, AND MAKING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS MORE
LIMITED IN TIME.

DEBT MANAGEMENT
---------------

9.  A 4 PERCENTAGE POINT GDP DECREASE IN THE CUMULATIVE
DEBT/GDP RATIO WILL BE ACHIEVED IN L997 MAINLY THROUGH A
REDUCTION OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT, PAID FOR BY THE
SALE OF EXTRA GOLD BY THE NATIONAL BANK OF BELGIUM (NBB)
(BF 222 BILLION) AND A CONTINUED SALE OF PUBLIC ASSETS
IN ENTERPRISES SUCH AS CREDIT COMMUNAL, THE MUNICIPALLY
OWNED BANK, AND ASLK-CGER, THE BANK AND INSURANCE
COMPANY (BF 70 BILLION IN ALL).  ANOTHER BF 75 BILLION
IS SUPPOSED TO COME FROM A MORE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF
PUBLIC ASSETS (E.G., INVESTING THEM IN BONDS RATHER THAN
PLACING THEM WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS).  THUS, THE
BELGIAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE CUMULATIVE
DEBT FROM L37 TO L27 PERCENT OF GDP IN FIVE YEARS TIME.
BY MAINTAINING A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH LEVEL OF PRIMARY
SURPLUS, IT WILL ACHIEVE A STEADY DECREASE OF THE
DEBT/GDP RATIO, WHEREBY MORE AND MORE ROOM WILL BECOME
AVAILABLE FOR PROGRAM (I.E., NON-INTEREST) GOVERNMENT
EXPENDITURE, AND THE PUBLIC DEBT WILL BE REDUCED TO 60
PERCENT OF GDP OVER AN ACCEPTABLE PERIOD OF TIME.

COMMENTS
--------

10.  ACCORDING TO DEHAENE'S ECONOMIC CHIEF OF STAFF,
THIS IS THE BUDGET WHICH IS POLITICALLY MOST ACCEPTABLE
AT THE MOMENT.  ANYTHING MORE FUNDAMENTAL, SUCH AS A
DRASTIC REFORM OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, WAS
IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE IN SUCH A SHORT TIME SPAN.  THE
SPECIAL BUDGET POWERS EXPIRE IN JULY 1997, BUT ALREADY
BY APRIL 1997 FOR SOCIAL SECURITY.  HENCE, THE
INEVITABLE REFORM OF THE CIVIL SERVICE PENSION SYSTEM
MAY HAVE BEEN POSTPONED FOR NOW, BUT 'SOMETHING' NEEDS
TO BE DONE BEFORE EASTER 1997, SINCE IT IS TREATED AS A
SOCIAL SECURITY ISSUE FIRST, AND ONLY THEN AS A BUDGET
PROBLEM.

11.  PETER PRAET, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT THE GENERALE DE
BANQUE, MORE OR LESS CONFIRMS THIS VIEW, WHEN HE CALLED
THE BUDGET "POLITICALLY VERY BALANCED".  HE COMMENTED
THAT IT NEEDED TO BE POLITICALLY MORE UNBALANCED TO
ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS.  PRAET POINTS OUT THAT
TWO-THIRDS OF THE CURRENT BUDGET DEFICIT CAN BE
ATTRIBUTED TO STRUCTURAL FACTOR REASONS, SUCH AS THE
FACT THAT THE BELGIAN ECONOMY IS ACTUALLY GROWING BELOW
ITS GROWTH POTENTIAL.  MOST OUTSIDE OBSERVERS AGREE THAT
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTED WISELY BY STARTING FROM
VERY CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS, THAT THERE ARE FEWER STOP
AND GO MEASURES IN THIS BUDGET THAN BEFORE, AND THAT
MANY OF THE MORE STRUCTURAL EFFORTS WILL HAVE A
BENEFICIAL LONG TERM EFFECT.

12.  THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT TRIES TO PRESENT ITSELF IN
ITS BEST POSSIBLE SHAPE BEFORE THE START OF EMU.  IT
WILL STILL NEED A POLITICAL DELIBERATION TO MAKE THE EMU
GRADE CONCERNING CUMULATIVE DEBT, BUT BY SHOWING
'SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS' IN THAT FIELD TOO (FROM 137 TO
127 PERCENT OF GDP), IT WILL AT LEAST HAVE CONFORMED TO
THE LANGUAGE (IF NOT THE SPIRIT) OF THE MAASTRICHT
TREATY.

NEW ZEALAND: TWO FERRIES PURCHASE UPDATE

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in WELLINGTON

It has been public knowledge for at least two years that Tranz
Rail (formerly known as New Zealand Rail) has been considering
upgrading two of its ferries servicing the Cook Strait between
New Zealand's North and South Islands.  The company has now
confirmed its intentions to replace two of its existing ferries
with two new ships by the year 2000.  Each new ferry will carry
between 750 and 1,000 people as well as cars and cargo.  The
ferries will be roll-on, roll-off in design.  Tranz Rail's ferry
upgrade is part of a pending NZ$485 million (US$330 million)
expenditure plan to take place over the next seven years.

It is an almost certainty that Tranz Rail will appoint a European
shipbuilder to this project.  Negotiations are currently taking
place with four European shipbuilders.  In a phone conversation
with the U.S. Commercial Service in Wellington, a spokesman for
the company explained that a number of U.S. shipbuilders were
approached for this project but not one was interested due to the
"roll-on, roll-off" requirement.  Further, "that any U.S.
companies specializing in maritime electronic systems would be
most likely working with those shipbuilders".

Further information on this major project should be directed to:

VIETNAM: DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR IMPORTED GOODS

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in HANOI

1.   UNLESS LICENSE TO DO SO BY THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND
INVESTMENT (MPI) UNDER THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT LEGISLATION (FIL),
FOREIGN COMPANIES ARE NOT PERMITTED TO DIRECTLY ENGAGE IN TRADE
IN VIETNAM, OTHER THAN THE DIRECT MARKETING OF GOODS THEY HAVE
MANUFACTURED IN VIETNAM.  ACCORDINGLY, A FOREIGN COMPANY THAT
WANTS TO SELL AND MARKET ITS GOODS IN VIETNAM MUST DO SO
INDIRECTLY BY APPOINTING A LOCAL AGENT OR DISTRIBUTOR TO
FACILITATE BOTH IMPORTATION INTO AND MARKETING WITHIN VIETNAM.

2.   CURRENT REGULATIONS ON SALES AGENTS DO NOT ADDRESS THE CASE
WHERE GOODS ARE FROM A FOREIGN SUPPLIER.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE
STATUS OF SUCH AN AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO UNCERTAIN RULES AND THE
CONTRACT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE.
THE MINISTRY OF TRADE HAS PROPOSED A DRAFT LAW THAT WOULD
REGULATE THOSE VIETNAMESE ENTITIES WHICH CAN ACT AS A SALES AGENT
OR DISTRIBUTOR FOR FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT WANT TO SELL THEIR
GOODS IN VIETNAM.

3.   THE MAIN RISK ARISING FROM THE GAP IN THE CURRENT
REGULATIONS IS THE RISK OF NON-PAYMENT. AS A SECURITY MEASURE TO
THE FOREIGN PRINCIPAL, SALES ARRANGEMENTS ARE OFTEN STRUCTURED AS
DISTRIBUTORSHIP AGREEMENTS, SINCE THE DISTRIBUTOR BUYS THE GOODS
DIRECTLY FROM THE FOREIGN PRINCIPAL.  IN THE CASE OF AN AGENCY
AGREEMENT, THE FOREIGN PRINCIPAL BEARS THE RISK SINCE THE AGENT
IS ONLY SELLING THE GOODS ON THE FOREIGN COMPANY'S BEHALF.
DISTRIBUTORSHIP AGREEMENTS ARE CONSIDERED AS "FOREIGN TRADE
CONTRACTS" AND SHOULD BE LODGED WITH THE MINISTRY OF TRADE.  IN
ANY CASE, THE EXPORTER SHOULD OBTAIN LEGAL ADVICE WHEN PREPARING
OR ENTERING INTO ANY SALES AGREEMENT WITH A VIETNAMESE
AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR.

4.   IMPORTING:  IN AN EFFORT TO CONTROL ITS LIMITED FOREIGN
EXCHANGE RESERVES, VIETNAM HAS STRINGENT CONTROLS ON THE IMPORTS
OF FINISHED GOODS.  ONE FORM OF CONTROL IS THE REQUIREMENT TO USE
AN IMPORT-EXPORT COMPANY AUTHORIZED BY THE MINISTRY OF TRADE.  IN
1995, ABOUT 1,250 COMPANIES HAVE TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TRADING
LICENSES TO IMPORT OR EXPORT DIRECTLY, OF WHICH ONLY NINE PERCENT
OF THE TOTAL NUMBER ARE PRIVATE FIRMS.   IN MOST CASES, THE
VIETNAMESE AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR WILL NEED TO PAY AN AUTHORIZED
TRADING COMPANY TO IMPORT THE GOODS.  THE AUTHORIZED TRADING
COMPANY WILL ADMINISTER THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING THE IMPORT
LICENSE AND CLEARING THE GOODS THROUGH CUSTOMS.   THE LICENSE IS
APPLIED FOR AFTER THE GOODS ARE SHIPPED, SOMETIMES AFTER THEY
ARRIVE IN VIETNAM.  IN EXCHANGE, THE VIETNAMESE AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR
WILL PAY A SERVICE COMMISSION, AVERAGING 2% TO 3% OF THE VALUE OF
THE SHIPMENT.   EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 1996, THE MINISTRY OF TRADE
REVOKED THE REQUIREMENT FOR EACH PARTICULAR SHIPMENT TO HAVE AN
IMPORT OR EXPORT LICENSE.  HENCE, A LICENSE MAY BE VALID FOR
SEVERAL SHIPMENTS. THE FIRMS CERTIFIED TO IMPORT AND EXPORT,
HOWEVER, ARE LIMITED TO THE RANGE OF COMMODITIES SPECIFIED BY THE
MINISTRY OF TRADE FOR EACH FIRM.  THEREFORE, THE VIETNAMESE
AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR MUST CONFIRM THAT THE IMPORT-EXPORT FIRM HAS
THE PROPER PERMITS TO COVER THE TYPE OF GOODS BEING IMPORTED.

5.   DISTRIBUTION:  ONCE THE GOODS HAVE CLEARED CUSTOMS,
VIETNAMESE COMPANIES WITH IMPORT-EXPORT PRIVILEGES, PRIMARILY
STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES,  MAY ALSO ACT SIMULTANEOUSLY AS
WHOLESALERS, AND IT MAY BE CONVENIENT FOR A U.S. EXPORTER TO SEEK
THESE TYPES OF FIRMS AS AGENTS/DISTRIBUTORS.   ALTERNATIVELY,
WITH THE OPENING OF THE ECONOMY, THE FLEDGING PRIVATE ENTERPRISES
HAVE REVITALIZED THE DISTRIBUTION SECTOR.  PRIVATE DISTRIBUTORS
GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE IMPORT RIGHTS AND MUST SECURE THE SERVICES
OF A LICENSED IMPORTER, ALTHOUGH THIS IS SLOWLY CHANGING.  IN
GENERAL, VIETNAMESE DISTRIBUTORS, WHETHER STATE-OWNED OR PRIVATE,
LACK CAPITAL AND EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE A BASIC RANGE
OF SERVICES:  PROPER WAREHOUSING, INVENTORY AND QUALITY CONTROL,
RELIABLE DELIVERY, MARKETING AND AFTER-SALES SERVICE.  PRIVATE
ENTERPRISES, HOWEVER, TEND TO BE MORE DEXTEROUS AND
BUSINESS-ORIENTED THAN THEIR STATE-RUN COUNTERPARTS.  GIVEN THE
GEOGRAPHIC CONFIGURATION AND POOR INFRASTRUCTURE OF VIETNAM
COUPLED WITH THE LIMITED CAPITALIZATION OF MOST LOCAL
DISTRIBUTORS,  U.S. EXPORTERS MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO HIRE
SEVERAL AGENTS/DISTRIBUTORS TO COVER DIFFERENT AREAS.

6.   MARKETING:   CONSIDERED AS PART OF TRADING SERVICES, FOREIGN
SUPPLIERS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO PROVIDE MARKETING AND SERVICES FOR
THEIR PRODUCTS IN VIETNAM.  GIVEN THAT LOCAL DISTRIBUTORS HAVE
LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN STANDARD TECHNIQUES, WITHOUT TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE U.S. EXPORTER, THESE
COMPANIES CANNOT BE RELIED UPON FOR A SUSTAINED MARKETING AND
SALES EFFORT.   MOREOVER, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR
AGENTS/DISTRIBUTORS TO CARRY COMPETING BRANDS.  THEREFORE, IN
ORDER TO OBTAIN EFFECTIVE MARKET REPRESENTATION FROM A VIETNAMESE
AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR, FOREIGN SUPPLIERS SHOULD BE PREPARED TO INVEST
IN TRAINING THEIR AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR EITHER BY SENDING TECHNICAL
EXPERTS TO VIETNAM OR SENDING THE AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR ABROAD FOR
TRAINING OR BOTH.  SECURING TRAVEL PASSPORTS AND TRAINING VISAS
FOR VIETNAMESE NATIONALS TO GO ABROAD MAY TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS TO
SECURE; HENCE, ADVANCE PLANNING IS REQUIRED.  CONSTANT CONTACT
WITH THE VIETNAMESE AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR IS ALSO NECESSARY.  A CLOSE
RELATIONSHIP ALLOWS THE FOREIGN SUPPLIER TO KEEP ABREAST OF THE
CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LOCAL MARKET.  CONTACT IS ALSO
NECESSARY TO KEEP THE VIETNAMESE AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR MOTIVATED TO
PUSH THE PRODUCT.

7.   REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE:  U.S. EXPORTERS MAY CHOOSE TO
ESTABLISH A PRESENCE IN VIETNAM IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL
OF INVOLVEMENT WITH THEIR AGENT/DISTRIBUTOR.  ISSUED BY THE
MINISTRY OF TRADE, A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE LICENSE ALLOWS A U.S.
EXPORTER TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING OF ITS
PRODUCT IN VIETNAM.   THIS MAY BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR
THOSE PRODUCTS THAT REQUIRE EXTENSIVE PROMOTION OR VALUE-ADDED
SERVICES.  THE REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE OF THE U.S. EXPORTER MAY
ALSO SUPERVISE SERVICE CENTERS AND SHOWROOMS.   TYPICALLY,
FOREIGN COMPANIES HIRE AND TRAIN LOCAL STAFF TO ACT AS MARKETING
REPRESENTATIVES, WHO THEN OVERSEE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING.  A
REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE, HOWEVER, IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED FROM
TRADING, RENDERING SERVICES, SUBLEASING ITS OFFICE, OR ANY OTHER
REVENUE-GENERATING ACTIVITIES.

8.   INTERNATIONAL TRADING COMPANIES:  GIVEN THE POTENTIAL HIGH
COST OF MAINTAINING A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE, U.S. EXPORTERS MAY
CHOOSE TO HAVE A DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH ONE OF THE
INTERNATIONAL TRADING COMPANIES PRESENT IN VIETNAM.  SOME
INTERNATIONAL TRADING FIRMS REPRESENTED IN VIETNAM INCLUDE
CONNELL BROS., DIETHELM, F.E. ZUELLIG, INCHCAPE AND GANNON.
CURRENTLY, INTERNATIONAL TRADING FIRMS ARE LIMITED TO
REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE STATUS; HENCE, THE SAME RESTRICTIONS IN THE
AREAS OF TRADING AND SERVICES APPLY.  HOWEVER, THESE
INTERNATIONAL TRADING COMPANIES HAVE EXPERIENCE IN HANDLING A
WIDE RANGE OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AS WELL AS INDUSTRIAL GOODS.
MOREOVER, THEY HAVE EXTENSIVE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE DUE TO THEIR
RELATIVELY LONG TERM PRESENCE IN VIETNAM.   BY WORKING CLOSELY
WITH KEY WHOLESALERS AND DEALERS, THESE FIRMS LIASE DIRECTLY WITH
THE FOREIGN PRINCIPAL TO COORDINATE MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION.

9.   FOREIGN INVESTMENT LICENSE:  IN THE LONG TERM, THE MOST
EFFECTIVE ROUTE FOR MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTING GOODS IN VIETNAM
IS TO INVEST UNDER THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT LAW.  THIS OPTION
USUALLY ENTAILS ESTABLISHING A MANUFACTURING OPERATION.  UNDER A
LICENSED FOREIGN INVESTMENT PROJECT, FOREIGN COMPANIES ARE
PERMITTED TO HANDLE THEIR OWN MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR
PRODUCTS MADE IN VIETNAM.  UNDER THIS FORM, A NUMBER OF FOREIGN
FIRMS HAVE RESORTED TO THE CHALLENGING AND COSTLY TASK OF
ESTABLISHING THEIR OWN NETWORK OF DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS TO
GAIN GREATER CONTROL ON THE HANDLING OF THEIR PRODUCTS.

10.  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATION:  IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE MYRIAD OF
PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM THE CURRENT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, U.S.
EXPORTERS ARE ADVISED TO CONDUCT EXHAUSTIVE DUE DILIGENCE ON
POTENTIAL LOCAL AGENTS/DISTRIBUTORS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE
RELEVANT PERMITS, FACILITIES, MANPOWER, CAPITAL AND OTHER
REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO MEET THEIR ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITIES.
COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS SHOULD CLEARLY DOCUMENT THE RIGHTS AD
OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY AS WELL AS STIPULATIONS FOR DISPUTE
RESOLUTION.

JAPAN: SANITATION MEASURES FOR IMPORTED OYSTERS

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in TOKYO

The following memo regarding sanitaion of imported oysters was
distributed to all qurantine stations in Japan by the Japanese
Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW).

MHW memo of September 30, 1996

To:       Managers of Quarantine Stations

From:     Director of Veterinary Sanitation Division
          Environmental Health Bureau
          Ministry of Health and Welfare

The importance of food sanitation control has been reconfirmed
since the eruption of nation wide food poisoning since May this
year.  In order to facilitate the safety of raw consumption
oysters, the following memo was distributed to Prefectural
Governments prior to the shipping season of Japanese oysters.
For imported oysters for raw consumption, your assistance in
guiding importers concerning hygienic handling is requested.  In
particular, importers should be requested that oysters imported
for cooked consumption must not be distributed for raw
consumption as indicated in this memo.

Regarding sanitation measures for raw consumption oysters

Purpose:  A number of food poisoning cases, including E. coli O-
157 contamination, has been reported since May, 1996.  Although
no raw consumption oysters have been identified as a carrier of
O-157, a guideline has been established to prevent food poisoning
from raw consumption oysters.  It is requested that Prefectural
and regional authorities of oyster production enhance their food
sanitation control.

Summary of sanitation measures:

I. Prefectural and regional authorities of raw consumption oyster
production should take the following sanitation measures.

1. Control of microorganisms in the oyster growing waters

1)  Periodical water quality testing should be conducted to
confirm the water quality standard:  below 70 MPN of total
coliform group per 100 ml of sea water.

2)  Periodical testing on vero-toxin producing E. coli. (VTEC)
with oyster meat should be conducted.  If test results read
positive on VTEC, shipment from the subject growing waters should
be prohibited.

2. Sanitation control of processing plants

In order to prevent secondary contamination, processing plants
must maintain thorough water sanitation control, health check of
employees, and clean handling of oysters.

3) Product inspection

Processors should maintain periodical product testing for the
oyster product standard (Bacteria:  50,000 counts or below per
one gram and E. Coli:  230 MPN per 100 grams) and VTEC prior to
shipment.

4) Hygienic handling

Processors should confirm the storage standard (storage
temperature of below ten degrees Celsius) and hygienic product
handling to prevent increase of microorganisms.

5) Batch control system

Processors and dealers should confirm the batch control system
with product labels, production management logs, etc. so the
original processors and growing waters can be identified with
already distributed products.

6) When VTEC is detected from oysters in distribution

If VTEC is detected from oysters in distribution, the subject lot
must be disposed, and shipment from the growing water must be
prohibited until the cause is identified and a prevention measure
is adapted.

7) Prevention of mixing with raw consumption oysters and cooked
consumption oysters

A thorough batch control system must be confirmed in order to
prevent distribution of cooked consumption oysters as raw
consumption oysters.

II. Sanitation measures for Prefectures which receive raw
consumption oysters

Prefectures which receive raw consumption oysters should adapt
the following sanitation measures.

1. Confirm sanitation control in distribution

Confirm the storage standard (storage temperature of below ten
degrees Celsius) and clean product handling to prevent increase
of microorganisms.

2. When VTEC is detected from oysters in distribution

1) If VTEC is detected from oysters in distribution, the
Prefectural authority must report the incident to the producing
Prefecture of the oyster and dispose the subject lot.

2) If VTEC is detected from imported oysters, the prefectural
authority must report to the Veterinary Sanitation Division of
the Ministry of Health and Welfare immediately.

FRANCE: EUROPEAN CHILDREN'S WEAR MARKET UPDATE

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in PARIS

A study has been published by the company  Management Horizons
Europe  on the European children s wear market.  This study took
into consideration the following factors:  demography, market
size, spendings, distribution networks, and consumers  taste. The
survey reported the following information:

Industry analysts predict that between 1995 and 2005, the
percentage of Europe s population represented by children aged
under 14 years will be as follows:

                    1995           2000           2005

Luxemburg           18.3%          20.9%          20.8%

United Kingdom      19.3%          19.9%          19.5%

Netherlands         18.4%          19.2%          20.0%

France              17.8%          19.2%          18.5%

Belgium             18.0%          18.2%          17.9%

Switzerland         17.8%          17.9%          17.5%

Spain               16.7%          15.3%          15.1%

Germany             16.3%          15.5%          14.4%

Italy               15.1%          14.1%          13.9%

The number of children aged 0 to 14 in Europe is expected to
increase by 1.3% through 2000. However, analysts predict a slight
decrease of 2.3 percent from 2000 to 2005.

The population of children aged 0 to 14 years is anticipated to
grow from 1995 to 2005 in the following countries:

- Netherlands (15.9%)
- Luxemburg (11.2%)
- United Kingdom (4.2%)
- Belgium (1.6%)

For the same period, the same population is expected to decrease
in the following European countries:

- Spain (10%)
- Italy (6.6%)
- Germany (9.4%)

According to market specialists, children aged 2-5 years is the
only share of the population which will certainly increase
between the years 2000 and 2005.

Between 1995 and 2005, the United Kingdom will certainly see an
increase in the number of children aged 6 to 9 years (11.9%), and
10 to 14 years (7.1%).

1995 sales of children s wear by distribution channel were as
follows:

France:
- Hyper/supermarkets:    31.0%
- Mail-order houses:     11.0%
- Specialty stores:      33.0%
- Department stores:      3.0%
- Popular stores:         3.0%
- Independent stores:    13.0%
- Others:                 6.0%

Germany:
- Hyper/supermarkets:     7.0%
- Mail-order houses:     11.5%
- Specialty stores:      30.5%
- Department stores:     12.4%
- Popular stores:
- Independent stores:    29.4%
- Others:                 9.2%

United Kingdom:
- Hyper/supermarkets:     5.0%
- Mail-order houses:      8.0%
- Specialty stores:      25.0%
- Department stores:      8.0%
- Popular stores:        25.0%
- Independent stores:    18.0%
- Others:                11.0%

Italy:
- Hyper/supermarkets:     4.8%
- Mail-order houses:      0.3%
- Specialty stores:      20.9%
- Department stores:     11.6%
- Popular stores:          -
- Independent stores:    53.7%
- Others:                 8.7%

Spain:
- Hyper/supermarkets:    15.8%
- Mail order houses:      0.4%
- Specialty stores:      20.9%
- Department stores:     11.6%
- Popular stores:
- Independent stores:    53.7%
- Others:                 8.7%

Considering the above, independent stores lead in terms of
children s wear sales only in Italy(53.7%) and Spain (49.8%).  In
the other European countries, specialty stores and
hyper/supermarkets are the two main distribution networks.
Specialty stores registered good sales, particularly in the
Netherlands (70%) and Belgium (55%), while sales in
hyper/supermarkets showed  good results in France (31%), followed
by Switzerland (19.1%), and Spain (15.8%).

The study reported that the media have a tremendous impact on
children, particularly in France and The United Kingdom.  Music
and television are influential at an early age, and are thus
excellent means for  promoting products which are specifically
directed towards children.

RAPID GROWTH IN VIETNAM'S COMPUTER SERVICES SECTOR

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in HANOI

1.   THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OVER 2,000 FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVE
OFFICES AND 1,400 FOREIGN JOINT-VENTURES/ 100 PERCENT
FOREIGN-OWNED BUSINESSES HAS SPURRED A GROWING DEMAND FOR
COMPUTER SERVICES IN VIETNAM. CURRENTLY, MANY OF THESE COMPUTER
SERVICE FIRMS ARE MOVING FROM SINGLE STATION PERSONAL COMPUTERS
(PC'S) TO LOCAL NETWORKING AND/OR WIDE AREA NETWORKS. THE TOTAL
NUMBER OF PC'S IN VIETNAM HAS GROWN FROM 40,000 IN 1994 TO OVER
100,000 THIS YEAR. WITH FEW LOCAL AND FOREIGN PROVIDERS OF
COMPUTER SERVICES, DEMAND IS OUTSTRIPPING SUPPLY.

2.   IN 1994, THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT DRAFTED ITS NATIONAL PLAN
ON INFORMATICS TECHNOLOGY (IT 2000 MASTERPLAN). IT 2000 DETAILS
THE COUNTRY'S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY,
DEFINES PRIORITY IT PROJECTS, SETS NATIONAL STANDARDS AND
OUTLINES POLICIES FOR MOBILIZING CAPITAL. OPEN SYSTEMS ARE NOW
THE ADOPTED STANDARD. SINCE THERE IS NO LEGACY SYSTEM OR STANDARD
IN VIETNAM, THE MARKET WANTS TO START WITH THE BEST AND MOST
RELIABLE PRODUCTS (MAINLY U.S. MADE).

3.   THE MARKET FOR COMPUTER SERVICES IS EXPECTED TO GROW RAPIDLY
WITH THE PLANNED COMPUTERIZATION OF STATE-OWNED BANKING, TELECOM,
ENERGY AND AVIATION INDUSTRIES. ASSISTING THE GOVERNMENT ARE THE
MULTILATERAL DONOR AGENCIES, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO EXTEND $200
MILLION IN CREDITS TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE PURCHASE OF COMPUTER
SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. AMERICAN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE
PERCEIVED TO BE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY WITH SUPERIOR AFTERSALES
SERVICE.

4.   SERVICES NOW IN GREATEST DEMAND INCLUDE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION,
IT TRAINING, NETWORK MANAGEMENT AND IT CONSULTING. DATA CENTER
DESIGN, COMPUTER DISASTER RECOVERY CENTERS AND OUT-SOURCING ARE
POSSIBILITIES FOR THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, DOMESTIC SOFTWARE
DEVELOPMENT WILL PLAY AN INCREASING ROLE IN VIETNAM'S IT
INDUSTRY. CURRENTLY, THERE IS A NEED FOR LEGITIMATE LOCALIZATION
OF MANY INTERNATIONAL SOFTWARE PROGRAMS.

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

THE AVERAGE VALUE OF VENEZUELA'S OIL EXPORT BASKET
HAS BEEN INCREASING STEADILY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF
1996.  HOWEVER, FOLLOWING U.S. MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ
IN SEPTEMBER 1996 WORLD OIL PRICES SHOT UP DRAMATICALLY,
AND VENEZUELA'S OIL BASKET CLOSED AT USDOLS 22.60 PER
BARREL ON OCTOBER 15, 1996.  THIS PRICE IS THE HIGHEST
SINCE 1990 WHEN IRAQ INVADED KUWAIT.  VENEZUELA HAS BEEN
EXCEEDING ITS 2.36 MILLION B/D OPEC PRODUCTION QUOTA.
MANY ANALYSTS BELIEVE VENEZUELA'S EXPORTS ARE CURRENTLY
AVERAGING 3.00 MILION B/D.  VENEZUELA'S OIL EXPORTS ARE
EXPECTED TO INCREASE EVEN FURTHER DURING THE NEXT
SEVERAL YEARS AS MARGINAL FIELDS CONTRACTS, STRATEGIC
ASSOCIATIONS AND EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION AGREEMENTS
WITH FOREIGN FIRMS ADD TO PDVSA'S OWN EXPANSION EFFORTS.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: FOREIGN TRADE - NON-OIL EXPORTS UP

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

NON-OIL EXPORTS INCREASED 32.3 PERCENT DURING
AUGUST 1996 TO USD 430 MILLION IN COMPARISON WITH THE
PREVIOUS MONTH.  THIS IS THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE INCREASE
WHICH MARKS AN END TO THE DOWNWARD TREND THAT BEGAN IN
MAY 1996.  HOWEVER, NON-OIL EXPORTS FOR THE PERIOD
JANUARY-AUGUST OF 1996 ARE STILL LOWER (14.7 PERCENT)
THAN THAT REGISTERED DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 1995.
LOWER NON-OIL EXPORTS DURING 1996 CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO
AN OVERVALUED BOLIVAR DURING FIRST QUARTER 1996.

BOLIVAR

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

THE BOLIVAR BEGAN TO APPRECIATE IN MID-SEPTEMBER
BECAUSE OF THE UNEXPECTED ENTRANCE OF FOREIGN CAPITAL
ATTRACTED BY INCREASED CONFIDENCE IN THE VENEZUELAN
ECONOMY.  THE BOLIVAR'S EXCHANGE RATE CLOSED AT BS.
473.00 PER DOLLAR AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER, REPRESENTING
AN APRECIATION OF 0.7 PERCENT COMPARED TO THE END OF THE
PREVIOUS MONTH.  THIS APPRECIATION CONTINUED INTO EARLY
OCTOBER, REACHING A PEAK OF BS. 465.25 PER DOLLAR ON
OCTOBER 2.  HOWEVER, THE AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE
FOR SEPTEMBER (BS. 475.84 PER DOLLAR) WAS 0.3 PERCENT
HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE PREVIOUS MONTH (BS. 474.60 PER
DOLLAR).

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: BRADY BOND TRANSACTIONS - CHANGE IN DOWNWARD
TREND

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

BRADY BOND TRADING INCREASED 31.3 PERCENT IN
SEPTEMBER, THE FIRST MONTHLY RISE SINCE THE LIFTING OF
EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND DEPRECIATION OF THE BOLIVAR IN
APRIL.  VENEZUELAN BRADY BOND PRICES HAVE BEEN
INCREASING BECAUSE OF THE GOV'S SUCCESSFUL
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGENDA VENEZUELA AND THE RESULTING
IMPROVEMENT IN VENEZUELA'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE.
WINDFALL OIL PROFITS, RISING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES
AND THE GOV'S ANNOUNCED INTENTION TO USE THESE RESERVES
TO REDUCE FOREIGN DEBT (PRIMARILY BRADY BONDS) HAVE ALSO
INCREASED INVESTOR'S EXPECTATIONS THAT THE BRADY BONDS
WILL BE REPAID.  THIS TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN
COMING MONTHS CONTRIBUTING TO AN INCREASE IN BOTH THE
VOLUME AND PRICE OF BRADY BOND TRADING.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE CAPITALIZATION INDEX -
RECORD HIGH

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

THE CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE CAPITALIZATION INDEX
CLOSED AT 5,481.90, INCREASING 19.1 PERCENT COMPARED TO
THE END OF THE PREVIOUS MONTH.  THE INDEX INCREASED TO
RECORD HIGHS IN ELEVEN STRAIGHT DAILY SESSIONS BEGINNING
SEPTEMBER 20.  KEY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE RECORD
HIGHS ARE LOW DOMESTIC INTEREST RATES AND POSITIVE
EXPECTATIONS OF THE GOV'S PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM WHICH
HAVE ENCOURAGED INVESTORS TO BUY STOCKS IN ANTICIPATION
OF RISING INVESTMENT IN THE CARACAS STOCK MARKET.
AVERAGE STOCK PRICES HAVE INCREASED MORE THAN THREE
TIMES SINCE SEPTEMBER 1995.  STOCK PRICES ARE EXPECTED
TO CONTINUE TO RISE, ALBEIT AT A SLOWER PACE, IN FUTURE
MONTHS AS THE ECONOMY BEGINS TO RECOVER FROM THE CURRENT
RECESSION.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: MONETARY STABILIZATION INSTRUMENTS - RATES
CONTINUE DOWN

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

DURING ITS WEEKLY AUCTIONS IN SEPTEMBER, THE CENTRAL
BANK PLACED BS. 188.8 BILLION (USD 249.7 MILLION) IN
180, 269, AND 358-DAY MONETARY STABILIZATION INSTRUMENTS
(TEMS), AT CLOSING NOMINAL INTEREST RATES OF 30.7, 31.8,
AND 33.0, RESPECTIVELY.  THE EFFECTIVE RATES ARE 29.3,
33.6, AND 35.5, RESPECTIVELY.  EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES
ON TEMS DECREASED FOLLOWING THE END OF EXCHANGE CONTROLS
IN APRIL 1996 UNTIL MID-AUGUST 1996 WHEN INTEREST RATES
BEGAN TO RISE.  EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES ON TEMS
DECREASED ONCE AGAIN FROM MID-SEPTEMBER UNTIL
MID-OCTOBER.  ACCORDING TO VENECONOMY (A PRIVATE
CONSULTING FIRM), THE CENTRAL BANK IS SEEKING A TEM
INTEREST RATE LEVEL WHICH IS LOW ENOUGH TO DISCOURAGE
HOT MONEY FROM COMING INTO THE COUNTRY AND HIGH ENOUGH
TO DISCOURAGE DOMESTIC INVESTORS FROM MOVING FUNDS OUT.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: MONEY SUPPLY/M2 - EXPANDS SLOWLY

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

THE MONEY SUPPLY HAS INCREASED 21.5 PERCENT SINCE
DECEMBER 1995.  THESE INCREASES ARE THE RESULT OF
WINDFALL OIL PROFITS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETELY
STERILIZED AND THE INFLUX OF DOLLLARS INTO THE CARACAS
STOCK EXCHANGE.  IN ADDITION, MOST CONSUMERS STILL
PREFER TO HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN CHECKING ACCOUNTS AND
SAVINGS DEPOSITS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES FOR
WHICH PRICES INCREASE RAPIDLY.  INCREASES IN THE MONEY
SUPPLY PUT ADDITIONAL DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON INTEREST
RATES THAT ARE ALREADY NEGATIVE IN REAL TERMS.  PLANS TO
CHANNEL ADDITIONAL OIL REVENUES TO EXTERNAL DEBT
PAYMENTS WILL HELP THE GOV MODERATE INCREASES IN THE
MONEY SUPPLY AND THE RATE OF INFLATION.

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

INTEREST RATES IN GENERAL INCREASED SLIGHTLY DURING
THE MONTH, ALTHOUGH THE MARGIN BETWEEN THE AVERAGE
LENDING RATE (34.68 PERCENT) AND THE AVERAGE CD RATE
(20.95 PERCENT) FOR COMMERCIAL BANKS DECREASED.
INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN DECREASING IN GENERAL TERMS
SINCE THE END OF APRIL.  EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: CONSUMER PRICE INDEX - STUBBORN, BUT ON THE
DECLINE

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR THE CARACAS METROPOLITAN
AREA INCREASED 3.6 PERCENT IN SEPTEMBER, WHICH IS LOWER
THAN THE INCREASE REGISTERED THE MONTH BEFORE (4.1
PERCENT).   THIS IS THE FOURTH CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY DECLINE
AND SUPPORTS THE GOV'S CLAIM THAT INFLATION IS ON A
DOWNWARD TREND TOWARDS A TARGET MONTHLY INFLATION RATE OF
1.5 TO 2 PERCENT.  THE INCREASE FROM SEPTEMBER 1995 TO
SEPTEMBER 1996 WAS 115.2 PERCENT, WHICH IS THE HIGHEST
ANNUAL INFLATION INCREASE EVER RECORDED FOR VENEZUELA.
THIS RECORD 12-MONTH ANNUAL INFLATION FIGURE IS EXPECTED
TO DECLINE DURING COMING MONTHS AS MONTHLY INFLATION
CONTINUES TO DECLINE.  INFLATIONARY EXPECTATIONS DECLINED
IN PART DUE TO POSITIVE MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS RELEASED
DURING SEPTEMBER.  AMONG THESE FAVORABLE INDICATORS ARE
WINDFALL OIL PROFITS, RECORD INTERNATIONAL RESERVES, A
RISING CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX, A SUCCESSFUL GOV BOND
ISSUE IN THE GERMAN FINANCIAL MARKET, AND THE APPRECIATION
OF THE BOLIVAR AGAINST THE DOLLAR.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: INT'L RESERVES - SURPASS 1996 GOALS

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

INTERNATIONAL RESERVES ROSE FOR THE FIFTH CONSECUTIVE
MONTH IN SEPTEMBER.  THIS MONTH THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY
DUE TO HIGHER OIL EARNINGS, STEMMING FROM IMPROVED PRICES
AND EXPORT VOLUME.  THE PLACEMENT OF THE GOV'S DEUTSH MARK
BOND ISSUE FOR AROUND USD 420 MILLION ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO
THIS INCREASE.  THE UNEXPECTED INCREASE IN RESERVES LED
THE GOV TO FOREGO THE SECOND USD 500 MILLION TRANCHE FROM
ITS IMF STAND-BY PROGRAM AND TO CONSIDER CANCELLING PLANS
FOR USD 450 MILLION IN IDB AND WORLD BANK LOANS TO FINANCE
FAST-DISBURSING SOCIAL SAFETY-NET PROGRAMS (USD 300
MILLION WITH THE IDB AND USD 150 MILLION WITH THE WORLD
BANK) DURING THE WEEK OF OCTOBER 7.

VENEZUELA-MACROECONOMICS: SUMMARY

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in CARACAS

MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS FOR SEPTEMBER PAINT A
POSITIVE PICTURE OF THE ECONOMY.  AMONG THESE FAVORABLE
INDICATORS ARE WINDFALL OIL PROFITS, RECORD INTERNATIONAL
RESERVES, A RISING CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX, A
SUCCESSFUL GOV BOND ISSUE IN THE GERMAN FINANCIAL MARKET,
AND A CONTINUING DECLINE IN THE INFLATION RATE.
VENEZUELA'S AVERAGE OIL EXPORT BASKET HAS INCREASED
STEADILY SINCE JANUARY, CLOSING AT USD 22.60 PER BARREL ON
OCTOBER 15, THE HIGHEST PRICE SINCE 1990.  AS A RESULT,
INTERNATIONAL RESERVES REACHED A NEW RECORD BY THE END OF
SEPTEMBER (USD 12,711 MILLION).  THE GOV HAS REITERATED
ITS PLANS TO USE EXCESS OIL PROFITS TO PAY DEBT, A
STRATEGY AIMED AT MANAGING THE ADDITIONAL OIL INCOME AND
AVOIDING THE MONETIZATION OF THE WINDFALL WHICH WOULD FUEL
INFLATION AND PLACE PRESSURE ON THE CURRENCY (THE
BOLIVAR).  RECORD HIGHS ON THE CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE
CAPITALIZATION INDEX WERE DUE TO LOW DOMESTIC INTEREST
RATES AND POSITIVE EXPECTATIONS OF THE GOV'S PRIVATIZATION
PROGRAM.  FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN LOCAL EQUITIES LED TO A
SLIGHT APPRECIATION OF THE BOLIVAR AGAINST THE DOLLAR.

VIETNAM ESTABLISHES 2ND NAT'L TELECOM COMPANY

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in HANOI

1.   IN JULY 1996, THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED THE SECOND
NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY BY FORMING THE SAIGON POSTAL
CORPORATION (FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE SAIGON POST AND
TELECOMMUNICATIONS JOINT-STOCK CORPORATION). THE SAIGON POSTAL
CORPORATION (SPC) WILL COMPETE WITH THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT
MONOPOLY, VIETNAM POST AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (VNPT).
THE COMPANY WAS ORGANIZED AS A JOINT-STOCK COMPANY WITH ELEVEN
SHAREHOLDERS, INCLUDING VNPT AND THE BEN THANH TOURIST SERVICE
COMPANY, EACH OWNING APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT. OTHER SHAREHOLDERS
INCLUDE THE MINISTRIES OF INTERIOR AND DEFENSE. THE COMPANY FALLS
UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE HO CHI MINH CITY PEOPLES COMMITTEE.
SPC IS ESTABLISHED AS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE ENTITY FROM THE
EXISTING HO CHI MINH CITY POSTS & TELECOM COMPANY.

2.   SPC, WHILE INITIALLY FOCUSING ON PROVIDING POST AND TELECOM
SERVICES TO THE SOUTHERN REGION, WILL BE INVOLVED EVENTUALLY IN
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IN
ORDER TO PROVIDE WIDER TELEPHONE ACCESS TO SOUTHERN PROVINCES,
SPC WILL EXPAND WIRELESS TELEPHONE SERVICES AND MOBILE PHONE
NETWORKS IN THE ECONOMICALLY KEY MEKONG DELTA PROVINCES, SUCH AS
TAY NINH, DONG NAI AND VUNG TAU.

3.   THE NEW CORPORATION WILL ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR UPGRADING
THE TELECOM NETWORKS WHICH CONNECT THE SOUTHERN SONG BE AND TAY
NINH PROVINCES TO QUANG NAM - DANANG PROVINCE, IN THE CENTRAL
REGION AND QUANG NINH PROVINCE IN THE NORTH.  SPC'S COMBINED
EXPANSION PLANS INCLUDE  INSTALLING 150,000 TO 200,00 FIXED
TELEPHONE LINES AND EXPANDING SATELLITE UPLINKS.

4.   ADDITIONAL SPC PLANS INCLUDE ESTABLISHING OF A FOREIGN
JOINT-VENTURE FACTORY TO PRODUCT TELEPHONY EQUIPMENT AND DEVELOP
A 100 - ACRE HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIAL PARK. THIS PARK WILL BE LOCATED
IN THE THU DUC AREA, NEAR HO CHI MINH CITY AND WILL TARGET
TELECOM, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER ELECTRONICS COMPANIES.

5.   A THIRD NATIONAL COMPETITOR MAY ENTER THE TELECOM SERVICES
SECTOR SOON. THE GOVERNMENT HAS APPROVED THE FORMATION OF THE
MILITARY ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY (VIETEL),
OWNED BY THE PEOPLES ARMY OF VIETNAM. GUIDELINES FOR VIETEL HAVE
YET TO BE ANNOUNCED, BUT EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE
IN FULL OPERATION BY LATE 1997. IT IS EXPECTED THAT VIETEL WILL
PROVIDE VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO THE EXISTING NATIONAL NETWORK,
POSSIBLY CONCENTRATING ON WIRELESS SYSTEMS ALONG THE DENSELY
POPULATED COAST.

6.    VIETEL FORMERLY KNOWN AS SIGELCO, IS ALREADY OPERATING AS A
MANUFACTURER, UNDER A LICENSE ISSUED IN NOVEMBER 1995. IT HAS
FORMED A FOREIGN  JOINT-VENTURE FACTORY TO PRODUCE TELEPHONE
EQUIPMENT AND ELECTRONICS FOR DOMESTIC SALE AND EXPORT. THE $20
MILLION PROJECT (VIETEL TECHNOLOGIES, LIMITED) WAS FUNDED BY
GOLDMAN SACHS (USA), NIKKO SECURITIES (JAPAN) AND A THAI
INVESTMENT GROUP. THE LOCAL PARTNERS CONSIST OF VIETEL AND THE
ARMY'S M1 COMMUNICATIONS FACTORY. THE JOINT-VENTURE  IS OWNED 70
PERCENT BY THE FOREIGN PARTNERS AND  30 PERCENT BY THE VIETNAMESE
ENTITIES.

VIETNAM ISSUES 1ST LICENSE FOR TRANSPORTATION & DELIVERY SERVICES TO
FOREIGN DISTRIBUTION FIRM

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in HANOI

1.   ON MARCH 12, 1996, THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT
OF VIETNAM (MPI)ISSUED THE FIRST LICENSE ALLOWING A FOREIGN
JOINT-VENTURE COMPANY TO TRANSPORT, DELIVER AND WAREHOUSE GOODS
IN VIETNAM TO TAIT (ASIA) LTD., A HONG KONG-BASED COMPANY AND ITS
LOCAL PARTNER, THIEN CANG COMPANY, LTD., A PRIVATE VIETNAMESE
FIRM. THE LICENSE PROVIDES FOR A CAPITAL INVESTMENT OF $2.5
MILLION, SPLIT 50/50 BETWEEN THE PARTNERS, AND ALLOWS THE VENTURE
TO OPERATE FOR TEN YEARS. PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THIS LICENSE,
ONLY FOREIGN COMPANIES WITH MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN VIETNAM
WERE ALLOWED TO TRANSPORT, DELIVER AND MARKET PRODUCTS THAT THEY
MANUFACTURED THEMSELVES. FOREIGN FIRMS ARE STILL PROHIBITED FROM
DISTRIBUTING THEIR PRODUCTS IN-COUNTRY.

2.   THE INABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE THEIR OWN PRODUCTS IN THE
VIETNAMESE MARKET HAS FRUSTRATED FOREIGN BUSINESSES. THE
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IN VIETNAM CONSISTS OF A FRAGMENTED,
DISORGANIZED NETWORK OF STATE-OWNED AND PRIVATE IMPORT-EXPORT
COMPANIES, STATE-OWNED AND PRIVATE WHOLESALERS, INDEPENDENT
AGENTS/DISTRIBUTORS, AND RETAIL OUTLETS LIMITED TO SMALL
FAMILY-RUN AND STATE-OWNED STORES.  UNTIL MARCH 12, FOREIGN FIRMS
WERE NOT PERMITTED TO MANAGE AND CONTROL DISTRIBUTION, THAT IS,
TRANSPORTATION, DELIVERY, WAREHOUSING, INVOICING AND MARKETING.

3.   UNDER VIETNAMESE LAW, THE IMPORTER ACTS AS THE CONSIGNEE AND
HOLDS TITLE TO THE IMPORTED GOODS.  THE TRADE MINISTRY MUST ISSUE
AN IMPORT LICENSE FOR EACH SHIPMENT, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO QUOTA
RESTRICTIONS FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES. AS A MATTER OF POLICY,
FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN PROJECTS SOLELY FOR TRADING AND
DISTRIBUTION IS NOT ENCOURAGED, AS THESE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES
ARE RESERVED FOR LOCAL COMPANIES.

4.   MANY FOREIGN DISTRIBUTORS HOPE THAT THE TAIT LICENSE IS A
STEP IN THE DIRECTION OF CREATING A LESS RESTRICTIVE TRADING
REGIME IN VIETNAM. THE LICENSE PERMITS THE JOINT-VENTURE TO LEASE
WAREHOUSE SPACE, PURCHASE AND OPERATE DELIVERY VEHICLES, DELIVER
MERCHANDISE AND PROVIDE MARKETING CONSULTANCY SERVICES.
UNFORTUNATELY,  THE LICENSE DOES NOT ALLOW THE JOINT-VENTURE TO
OWN THE GOODS BEING DELIVERED. ANY GOODS IMPORTED MUST BE
CONSIGNED TO A LEGALLY AUTHORIZED VIETNAMESE PARTY OUTSIDE OF THE
JOINT-VENTURE. IN ADDITION, THE JOINT-VENTURE DOES NOT HAVE THE
RIGHT TO COLLECT THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE.  MPI IS STILL
CONSIDERING WHETHER TO ALLOW THE JOINT-VENTURE TO INVOICE
DIRECTLY AND COLLECT REVENUES. IF THIS OCCURS, THEN THE LICENSE
WILL MORE CLOSELY REPRESENT A TRUE COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
LICENSE.

5.   WHILE INDUSTRY EXPERTS ARE CAUTIOUS IN DRAWING ANY
CONCLUSION THAT THIS IS A IRREVOCABLE COMMITMENT TO THE
INDUSTRY'S IMMINENT FURTHER DEREGULATION, IT IS NONETHELESS A
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND GIVES FOREIGN DISTRIBUTION
COMPANIES HOPE FOR IMPROVED ACCESS TO THE VIETNAMESE MARKET.

GUATEMALA PASSES ELECTRICITY LAW

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in GUATEMALA CITY

1.  SUMMARY: THE GUATEMALAN CONGRESS ON OCTOBER 16 PASSED
LANDMARK LEGISLATION TO RESTRUCTURE THE ELECTRICITY MARKET.
THIS KEY LAW OPENS AND DEMONOPOLIZES THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR TO
MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE TO THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT THAT IS CRITICAL
TO MEETING PRESENT AND FUTURE ELECTRICITY GENERATION NEEDS IN
THE COUNTRY.  THE LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR THE AUTONOMOUS
RATE-SETTING ENTITY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTED, DUE TO ITS
INABILITY TO SECURE A TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY IN THE CONGRESS TO
CREATE THE INDEPENDENT ENTITY.  NONETHELESS, THE LOCAL IDB
REPRESENTATIVE BELIEVES THE LEGISLATION, AS PASSED, WILL
SATISFY THE RELEVANT CONDITION IN THE IDB INVESTMENT SECTOR
LOAN NOW BEING NEGOTIATED.  HOWEVER, FAILURE TO GAIN A LARGER
MAJORITY ON THIS BILL DOES NOT BODE WELL FOR THE CREATION OF
OTHER NEW GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.  END SUMMARY

2.  FOLLOWING SEVERAL MONTHS OF DEBATE AND THE INCORPORATION OF
KEY AMENDMENTS, THE GUATEMALAN CONGRESS ON OCTOBER 16 PASSED
ITS ELECTRICITY SECTOR MODERNIZATION AND DEMONOPOLIZATION LAW
BY A 49-23 MARGIN.  THE LAW IS BASED ON THE DRAFT LEGISLATION
DEVELOPED SEVERAL YEARS AGO THROUGH A USAID-FUNDED GRANT.  THE
PAN MAJORITY WAS JOINED BY SEVEN MEMBERS OF MINORITY PARTIES,
WHILE THE FRG AND FDNG PARTIES VOTED AS A BLOC IN OPPOSITION TO
THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL.

3.  THE NEW LAW WILL "DEMONOPOLIZE" THE POWER SECTOR AND
INCORPORATE MOST OF THE FEATURES OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ORIGINAL
PROPOSAL, I.E., UNBUNDLING OF PRODUCTION, TRANSMISSION, AND
DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITIES; LIBERALIZED ENTRY TO THE POWER
INDUSTRY; AND UNRESTRICTED ACCESS TO THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM BY
PRODUCERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND WHOLESALE CONSUMERS.  THE NOTABLE
SHORTCOMING OF THE LAW IS THAT THE RATE-SETTING COMMISSION WILL
BE SUBORDINATE TO THE MINISTRY OF ENERGY AND MINES, RATHER THAN
AUTONOMOUS, AS INITIALLY PROPOSED.  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE
AUTONOMOUS ENTITY REQUIRED A 2/3 MAJORITY IN THE CONGRESS,
WHICH THE PAN MAJORITY WAS NOT ABLE TO MUSTER, AFTER A NUMBER
OF ATTEMPTS.

4.  AS ORIGINALLY DRAFTED BY A USAID CONTRACTOR AND APPROVED BY
THE ENERGY COMMITTEE OF THE GUATEMALAN CONGRESS WITH THE STRONG
SUPPORT OF THE ENERGY MINISTER, THE RATE-SETTING COMMISSION WAS
TO BE AN AUTONOMOUS ENTITY WITH THE AUTHORITY TO SET TARIFFS
SUFFICIENT TO PERMIT PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS TO BOTH RECOVER
COSTS AND PROVIDE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO EXPAND THE PRODUCTION
AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS.  UNDER THE APPROVED LEGISLATION THE
COMMISSION WILL FUNCTION AS INDICATED ABOVE, BUT UNDER THE
AUTHORITY OF THE MINISTER OF ENERGY AND MINES.  IT IS OUR
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE GOVERNEMENT WILL ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO
OPERATE WITHOUT THE INTERFERENCE OF THE MINISTER AND WILL SEEK
TO CHANGE THE STATUS OF THE COMMISSION AT A LATER DATE.  THE
STATE-OWNED POWER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES ARE NOW
LOSING AS MUCH AS USD 140 MILLION PER YEAR AND ONLY ABOUT 30
PERCENT OF GUATEMALAN HOUSEHOLDS HAVE ACCESS TO ELECTRICITY
SERVICE.  THOUGH GUATEMALA'S STATE-OWNED ELECTRICITY PRODUCING
AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES ON OCTOBER 15 INDEPENDENTLY
INTRODUCED RATE INCREASES OF AS MUCH AS 50 PERCENT, A
GUATEMALAN COURT, ONCE AGAIN, HAS ISSUED A PROVISIONAL
INJUNCTION SUSPENDING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW RATES.

5.  COMMENT: PASSAGE OF THIS LEGISLATION, WITH OR WITHOUT THE
INDEPENDENT RATE SETTING ENTITY, IS A KEY STEP IN ATTRACTING
THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT CAPITAL THAT IS CRITICAL TO MEETING THE
PRESENT AND FUTURE ENERGY NEEDS OF GUATEMALA.  THE FAILURE OF
THE PAN TO MARSHAL THE 54 VOTES NEEDED TO SET UP AN INDEPENDENT
REGULATORY ENTITY HAD MUCH LESS TO DO WITH COMPETING VISIONS OF
THE FUTURE OF GUATEMALA'S ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY THAN WITH THE
EXERCISE OF POLITICAL POWER.  THE FRG, WHICH HAS 20 VOTES IN
THE CONGRESS, HAS LONG SUPPORTED REFORM OF THE ELECTRICITY
SECTOR AND HAD GIVEN WRITTEN ASSURANCES IT WOULD SUPPORT THE
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION.  NEVERTHELESS, THE VIGOROUS DEBATE OF
THIS ISSUE -- LITERALLY REACHING THE POINT OF PHYSICAL BLOWS --
IS A REMINDER TO THE PAN MAJORITY THAT THE POWER TO OBSTRUCT IS
POWER NONETHELESS, A POINT THAT WILL NO DOUBT BE RAISED WHEN
THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO ENACT OTHER ELEMENTS OF ITS PLAN TO
MODERNIZE THE STATE.  END COMMENT.

TURKEY PUTS FORWARD A "BALANCED BUDGET" FOR 1997

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in ANKARA

1.  SUMMARY:  THE GOT LAST WEEK SUBMITTED ITS
FIRST-EVER BALANCED BUDGET TO PARLIAMENT.  PM
ERBAKAN CALLED THE 1997 BUDGET "REVOLUTIONARY,"
ALTHOUGH NEARLY ALL OTHER OBSERVERS TERMED IT
UNREALISTIC.  TO ERASE THE BUDGET DEFICIT -- WHICH
IS LIKELY TO REACH 10 PCT OF GNP THIS YEAR -- THE
GOT HAS PROJECTED A REAL REDUCTION IN INTEREST
EXPENSES IN 1997, A REAL INCREASE IN TAX REVENUES,
AND PINNED MOST OF ITS HOPES ON AN EXPLOSION IN
PRIVATIZATION RECEIPTS.  THE GOT ESTIMATES GROWTH
WILL SLOW TO 4 PCT IN 1997, AND IS PROJECTING A
MODEST DROP IN INFLATION TO 65 PCT. END SUMMARY.

-------------------------------------------------
REPUBLIC'S FIRST BALANCED BUDGET RAISES QUESTIONS
-------------------------------------------------

2.  ON OCTOBER 18 THE GOT SUBMITTED TO PARLIAMENT
ITS DRAFT BUDGET FOR 1997.  THE 1997 BUDGET, THE
FIRST PREPARED BY THE COALITION HEADED BY THE
ISLAMIST REFAH PARTY, IS THE FIRST BALANCED BUDGET
IN THE TURKISH REPUBLIC'S HISTORY.  PM ERBAKAN
CALLED THE BUDGET "REVOLUTIONARY," WHILE HIS
JUNIOR COALITION PARTNER, TANSU CILLER, CLAIMED
THAT THE BUDGET WAS BASED ON FACTS, NOT FICTION.
NEARLY ALL OBSERVERS OUTSIDE THE COALITION
GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, HAVE DISMISSED THE 1997 DRAFT
AS UNREALISTIC.  THE BUDGET DEFICIT THIS YEAR --
BLOATED BY ELECTION SPENDING AND ERBAKAN'S
POPULIST ECONOMIC MEASURES -- IS LIKELY TO REACH
10 PCT OF GNP.  EVEN UNDER CILLER'S 1994 AUSTERITY
PROGRAM, THE GOT WAS UNABLE TO BRING THE DEFICIT
BELOW 3.5 PCT OF GNP.

3.  THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ELEMENT OF THE 1997
BUDGET IS A PLANNED SURGE IN NON-TAX REVENUE,
PRIMARILY RECEIPTS FROM PRIVATIZATION.  NON-TAX
REVENUES ARE EXPECTED TO SOAR BY 765 PCT IN
NOMINAL TERMS, VERSUS A PLANNED 65 PCT INFLATION
RATE.  NEARLY ALL OF THIS REFLECTS THE GOT'S
ESTIMATE OF 8.7 BILLION USD FROM SALE OF STATE
ASSETS NEXT YEAR.  THIS INCLUDES PRIVATIZATION OF
STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES AS WELL AS SALE OF STATE
LAND, HOUSING AND SOCIAL FACILITIES.  THIS
ESTIMATE IS NEARLY THREE TIMES THE TOTAL AMOUNT
THE GOT HAS RAISED FROM PRIVATIZATION OVER THE
LAST 10 YEARS; IN THE FIRST 9 MONTHS OF 1996 THESE
RECEIPTS TOTALLED ONLY 300 MILLION USD.

4.  ON THE EXPENSE SIDE, INTEREST WILL CONTINUE TO
ACCOUNT FOR THE LION'S SHARE, REPRESENTING 30
PERCENT OF THE TOTAL BUDGET IN 1997.  HOWEVER,
THE NOMINAL INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSES IS ONLY
24 PCT OVER 1996, VERSUS 65 PCT EXPECTED
INFLATION.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE GOT IS PROJECTING
A SIGNIFICANT REAL DROP IN INTEREST PAYMENTS NEXT
YEAR.

5.  THE BUDGET ALSO RELIES ON A NOMINAL INCREASE
IN TAX REVENUES OF 99 PCT NEXT YEAR.  PM ERBAKAN
HAS ANNOUNCED THAT REFORMS IN TAX ADMINISTRATION,
TO BE UNVEILED LATER THIS YEAR, WILL HAVE AN
IMMEDIATE IMPACT BY BROADENING THE TAX BASE AND
INCREASING COMPLIANCE; NO NEW TAXES ARE EXPECTED.
OBSERVERS REMAIN HIGHLY SCEPTICAL, HOWEVER, BOTH
OF THE GOT'S ABILITY TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THE
LONG-POSTPONED TAX REFORM PROGRAM, AND THE SPEED
WITH WHICH RESULTS WILL BE VISIBLE.  PREVIOUSLY
THE GOT HAS ALWAYS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT CHANGES IN
THE TAX ADMINISTRATIONS SYSTEM WILL TAKE 3-5 YEARS
TO HAVE AN IMPACT.

-----------
THE NUMBERS
-----------

6.  THE BUDGET DRAFT SETS REVENUES AND
EXPENDITURES FOR NEXT YEAR AT 47 BILLION USD
(BASED ON THE PROJECTED AVERAGE DOLLAR EXCHANGE
RATE FOR 1997 OF 135,000).  INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE
EXPECTED TO TAKE 30 PCT OF TOTAL EXPENDITURES,
WITH PERSONNEL PAYMENTS ABSORBING 27 PCT.  PM
ERBAKAN HAS PLEDGED TO INCREASE CIVIL SERVANT
SALARIES IN LINE WITH INFLATION; THE FINANCE
MINISTER HAS ALREADY ANNOUNCED A 30 PCT INCREASE
FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 1997.  HOWEVER, SOME EARLY
CALCULATIONS INDICATE THAT THE 1997 BUDGET'S
ALLOCATION FOR PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO
INCREASE SALARIES BY AS MUCH AS THE PROJECTED
INFLATION INCREASE.

7.  THE DRAFT BUDGET FORESEES A LARGE INCREASE IN
PUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENTS, JUMPING 131 PCT IN
NOMINAL TERMS.  TRANSFERS TO SOCIAL SECURITY
ORGANIZATIONS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE ESTIMATED TO
RISE BY 54 PCT, OR BELOW THE PROJECTED RATE OF
INFLATION.

8.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE COMPARES THE 1997 BUDGET

MACROECONOMIC TARGETS USED IN CALCULATING THE 1997
BUDGET:  REAL GNP GROWTH WILL BE 4 PCT AND
INFLATION 65 PCT; THE AVERAGE USD EXCHANGE RATE
TARGET IS 135,000 TL; EXPORTS AND IMPORTS ARE
PROJECTED TO REACH TO 29.5 AND 50 BILLION USD
RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING A TRADE DEFICIT OF 20.5
BILLION USD; THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT IS
ESTIMATED AS 5.6 BILLION USD.

----------------------
COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET
----------------------

10.  REACTION TO THE 1997 BUDGET PROPOSALS HAS
BEEN UNIFORMLY NEGATIVE.  OPPOSITION PARTIES
SEVERELY CRITICIZED THE BUDGET; AN ANAP DEPUTY
CALLED IT "SHEER NONSENSE".  CHP'S VICE CHAIRMAN
SAID THAT CLAIMING THAT THE 1997 BUDGET WILL BE
BALANCED, THE GOVERNMENT WAS FOOLING NOT ONLY THE
PEOPLE BUT ALSO ITSELF.  RAHMI KOC, ONE OF
TURKEY'S MOST PROMINENT BUSINESSMEN, TOLD
REPORTERS THAT HE FOUND THE BUDGET TOTALLY
UNREALISTIC.  MOST ACADEMICIANS AND COLUMNISTS
ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE BUDGET'S
CREDIBILITY.  MANY PAPERS ALSO NOTED THAT THE
RELEASE OF THE BUDGET COINCIDED WITH THE VISIT OF
AN IMF DELEGATION TO ANKARA, AND CITED UNSOURCED
CLAIMS THAT THE IMF TEAM FOUND THE BUDGET "OVERLY
OPTIMISTIC."

11.  SEPTELS WILL PROVIDE FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE
1997 BUDGET, INCLUDING DISCUSSIONS WHICH TOOK
PLACE LAST WEEK DURING THE MEETING OF THE JOINT
ECONOMIC COMMISSION.

HUNGARY: PERSONAL FOREX SAVINGS FALL IN NINE MONTHS

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

THE REAL VALUE OF PERSONAL SAVINGS HELD IN FOREIGN
CURRENCY ACCOUNTS FELL BY HUF 18 BILLION IN THE FIRST NINE
MONTHS OF THIS YEAR.  NATIONAL BANK OF HUNGARY FIGURES
SHOW THAT THE FORINT VALUE OF PERSONAL FOREX SAVINGS
INCREASED BY HUF 32 BILLION IN THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD.
HOWEVER, DEVALUATION ALONE WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE FORINT
VALUE OF THE AMOUNT HELD IN FOREX ACCOUNTS AT THE START OF
THE YEAR BY HUF 50 BILLION.  FOREX SAVINGS INCREASED BY
HUF 1.5 BILLION IN FORINT TERMS IN SEPTEMBER BUT THE 1.2
PERCENT RATE OF THE CRAWLING PEG DEVALUATION ALONE WOULD
HAVE CAUSED A HUF 5.5 BILLION INCREASE LAST MONTH.
PERSONAL SAVINGS HELD IN FOREX ACCOUNTS TOTALLED HUF 471
BILLION AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER.  MORE THAN 30 BANKS OFFER
PERSONAL FOREX ACCOUNTS BUT MORE THAN HALF OF ALL FOREX
SAVINGS ARE HELD AT OTP.  HALF OF ALL FOREX SAVINGS ARE IN
DEUTCH MARKS, 20 PERCENT IN U.S.DOLLARS AND 12 PERCENT IN
AUSTRIAN SHILLINGS.  FINANCIAL ANALYSTS BELIEVE THAT FOREX
SAVINGS HAVE LOST THEIR APPEAL BECAUSE OF HIGHER YIELDS ON
FORINT SAVINGS AND THE PREDICTABLE RATE OF DEVALUATION BY
THE CRAWLING PEG MECHANISM.

HUNGARY: DEVALUATION EXHAUSTS ITS EXPORT-PROMOTING EFFECT

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

ACCORDING TO THE LATEST ANALYSIS OF THE ECONOMIC
RESEARCH INSTITUTE (GKI), THE FORINT DEVALUATION LOST ITS
EXPORT-STIMULATING EFFECT AROUND THE MIDDLE OF THIS YEAR.
FOREIGN TRADE FIGURES SHOW ADVERSE TRENDS FROM THE SECOND
THIRD OF 1996, COMPARED TO EARLIER EXPECTATIONS.  EXPORTS
GREW BY 5.2 PERCENT, CALCULATED IN DOLLARS AND BY 8.9
PERCENT IN VOLUME DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS, COMPARED TO
THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THESE FIGURES ARE DOWN FROM
THE FIRST QUARTER.

THE FORMERLY STRONG ACTIVITY IN EXPORTS MOTIVATED BY
EXTERNAL PRICES IN FORINT TERMS WEAKENED IN 1996.  THIS
WAS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACT THAT COMPANIES COULD
REALIZE A HIGHER INCREASE IN DOMESTIC SALES PRICES THAN IN
EXPORT PRICES DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE RATE OF THE
CRAWLING-PEG DEVALUATION.  THE RISING IMPORT PRICES DUE TO
THE IMPORT DUTY SURCHARGE ALSO ASSISTED DOMESTIC
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES TO RAISE DOMESTIC PRICES ABOVE
EXPORT PRICES.  BY THE MIDDLE OF 1996, IN MOST INDUSTRIAL
SECTORS, THE PRICE ADVANTAGE OF EXPORTING CEASED TO EXIST.

GKI FORECASTS THAT THE VOLUME OF EXPORTS WILL GROW BY
6-7 PERCENT, WHILE IMPORTS WILL BE UP 3-4 PERCENT IN 1996.
THE MONTHLY ONE PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE DUTY SURCHARGE,
WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO BE ABOLISHED BY JULY 1997, COULD
CAUSE A 10 PERCENT DECREASE IN THE COST OF IMPORTED GOODS,
THUS BOOSTING IMPORTS STRONGLY.  GKI EXPERTS DO NOT THINK
THAT THE IMPORT INCREASE COULD BE OFFSET BY A RISE IN THE
COMPETITIVENESS OF EXPORTS NEXT YEAR.

HUNGARY: GOVERNMENT PUBLISHES THREE-YEAR FORECAST

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

UNDER THE LAW ON PUBLIC FINANCES, THE GOVERNMENT IS
COMMITTED TO PRESENT A THREE-YEAR OUTLOOK OF MAJOR
ECONOMIC INDICATORS ACCOMPANYING THE ANNUAL BUDGET BILL.
ACCORDING TO THIS THREE-YEAR FORECAST, THE GOVERNMENT
EXPECTS A HUF 40 BILLION COMBINED DEFICIT IN THE TWO
SOCIAL SECURITY FUNDS IN 1998 AND A HUF 28 BILLION DEFICIT
IN 1999 FOLLOWING A BALANCED BUDGET IN BOTH FUNDS IN 1997.
THE GFS GENERAL GOVERNMENT DEFICIT INCLUDING PRIVATIZATION
REVENUES IS FORECAST AT HUF 315.2 BILLION NEXT YEAR, 376.3
BILLION IN 1998 AND HUF 330.9 BILLION IN 1999.  THE GFS
DEFICIT IN PUBLIC FINANCES EXCLUDING INCOME FROM
PRIVATIZATION IS FORECAST AT 4.9 PERCENT OF GDP IN 1997,
4.3 PERCENT IN 1998, AND 3.3 PERCENT IN 1999.  THE
FORECAST PROJECTS 2 PERCENT GDP GROWTH NEXT YEAR, 3-4
PERCENT GROWTH IN 1998 AND 4-5 PERCENT GROWTH IN 1999.
THE GOVERNMENT EXPECTS INFLATION OF 17-19 PERCENT NEXT
YEAR, 12-14 PERCENT IN 1998 AND 10 PERCENT IN 1999 WHILE
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCER PRICES ARE EXPECTED TO RISE 1-3
PERCENT POINTS SLOWER THAN CONSUMER PRICES.  THE FORECAST
PROJECTS AN 8-10 PERCENT INCREASE IN EXPORTS NEXT YEAR
FOLLOWED BY A 5-7 PERCENT INCREASE IN 1998 AND A 7-9
PERCENT INCREASE IN 1999.

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

THE OUTPUT OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN AUGUST WAS
UNCHANGED FROM JULY AND WAS THREE PERCENT DOWN, IN VOLUME
TERMS, ON AUGUST 1995.  THE VOLUME OF NEW CONSTRUCTION
ORDERS IN AUGUST WAS 18.5 PERCENT LOWER THAN IN THE SAME

BOOKS WERE THE EQUIVALENT OF 4-5 MONTHS OUTPUT AT THE END
OF AUGUST.  WORK STARTED ON 185 CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS WITH
A TOTAL BUDGET OF HUF 17 BILLION (CURRENT HUF/DOLLAR
EXCHANGE IS APPROXIMATELY 155 HUF/1 USD) IN AUGUST AND 141
PROJECTS WORTH HUF 7 BILLION WERE FINISHED.  THE VALUE OF
PROJECTS STARTED WAS 35 PERCENT HIGHER THAN IN AUGUST 1995
WHILE THE VALUE OF COMPLETED PROJECTS WAS 25 PERCENT
LOWER.

HUNGARY: PRIVATE RESEARCH INSTITUTE FORECASTS 2.5% GDP GROWTH IN 1997

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

(GKI) THE PRIVATE ECONOMIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE
FORECASTS A 2.5 PERCENT INCREASE IN GDP, A 5-6 PERCENT
RISE IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND A 10 PERCENT INCREASE IN
INVESTMENTS FOR 1997.  GKI PROJECTS ANNUAL AVERAGE
CONSUMER PRICE INFLATION OF 20 PERCENT FOR NEXT YEAR, AN
AVERAGE OF TWO DIFFERENT ESTIMATIONS.  ASSUMING AN ANNUAL
25 PERCENT INCREASE IN ENERGY PRICES, THE INFLATION RATE
COULD BE 19 PERCENT OR ASSUMING AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF 40
PERCENT INCREASE IN ENERGY PRICES, THE INFLATION RATE
COULD BE 21 PERCENT.  SIGNIFICANT FACTORS, SUCH AS THE
ABOLITION OF THE 6 PERCENT IMPORT SURCHARGE IN THE FIRST
HALF OF 1997 AND TARIFF REDUCTIONS WILL REDUCE IMPORT
COSTS NEXT YEAR.  THE REDUCTION IN IMPORT COSTS COULD
RESULT IN AN IMPORT GROWTH RATE EXCEEDING THAT OF EXPORTS.
GKI FORECASTS AN EIGHT PERCENT IMPORT INCREASE AND A 6
PERCENT EXPORT INCREASE FOR 1997, RESULTING IN A USD 200-
300M RISE IN TRADE DEFICIT OVER THE YEAR.  GKI FORECASTS A
USD 2.5 BILLION TRADE DEFICIT OF USD 1.8-2 BILLION, WHICH
IS STILL SLIGHTLY BELOW THE VALUE OF EXPECTED DIRECT
FOREIGN CASH INVESTMENTS.

THE 10 PERCENT INCREASE IN INVESTMENT SHOULD BE
FUELLED BY IMPROVING THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR PRODUCERS
SUPPLYING THE DOMESTIC MARKET.  LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE
CENTRAL BUDGET ARE ALSO PLANNING TO INCREASE INVESTMENT
SPENDING.  ESTIMATIONS BASED ON TAX AMENDMENT PROPOSALS
FOR NEXT YEAR SHOW A 20 PERCENT INCREASE IN BOTH GROSS AND
NET WAGES, RESULTING IN NO FURTHER FALL IN REAL WAGES.
PERSONAL CONSUMPTION, HOWEVER, IS EXPECTED TO RISE BY 1
PERCENT, DUE TO DELAYED PURCHASES FROM PRECEDING YEARS.
HENCE THE GROWTH RATE OF PERSONAL SAVINGS IS EXPECTED TO
FALL SLIGHTLY.  DOMESTIC DEMAND IN VOLUME TERMS, IS
PROJECTED TO RISE TO 3 PERCENT AS A RESULT OF INVESTMENTS
AND CONSUMPTION.  GKI FORECASTS A CONSOLIDATED GENERAL
GOVERNMENT DEFICIT IN THE RANGE OF 4.5-5 PERCENT OF NEXT
YEAR'S GDP, SIMILAR TO THAT OF 1996.  (NOTE: REFTEL
EXPLAINS THE NEW ACCOUNTING MEASURE TO BE USED BY THE GOH
BEGINNING IN 1997.  WITHOUT THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING
METHODS, THE 1997 CONSOLIDATED BUDGET WOULD BE THREE
PERCENT OF GDP.  END NOTE.)  PROVIDED FINANCING
REQUIREMENTS OF THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT WILL NOT EXCEED
THIS LIMIT, NOMINAL INTEREST COULD FALL FROM 22 PERCENT AT
THE BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR TO 19 PERCENT AT THE END.  GKI
WARNS THAT POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS EXPECTED FOR NEXT YEAR
ARE CONSIDERABLY THREATENED.  A POSSIBLE RISE IN DOMESTIC
DEMAND COULD GENERATE A HIGHER THAN EXPECTED IMPORT
INCREASE RATHER THAN BOOSTING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION.  IN
ADDITION, THE PLANNED RESTRUCTURING OF TAXES AND SOCIAL
SECURITY CONTRIBUTIONS MAY NOT PRODUCE THE TARGETED
REVENUES.  FINALLY, GENERAL ELECTIONS IN 1998 COULD LEAD
TO A SOFTENED ECONOMIC POLICY IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1997.

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in BUDAPEST

ACCORDING TO THE FINANCE MINISTRY, HUNGARY'S GDP IS
EXPECTED TO GROW BY ONLY ONE PERCENT THIS YEAR AS A RESULT
OF DECLINING DOMESTIC DEMAND.  THE MINISTRY FORECASTS AN
8-10 PERCENT ANNUAL GROWTH IN EXPORTS AND A 3-5 PERCENT
INCREASE IN IMPORTS RESULTING IN A USD 1.8 BILLION TRADE
DEFICIT, USD 800 MILLION LESS THAN LAST YEAR.  THE DEFICIT
IN THE CURRENT ACCOUNT IS NOW PROJECTED AT USD 1.7
BILLION, USD 300 MILLION LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL TARGET.
THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE ANNUAL
GDP WILL BE LESS THAN 4 PERCENT THIS YEAR AS COMPARED TO
5.5 PERCENT LAST YEAR AND OVER 9 PERCENT IN 1994.  NET
DEBT IN PROPORTION TO EXPORT REVENUE IS PROJECTED TO BE
BELOW 110 PERCENT THIS YEAR, DOWN FROM 130 PERCENT IN 1995
AND 180 PERCENT IN 1994.

THE FINANCE MINISTRY PROJECTS ANNUAL AVERAGE CONSUMER
PRICE INFLATION OF 23-24 PERCENT AND 20 PERCENT TWELVE-
MONTH INFLATION IN DECEMBER, WHICH ARE BOTH HIGHER THAN
THE ORIGINAL GOVERNMENT TARGETS OF 20 PERCENT AND 16
PERCENT RESPECTIVELY.

VIETNAM PLANS TO DEVELOP DEEP-SEA FISHING FLEET: OPP'TIES

from INTERNATIONAL MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS, October 23, 1996
     U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (US&FCS)

Telegraphic Report from the AMERICAN EMBASSY in HANOI

1.  VIETNAM'S INTEREST IN DEVELOPING A DEEP SEA FLEET CAPABILITY
BETWEEN NOW AND THE YEAR 200 IS TRONG.  INDEED, THE GOVERNMENT
HAS MADE DEEP SEA FISHING AND AQUACULTURE AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
PRIORITY.  CURRENT ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT THE VIETNAMESE FISHING
INDUSTRY WILL NEED TO INVEST $600 MILLION USD OVER TH NEXT FIVE
YEARS IN ORDER TO RAISE OVERALL PRODUCTION FOR CONSUMPTION
INTERNALLY AND FOR EXPORT (OF HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS) FROM 800,000
TONS PER YEAR TO 1,200,000/1,500,000-THE TARGET OBJECTIVE.

2.  VIETNAM PRESENTLY HAS NO DEEP SEA FLEET CAPABILITY.  ITS
FLEET IS LIMITED TO SMALL COASTAL VESSELS OF 400-600 HP WORKING
AT A DEPTH OF 30 TO 50 METERS.  HOWEVER, TO INCREASE
SIGNIFICANTLY ANNUAL PRODCUTION OF SHRIMP AND YELLOW FIN TUNA,
VIETNMA MUST DEVELOP THE CAPABILITY TO FISH FOR LARGER SIZE
SHRIMP FOUND AT A DEPTH OF 120 TO 150 METERS AND A RANGE OF
150-200 KM FROM SHORE.  THE PRODUCTION BY VIETNAM OF FRESH SHRIMP
AND TUNA ARE BELIEVED TO BE MOST LUCRATIVE FOR SERVICING WORLD
MARKETS.  CURRENTLY, FOREIGN COMPANIES PRIMARILY FROM TAIWAN AND
JAPAN ARE CONTROLLING THIS CATCH.

3.  ACCORDING TO CURRENT ESTIMATES, VIETNAMESE INDUSTRY MUST
DEVELOP A FLEET OF 50 TUNA VESSELS, WITH A "MOTHER" PRCOESSING
SHIP TO PRESERVE THE CATCH AND ENSURE THE HIGHEST QUALITY. FOR
SHRIMPING, THE FLEET IS FOR 250 VESSELS.  A DETAILED GOVERNMENT
SURVEY OF VESSEL NEEDS BY PROVINCE, NOW UNDERWAY, SHOULD BE
COMPLETED BY THE 4TH QUARTER OF 1996.  THE BOATS REQUIRED ARE
EXPECTED TO RANGE IN SIZE FROM 75 TO 110 FEET, WITH 600 HP TO
1,000 HP ENGINES.  EQUIPMENT FOR SHRIPING WILL INCLUDE CAGES FOR
MATURE CRAWFISH, PLUS CONVENTIONAL NETTING GEAR.

4.  THE NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF VIETNAM FOR A PHASED
APPROACH ROUGHLY AS FOLLOWS:  1) THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
APPROVED A $57 MILLION SOFT LOAN PROGRAM TO ESTABLISH THE
LAND-BASED INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT DEEP SEA FISHING AND
PURCAHSE ONE 30-50 FEET ALUMINUM HULL FISHING VESSELS, WITH 250
HP (IMPORTED) ENGINES; 2) PURCAHSE OUTRIGHTA NUMBER OF LARGER
SIZE VESSELS FROM ABROAD; 3) ENTER JOINT VENTURES IMPLEMENTED
WITH FOREIGN FIRMS TO CONSTRUCT FISHING VESSELS, USING VIETNAMSE
STAFF IN FOREIGN SHIP YARDS, FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY OF VESSELS IN
VIETNAM AND THEN ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT, NATIONAL
SHIPBUILDING CAPABILITY.

5.  COMPETITIVE FINANCING WILL BE KEY IN ORDER TO WIN ORDERS TO
SUPPLY THESE FISHING VESSELS TOVIETNAM, AUTHORITIES EMPHASIZE.
AND, VIETNAM'S EXPORTERS WILL NEED TO HAVE ASSURED COMMERCIAL
ACCESS TO FOREIGN MARKETS FOR ITS TUNA AND SHRIMP TO BE ABLE TO
SERVICE PAYMENT OF LOAN OBLIGATIONS INCURRED.

6.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:  DR. HO VAN HOANH,
DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION DEPARTMENT, MINISTRY OF
FISHERIES, 57 NGOC KHANH, BA DINH, HANOI, TEL: 84-4-8326396; FAX:

FROM THE DESK OF GEOFFREY BELL

"The main excitement at the London summit naturally centered on
President Gorbachev's visit and his economic plans.  Beneath the cordial
public reception, a vigorous debate raged behind the scenes over how far
the West should go in offering financial assistance, with the US and
Japan taking the hardline position.  The end result will be some increase
in technical assistance and a modest relaxation of restrictions on EBRD
lending to the USSR.

"At the same time, and with considerable fanfare, the USSR has been
granted `special association' with the IMF and World Bank.  The original
idea, floated at the G7 finance ministers' meeting in London, was to
make the Soviet Union an `associate member' of the Bretton Woods
institutions -- but since the multilaterals' statutes currently have no such
membership classification, `special association' has been substituted for
`associate member' status.  The end result is the same: Moscow will
supply the multilaterals with economic statistics, the IMF can examine
USSR economic performance in Article IV-type consultations, and the
USSR is eligible for technical assistance in reforming its economy.

"But the new Soviet linkage with the multilaterals does not entail new
financial commitments from Washington.  Moscow will have no quota
at the IMF, nor is the World Bank expected to finance major projects in
the Soviet Union.  Put another way, there is less to `associate status' than
meets the eye, and surely no substitute for the broader benefits of full
membership -- which is still some distance off.

"The dollar behaved impeccably for the G7 summit, with the massive
coordinated central bank intervention on July 12 successful in keeping
the currency slightly below the DM1.80  level throughout the meetings.
While the dollar is still vulnerable to a near-term correction, however,
our surveys indicate a heavy majority of market participants feel that the
general trend for the dollar remains upward.  That conviction has been
reinforced by Fed Chairman Greenspan's decidedly upbeat economic
review in congressional testimony this week, where he predicted growth
ranging from 2 1/4-3% in 1992 and steady progress in bringing down
inflation.

"While few economists now challenge the administration's contention
that the recession has ended, serious questions linger over the strength
of the economy.  Greenspan may well be correct about growth next year,
but the current air of caution in the consumer and business sectors
suggests his optimistic forecast could prove a bit on the high side.  The
chairman's view did gain support this week from report of a June
housing starts rise of 5.2%, surpassing the 1 million annualized rate for
the first time since November 1990.  In response, bond yields have
backed up slightly, with the long bond yielding just under 8.5%.

"We have been emphasizing the inevitability of US bank consolidation
for some time, so the only surprise in the Chemical/Manufacturers
Hanover marriage announced on July 15 is that it happened sooner than
many analysts expected.  This first money center merger, along with the
proposed NCNB-C&S/Sovran coupling, is likely to trigger a series of
similar consolidations.  Bankers have shown a consistent pattern of
rushing in the same direction -- whether the fad be LDC loans, highly
leveraged transactions or globalization and securitization -- and the
merger movement is likely to be no different.  Bank stocks have
immediately moved up, and investment houses are eager for the action
given the paucity of new business elsewhere.

"One area of banking where activity is growing fast is the funding of
Third World debt.  Prices have been rising very sharply, and bankers
anxious to sell their loans are finding willing new buyers in trading
rooms and among portfolio managers looking for high-yield paper.  It is
no exaggeration to argue that the Latin American debt crisis is nearing
an end: Indeed, the value of bank loans in the secondary market already
equals or exceeds the written-down value in the books of many banks."

Coming Down from the Summit

THE LONDON SUMMIT was historic by virtue of Soviet President
Gorbachev's presence and the synchronized announcement of the
conclusion of the START negotiations.  But the focus on Gorbachev
pushed a diverse range of other important economic and diplomatic
issues to the background, and that raises serious questions about summit
reform.

The bare bones of the deal with Gorbachev were widely anticipated:
"special association" with the IMF and the World Bank and commitments
to provide technical advice in specific sectors, notably energy and food
distribution.  The promises of additional assistance from the OECD and
the EBRD do not amount to much.  More significant was the proposed
help with retooling military factories for civilian use, which doubtless did
not go unnoticed by the hardliners in Moscow.  In the end, Gorbachev
emerged with only modest Western commitments to expand financial
assistance, sweetened with lavish praise and an invitation to the 1992
summit.  The latter has been widely interpreted as a first step toward a
G8 -- but in fact, it is little more than a symbolic gesture aimed at
shoring up the Soviet president's political position at home.

Aside from the Soviet question, G7 leaders offered a semblance of
movement on several issues, including a reaffirmed commitment to
control arms sales and arrest the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction.  Participants also gave an endorsement to renewed efforts to
achieve a negotiated peace settlement in the Middle East, and established
a yearend deadline for conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT
negotiations.  It remains doubtful, however, whether G7 goals on arms
control and Mideast policy can be realized -- and the consensus on the
general need for a GATT accord does nothing to resolve the sticky issues
that frustrated attempts to meet the original deadline for conclusion of the
Uruguay Round at end-1990.

Perhaps more notable is what the summit participants scarcely discussed
at all.  Environmental issues got a scant 15 minutes of public discussion,
and the tour d'horizon in the final communique reappeared virtually
verbatim the Houston summit positions on secondary issues ranging from
drug trafficking to aid to Africa.  In effect, the agenda was hijacked by
the Soviet question -- and the gradual erosion in substance, continuity
and focus at annual G7 summits over the past decade has continued.

What should be done?  A Group of Thirty report released last week put
forward three practical recommendations:

* Set a new core agenda for future summits alongside a topical agenda
of items like aid for the Soviet Union.  The core should comprise five
broad topics -- aid, trade and investment, economics (macro and
structural adjustment), defense and the environment.

* Define, manage and monitor sharing of responsibility on core agenda
issues in a systematic and comprehensive manner.  That would require
G7 leaders to agree on performance measures for their own countries,
which would then be used to frame the discussion of burden-sharing and
tradeoffs in different areas of the G30 process.

* Improve arrangements for follow-through on summit decisions.  One
possibility would be to emulate the European Council of Ministers, with
heads of state meeting twice a year and periodic ministerial consultations
beyond finance to other areas such as agriculture and trade.  Broader
ministerial representation at the leadership summits could also assure
more comprehensive discussion of policy coordination in specific areas.

On balance, the London summit avoided the appearance of failure, but
it failed to deal effectively with the pressing international issues that
threaten to destabilize the world order.  If progress on GATT is achieved
and if the Soviet Union can somehow be extricated from its present
political and economic morass, the summit may have served sufficient
purpose.  But the prospect of new frustrations looms large on both fronts
-- and something more than pageantry may be required when G7 leaders
meet again.

Chemical/Manny Hanny: Let the Mergers Begin

THE MONEY CENTER MERGER long rumored finally took its first
step toward consummation this week -- and more such consolidation
moves in the US banking industry are imminent.  Once the merger of
Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover is carried out -- there seems scant
chance regulators will object, though it represents a major setback for
New York City employment and municipal revenues -- the new Chemical
Banking Corp. will have assets of US$135.5 billion, second only to
Citicorp with US$216.9 billion.  That puts more pressure on fourth-place
Chase Manhattan, fast sliding down the US asset league table with
US$98.1 billion, to shop around.  Others will have to consider mergers
just to remain cost-competitive, particularly those with large branch
networks in crowded banking markets.

Some analysts see Chase linking up with the Bank of New York, a
US$39.44 billion institution, though BNY is still working through the
aftereffects of its 1988 merger/takeover of Irving Trust.  There are
multiple consolidation possibilities on the West Coast, even if
deterioration of California and other Pacific real estate markets and bank
credit quality may delay action until the worst loans are shaken out.
Executives from Wells Fargo and Security Pacific held exploratory talks
last year; they may be taking a second look.  Another widely touted
match would merge First Interstate of Los Angeles into the well-
capitalized and aggressively expanding BankAmerica of San Francisco.
In the South, NCNB and C&S/Sovran were already talking merger as a
combined US$116.6 billion regional power when this week's news
broke, and high-performance Wachovia and South Carolina National
Bank recently tied a definitive knot.  In the Midwest, some see the
possibility of a merger between First Chicago and Continental Bank --
the latter just shaking off the lingering effects of its 1984 liquidity crisis
and rescue by the FDIC.

The Chemical/Manny Hanny merger is encouraging because it indicates
that, in the upper reaches of the US industry, realism is prevailing over
issues of institutional prestige and executive ego.  Put another way, post-
consolidation yearly cost savings of US$650 million were simply too
great to be overlooked at a time of diminished earnings prospects.  IR
has long argued that the US industry is weakened by its fragmentation
into an excessive number of institutions, with much of the excess
capacity to be found in the New York money center.  Together,
Chemical and Manufacturers have 562 branches in New York and the
surrounding region -- 133 in Manhattan alone.  Seventy branches will be
eliminated, contributing in significant part to the overall savings as at
least 6,200 jobs from a combined total of 45,000 are eliminated.  That's
a tough blow to New York, whose job pool and revenues had already
taken a major hit as the financial industry dramatically contracted.  But
as bankers prepare to cope with pending legislation in Congress that
would lock undercapitalized institutions out of expanded business areas,
they are likely to give local political considerations considerably less
weight.

Another important implication of the Chemical/Manny Hanny deal is the
new lease on life it has given bank stocks, whose first-half rebound was
in danger of petering out.  Shares of both banking concerns posted large
gains on the news, pulling up other banking issues.  Investors see a wave
of consolidations boosting profits, though it won't be easy to find many
pairs of institutions that dovetail so nicely (and with such compatible
chairmen) as Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover.  But most banks
stand to realize some savings through consolidation, and as their rivals
merge, they may have little choice but to follow suit.  In New England,
Fleet/Norstar's spring acquisition of the failed Bank of New England's
three main units already has raised pressure on the reorganizing Bank of
Boston to join forces with Shawmut National in neighboring Connecticut.

The misfortune for the longer-term development of the industry,
especially in an international context, is that there is little immediate
incentive for mergers of banks in different US markets.  The FDIC's
rejection earlier this year of BankAmerica's strong bid for the BNE units
was shortsighted in this regard because it prevented the creation of the
first major bicoastal institution.  BankAmerica may yet acquire a
subsidiary outside its region, but there are few others inclined to do so
at present.  For now, the main impulse will be consolidation within
regions and in contiguous regions, in anticipation of a US banking
reform bill likely to liberalize branching across state lines.  At some later
date, with the current bank crisis and real estate recession waning, we
may see truly national banks created by a second wave of East-West and
North-South mergers.

Myth and Reality at BCCI

THE MAIN MYTH about BCCI -- which no one has challenged -- is
that it was founded by a Pakistani banker, Agha Hassan Abedi, with Gulf
Arab money.  The truth is that it was founded by Bank of America,
which at the time was trying to build up its presence in the Middle East
and had just failed in an attempt to put together a consortium bank with
Saudi Arabia's NCB and Iran's Bank Saderat.  BoA brought in Abedi,
who had been in Beirut, to head a management team that he ran before
UBP's East Pakistan empire died with the birth of Bangladesh.  That's
no big deal: Lots of Western banks were promoting Middle East banks,
and Abedi very quickly seems to have taken over the show.  But it does
serve to emphasize the layers of obfuscation that now cloud the BCCI
affair.

We put little credence in the rumors that BCCI ran a hit squad in the US
that "eliminated" hostile witnesses, and that BCCI had made direct
payments to several former world leaders.  And the story that a recent
warehouse fire in London destroyed all or a good part of the BCCI
papers taken away from the bank by the SFO and the liquidators at the
time of its closure sounds more like James Bond fiction -- at least, we
hope it is.  More plausible is the story that BCCI paid its non-executive
directors US$200,000 a year -- wildly out of line with standard
compensation for such posts.  And what about the link between London's
highbrow but troubled Cromwell Hospital (favorite of Arab clients for
years) and BCCI?  It seems the original ownership came from BCCI
senior management, and the funding came from the bank as well.  The
relationship is well worth a look, particularly in light of some of the
shenanigans uncovered at the hospital in recent years.

A particularly intriguing published report buried in the BCCI news was
a report from Abu Dhabi suggesting that the second set of books, which
documented the years of fraud, had been located in the UAE.  That just
happens to be where Abedi's No. 2, the mysterious Mr. Naqvi, is
reputed to be now (in fact, we suspect Naqvi is more likely in Pakistan
with his erstwhile boss).

Whatever the case, the report serves to focus attention on just what the
fraud in question was.  Given the secrecy attached to the various Price
Waterhouse reports -- as many as 10, of which those of last October and
this June were most important -- the answer to this critical question is not
clear, though presumably Leigh-Pemberton has finally told the sheikh.
But we see three separate problems:

* a shuffling of assets from low- to high-regulation jurisdictions
whenever a bit of window dressing was necessary to pull the wool over
the bureaucrats of the bank's "college" of regulators -- something that we
are assured has been known in its entirety to the BoE and PW for at least
two years;

* the non-recording of deposits, probably to assist clients in avoiding
VAT and corporate taxes, primarily in the UK -- which inevitably led to
a dual booking system (and which was also, we are told, well known to
the BoE; and

* a very dodgy loan book, including unsecured or inadequately secured
loans to insiders, influential Gulf families, Pakistani shipping interests
and apparently fictitious names.

The official BoE position seems to be that, while BCCI was thought
merely to have a solvency problem, doing a deal with Sheikh Zayed to
pour more money in was acceptable.  But as soon as there was
irrefutable evidence of fraud, that deal had to be dumped and the bank
closed -- no matter that Sheikh Zayed feels he was duped or that 1.5
million depositors worldwide may have lost their money.
The problem is that there are so many holes in this argument that one
scarcely knows where to begin.  First, contrary to the BoE's official
interpretation, the 1987 Banking Act does not need proof of fraud before
a bank is closed -- just strong evidence that it is in trouble.  There was
nothing to stop the BoE from acting earlier if it had wanted. (And under
the act, neither it nor its agents can be sued except in the most dire
circumstances.)  Second, we know for a fact that the BoE had plenty of
evidence on at least the first of the three frauds as early as mid-1988, so
it could have acted then.  And don't forget that it has had its own
management, seconded from Lloyds Bank, in place since early this year.
Third, given that the Urdu mafia around Abedi had been cleaned out last
year, there is no reason to believe that the fraud situation at BCCI was
actually getting worse in 1991 -- indeed, everything we hear suggests it
was getting better.

So why did the BoE act?  One suggestion is that Leigh-Pemberton did
not appreciate the consequences, but that is too insulting to accept.  Less
incredible is the possibility that Luxembourg didn't know what might
happen, and that it pushed the button first.  Or maybe the US regulators
(or FBI) prompted action.  Our own suspicion is that the initiative came
from Price Waterhouse, whose position in the whole affair is both crucial
and equivocal.

PW audited half of BCCI even before 1987, when it was awarded a
worldwide contract at the behest of the BoE (and apparently at a fee of
around STG1 million a year).  In the last two years, it has done around
10 supplemental reports for the BoE, the last two of which (and perhaps
others) have contained evidence of fraud sufficient for the authorities to
shut the bank down.  Prior to the 1990 accounts (which are still
unpublished), however, PW did not choose to qualify its approval, except
in ways that few professionals would have spotted.  In the last 18
months, poor Sheikh Zayed -- who is utterly blameless in this -- poured
about US$2 billion into BCCI as the Pakistanis got out with their loot.

Now, the auditor (in the US and the UK) works for the shareholder --
not the regulators and not the depositors.  So, PW might well have asked
itself, should it tell Sheikh Zayed what it is finding in its investigations
for the BoE, since those findings mean that it will be unable to approve
the accounts and since they will almost certainly force the authorities to
close BCCI?  In particular, shouldn't PW have told Sheikh Zayed enough
to stop him pouring money into the bank that he is most unlikely to get
back?  Clearly, PW was in a difficult situation -- but it is significant that,
two days before the bank was closed and after the June 27 date on which
PW handed over its final report to the BoE, Sheikh Zayed pumped
another US$660 million into BCCI.  One can well imagine near-panic at
PW: After all, they, the auditors, were at that point unequivocally in
possession of information that would render that capital injection
worthless in the very near future.  Might PW not have said to the Bank,
"Act, or we will go public"?

Certainly, PW does not emerge covered in glory.  It appears to have
gotten itself in a dreadful pickle between its twin responsibilities: to the
shareholders in the normal course of (very lucrative) audit business, and
to the BoE in the course of special studies that directly impinged on the
audit side.  Maybe it was wrong of the Bank to entrust the same firm
with both tasks.  But the Bank has more to answer for than that.
Whatever soothing words Leigh-Pemberton and Brian Quinn gave to the
Gulf rulers, the fact is that the BoE effectively allowed Sheikh Zayed to
pour huge amounts of good money after bad, knowing all the while that
a closure was almost inevitable whatever pledge might have been made.
That's shoddy treatment, at best.

A Not-so-precious Metal?

THE FACT that gold funds in the US turned in an impressive 8.04%
gain in the second quarter has bolstered optimism that the market has
turned the corner.  But what we find more intriguing is the shift in
emphasis -- notably in Kathryn Welling's thoughtful analysis in this
week's Barron's, which predicts improved prices in the second half --
to define gold increasingly as little more than a commodity subject to
forces no different than those that apply to copper and wheat.

Traditionalists would doubtless argue that recent political change in South
Africa and the lifting of US sanctions have also had a positive impact,
and there is surely some truth in that.  But Welling's analysis still points
up a fundamental change from the gold bug arguments common during
the last runup of prices from 1976-79.  Traditional reasons to buy gold
were to hedge against rising inflation and consequent loss of value in
paper currency, reinforced by the more extreme scenario of a sharp
depreciation of other assets as a result of major political disturbances.
But Welling puts the case for a new price rise in more basic terms:
Demand for gold, especially for jewelry, continues to rise, and supply
cannot keep pace given the high marginal costs of expanded production.

An IR editor who addressed a congregation of gold bugs in the 1970s
recalls the hoots of derision that greeted a lonely heretic who ventured
to note that surging prices might depress jewelry demand.  At the time,
this area of the market was considered trivial compared with the
apparently inexhaustible demand for gold for financial purposes.  Now
the outlook is different: In 1989, jewelry demand for gold overtook
Western mine production, and the gap widened last year.  Evidently the
industry has taken notice: The World Gold Council is a primary sponsor
for a current exhibit of rare African gold jewelry at the Chicago Art
Institute.

So why has gold become a commodity?  The reason is that it's now
widely realized that paper money can have value when issued by a
central bank that keeps the money supply under tight control.  This
perception differs fundamentally from the traditional view that paper
money (including bank deposits) can never have ultimate value unless it
is redeemable in gold.  In fact, investors have shown no reluctance to
hold dollars, DM or other hard currencies because it is universally
recognized that central banks in the key industrialized countries will act
responsibly to control money supply.  Hard lessons from inflationary
experience have definitively refuted any "greenback" theories that
governments can simply print unlimited amounts of money without
affecting its value.

With these lessons learned, gold -- earning no interest and requiring
storage costs -- looks less attractive as an investment, save purely as a
commodity.  Even the threat of war or rising inflation is no longer
enough to set off a rush into gold -- the dollar is generally the preferred
safe haven.  Hence the Gulf crisis produced surprisingly modest
movement in the price of gold.

Today, many traders in silver look to tableware instead of coinage for
guidance on demand.  Perhaps gold bugs will be more reluctant to
undergo complete conversion -- but it's not too early to pay closer
attention to how gold rings and necklaces are moving at the retail jewelry
shops.

UNITED STATES

GREENSPAN'S testimony before Congress confirms that Fed bank
president hawks in the FOMC have taken a back seat on monetary
policy.  Although Greenspan's forecast of economic growth next year in
a range of 2.25-3.0% is below the administration forecast at 3.6%, he
pointedly chose to keep present money supply targets at 2.5-6.5%.  The
anti-inflation zealots would have preferred to lower the band a notch, but
the 0.3% fall in the June PPI hardly supports their case -- and the 0.2%
CPI rise last month scarcely appears grounds for panic.

Greenspan conceded, as most corporate borrowers could confirm, that
the credit crunch persists -- and there's no guarantee that the situation
will get better in the near term.  In this context, the Chemical/Manny
Hanny marriage unveiled this week -- and the certain prospect of more
mergers to follow (see the lead editorial in this issue) -- could prolong
and conceivably even exacerbate the crunch in the short term, for two
reasons:

* parties to coming mergers will want to wash their hands of lending by
the other party that looks unwise or possibly vulnerable to regulatory
difficulties; and

* in many cases, loan officers fearful for their jobs will be inclined to sit
on their assets until they get a clearer picture of the new chain of
command and its revamped lending priorities.

The 5.2% rise in June housing starts is obviously good news, reinforcing
the anecdotal evidence that lower interest rates have given a boost to
residential construction.  But the recovery in the sector remains fragile
-- one more reason why the Fed will be cautious about raising interest
rates in the near term.  The 0.7% rise in industrial production for June
was skewed by a surge in auto and truck output, behind the 3.7% jump
in the consumer goods category.  Business equipment, excluding autos
and trucks, showed no change (remember too that some "fleet sales" of
vehicles quickly feed through to the consumer market).  Thus far, the
recovery seems to be stronger in consumer-based categories like housing
than in the business investment sector.  One gloomy projection based on
that dichotomy is that employment will show little improvement in the
near term -- and could even decline further -- though rising spending
power for workers will be sufficient to offset declining demand from the
unemployed.  The implicit risk in this scenario is that, unless
productivity picks up, lower profit margins and lower investment will be
the end result, undercutting the nascent recovery.  We do not view such
an outcome as inevitable -- but it's worth noting that a recovery driven
largely by the consumer economy threatens to exacerbate the existing
distortions caused by the relatively low savings rate of the US.  And
higher real long-term interest rates as global demand for capital
intensifies could further undercut business investment.

President Bush offered vague commitments in London to press forward
with the Uruguay Round -- but behind the reassuring rhetoric is a drift
in Washington toward the same sort of protectionism that the US is
pressing Brussels to abandon.  That suggests that the administration may
seek to use the North American FTA as a vehicle to introduce tougher
restrictions on imports from outside the proposed trading bloc.  A critical
issue is whether the new FTA will contain tougher foreign content
restrictions to prevent Japanese and European exporters and investors
from stealing under the umbrella of the trade pact.  Already US
automakers are complaining about liberal interpretations as to "national
content" in Canadian-built cars -- and we can expect such issues to be
pressed with greater urgency regarding Japanese- and European-owned
companies in Mexico.  That could lead to establishment of more uniform
tariff treatment for imports into North America -- another step down the
road toward major regional trading blocs.

TIGHTENING UP ON THE BANKS

In contrast to pending House legislation that less charitable observers
deride as a "widows, orphans and bankers relief bill," the Senate
Banking Committee draft released this week grants less new turf to the
banks and asks more in return.  Still, the "committee print" fashioned by
committee chairman Donald Riegle (D-Mich.) is consistent in key
respects with the Brady reform plan.  It includes two essential elements
of the White house proposal -- repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act separating
commercial and investment banking and authorization of interstate
branching -- albeit with provisos on both.  But the Riegle draft would not
allow ownership of banks by commercial enterprises and would continue
to bar entry by federally chartered banks into the insurance business.

Maintenance of the existing barrier to business ownership of banks could
amount to de facto continuance of Glass-Steagall, as so many securities
houses are subsidiaries of major corporations.  And the Senate bill is
much more restrictive than the House version on deposit insurance.  It
does not propose to cut back coverage of individuals from present levels,
but it would eliminate protection of brokered deposits.  The industry is
sure to mount heavy resistance as well to the provision for a special
assessment to cover the first US$10 billion pumped into the Bank
Insurance Fund.  Big banks will object in particular to the inclusion of
foreign as well as domestic deposits in the assessment base.

Some of the Riegle bill's sterner provisions may fall away in eventual
House-Senate conference talks on the final bill.  But commercial control
of banks, also vigorously opposed by Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.),
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, may well be
doomed.  It is also vulnerable to the populist argument (exaggerated, but
not entirely unfounded) that letting big companies buy banks would
concentrate economic power and dramatically raise taxpayer exposure in
the event of failures.

Provisions in the draft Senate bill that would impinge on Fed and
Treasury discretion in stabilizing big banks in trouble also are likely to
be watered down.  The Riegle draft would bar the rescue of large banks
as "too big to fail," and limit discount window assistance.  In the end,
however, monetary officials are likely to be left with wide discretion
here.  Democrats in both the House and Senate may well oblige the
maintenance of provisions obliging banks to provide services to low-
income consumers.

CANADA

THE MULRONEY government is going Gramm-Rudman in a big way
--  if more for political expediency than budgetary rigor.  FM Don
Mazankowski used a visit to his home province of Alberta to announce
plans for a 3% cap on annual federal spending, with Parliament barred
from hiking taxes or authorizing new borrowings to push spending above
that limit.  The Spending Control Act would cover all federal
expenditures except debt service, and would be applied on a government-
wide basis -- which means above-target increases in entitlements such as
social welfare or unemployment benefits would have to be offset by
compensating cutbacks elsewhere in other federal departments.

It is no accident that the FM broke the news in Alberta, the hotbed of the
surging Reform Party, whose otherwise vague and unfocused rightist
platform has one clear plank -- strict controls on government
expenditures.  The Reformists are ahead of the ruling Tories in the polls
nationally and far ahead in Alberta.  Cabinet ministers like Mazankowski
and high-profile Constitutional Affairs Minister Joe Clark may be safe,
but private polls show that other Alberta-based Tories would be wiped
out if elections were held now.

It appears doubtful whether Mazankowski's gambit can reverse the Tory
slide in the West, but odds for approval in Ottawa appear favorable --
likely before yearend.  Under the law, a five-year spending ceiling would
be set at Can$615.3 billion.  If spending projections in a given budget
exceed the yearly levels implicit in the five-year limit, the FM would be
compelled to establish how the government plans to compensate for the
overrun in future years.  Budgets that do not comply with mandated
spending limits could be approved only if Parliament rescinds the act
itself.

Gadfly Quebec businessman Glen Kealey -- well known nationwide as a
constant fixture who conducts his one-man protests almost daily outside
Parliament -- has become far more than just a nuisance to the Tory
government.  The doggedly persistent Kealey, whose rage stems from
alleged attempts by several Quebec Tories to extract bribes in exchange
for commitment of federal offices to his planned office complex across
the river from Ottawa, surprised the political cynics by persuading the
courts to bring charges of fraud and corruption against Sports Minister
Pierre Cadieux, three former ministers, the RCMP commissioner, several
senators and other Tory party officials.  Several targets of Kealey's wrath
already have been convicted on other charges; several more left the
cabinet with their political careers ruined.  The new charges will be
investigated by the local police, and some big Tory names could face
trial; Kealey first complained to the RCMP, but the federal agency found
evidence supporting the charges to be insufficient.

Economists are convinced the recession is over, but some leading
business executives fear that the economy could slip into a double-bottom
recession if the present upward momentum proves unsustainable.  For
now, the recovery scenario looks secure: Manufacturing shipments
increased by 0.9% in May to Can$23.3 billion, the third straight monthly
gain after a string of declines.  Granted, the gain was well below the 2%
rise in April, and most of the expansion was concentrated in the auto and
wood industries.  But combined with other economic indicators, it points
to an improving trend that should persuade the BoC to keep short-term
rates steady.

JAPAN

THE EFFECTS of the brokerage scandal may persist long after the
embarrassing disclosures end, and could knock the wind out of an
economy that is already looking tired.  No one is talking about an
outright recession: On the contrary, with just two months to go, the
current expansion is certain to surpass the record 57-month Izanagi boom
of the 1960s.  But most economists now doubt that real GNP will meet
the official target of 3.8% growth in the fiscal 1991 year through next
March.  The latest forecast revisions show inflation-adjusted growth of
3.0-3.5% in FY 1991.  Moreover, the likelihood that activity in Europe
--  a major customer of Japanese exports in recent quarters -- will continue
to slow suggests that the external sector may no longer offset weakness
in the domestic economy.

The immediate cause for concern is the newly foundering stock market,
which plunged to a 1991 low earlier this month and remains unsteady
over the 23,000 level.  Since Japanese banks may book unrealized profits
on equities holdings as capital, fluctuations of the Nikkei directly affect
their ability to meet the 8% capital adequacy requirement that the BIS
has set for the end of March 1993.  Last August, as the recovering
Tokyo Stock Exchange stalled and headed south again, only three of the
12 city banks had met the new standard.  However, the next phase of the
rally hatched in January pushed all but one over the threshold at the end
of FY 1990 on March 31.  At current levels, stock prices are 15% below
the 1991 peak of 27,147 on March 18.

The Ministry of Finance's largely symbolic response to the securities
scandal has done little to reassure investors or restore its flagging
credibility.  Last week, the Big Four securities houses began a
"voluntary" punishment -- a four-day suspension of soliciting business
from corporate clients.  FM Hashimoto, who previously denied
responsibility for the incident, subsequently reversed his position and
acknowledged that faulty oversight may have been a contributing factor.
The penalty: a three-month pay cut of 10% for himself (which translates
to a sum of US$30,000) and two other MoF officials.  Ironically,
Hashimoto's embarrassment may yield political dividends for PM Kaifu,
whose chances of retaining the LDP presidency and the top job in
October have thus improved.

The BIS rule and slumping TSE are squeezing banks anew and reducing
their ability to lend.  Now that equity financing is not a viable
alternative, major banks are rushing to obtain massive amounts of
subordinated loans from life insurance companies.  Sumitomo Bank, for
example, is seeking to borrow Y40-50 billion through this avenue.  At
worst, this could become a new source of pressure on stocks and crimp
corporations, which face rationing of credit needed to fund investment.

Significantly, the Bank of Japan's half-point cut in the discount rate on
July 1 was designed to refuel the economy and provide relief to the
teetering Nikkei.  Thus, the fallout from the brokerage scandal has
probably nullified the stimulative effect of lower interest rates.  Indeed,
all but two of 18 economic research institutes, which published revised
economic forecasts this week, believe that further easing of monetary
policy is required to sustain the expansion.

Warning signs are emanating from a variety of sources:
* Corporate bankruptcies: The number of first half business failures rose
for the first time in seven years by 60.2% to 4,723 in January-June 1991
from a year ago.   Combined liabilities surged 394.4% to a record
Y3,426.2 billion, surpassing the previous high reached in the first
semester of 1986.  This figure represents 82% of the full-year record
achieved in 1986, and assures that a historic high will be set for all of
1991.  Most of the increase in liabilities resulted from the collapse of
"bubble" companies that speculated heavily in equities and real estate.

* Foreign trade: The merchandise trade surplus widened in June for the
sixth consecutive month.  Measured year-on-year, the surplus grew 8.9%
to US$7.26 billion, as 6.9% growth in exports outpaced the 6.1% rise
in imports.  However, the bilateral balance with the US fell 17.9% -- a
reflection both of the relative strength of the yen and the weak US
economy.  Consequently, Japanese companies are likely to renew their
bid for American pocketbooks, which could draw new protectionist
reprisals from Washington.

The improving trade balance elsewhere carries the same political risk.
In the 12 months through June, the surplus soared 48.5% to US$2.64
billion with the EC and 20.3% to US$3.44 billion with Southeast Asian
countries.  In Europe, French PM Edith Cresson is leading the rhetorical
attack on Tokyo, while complaints are emerging from both Seoul and
Taiwan.  Thus, researchers at LTCB expect the current account surplus
to expand sharply from US$33.8 billion in FY 1990 to US$58.6 billion
this year, but to contract by 9% in FY 1992 in line with the shrinking
trade surplus.

* Monetary growth: The key M2+CDs measure rose a modest 3.5% in
May from a year ago, down nearly 10 percentage points from the peak
rate of 13% in the first quarter of 1990.  The BoJ insists that this pace
is sufficient to sustain economic activity, and expects the money supply
to show a 4% increase in April-June -- we have our doubts.

* Business investment: A new Small Business Credit Insurance Corp.
survey reveals that planned plant and equipment spending by small and
medium-size companies will drop 6.8% in the current fiscal year amid
increasing caution about the economic outlook.  Asahi Mutual expects
overall capital spending to grow just 1.1% in January-June 1991 from
the previous half year, and by a relatively modest 2.2% in July-
December.

The BoJ's 25-month regimen of tight credit will continue to reduce
inflation pressures.  Overall wholesale prices fell 0.1% in June from
May and rose an enviable 0.6% from a year earlier; since 1985, the WPI
has fallen 9%.  LTCB economists foresee no more than 1% wholesale
inflation and 2% retail inflation in the latter half of FY 1991 on the basis
of stable crude oil prices and moderate wage growth.  Taken together,
anemic activity, restrained growth in prices and the money supply and
a foundering stock market increase the prospects for another cut in the
official discount rate, currently 5.5%, by the end of September.

GERMANY

THE DECISION of the Bundesbank to lower the target for monetary
aggregate growth has blown the cover on the attempt in Frankfurt and
Bonn to play down the deepening rift over monetary policy.  The
decision to lower the top end of the money supply band to 5% is a direct
response to the failure of FM Theo Waigel and Economy Minister
Juergen Moellemann to make headway on subsidy and other spending
cuts.  IR sources say the only reason the Bundesbank chose not to hike
rates last week is that it didn't want to embarrass Waigel on the eve of
the London summit, where a German rate hike would have been
enormously unpopular -- though it seems eminently plausible that the
massive coordinated CB intervention in support of the DM one day after
the Bundesbank meeting was the quid pro quo for standing pat.

Market sources in Frankfurt anticipate an upward bias in interest rates
to the end of the summer.  The central concern at the Bundesbank
remains the budget: BB analysts dismiss Finance Ministry claims that the
federal share of PSBR will fall by 50% to DM25 billion in 1995 as
irrelevant, and forecast total new public debt will reach at least DM160
billion by that year.  That's not counting "shadow budgets" and other
hidden outlays taken off budget, notably the Treuhand and Hermes-
backed credit lines to the USSR.

Schlesinger's immediate concerns are twofold:

* FX reserves at the BB have fallen by DM10 billion thus far in 1991,
narrowing the margin of comfort for future intervention.  The
coordinated July 12 operation proved a huge success -- but Schlesinger
is well aware that such broad support, particularly from the Fed, cannot
be counted on if the DM comes under renewed pressure.

* The June inflation numbers were bad enough, and Schlesinger fears the
July results could be worse -- albeit largely due to the one-off impact of
the tax increases that took effect July 1.

Heightened pressure on the FX and inflation fronts would significantly
narrow the odds for a Bundesbank rate hike, regardless of Bonn's desire
to hold off.  And rising interest rates would also intensify pressure on
Waigel to consider new fiscal actions.  Wilhelm Noelling of the
Hamburg LZB already is publicly touting hefty taxes on real estate
holdings and capital assets as the only effective means to transfer wealth
from west Germany to the ex-GDR.  Noelling's view is still tainted by
association with the Hamburg SPD's weakness for giveaways to the East
-- but the endorsement of several economic institutes has broadened the
political base of support for new fiscal actions.  Any movement in that
direction, however, clashes head-on with the palpable unpopularity in the
West of the tax rises already in place -- and it's impossible to conceive
of Bonn implementing fiscal adjustments that could prevent the PSBR
from moving steadily higher.

Further repercussions of the Karlsruhe decision. Tax lawyers who have
seen the 60-page Supreme Court verdict call the decision a landmark
victory for fiscal authorities -- and a stinging defeat for rights to privacy
in banking transactions.  In the political arena, the ruling CDU is
inclined to opt for spot tax audits as the most efficient -- and least
financially damaging -- response to the court ruling.  It also appears to
favor a deductible limit of DM2,000 for interest income.  But neither the
party nor the government thus far has provided sufficient clarification of
its position on the Karlsruhe ruling, and that alone could unsettle
investors.  The opposition SPD has taken advantage of the confusion by
spelling out a more clear-cut policy that rules out reintroduction of
withholding tax on interest income, establishes higher deduction limits
for small investors, and calls for aggressive efforts to assure greater
conformity in tax laws throughout the EC.  The SPD also would favor
spot audits over more sweeping tax controls.

Banks will be forced to relax secrecy requirements, but will seek Bonn's
commitment to broaden exemptions for interest income on the (somewhat
self-serving) grounds that lower taxes would make voluntary controls
more workable.  Specifically, the industry will lobby for much bigger tax
exemptions up to DM6,000 for single and DM12,000 for joint returns.
The trouble is that the standard tax deduction for wages currently is set
at just DM2,000 -- and it will be difficult to make a case for giving
preferential treatment to interest income.  Also expect the small banks --
without links to Luxembourg or offshore subsidiaries -- to press for
uniformity in rules for interest taxation throughout the EC, which
Deutsche, Commerzbank and Dresdner are more likely to oppose to
protect their interests abroad.

THE MERTENS AFFAIR

Two weeks after allegations of insider trading abuses in the newsletter
Effecten-Spiegel triggered action at Deutsche Bank against a key figure
in the case, the affair is burgeoning.  Prosecutors are now investigating
Thomas Fluegel, a crony of Manfred Mertens, the DB securities official
sacked for violating "internal regulations" of the bank.  Prosecutors have
raided Fluegel's office and are now sifting through documents for
evidence to support allegations that Mertens was embezzling from his
employer -- purportedly by skimming payments for securities deals that
turned a profit, while chalking up losses to DB.  IR sources also report
that Deutsche is restructuring its securities trading operations to prevent
its employees from conducting one-man operations at its expense.

The latest twist is part of an increasingly tangled web of allegations.
Fluegel was a former employee of the Frankfurt securities trader
Ohms/Schmidt, until Schmidt and Fluegel quit and joined forces.  Ohms,
not touched in the most recent affair, was the former employer of
Joachim Schmidt, the securities trader who gained notoriety in the VW
securities scandal.  A report in the business magazine Wirtschaftswoche
claims that Poehl's former secretary, who was fired after allegedly
providing Schmidt with information about dollar interventions, was later
hired by Ohms.

UNITED KINGDOM

The half-point cut in interest rates, courtesy of the Bundesbank, came on
schedule.  And the enthusiasm of the markets may convince Chancellor
Lamont to go for another half-point cut before the new Schlesinger-era
Bundesbank Council reconvenes at the beginning of September.  The
FTSE has surged, the gilts market has suspended disbelief, and
economists like Gavyn Davies (whose ideological bent is to the left) are
saying that there is finally light at the end of the tunnel.

But hold on.  For once, we side with the CBI, whose latest
pronouncement is that "brutal" anti-inflation policies (strongly supported
at the time by the CBI) have set back growth prospects for years.  We
don't see any sign of the recession ending: Indeed, in some key sectors,
the other shoe is still to fall.  The most vulnerable is property: the
Stanhope/Rosehaugh merger is a sign of weakness, not recovery.  In
central London, 15% of office space supply is now unoccupied, and
empty office space in the capital has increased by 6.2 million square feet
in the last six months alone.  Plus, there is still a huge amount of new
building about to come on the market -- with no realistic chance of
finding tenants.  Whether base rates are 11% or 11.5% is irrelevant to
the plight of these developers: Another half-point cut won't stop some
very nasty collapses.

And the banks stand to suffer from the property fallout.  The
conventional wisdom is that the clearers are in for a bonanza -- after five
years of retrenchment, it is felt, they are leaner and more bottom-line
oriented.  As the economy recovers, it is argued, bank profits will soar.
Well, maybe -- but only because bank accounting is exceptionally
creative and they are going to have to raise capital for Basel.  The truth
is that all the clearers are sitting on real estate loans that are
nonperforming, underperforming or outright worthless -- and they will
have to take the hit sometime.  Lamont's anticipated report exonerating
the clearers from operating a cartel to the detriment of small business
could well reinforce the feel-good tendency among the banks -- but in
our view, the optimism is premature.

As for gilts, the message seems to be that, despite the expectation of
higher growth, inflationary expectations are falling even faster -- and
gilts are, therefore, a solid bet.  But note that the markets are looking
very selectively at the price data: The fact is that retail prices are stuck
at 5.8% and that core output inflation is running at 6%.  And forecasts
of 3.5% by Christmas, despite a pickup in growth, are wildly optimistic.
Plus, the improvement in the June PSBR to "only" STG1.41 billion,
from STG3.52 billion in May, is a one-off improvement: Had it not been
for receipts from the Scottish power selloff, the amount would have been
almost STG2.6 billion.  Given the doubts about the government's ability
to sell off the residue of BT as it had expected in the autumn, the PSBR
for FY 1991-92, which is slated at STG8 billion, could well come in at
closer to STG12-13 billion -- and that will offset even a substantial
improvement in inflation.

Finally two pointers:

* Barclays's new ECU issue of subordinated notes (a private placement
to Asian investors) will be the first of several such calls as clearers look
for capital to meet Basel ratios.  The ECU market is underdeveloped for
UK institutions, and there is real potential there.

* The front-runner to succeed Robin Leigh-Pemberton, whose stock has
taken a tumble as a result of BCCI, is SIB's David Walker.  As an
outsider, he has remained untainted by the BCCI affair -- unlike Eddie
George, who might normally get the nod.  As a former insider, he would
be better able to clean house under a Labour government than someone
like David Scholey.  Plus, he is a genuinely impressive intellect.

MIDLAND IN MOSCOW

The Financial Times investigation into the activities of a Midland Bank
trade subsidiary in the arms business, and the revelation of its links to
the world of British spookery -- not to mention losses close to STG100
million over 10 years -- is yet another bizarre banking story that could
run and run.  Moreover, the emerging evidence indicates close traditional
links between boardrooms at a number of clearing banks (and one or two
merchant banks) and the intelligence community, though Midland may
be the only one to have had its senior staff commit "suicide" in Moscow.
What must have present managements worried is just how easy it seems
to have been to lose MITS within the Midland organizational structure:
Kit McMahon is no fool, but it took him at least a couple of years to
identify a division that was apparently losing money like Bank of New
England.  A couple of questions to the auditor might not be amiss: What
are they paid for, after all?

GOVERNMENT FOR SALE

Transatlantic observers begin by accepting the British picture of
themselves as squeaky-clean, which only heightens their incredulity when
the venality of British politics and business is exposed to view.  A good
case in point is the decision by British Airways' boss, Lord King, to
withhold his company's regular STG40,000 contribution to the Tory
party because the DTI and Department of Transport have decided to open
up BA's cozy near-monopoly of long-haul routes out of Heathrow to
competition -- particularly from Virgin's Richard Branson.  In the US,
this kind of corporate donation  goes through a PAC and is decently (if
ingenuously) clothed in some sort of ideological garb -- free markets, fair
trade, Japan-bashing, whatever.  In the UK, it is right up front -- hence
King's decision.  What is more outrageous is that, by and large, the
British press has applauded King for his frankness -- but then the press
has a pretty relaxed view of its perks, too.

Latest evidence that the UK courts are hopelessly naive comes from the
decision just handed down against the four principals in the Garton
Amhurst case, who got between 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 years in jail for fleecing
clients quite shamelessly of at least STG4.7 million over 10 years.  The
four, who were barely in their 20s when the scam started, will do 12-24
months with good behavior -- and will then have to forego the pleasures
of being a company director for another couple of years.  Most
outrageous, the judge accepted that they had salted nothing away for this

SWITZERLAND

EXPECTATIONS that inflation will remain stubbornly high through the
summer -- with the year-on-year index climbing in June to its highest
level in nearly a decade, at 6.6% -- have dampened investor interest in
the SF bond market.  The falloff in new issues as the summer break
begins also has hurt the market.  Current prices already discount an
anticipated fall in inflation to 4.5% by yearend, and leading analysts at
Swiss banks expect SF bond yields to hold near present levels to
yearend.

The consensus among Zurich bankers is that investors would do better
to move now to lengthen maturity profiles in SF fixed-income portfolios
-- those who wait could find supply short when the market takes a more
dramatic upturn.  From a technical perspective, another good play in
Zuerich at present is Japanese equity warrants, currently recommended
by CS director Pierre Andre Chappallaz.  In recent weeks, warrant
values have declined from a 20% to 14% premium, which has made this
sector competitive with other currency warrants.  Chappallaz warns,
however, that persistent political uncertainty in Japan could lead to
further depreciation in value.

Bank Vontobel also is advising investors to reduce liquidity in all
currencies.  Jean-Pierre Rothenbuehler, head of the bank's advisory
department for private clients, views DM investments as likely to remain
the most solid in Europe, but prefers Euro-DM to the domestic Bund
market.  Vontobel analysts are concerned at the pall cast over the
domestic market by the recent constitutional court decision regarding
taxation of interest income.  The result could be a split in the DM bond
market, with prices falling for Bunds but rising for Euro-DM issues.

As for the Swiss stock market, currently near its 1991 high, Vontobel
anticipates little movement over the next several weeks, with the
economic slowdown and slower-than-anticipated improvement on the
inflation front already factored into pricing.  The market will regain its
upward momentum only with a significant drop in interest rates and
improved Swiss corporate earnings, bolstered by recent favorable
movements in SF exchange rates against the dollar and the yen.

A new study of prospective Swiss economic integration with Europe by
Peter Meier, chief economic analyst at Zurcher Kantonalbank, sees
significant advantage in the potentially enhanced stability that EMS
alignment could bring to the Swiss franc.  In Meier's view, full Swiss
integration in the EMS would appear a logical extension of present EC
movement toward monetary union.  But SNB Governor Markus Lusser
remains skeptical over the perceived benefits in closer SF alignment with
the EMS.  In our view, however, the SNB's dream of monetary policy
independence from Germany appears impossible to realize in the present
environment.

On interest rates, Meier foresees no fall in domestic mortgage rates at
least until Euro-SF rates begin to slide more sharply.  Three-month
Euro-SF rates, currently around 7 13/16-7 15/16%, should ease by
around half a point by yearend, but ZKB analysts view that fall as
insufficient to influence mortgage rates.

Don't expect any further substantial improvement in the Swiss trade
deficit to yearend, as softening in export sales abroad should offset an
anticipated falloff in import demand.  In the first half, the trade deficit
declined by 8% against the year-ago period to SF5 billion, while terms
of trade improved due to modest decline in import prices and modest
improvement in average export values.  Widening interest spreads
currently favor the DM -- some Swiss forecasters now anticipate a rise
to SF0.88/DM on the cross by yearend -- but the currency movement is
unlikely to have a major impact on the bilateral balance with
Switzerland's largest key trading partner.  IR expects softened German
demand as a result of the economic slowdown to weaken Swiss exports
to that country in the second half.

The Swiss economic slowdown has taken its toll on federal finances.
The Federal Financial Department in Berne, in revised projections based
on first-half tax income, predicts that the budget will finish the year in
deficit for the first time in five years.  The new forecast contrasts with
an original budget projection of a SF73 million surplus in 1991.
Estimated tax revenues of SF16.2 billion were significantly below
expectations: Direct federal tax income appears likely to come in near
anticipated levels at yearend, but turnover taxes -- the main source of
federal tax revenues -- show a substantial decline.

FRANCE

NOW THAT year-on-year inflation is lower in France than in Germany
for the first time in 18 years, FM Beregovoy sees a widening margin of
comfort to ease credit -- but he will resist political pressure for more
aggressive action.  Provisional data show the June CPI at just 0.2%, with
the year-on-year rate up by 10 bp from May to 3.3%.  But a 0.5%
monthly surge pushed the German CPI up to 3.5% year-on-year in June.
The widely anticipated reversal in the Franco-German inflation
differential is a personal victory for Beregovoy, whose tight-money,
strong-franc policies over the past three years have steadily slowed price
growth.

France should retain the inflation edge over Germany at least until the
end of the year, given expectations of stable French inflation around 3%
and persistent reconstruction pressures on German prices.  But
Beregovoy and the Bank of France are taking a cautious line on interest
rates, despite mounting political pressure to ease monetary policy to
prime the economy.  French growth was flat in the first quarter and is
expected to remain sluggish at 1.5% for all of 1991, down from 2.8%
in 1990.

The BoF's benchmark rates, the money market intervention rate and the
repurchase rate for five- to 10-day securities, have held steady at 9% and
10%, respectively, since March 18.  The rates are applied by the central
bank on its advances of liquidity to the banking system and are generally
regarded as the lower and upper limits for daily movement by short-term
market-determined rates.  The BoF's quarter-point cut of key rates last
October was quickly followed by German monetary tightening that sent
the franc into dangerous territory, briefly over FF3.4200; the BoF now
appears firmly committed to holding the line at FF3.40.

Advocates of immediate easing gained additional ammunition with the
continued fall in housing starts to the end of the first quarter.  The
downward trend is expected to continue through the summer, despite a
recent pickup in construction permits.  The volume of houses completed
in 1990 rose by just 1.6% after a rise of 5.4% in 1989, while spending
on house purchases and building improvements rose by a feeble 0.2%.
Developers reported a sharp rise in housing inventory to FF7.1 billion
in 1990, from FF2.4 billion the year before.

SABENA'S FATE

The EC Commission will decide next week whether to approve a
proposed Belgian government aid package of BF35 billion to help
restructure struggling national air carrier Sabena.  The issue is seen as
important since the EC is taking an increasingly dim view of subsidies,
and last year heavily criticized Air France and UK-based Rover for
hidden subsidy arrangements.  The Commission previously has indicated
that it would approve a Sabena bailout only if:

* it is a one-time operation, ruling out any future aid for the airline; and

* Sabena's monopoly on routes to Brussels's Zaventem international
airport is dismantled and access is granted to other airlines.

The Commission is understood to believe that the Belgian government
has gone a long way toward meeting conditions for the aid.  The package
would include a BF16.2 billion writeoff of long-term debt and would be
extended in two phases.  An initial installment of BF10 billion would be
paid immediately upon Commission approval, mainly to finance up to
3,000 layoffs.

A BREAK IN THE FARM IMPASSE?

EC Agriculture Commissioner Ray MacSharry has come up with a new
plan designed to take large amounts of land out of production.  The
comprehensive reform program is designed to encourage farmers to retire
early, tempted by lump-sum payments and pension plans.  Those staying
on would face a 35% cut in the Community's guaranteed prices, a 15%
cut in support prices for beef, and a 4% cut in the EC milk quota over
the next three years.  The scheme would cost the EC budget almost
STG3 billion in compensation to farmers over three years -- but
MacSharry argues that would be modest relative to the cost of
perpetuating the present subsidy system.

SOVIET UNION

CAN THE WEST avoid paying for perestroika?  The G7 managed to
politely fend off Gorbachev's financial pleas at the London summit: The
six-point program for the future is skillfully and carefully crafted to put
the emphasis on technical assistance and macroeconomic monitoring by
the multilaterals.  But it should already be obvious that -- even if foreign
capital makes inroads in select areas such as energy, mining and
aerospace,   and  even  if  the  Soviet  Parliament  and  the  republics
adopt the necessary legal framework for development of the private
economy -- the need for more substantial financial aid will remain acute.

The key to the future of the Soviet economy -- assuming it is not ripped
apart by nationalist movements -- remains privatization.  But the
transition to a market economy will be long and difficult: Production will
continue to plummet in the interim, existing distribution patterns will be
disrupted, and living standards will slide further.

The conundrum is that Western leaders tacitly recognize Gorbachev's
great experiment -- and his government -- could come crashing down if
he cannot raise the capital abroad to finance a more ambitious and
accelerated market transformation, yet they are reluctant to make massive
financial commitments.  The G7's insistence on a more specific and
viable blueprint for reform is understandable -- but the risk is that the
transformation will be stopped dead in its tracks while the West quibbles
over the details of the program.  Sweeping Soviet capitulations on global
policy from Eastern Europe to arms control of the magnitude agreed by
Gorbachev would have been inconceivable a decade ago -- and
Gorbachev's defenders would argue that the G7 would ultimately be
doing itself a favor by more generously assisting the transition to a
capitalist economy.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA

EXPECT a reasonably good economic performance for 1991, despite
predictable setbacks in the transition to a market economy.  Like its East
European neighbors, Czechoslovakia has suffered economic damage from
lost oil imports and Mideast contracts as a result of the Gulf crisis, as
well as from disruption of trade with the Soviet Union.  But Prague has
fared better in weathering the storm -- and while FM Vacalv Klaus warns
against premature optimism, government officials express satisfaction
with the progress made toward economic stabilization thus far.

Jaromir Zahradnik, vice president of the National Bank, notes that the
koruna exchange rate has stabilized and that inflation has been brought
under control after an initial surge following price decontrol at the start
of the year.  The CPI, which surged to 26% monthly in January,
dropped below 2% in May.  Unemployment has remained moderate at
around 3% of the workforce, in contrast to much higher levels in
neighboring countries.  Prague is proceeding with careful but
fundamental reform of the banking and financial systems.  State subsidies
for unprofitable enterprises are gradually being phased out, and
bankruptcies are certain to follow.

On balance, Prague's go-slowly approach to reform appears to have
produced less economic disruption and political turmoil than Warsaw's
more sweeping strategy.  Whether that is a matter of superior economic
management is another  question -- clearly Czechoslovakia has also
benefited from the fact that its foreign debt position is the most
advantageous among all East European countries save Romania.

POLAND

WARSAW will press the IMF for new concessions in its new pact with
the multilateral to ease the country's worsening financial straits.  The
government is watching helplessly as revenues from state-owned
enterprises dwindle, and the fledgling private sector can scarcely be
expected to fill the gaping hole in the budget.  The fiscal deficit is
projected to reach US$777 million this year, with inflation expected to
hit 55%.  Goals agreed with the IMF when the US$2.5 billion three-year
assistance package was originally negotiated in April already appear
hopelessly beyond reach.  One sign of Warsaw's growing desperation is
the postponement of a US$100 million payment on interest arrears owed
to commercial bank creditors.

Poland's financial reputation will be further tarnished by the brewing
scandal at the Agency for Foreign Debt Servicing.  The agency was
established before Solidarity took power, but several of its officials,
including Vice Finance Minister Janusz Sawicki, hold important positions
in the Bielecki government.  The agency is accused of mishandling the
funds, unauthorized repurchase transactions of national debt and outright
fraud.

The IMF will not agree readily to take the pressure off Warsaw -- but
some compromise appears inevitable if credit lines to Poland are to be
preserved.  Local political observers are loath to predict when the
population's tolerance for further austerity measures will run out, but the
pessimists say the breaking point is dangerously close.

BRAZIL

MONTHLY INFLATION moved as anticipated into double digits in
June, but the rise was not so drastic as to fatally undercut confidence in
Economy Minister Marcilio Marques Moreira's economic program.
Estimates by the FIPE institute at the University of Sao Paulo show
inflation for the 30-day period to July 8 accelerated to 10.7%, and FIPE
economists expect inflation to peak around 11% before easing to 10% by
end-July.

The IMF technical mission that arrived in Brazil this week will have to
weigh the recent economic progress made under Moreira against
lingering concerns, specifically over the inflation outlook and a
deterioration in the fiscal situation after steady improvement in 1990.
The latter problem reflects a sharp reduction in government revenues,
caused by restoration of diverse fiscal incentives by Congress and an
unexpected plunge in income tax receipts laid to bureaucratic confusion
under the previous economic team.  Restored tax breaks alone have cost
the federal treasury an estimated US$1.77 billion, boosting total
giveaways through fiscal incentives to a crushing US$7.82 billion -- or
1.51% of GDP.  Bureaucratic foulups in income tax collection over the
past year have cost the treasury another US$1 billion.

Despite these fiscal problems, Moreira stands a good chance of
persuading the Fund to sign off on a new credit facility so long as he can
offer convincing evidence that the economic situation has been stabilized
and inflation has been brought under control.  In this context, the July
inflation figures assume added weight as an indicator of the credibility
and effectiveness of Moreira's economic policy management.  His clout
with US and IMF officials in Washington should also help -- but no
amount of influence could overcome a renewed deterioration in the
inflation trend.  To bolster anti-inflation policy, Moreira has concentrated
his formidable diplomatic skills on persuading Congress of the need to
resist pressure for a return to full-fledged wage indexation.  His success
in maintaining wage restraint thus far should improve Brazil's case with
the IMF.  Moreira also can be expected to emphasize the fiscal windfall
anticipated from the dramatic shortening of the term for industrial tax
collections under EM 297.

Assuming July inflation holds below 11%, Moreira is well positioned to
gain IMF approval of a new letter of intent, clearing the way for signoff
on a credit facility.  Moreira's immediate objective is to gain IMF
commitment to an 18-month standby loan, which currently is expected
to total between US$1.5-2 billion.  If Brazil remains on course in
meeting its IMF targets, the economy minister is expected to seek
subsequent Fund approval of an extended fund facility for a three-year
term, with a credit commitment totaling US$3 billion or more.  If the
IMF hurdle can be cleared, Moreira remains optimistic that a deal with
commercial bank creditors can be reached by yearend.  The bank talks
can be expected to proceed in parallel with renegotiation of Paris Club
debt, currently estimated at around US$4 billion.

Terms for securitization of exports were regulated by the Central Bank
this week in Carta Circular 2185, which will allow Brazilian exporters
to negotiate loans in foreign currency with an international financial
institution using export revenues as collateral.  Sources in Brasilia report
that Brazilian exporters already have filed requests at the Central Bank
totaling a massive US$1.5 billion for approval of securitization
operations.  The new mechanism for export financing already appears to
be supplanting traditional reliance on short-term credit lines from foreign
banks.  According to exporters, securitization is advantageous since it
allows for longer terms, lower interest rates and larger volumes of cash
in foreign currency rather than cruzeiros.  The CB regulation allows
Brazilian exporters to open foreign bank accounts where they can deposit
part of their revenues.
The National Monetary Council this week also approved the rules for
conversion of foreign debt for financing environmental projects.  A
conversion fund will be constituted by conversion of debt into Treasury
papers denominated in cruzeiros with FX correction and fixed interest of
6% yearly.  Brazilian debt would be acquired abroad at prevailing
secondary market discounts and exchanged for Treasury papers.  CB
President Francisco Gros said that the G7 commitment at the London
summit to initial investment in Amazon conservation will be discussed
within the rules approved this week.  In a first stage, the government has
set a ceiling of US$100 million on this type of conversion, but Gros
already concedes that this limit may well be increased.

A consortium of eight foreign private bank creditors headed by Austria's
BBA Creditanstalt-Bankverein plans to participate in the Brazilian
privatization process through debt-equity conversions.  This marks the
first time that a group of creditor banks has joined for this purpose. The
other banks in the consortium are Amro of Holland, Banco Portugues do
Atlantico of Portugal, Generale Bank of Belgium, Dresdner and BFG of
Germany, and UBS and SBC of Switzerland.  A leading figure in putting
together the consortium is former CB President Fernao Bracher,
president of BBA Creditanstalt in Brazil.

After moving up at the beginning of the week, interest rates began to
slide on July 17.  The traditional pattern of government expenditures
above receipts in the second half of the month is one factor; another is
the conclusion of reschedulings for most state banks with outstanding
debt obligations to the Central Bank.  Interbank CD rates dropped at
midweek from 17.5% monthly to 15.3%; private bank CDs were offered
for yearly rates of 325/340%, trending lower.  The official CB reference
rate, or TRD, for July has been set slightly higher at 10.05%, broadly
consistent with inflation estimates for the month.

The black dollar moved at midweek to Cr$364/366, at a 10.9% premium
over the commercial rate at Cr$329/330.  Gold prices edged up to
Cr$4,307, for a 10.8% advance over the past month.  After rallying
early in the week, the BOVESPA dropped 0.4% on July 17 to 14,164
points with a trading volume of Cr$9.48 billion; the BVRJ rose 0.9% to
57,683 points with trading volume at Cr$2.58 billion.  Telebras, the
telecoms parastatal, accounted for close to half of July 17 trading on
BOVESPA on expectations of spectacular first half profits exceeding
US$500 million.

BANK CONSOLIDATION, BRAZIL-STYLE

Brazilian bank earnings reports for the first five months of the year show
an industry that has grown in numbers -- and deteriorated in profitability.
The number of banks in Brazil has reached 239, and 116 -- nearly half
--  reported losses for the January-May period.

In good part, this negative performance reflects the fallout from an
excessive expansion of the industry in 1990, spurred by a flurry of
incorporations of small and medium-size institutions.  Liberalization of
rules for bank incorporation under the 1988 constitution and subsequent
regulations issued by the Sarney administration set the stage for last
year's expansion.  The result was a surge in institutions from 153 in
1989 to the present 239.

The irony is that the expansion occurred even as the draconian freeze of
investment funds implemented under the original Collor Plan in March
1990 drained liquidity from the system.  Total liquidity in the banking
system shrunk by nearly 50%, from US$116.5 billion in 1989 to US$59
billion in 1990.  Many of the new banks were not well prepared to face
the adversities of 1990.  Most were founded by industrial and retail
groups, restructured brokerages and distributors seeking to profit from
lucrative margins of as much as 50% that prevailed in the last months of
the Sarney administration.  Then came the liquidity crunch, followed by
a wave of bankruptcies in the second half of 1990 and a continued
monetary squeeze that put additional pressure on industry profit margins.

Few of the new banks thus far have failed as a result of these financial
pressures.  But industry executives believe that many will eventually
have to seek mergers to avoid going under, which could reduce the total
number of banks by as much as 40% over the next year.

AIRCRAFTS FOR SALE

With the debut selloff of the state-owned steelmaker Usiminas set for
September, the Collor government is preparing to launch its second
privatization with sale of the jet-turbine maintenance firm Companhia
Eletromecanica.  Celma, with assets officially valued at US$84 million,
will be privatized in several stages.  An initial tender of up to 10% of
total Celma shares will be offered to employees; United Technology,
which currently owns a 13% shareholding in Celma, will be offered the
option to increase its stake up to the 40% maximum established for
foreign shareholders in the privatization process.  Remaining Celma
stock will go on the block for public offer on October 22.

One problem that has held back privatization of Celma is the fact that it
is the only domestic company qualified to service Brazilian Air Force
jets.  This issue was resolved through inclusion of a special clause in
privatization terms that guarantees such maintenance will be continued.

Though the Celma selloff is on a much smaller scale than the Usiminas
deal, its sale breaks a number of nationalistic taboos and paves the way
for a much more significant privatization: Brazil's biggest aircraft maker,
Embraer.  The recent surprise appointment of former Infrastructure
Minister Ozires Silva as president of Embraer -- the company he headed
from its founding until he assumed the Petrobras presidency in 1986 --
has been widely interpreted as a mission to get the parastatal ready for
privatization.

ARGENTINA

GOOD NEWS on the inflation front: The cost-of-living index should
ease this month to a range of 2.2-2.5%, from 3.1% in June.  Economy
Minister Cavallo has taken the initiative with a new decree issued this
week to end blanket wage indexation, a key element in the government's
anti-inflation strategy.

But don't expect organized labor to accept wage restraint meekly.
Steelworkers boss Lorenzo Miguel already has called a new 24-hour
general strike for July 24, in protest of plans by the state-owned steel
giant Somisa to lay off roughly one-third of its 13,000-strong workforce.
CGT Saul Ubaldini is challenging the government on another front -- he
is widely expected to enter the Buenos Aires gubernatorial contest as an
independent in September, and his anticipated vote share of up to 5%
would likely come at the expense of Peronist nominee Eduardo Duharde.
And the emerging alliance of Luis Barrionuevo, Ubaldini and Miguel --
the so-called "BUM" factor -- poses a major threat to government wage
policy.  Current expectations are that Cavallo will seek to hold wage
adjustments within a range of 5-8% and limit adjustments to no more
than a semi-annual basis, but the unions promise rough sailing ahead.

The Menem government is moving to wrap up final terms for agreement
with the Fund, bolstered by continued price stability.  The target date for
signing of the IMF standby accord now appears to be July 29, with a
first tranche of US$260 million expected to be disbursed in September
from a one-year facility totaling US$1.04 billion.

The political situation is growing increasingly complicated as the
Peronists move toward what could prove a devastating defeat in
September congressional and gubernatorial elections.  Radical leader and
former president Raul Alfonsin already is predicting a Peronist debacle
and demanding a "national unity" government at the federal level.  One
of the more extraordinary endorsements for a unity pact among the major
parties came from former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who
suggested to Foreign Ministere Guido di Tella that such a move would
bolster foreign investor confidence in Argentina.

President Menem appears unlikely to give ground until the election
results are in, though speculation is rife that he will implement a
reshuffle at Interior if the ruling party suffers serious setbacks.  Present
forecasts anticipate that the Peronists will lose a substantial number of
congressional seats and governorships, with the Radicals making modest
gains but provincial parties staging the largest advances.  The 120-seat
Peronist plurality on the 254-seat lower house looks certain to undergo
serious erosion, though the party could cling to its majority in the
Senate.

The federal government's confrontation with the provinces deepened with
the brash move by Radical Governor Massaccesi in Rio Negro to seize
(with local police assistance) funds held at a CB-related federal financial
institution in the region.  Massaccesi claimed that the seizure was
justified by his need to meet state payrolls and the federal government's
failure to provide the provinces adequate resources to meet basic
financial requirements.  The conspicuous lack of criticism from other
provincial leaders has left Economy Minister Cavallo isolated in his
efforts to force return of the seized funds, though the federal government
has tightened the squeeze by canceling clearing for the province for new
withdrawals.

NEW ZEALAND

CONSUMER PRICES rose just 0.1% in the second quarter, the least
since 1967, while annual inflation slowed sharply to 2.8%.  This places
New Zealand ahead of all major OECD countries, including Australia,
Germany, Japan, the US and UK -- its biggest trading partners.  The
obvious implication is that local goods will become increasingly
competitive in foreign markets, and confirms our belief that the longer-
term outlook for the economy is decidedly bullish.  The continued
depreciation of the kiwi dollar to under the key 57-cent level against the
greenback and toward 57 on the TWI carries little inflation risk, and
instead will support a durable expansion led by exports later this year.

Inflation fell in most categories, particularly in transportation, household
and food costs.  Significantly, existing house prices fell 0.6% in the
quarter, the first drop since 1977.  Adjustment for volatile energy prices,
tax-related changes and other one-off factors yields an underlying annual
inflation rate of 2.2%, down from 2.7% in the first quarter and 4% a
year ago.  Weak domestic demand, falling real wages and falling
inflation expectations are all favorable portents.  NZNB economists
forecast underlying price growth of 2.3% for all of 1991.

The reaction of the Reserve Bank to the CPI result, which was in line
with expectations, speaks volumes about the official commitment to price
stability.  Market participants had hoped for a signal that the RB would
now tolerate a positively sloped yield curve; on July 15, the gap between
90 days and five years was virtually flat, compared with minus 151 bp
one year ago.  Instead, the CB declared that the encouraging headline
inflation rate overstates the actual improvement, and supported this with
its housing adjusted price index, which rose 0.3% in June and 3.4%
year-on-year.  Clearly, the monetary authority is not contemplating a
significant shift in policy as a result of the second quarter CPI.  On the
contrary, the RB noted that wholesale interest rates and the exchange rate
have already largely discounted the improvement in inflation.  Finally,
it warned that modest credit easing awaits further evidence that price
pressures remain under control and confirmation in this month's budget
that the government's fiscal house will be put in order.

PHILIPPINES

ECONOMICS AND POLITICS have taken a turn for the worse.
Government statisticians report that the economy is at a virtual standstill,
after an imperceptible 0.2% expansion in the first quarter.  Inflation rose
to a five-year high of 19.0% annually in June, and unemployment hit a
six-year peak of 15.1% in April, which is certain to increase further as
the 600,000 layoffs linked to the Mount Pinatubo eruption flow through
to the official data.

The recent political developments are equally bearish.  The resignation
of Oscar Orbos, President Aquino's eminently capable and trusted
executive secretary, was apparently the result of a cabinet power play.
Orbos was principally responsible for implementing a local version of
glasnost and perestroika, which have made the administration more
accessible to the electorate and streamlined the bloated government
bureaucracy; his absence will be sorely felt.  At the same time, Defense
Secretary Fidel Ramos vacated his portfolio to pursue the ruling party's
mandate in the May 1992 elections.  These departures will leave the
president without two of her most popular advisers, just as a social crisis
is emerging on the horizon.

Indeed, opposition members Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile and VP Salvador
Laurel recently warned of impending chaos -- food riots staged by the
thousands left jobless, hungry and homeless by the fury of Pinatubo.
Although this strikes IR as deliberately alarmist and laden with ulterior
political motives, the deteriorating economy does have explosive
potential.  Both the rightist Iglesia Ni Kristo Church of Christ group and
the leftist Kilusang Mayo Uno May 1st movement are planning massive
rallies.  Their demands: rollback of petroleum prices to the level of
December 4, 1990, when Aquino pushed through sharp increases to
comply with IMF guidelines; and elimination of the 9% import surtax
implemented in January.

The INK's agenda could well extend beyond these two issues.  Loyal to
the late President Marcos, closely knit and thus politically influential, this
extremist sect is capable of putting all of its 4 million supporters on the
streets.  The apparent gambit: If the Catholic church was able to
organize one million for the historic people-power movement in February
1986 that led to Marcos's demise, the INK can do the same to Aquino.
To guard against infiltration by troublemakers, the sect has recruited
thousands of marshals backed by six helicopters.

In contrast, the KMU has a proven track record for provoking violence.
And IR does not dismiss the possibility that renegade Col. "Gringo"
Honasan and his Reform Armed Forces Movement might seek to take
advantage of the situation by mounting another coup attempt.  Two
hopeful notes: The conservative Federation of Free Farmers and the
Trade Union Congress of the Philippines will not join the INK and KMU
in the street demonstrations; and the unofficial ceasefire continues to hold
in the volcano-affected regions and insurgency-related incidents
elsewhere remain subdued.

Perhaps the worst news came from Washington, which disclosed that
Clark AFB will be abandoned after all because of the devastation
wrought by the volcano.  A Pentagon survey team estimated that it would
cost US$500-800 million to dig out the 9,000-acre base and repair
runways and more than 70 buildings that were damaged by ash.  Thus,
the Air Force will vacate Clark at the expiration of the existing lease on
September 16, 1992.  But the US considered Subic Naval Base with its
strategically important deep-water port worth the cost of rehabilitation.
In fact, the Pinatubo disaster put new urgency into the talks that have
dragged on for 14 months.  Chief negotiator Richard Armitage's
bargaining position was substantially enhanced by the dire economic
circumstances in the Philippines, and by the growing congressional
opposition to any continued military presence on the islands when the US
is shuttering dozens of installations at home.  The two sides reached
agreement this week on a new lease for Subic, which carries a 10-year
term and provides for US$400-500 million in cash and in-kind
compensation divided about equally.  This will provide the economy with
urgently needed relief, although the treaty will face stiff opposition in the
Philippine Senate, where approval by a two-thirds vote is required.

The poor political and economic fundamentals explain the collapse of the
Manila Composite to 990 points on July 12 from 1,554 two weeks ago.
Curiously, the peso regrouped from a brief slide to appreciate by 16
centavos to P27.59/US$ in official dealing and by 42 centavos to
US$27.55 in parallel activity -- unsustainable strength in both cases.

INDIA

ECONOMIC reforms have been coming from the new Congress
government of PM Narasimha Rao at such a furious pace that no one is
quite able to figure out their impact on the economy or on specific
industries.  Over the past three weeks, the government has:

* devalued the rupee by around 18% against a basket of currencies and
promised to make the rupee a convertible currency in three to five years'
time;

* overhauled the export policy regime;

* raised bank lending rates; and

* presented a railways budget that makes a determined effort to put
industry finances on a firm footing.

And the most dramatic moves are yet to come.  The government is
drafting a new industrial policy that promises to push deregulation well
beyond previous expectations, and its new budget is expected to narrow
the federal deficit, slash a range of subsidies and launch privatizations for
select public sector enterprises.

In IR's view, the significance of the rupee devaluation has been
exaggerated, and its benefits in the medium term remain unclear.  But
the government had no choice -- not so much because of IMF insistence
as a condition for new credit, but rather to shore up eroded confidence
among international bankers (which led to an almost complete
evaporation of short-term loans) and expatriate Indians (who made heavy
withdrawals from foreign currency deposits held in Indian banks).  At
the pace of deterioration on the eve of devaluation, the country's FX
reserves of R25 billion, equivalent to just two weeks' import cover,
would have run out in three days.  The initial steep devaluation of the
rupee was a dramatic gesture intended to send a message that the new
government was determined to restore economic and fiscal order and
serious about carrying out IMF-approved reforms.  The strategy appears
to have worked -- at least for now.  The run on overseas Indian deposits
has ceased, both because of renewed confidence in the government and
because a devalued rupee implies higher returns for expatriates in rupee
terms.

The long-term implications of rupee devaluation for the balance of
payments, however, are unclear.  The 1966 devaluation of the rupee
failed in the short run because of production constraints caused by
drought, though it did tend to narrow the trade gap over the longer term.
In the 1970s and 1980s, however, the steady decline of the rupee, while
leading to an acceleration of exports, failed to narrow the trade gap as
imports also grew rapidly.  Given that India's export mix remains
heavily weighted toward relatively price-inelastic commodities,
devaluation by itself will not have a major impact on the trade balance
in the near term -- but combined with the entire reform package
proposed, it could make a difference.  The real breakthrough so far has
been the new trade policy, which scraps the vexatious system of
government-issued import licenses with a streamlined system for license
issuance based on export performance (exporters will receive Exim scrips
valued at up to 30% of exports, which will be freely traded).  The
reform eliminates procedural delays and diminishes opportunities for
bureaucratic corruption; more important, it links imports to export
performance -- a definite incentive to manufacturers to step up export
capability.  Import-dependent industries (such as computers and
consumer electronics) will obviously be hit hard, while exporters of
goods with minimal import content (such as various agribusinesses) will
reap windfall profits by selling off Exim scrips they earn but do not
require.  The new trade policy also eliminates cash subsidies for
exporters (the devaluation of 18% should be adequate incentive for
competitive exporters, while uncompetitive exports will cease), saving
the government R40 billion per fiscal year -- a move that will go a long
way toward bridging this year's budget deficit.

Bank lending interest rates have been raised to a minimum of 18% from
the existing 17%, with banks free as before to fix rates over the
minimum.  A move to increase long-term interest rates was announced
earlier.  The moves are intended partly to rein in excess demand in the
economy, but also to answer persistent demands for pricing scarce capital
more realistically.

Rationalization is also the central theme behind railway rate reform, with
both freight and passenger fares hiked to yield a projected budget
surplus.  Market borrowings by the railways will be increased in
accordance with the principle that reliance on budgetary allocations must
diminish, which partly explains the move to reduce subsidies for
passenger travel.

US DOLLAR

The G7 went into the London economic summit with lofty expectations.
Depending on who was talking, these included a pledge to revitalize the
stalled Uruguay round of GATT, improve the coordination of economic
policy, provide debt relief for Third World countries, step up the war on
drugs and money-laundering, draft a plan for environmental protection,
and in general promote sustained economic recovery and price stability
for all.  The formal emphasis on economic issues notwithstanding, the
most important item on the agenda was clearly Mikhail Gorbachev.  In
short, the seven heads of state aimed to do nothing less than manufacture
perestroika on a global scale.

The flurry of communiques issued at the conclusion of the summit
declared substantial progress on all counts.  In fact though, the talks did
little more than confirm that the Seven are not prepared to abandon their
parochial interests for the collective good.  The US expansion is on
track, the economic slowdown in continental Europe and Japan will
continue, the collapsing economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union will collapse further -- despite the best efforts of the august group.
As expected, Bonn eloquently represented Moscow's case for buckets of
Western cash, which was vigorously resisted by Washington and Tokyo.
In the event, the opposing sides compromised and agreed to provide
plenty of moral support for the beleaguered Kremlin leader but no
bailout -- again, as expected.

None of this should have come as a surprise.  On the contrary, the
outcome was virtually preordained and reflects the nettlesome economic,
political and social problems that each of the Seven faces at home.
Japan's Toshiki Kaifu arrived in London somewhat humbled by the
brokerage scandal in Tokyo and revelations that Japanese firms illegally
supplied military hardware to Iraq.  But the others also came with
forgettable baggage, and almost no one could escape responsibility for
the embarrassing BCCI affair.

For the foreign exchanges, the significance is that the solid consensus
that led to the Plaza and Louvre accords no longer exists.  Thus, the
dollar will dance to the tune played in the markets, with little regard to
the preferences of the authorities.  From IR's perspective, the road for
the dollar is clearly up.  Readers are well acquainted with the reasons,
which in brief review focus on the favorable economic and political
fundamentals for the US, particularly when compared with Germany.

The recent statistics indicate further improvement at American factories
and reveal signs of life in the moribund housing market.  Even the
dismal auto industry appears to have rebounded modestly.  At the same
time, both wholesale and retail inflation remain under control (an
unsustainable jump in renter and homeowner costs was responsible for
the 0.4% rise in the core CPI for June).  Granted the rosy outlook
should not be exaggerated -- the unexpected 0.2% decline in retail sales
last month confirms that consumers are not prepared to embark on a
spending binge, and the decline in the personal savings rate to 3.6% in
May suggests that they may not be able to.  But there is no doubt that
the business cycle in the US is ahead of much of the industrialized
world.

Thus, IR is confident of the dollar's longer-term direction, even though
daily and weekly volatility will remain high.  This past week was no
exception.  After trading more quietly in early July, a riot broke out on
July 12, as a pair of weak US statistics combined with a sharp response
from the authorities to send the dollar plummeting from DM1.8410 to a
low of DM1.7850 in a matter of hours.  The repeated bouts of concerted
intervention -- by 15 central banks, including the Fed and Bundesbank
--  reflected truly masterful timing that forced the FX markets into a
defensive mode ahead of the London meeting.  Although no one will
admit as much, the Fed's participation was obviously part of a G7 pact:
The Bundesbank's Poehl agreed to delay tightening at the July 11 council
meeting in exchange for Alan Greenspan's support for a coordinated
attack.

IR's advice all along has been to take advantage of dips to buy cheaply
--  and the markets seem to have the same idea.  Indeed, the dollar was
consistently supported at key levels above DM1.78.  Even the latest
selloff on July 18 linked to the May merchandise trade report (both
exports and imports declined, a sign of weak demand at home and
abroad) failed to inflict the fatal blow.  The greenback was easily beaten
through the critical DM1.7770 area to a low above DM1.7650, but both
the corporates and the dealers stepped in to bid it up to safer levels.  In
our view, the dollar will continue to run on a treadmill until participants
see compelling reasons for a break into a new range.  Thus, we prefer
to believe that current prices are close to an effective bottom.

GERMAN MARK

A BOXING MATCH is in progress.  In one corner, the technicals are
pummeling the dollar lower.  On July 18, the unit broke through support
at DM1.7840 and the more important DM1.7770 level and tumbled an
additional 120 points before regaining its footing.  In the other corner,
the fundamentals have thrown the favorable US economic statistics into
the ring to defend their case for a higher dollar.  The technical analysis
is as follows: We have witnessed a correction after the (halting) rally
from DM1.6900 to DM1.8425.  On this current dollar downtrend, the
support levels are DM1.7850 (already vanquished) and DM1.7650
(dangerously close).  Beyond that lie DM1.7550 and DM1.7480.  As the
theory goes, a break of DM1.7650 heralds a collapse to DM1.6900.
This may look convincing on the charts, but we see little fundamental
justification for a significant dollar correction.  Indeed, the recent
appearance of corporate demand for dollars indicates skepticism among
longer-term participants with the bearish astrology.  In addition, while
the central banks have succeeded admirably in setting up the markets, we
doubt that their strategy is to sell the dollar down to DM1.70.  Thus, we
will operate in a DM1.7550-1.8150 range over the forecast horizon.

JAPANESE YEN

THE CONCERTED central bank defense of the DM on July 12 cost the
yen heavily on the cross, which climbed from Y75.50/DM ahead of the
intervention to test key resistance at Y76.90.  Since then, it has ranged
mostly between Y76.00-76.60 in trendless trading.  The yen broke out
of its narrow range against the dollar and soared 300 points to a high of
Y136.05 during that furious Friday morning.  But in the meantime it has
retreated to Y137.50, and thus we look for it to remain inside of
Y136-139 over the next two weeks.  IR's expectation that the
dollar/mark is near bottom implies that the DM/Y is approaching its top
-- a reversal of the scenario from last week.  Our success with the cross
extends the record to four straight weeks (which will more than pay for
stopping out of the short DM/SF position).  Most recently, readers
bought DM for half at Y75.85 and soon took profit at Y76.85.  Next
week, we suggest selling the cross for 50% at current levels around
Y77.20 with the expectation of again taking 100 points of profit.

We should point out however that there is considerable disagreement
about the outlook.  For example, we hear that Japanese commercial
banks plan to raise substantial amounts of subordinated loans from life
insurance companies.  To increase lending domestically, life insurers
may reduce overseas investment and perhaps even repatriate foreign
funds.  The effect will be to reduce the demand for dollars and other
currencies.  The markets also know that if the yen strengthens -- against
the dollar or EMS bloc -- the insurance companies may need to purchase
yen to hedge their foreign investments.

STERLING

THE MARKETS ignored the 50-bp cut in base rates engineered by the
Bank of England on July 12.  In fact, the pound actually firmed
marginally on the cross to a high of DM2.9631/STG, and currently
appears firm about one pfennig below.  Technicians now see good
support at DM2.95, compared with previous support at
DM2.9350-2.9400.  The markets are also bullish the pound against the
dollar.  One source close to the action saw a US brokerage purchase
STG200 million of US$1.7500 sterling calls on the IMM at midweek.
Nonetheless, IR remains skeptical of this currency and advises steering
clear of a continued rally.  The recent indicators on industrial output,
unemployment and unit labor costs depict continued recession and
resilient inflation pressures.  Readers are still fully short the cross at
DM2.9450 and should take profits at DM2.9180.  Look for a
US$1.6250-1.6850 range against the dollar, and be prepared for sterling
to be punished if major support 30 points under the bottom is broken.
On the yen cross, IR is still short the pound for 50% at Y226.00/STG,
and will sell for the balance at Y228.00.  We have raised the
recommended level to take profits to Y222.50.

SWISS FRANC

THIS CROSS came under additional pressure in the past week.  The
franc tested SF0.8700/DM after the Bundesbank announced that
monetary policy would not change, and has recovered only 30 points
since then.  A contributing factor was a July 17 report that the SNB will
link its currency to the ECU.  The markets interpreted this to mean that
the Swiss are abandoning their traditional ties to the restrictive policies
in Bonn -- a ridiculous assertion since this never was an expressed policy
of the SNB.  In any case, the prevailing dislike for the SF has forced us
to reconsider the near-term outlook.  IR now advises stopping out of
short DM acquired at SF0.8535 at a loss.  Immediately reverse to
purchase the cross for a half lot at current levels around SF0.8660 and
put on a quick stop-loss at SF0.8625.  Against the dollar, IR nailed the
actual range for the July 17 week -- SF1.5443-1.5942, 40 points above
prediction (although the dollar broke through the bottom during the July
18 selloff).  A test of SF1.52 is possible over the fortnight, while the
dollar should face resistance at SF1.57.

FRENCH FRANC

THE FUNDAMENTAL strength of this franc was confirmed by the June
CPI -- up 0.2% from the previous month and 3.3% from a year ago.
This brought the growth rate of French prices under the German rate
(3.5% at present) for the first time since 1973, and assures membership
in the elite group of low-inflation countries.  It also reflects the
commitment in Paris to building a strong currency through tough wage
bargaining and a refusal to follow a beggar-thy-neighbor policy of
devaluation.  Thus, IR's longer-term confidence in the FF is intact.  But
in the immediate future we cannot rule out a rise in the cross over
FF3.40/DM, in view of the softer tone in franc deposit rates linked to
recent remarks from FM Beregovoy that hint at a 25-bp cut in the CB's
intervention rate.  Consequently, we are more comfortable to square up
short DM at current levels around FF3.3930 for a modest profit of 10
points.  Over the forecast horizon, readers should sell the cross for 50%
at FF3.3975, and short for the balance at FF3.4050.  Against the dollar,
buy francs at FF6.16 and sell at FF5.95.

CANADIAN DOLLAR

THE RECESSION may be over, but IR remains skeptical and has a
receptive audience among Canadian business executives.  Indeed, many
are now raising the possibility of a double-dip recession that is also
mentioned south of the border.  At the very least, the economic recovery
will proceed from a deep hole, with little assistance from fiscal or
monetary policy.  Readers are familiar with our aversion to the high-
yielding currencies.  The Canadian dollar is a particular favorite as a
parking place for speculative Japanese capital, which has little allegiance.
Indeed, further revelations about what is billed as "Canada's Watergate"
triggered overnight selling on July 18 by three major Tokyo banks and
sent the Can$ tumbling by nearly 100 points to Can$1.1565.  Those who
have patiently held greenbacks purchased at Can$1.1470 took 70 points
of profit on the move.  IR recommends employing a similar strategy at
slightly higher levels in the weeks ahead: Buy US for half of positions
on a dip to Can$1.15 with a view to taking a full cent of profit.

AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR

THE JUNE employment report revealed a modest but unexpected drop
in the jobless rate to 9.3%, and a more moderate rate of decline in full-
time payrolls.  Canberra says -- we agree -- that Australia is slowly
emerging from an unusually deep recession, and surveys of business
expectations point to the same conclusion.  However, we are less
optimistic about the pace and strength of the recovery.  The labor market
in particular will remain weak for the foreseeable future, and a further
rise in the unemployment rate toward 10% is not out of the question.  In
fact, the Treasury forecasts a peak rate of 10.75%.  That seems unduly
pessimistic, but may help to explain the prevailing expectation for an
additional 50-bp reduction in official cash rates to 10% next month.  The
market is tipping at a credit easing to accompany the second quarter
reports on consumer prices on August 7 or the national accounts on
August 15.  This could cut short the Aussie dollar's stubborn rally to a
high of US$0.7767 this week.  In fact, the unit slid 40 points on July 17
amid rumors (quickly denied) that the RBA had sold the A$ around
US$0.7750.  True or not, the reaction indicates that dealers have little
confidence in holding long Aussie positions.  IR expects to take 100
points of profit on short A$ acquired at US$0.7600, but now advises
laying a stop at US$0.7810 to protect against an unlikely bounce.

OVERVIEW

CONVERGENCE WAS THE KEY to profits in European bond markets
as this year began, and until recently inflation and interest rates appeared
to be trending toward Germany's more desirable levels.  FX risk aside,
this partly explains why, in the first half of 1991, Spanish bonds
outperformed all other major government instruments with a local-
currency total return of 13.9%.  But now that the drop in inflation has
stalled in Spain and Italy -- the other high-yielder -- high nominal returns
no longer suffice.  Meanwhile, inflation in Germany has crept up to
3.5% and looks headed over 4%, pulling up the anchor of European
convergence.  With German bond yields on the rise and the Bundesbank
expected to hike its central rates when its leadership returns from
holiday, some observers see pressure on yields in other major
government securities markets.

A case in point is France, where inflation, now at an annual 3.3% rate,
is below Germany's for the first time since 1973.  Finance Minister
Pierre Beregovoy makes no bones about wanting to cut interest rates,
much to the dismay of analysts who point to a vulnerable exchange rate
and inevitable German tightening.  Yet the French market, bolstered by
an influx of capital fleeing Bunds, has shown some willingness to bring
down yields.  The lesson from this is that convergence, which took its
compass bearings from Germany, is off for the moment, although it
might be going too far to say divergence is now the rule.  Still, in
months to come, markets with sound fundamentals will pave their own
road while Germany struggles down the reunification path.  German rates
are pushing to attractive levels, but unfurling risk in Frankfurt makes the
50-bp premium offered by French OATs even more attractive and gives
Beregovoy leeway to push down rates regardless of the BB's intentions.

UNITED STATES

TREASURIES saw both extremes over the past week.  Investors were
alternately encouraged by retreating producer prices and weak retail
sales, and discouraged by unexpectedly high June consumer inflation and
housing starts.  The latter figures carried more weight.  The 5.2% gain
in housing starts built the case for a durable -- if not necessarily dynamic
-- recovery, while the rise in consumer prices disappointed bulls who
pointed to the textbook tendency of inflation to slow in the wake of a
recession.  However, economists are learning that the 1990-91 recession
is following an unpublished textbook, much to the chagrin of participants
who loaded up on long maturities.  Other factors contributed to the
uncertain bond outlook.  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan launched his
twice-yearly testimony to Congress on the economy.  His message was
mixed in its implications for the Treasuries market: Despite compelling
signs of recovery, the central bank looks for meaningful progress on
inflation.  But that was before the July 17 release of consumer prices --
up just 0.2% overall, but with core (excluding energy and food) prices
up 0.4%.  Bond investors took that as an indication that inflationary
pressures have not been purged by the recession and continue to threaten
real returns.  That, taken with the housing starts data, sparked selling
and markdowns to push the key 30-year bond yield to 8.49% on July 17,
from 8.43% on July 12 after the PPI release.

A rise in applications for jobless benefits on July 18 did not appear to
break the recent trend of improvement in the labor market, and thus was
of little help.  During the July 18 session the long bond yield improved
slightly to 8.47%, but the upward bias remains.  With the June inflation
figures behind it, the market has begun to focus on issues of supply.  In
the week ahead participants face the sale of US$12.5 billion in two-year
notes and US$9.25 billion in five-year notes.  But of greater concern is
the August quarterly refunding operation, which has been estimated at
US$37.5 billion, another record.  Specific figures on the refunding are
to be released July 31 -- which could accelerate sales and markdowns to
push the key yield toward the 8.60% level.  Over the shorter term,
however, the market could well manage to hold within the range pivoting
around 8.50% on grounds that the jury is still out about the strength of
the recovery.  It may also reconsider the CPI data, which suffered from
some one-off influences.  There has been some idle talk of another Fed
easing, but this seems improbable in view of the encouraging indicators
and the bond market's resilient inflation jitters.  "Watchful waiting," in
Greenspan's artful phrasing, speaks volumes, which makes intermediate
maturities -- twos to fives -- the place to be.

JAPAN

TOKYO BOND ACTIVITY was not reinvigorated by the return of the
Big Four securities houses to full trading after their slap-on-the-wrist,
four-day suspension for unethical dealings.  Indeed, IR wonders if there
is anything capable of shaking the Japanese government bond market out
of its torpor.  The recent half-point cut in the official discount rate has
been absorbed without significant benefit to bonds.  It would not surprise
us if the Bank of Japan were to give the markets another 50-bp cut in the
discount rate by the end of this quarter (sooner if the Nikkei plunges
below 22,000).  But that cannot be counted upon and the market may be
obliged to bide its time and await further indications of a decelerating
economy, better price data and restoration of a positive yield curve.  In
the meantime, bonds may do worse before they do better.

We have seen reports that Japanese banks, under pressure to defend their
capital ratios eroded by the Nikkei's recent declines, intend to sell off as
much as 30% of their bond holdings this year and next.  But a fall in
money market rates could bolster the Nikkei and convince Japanese life
insurers to shift from cash and short-term instruments into bonds, in
expectation of a rally later this year assisted by a relatively strong yen.
But until the CB moves to cut the ODR from its present 5.5% level,
there will be little interest for participants to increase exposure in
Japanese bonds.  The money market reveals no expectation of an
imminent cut, with the key unsecured overnight call rate trading around
7.50% and the three-month CD changing hands at 7.60-7.65%.  Those
rates still figure very favorably with the benchmark 10-year government
bond yield, which on July 18 stood at 6.74% after 6.78% a week earlier.
IR expects little progress in the week ahead.

GERMANY

ALTHOUGH the London economic summit lightened the burden on
Bunds of a Soviet economic debacle, the investment climate in Germany
itself continued to deteriorate.  While Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Finance Minister Theo Waigel were urging the rescue of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika program, their opposition at home was
on the offensive.  An SPD leader scoffed at Waigel's estimate of a
DM140 billion public sector deficit this year, claiming it would amount
to some DM202.1 billion; Rudi Walther, head of the Bundestag's budget
committee, said rising deficits were having devastating financial effects.
Later the FM acknowledged a rise to DM156 billion, after which
Deutsche Bank chief economist Norbert Walter forecast what the markets
already know: The Bundesbank will have to raise interest rates later this
year.  Despite this, the bond market held its own during the issuance of
DM2.39 billion one- and two-year zero-coupon notes.  They went down
at average yields of 9.20% (with a tail to 9.28%) and 9.18%,
respectively.  The benchmark 10-year federal bond closed on July 17 at
a yield of 8.59%, continuing a steady advance in the week.

Market sentiment took a turn for the worse the next day, ironically just
as the DM continued its rally against the dollar, on the basis of the July
monthly report of the Bundesbank and the US trade report.  The CB said
the price climate was worsening considerably even before the tax hike
was implemented this month.  Private economists see the cost of living
surging to 4.2-4.3% in July compared with 3.5% in June, and the central
bank's policy-making council is not expected to respond by raising rates
before August 15.  While this inflationary surge was expected, the
revised PSBR projection has conjured up images of a tidal wave of new
supply, further depressing prices and driving up yields.  On July 18 the
key 8 3/8% 10-year government bond yielded 8.66% as the futures
contract crashed through support levels; market operators are looking for
buying interest only at 8.75%.  In the current climate, IR expects Bunds
to quickly reach that target -- at which investors may wish to begin
cautiously acquiring government paper.

UNITED KINGDOM

AS IR EXPECTED, the Bank of England cut the base lending rate by 50
bp to 11% on July 12, even though the RPI figures released by the CSO
were above forecast.  Retail inflation remained at a 12-month rate of
5.8% in June, the same as in May, due mainly to seasonal rises in food
prices.  Excluding mortgage payments, the rate rose to 6.9% from 6.6%.
Gilt investors decided things were as good as they would be for a while
and began to lighten up, with many shifting funds to the French
government bond market.  But there was more erosion at the front end
than in long maturities, given the strong fundamentals at the far end.
Supply concerns are an additional factor.  On July 12 the BoE said it will
issue STG500 million in paper in tranches of 12% and 9.5% stock due
1998 and 2005, respectively.  Though well received, that contributed to
the market's more tenuous tone.

However, it's premature to say that the gilts rally is over.  Exchequer
Norman Lamont said at the summit that while he looks for a second half
recovery, it has not yet begun.  On July 18 the market received a battery
of economic data that was relatively bullish for bonds.  Unemployment
rose to 8.1% in June from 7.9% in May and industrial production fell
by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in May after a 2.7% fall in April.  While
the figures cast doubt on predictions of a double-dip recession, they do
indicate that the first dip is not over.  Thus, gilts will probably progress
further.  On July 18 the benchmark 10% gilt maturing in February 2001
yielded 10.27%, compared with 10.20% after the rate cut on July 12 and
10.26% a week earlier.  The longer-dated 11 3/4% of 2003 yielded
10.22% against 10.27% a week before,   and the 12% coupon of 2017
yielded 9.97% after  10.02%.  IR sees continued declines in yields in the
weeks ahead, although progress on the short end will depend on
expectations for additional credit easing.  But with elections apparently
delayed until 1992 and inflation now stalled, the next cut is unlikely to
come until late in the summer.

OTHER MARKETS

French bonds were well bid this week on June's 3.3% inflation rate.
There was some disappointment on July 16, when the Bank of France
left its intervention rate at 9% in a tender operation, which may be
linked to official concern that the franc might suffer.  But a 25-bp cut --
the same as the last, in March -- is being discounted with inflation seen
at 2.8% by yearend.  Still, foreign investors remain wary of the policies
of Socialist PM Edith Cresson.  Securities prices rose in the week as
Beregovoy said low inflation would boost the franc and allow rate cuts.
Yields fell 12-14 bp at an auction of two- and five-year notes on July 17,
but the next day players balked at a large FF11 billion note tender.
However, support levels held and prices looked firm.  The benchmark
9.5% 10-year bond finished at 9.14%, up three bp from one week
before.  Progress is likely to be tied closely to the franc's position in the
EMS grid.  Elsewhere, Spanish yields pushed up on July 18 after
government-union talks on a proposed wage and productivity pact broke
down.  The yield at a tender of one-year bills rose to 12.04% from
11.73% at the last such tender.  Economy Minister Carlos Solchaga
warned of tighter fiscal policy and higher interest rates in answer to
inflation, which is stubbornly holding around 6%.  Failure of the wage
and productivity negotiations squelch talk that the Bank of Spain might
ease its 12.75% intervention rate.

BNI president upbeat about share offering

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 1

   JAKARTA (JP): The president of state-owned Bank Negara Indonesia
(BNI) 1946, Widigdo Sukarman, said yesterday he was confident the bank's
initial public offering (IPO) in November would be well received by
investors despite the large number of shares it had to sell.
   Widigdo said the bank, which started a "roadshow" promotion campaign
here yesterday, would take the IPO roadshow to six other cities in
Indonesia and to major financial centers in Japan, Europe and the United
States to attract investors.
   "We are confident that foreign and domestic investors will respond
positively. The potential demand for BNI shares is quite good," he told
reporters after launching the bank's roadshow program, which is to end
on Oct. 24.
   He said the bank, the country's largest commercial bank, would sell
1.08 billion new shares, or around 25 percent of its enlarged capital.
   The share prices, each with a face value of Rp 500 (20 U.S. cents),
are to be determined at the end of the roadshow. The shares are to be
sold to the public during the primary offering period between Nov. 6 and
Nov. 29.
   Widigdo hinted that the price of the bank's shares would be set at a
reasonable level even though the potential demand for the shares was
promising.
   "The bank's IPO is merely based on business factors so that we will
make a success not only on the primary market but also on the secondary
market," he said in an indirect reference to the decline of a number of
listed companies' share prices to below their IPO prices.
   He said the proceeds from the IPO would be used to boost its capital
and strengthen its short-term and long-term finance.

Assets

   BNI's total assets were valued at Rp 32.35 trillion ($13.7 billion)
on June 30 this year, with deposits amounting to Rp 17.90 trillion and
loans to Rp 20.44 trillion.
   Its pretax profit totaled Rp 198.6 billion in the first semester of
this year, or more than half of last year's pretax profit of Rp 378.7
billion.
   David Chang, the research division director of securities company PT
Vickers Ballas Tamara, said the bank, which had the widest national
network, with over 489 branches throughout the country and six overseas
branches, was projected to sell its shares at a price which offered a
price earning ratio between eight and 10 times of its 1997 profit. On
the Jakarta Stock Exchange, the banking sector's price earning ratio is
generally eight times its 1997 profits.
   "If the bank offered (the shares) at a discount, the issue is likely
to be successful because it deserves a premium over the banking sector,
given its sovereignty," he told The Jakarta Post.
   The bank is expected to raise around Rp 1 trillion from the IPO,
allowing it to strengthen its capital and improve its capital adequacy
ratio from its current level of 9.1 percent to about 12 percent, he
said.
   Chang said the bank, which is expected to maintain its loan to
deposit ratio at around 85 percent to 90 percent, would generate
sufficient funds from the IPO to support its growth over the next three
to four years.
   He projected that BNI would maintain its credit expansion rate at
about 17 percent a year for the next few years in conformity with the
central bank's low loan expansion target.
   BNI's net interest margin is likely to remain at 3.5 percent in 1997
as it compensates for the rise in its reserve requirement from 3 percent
to 5 percent next April, he said.
   On funding, Chang said the bank had an advantage over its competitors
in strengthening its retail market, given its large branch network and
its low sovereign risk. (hen)

Sukarno's daughters make peace with army officer

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 1

   JAKARTA (JP): A lawsuit for libel which was filed by two of former
president Sukarno's daughters against Armed Forces' Chief of
Sociopolitical Affairs Lt. Gen. Syarwan Hamid was settled by mediation
in court yesterday.
   The conflicting parties agreed to end the row after Syarwan
"corrected" a contentious statement that he reportedly made on Megawati
Soekarnoputri, the deposed chairperson of the Indonesian Democratic
Party (PDI), and Sukmawati Soekarnoputri last August.
   The agreement was mediated by Judge Thoyib at the East Jakarta
District Court.
   Megawati and Sukmawati filed the lawsuit, saying they were offended
by Syarwan's statement, published by Surya daily newspaper, which
accused Megawati of planning to start a rebellion along the lines of
Cory Aquino's "people's power" in the Philippines.
   In the Surya article, Syarwan was reported as saying that Sukmawati
was mobilizing her Marhaen group, a pronationalist organization of
followers of Sukarno's teachings, to help the rebellion.
   Syarwan's remarks were reportedly made during a meeting with members
of the Indonesian Ulema Council in Jakarta on Aug. 12. Surya's front
page article the following day carried the suggestive heading "Megawati
wants to become Cory Aquino: ABRI Chief of Sociopolitical Affairs".
   Megawati and Sukmawati said the remarks were slanderous and damaging
to the reputation of their father and people in general. They demanded a
public apology and Rp 50 billion in damages.
   Only Sukmawati was present in court yesterday. Syarwan and Megawati
were represented by their lawyers.
   Syarwan's lawyers Col. Imron Anwari and Major Payaman Pangaribuan
told the court that the statements regarding the two plaintiffs, printed
in Surya, "were untrue".
   This correction was deemed sufficient by the plaintiffs who
considered the case to be over, Antara reported.
   R.O. Tambunan, who represented Megawati at the hearing, told The
Jakarta Post last night that his client was not insisting on a public
apology.
   "The hearing today was open to the public and it was widely covered
by local and international press," Tambunan said, adding that the
decision "reflected Megawati's big heart".
   The case for Rp 50 billion in damages was automatically dropped.
   "We weren't after the money when we filed the lawsuit. We only wanted
to see the names of Megawati and Sukmawati restored," he said.
   He said the peace agreement resulted from a meeting of the parties'
lawyers on Sept. 17.
   "We did not drop the lawsuit. We came to an agreement," he stressed.
   Tambunan said that another lawsuit, filed by Megawati against the
Armed Forces Chief, the National Police Chief, the Minister of Home
Affairs and her foes in the PDI, would proceed.
   In this lawsuit, Megawati is demanding that the results of the
congress of her PDI foes in Medan in June be annulled. The congress,
which had the backing of the government and the military, deposed her as
the party's leader.
   This lawsuit is scheduled for this Thursday at the Central Jakarta
District Court. Efforts for an out of court settlement have failed.
   Syarwan's remarks in August came in the wake of massive riots in
Jakarta in which at least four people died.
   The July 27 riots, blamed on the leftist Democratic People's Party,
began after the violent takeover of the PDI headquarters by supporters
of Soerjadi, who ousted Megawati as the party's leader. (emb/imn)

ABRI reshuffles another hundred senior officers

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 1

   JAKARTA (JP): The Armed Forces (ABRI) announced yesterday a reshuffle
affecting more than 100 senior officers in all four services, including
the reassignment of onetime rising star Maj. Gen. A.M. Hendropriyono.
   ABRI Chief Spokesman Brig. Gen. Amir Syarifudin told Antara that
Hendro would be recalled to ABRI headquarters, pending a new assignment
in a civilian position.
   Amir did not elaborate, but Suara Pembaruan daily reported yesterday
that Hendro, currently chief of the Army Training School in Bandung,
will be given the post of secretary for development operations, a
strategic position under the supervision of the State Secretariat.
   Some military analysts said the new civilian post would end his
military career. Hendro is currently 51 years old; the mandatory
retirement age for military officers is 55 years.
   A 1967 graduate of the Military Academy, Hendro was once regarded as
one of the Army's most promising rising stars when he became the
youngest ever chief of a regional military command. He became chief of
the Jakarta Regional Military Command at the age of 48 in 1993.

Latest reshuffle

   Amir said the latest reshuffle in the military affects 108 senior
officers. As stipulated in a Sept. 16 decree by ABRI Chief Gen. Feisal
Tanjung, 52 Army officers, 24 Navy officers, 13 Air Force officers, and
19 officers of the National Police are being moved.
   Another major important change, announced Saturday, was the
replacement of the current assistant to the chief of sociopolitical
affairs, Maj. Gen. Suwarno Adiwijoyo, who is nearing the mandatory
retirement age of 55.
   He will be replaced by his deputy, Brig. Gen. Budi Harsono, who will
become the new assistant to Lt. Gen. Syarwan Hamid. Suwarno will be
recalled to the armed forces headquarters before he retires.
   The commandant of the Bandung-based Infantry Weapons Center, Maj.
Gen. Rachmad Mokoginta, is also being moved as he too is preparing for
his retirement. He will be replaced by his deputy Brig. Gen. Luhut
Panjaitan.
   Changes in the Navy include the reassignment of  Maj. Gen. (Marine)
Gafur Chalik, currently aide to the ABRI chief, to the Navy headquarters
to prepare for his retirement.
   Commodore Freddy Numberi, currently aide to the navy Chief of Staff,
will be assigned as Chief of the Fifth Sea Born Command based in Irian
Jaya, and Brig. Gen. (Marine) Benyamin Balukh, will be assigned as
deputy chief of the Armed Forces School of Command.
   In the Air Force, Rear Marshall Sadeli Kalman, chief of the Air
Force's Maintenance Division will be replaced by Commodore Syaiful
Kartimunaf.
   In the National Police, Brig. Gen. Soerpadi will be assigned as the
new director for operational education at the National Resilience
Institute, replacing Brig. Gen. I Wayan Karya. (imn)

Minister confirms art theft

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 1

   JAKARTA (JP): The government confirmed yesterday the theft of a
number of valuable Indonesian paintings from the National Museum,
including two masterpieces withdrawn Friday by international auction
house Christie's from its October sale in Singapore.
   The theft took place a month ago and was believed to involve members
of staff at the museum, according to Minister of Education and Culture
Wardiman Djojonegoro.
   He said: "The stolen paintings have been withdrawn by Christie's from
its auction house."
   It was the first official statement issued by the government since
the news of the theft, categorized as part of the national collection,
was broken by some local media late last week.
   Wardiman gave no details about the other titles or the precise number
of paintings stolen from the museum, which is under the supervision of
the minister's office.
   According to reliable sources, at least six paintings by world-
renowned Indonesian masters, such as Raden Sarief Bustaman Saleh,
better-known as Raden Saleh, Affandi and Raden Basoeki Abdullah have
been taken.
   Police records show that the theft was only reported by museum
staffer Kolam Sardjono on Sept. 12.
   However, the theft was hidden from the public by the museum until art
curators were amazed to see Christie's catalog for the Oct. 6 auction
feature two paintings by Indonesian masters previously thought to be in
the National Museum here.
   Local media first reported the theft Friday, despite no official
comment from the authorities.
   Shortly after a long meeting the same day, Christie's International
Singapore Pte. Ltd. announced that the two paintings, A Nude, completed
in 1992, by Basoeki Abdullah and Portrait of a Dutch Governor Wearing
the Willems Order, completed in 1867, by Raden Saleh, were withdrawn
from its upcoming auction.
   However, there is no further explanation about the hasty withdrawal
or the current whereabouts of the paintings.
   Minister Wardiman criticized the media for disturbing the
investigation to arrest the thieves.
   "The reports have made the investigation more difficult. That's why I
asked the press not to magnify the case," he said.
   The minister said that any dishonest museum employees might have had
a double motivation; the poor security system and their low pay.
   "The museum employees are state employees. Therefore, they have the
same level of salary earned by other state employees," said Wardiman.
   Consequently the temptation to steal the precious items could have
become stronger, he said.
   The salary of middle-rank state employees ranges from Rp 250,000 to
Rp 500,000 (US$106 to $212) per month. The price of the each painting is
hundreds of millions of rupiah.
   The National Museum, located on Jl. Medan Merdeka Barat in Central
Jakarta, has recorded a number of thefts of a wide range of national
treasure from its collection.
   National Police Chief Lt. Gen. Dibyo Widodo said Sunday in Batam
Island, Riau, that the police have questioned a number of people
regarding the recent theft of the paintings.
   The three-star general also said that the Indonesian police have
asked the local police in Singapore, through Interpol, to help
investigate the stolen paintings.
   In another related development yesterday, Minister of Tourism, Post
and Telecommunication Joop Ave called on Christie's to cooperate with
Indonesia to arrest the suspects. (bsr/icn)

IKIP Surabaya selects new rector

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   SURABAYA: The state Teachers Training Institute (IKIP) in Surabaya,
is having trouble selecting a new rector to replace Soerono
Martorahardjo.
   The three best of ten nominees for the position are said to have
flaws. Although two of them have doctorate degrees, one is said to have
been involved in corruption involving a campus development project three
years ago and one has been the target of student protests over the
expulsion of a lecturer.
   The other candidate has good leadership and academic ability but only
has an undergraduate degree (S1), said lecturers at the institute
yesterday.
   Academics at the institute doubt that he would be respected
professionally, because of his lack of experience and scientific
background.
   Suripan Sadi Hutomo, one of the three best candidates, said that the
nominees were selected on Sept. 17.
   "But the results have not been announced yet. Not even internally,"
he said.
   The institute is preparing to become a university in about three
years, when is expected to have the biggest campus in Southeast Asia.

238 arrested for timber theft

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   SURABAYA: A forest raid, code-named "Brush Operation", has resulted
in the arrest of 238 people in Jombang and Nganjuk who are suspected of
stealing 600 cubic meters of teakwood from surrounding forests.
   "We expect that court hearings will be held soon to try all the
suspects, some of which are members of the Armed Forces (ABRI),"
Marsanto, a provincial government official in charge of security,
agrarian and public affairs, said yesterday.
   According to Antara, the market price of illegal timber ranges
between Rp 200,000 (US$85) and Rp 300,000 a meter cubic.
   He said 850 mobile brigade officers took part in the raid in areas
prone to illegal teak wood logging, including Nganjuk, Jombang and
Madiun.
   Marsanto said the operation would be extended to cover other areas in
East Java such as Bojonegoro and Padangan.
   "More preventive measures will be taken to deter teakwood theft," he
said.
   Nganjuk regent Soetrisno said that while he supported the efforts to
eliminate teakwood theft, he criticized a recent police move to
confiscate a local official's chair which they suspected of being made
from stolen wood. (14)

Reporters demand proper probe

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   SURAKARTA, Central Java: The Yogyakarta chapter of the Indonesian
Journalists Association is considering whether to ask the National
Commission on Human Rights to investigate the death of a local reporter
here last month.
   The chairman of the association's Yogyakarta chapter, Oka
Kusumayudha, said yesterday that he would refer the case to the rights
commission if the police investigation into the murder was
unsatisfactory.
   Senior journalists have formed a fact-finding team to assist the
police. The team has submitted five bundles of reports to the
journalists association in Jakarta, Oka said.
   Fuad Muhammad Safrudin was fatally beaten in his home on Aug. 13. He
did not regain consciousness before he died in intensive care three days
later. The Bernas journalist is survived by his wife and two children.
   "If the police neglect to follow up our team's findings, we will seek
help from the National Commission on Human Rights," Oka said.
   According to Oka, the association had encouraged the police to speed
up their investigation.
   "The team works relentlessly, meticulously and professionally, after
all, they are used to searching for facts," Oka said.
   Oka added that the Chief of the Yogyakarta Police Precinct Col.
Darsono had promised a thorough and proper investigation. (har/14)

'Clear conscience inspired Frans Seda'

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): A clear conscience consistently underlined the thoughts
and actions of senior economist Frans Seda, one of the architects of the
New Order, says book editor Frans M. Parera.
   "In answering social, political and economic challenges, Frans Seda
has consistently acted with a clear conscience," Frans Parera told
reporters yesterday.
   Frans Parera headed the team which edited a soon-to-be-released book
in honor of Frans Seda's 70th birthday. The book Kekuasaan dan Moral
(Power and Morality) is to be launched on Oct. 6.
   In connection with his birthday, a seminar will be held on Sept. 26
to review the political economy of Indonesia during the 1966 to 1970
period, Frans Parera was reported by Antara as saying. The seminar is to
be held at the Catholic Atmajaya University in Jakarta.
   Frans Parera described Frans Seda as a "three-generation statesman"
and a "professional politician" because of his lengthy experience and
his rational way of examining the state administration.
   He kept his distance from religious and ethnic organizations for the
sake of establishing a united, harmonious nation, Frans Parera said.
   "In his thoughts and writing, Frans Seda constantly tries to define
power amid changes with time," he said.
   Frans Seda has always been critical of inconsistencies in the state
administration, he added.
   Frans Seda was born in Maumere, Flores, on Oct. 4, 1926.
   He was a member of a team of economic advisors to President Soeharto
in the early years of the New Order administration. He served as the
minister of plantations from 1964 to 1966 and as the minister of
agriculture in 1966 under President Sukarno. He was finance minister
from 1966 to 1968 and minister of transportation from 1968 to 1973 under
President Soeharto. (emb)

Legislator deplores PDI candidate list

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): A legislator criticized the government yesterday for
accepting the election candidate list from the rift-ridden Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI), saying that the list breached the electoral law.
   A.A. Oka Mahendra, a member of House Commission II for home affairs,
said in a hearing with Minister of Home Affairs Yogie S.M. that the PDI
had listed 903 legislative candidates although the law allowed 850 to be
listed.
   Oka said the electoral law stated that the number of legislative
candidates that a contesting group could propose was twice the number of
contested seats in the House.
   Next year, Golkar, the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) and the
United Development Party (PPP) will contest 425 seats in the 500-seat
House of Representatives. The remaining 75 seats are reserved for the
Armed Forces.
   Golkar and PPP have each submitted 850 names of legislative
candidates to the National Elections Institute.
   "Accepting a list with more than 850 candidates is against the law,"
said Oka, a House member from the ruling Golkar organization.
   Yogie, who is also chairman of the National Elections Institute, did
not answer Oka's objection. Yogie responded by saying that the electoral
law should be properly abided by.
   Separately, the secretary-general of the national elections
institute, Suryatna Subrata, said the institute would return the
proposed list to the PDI central board.
   "The PDI central board has to revise the list and nominate a maximum
of 850 names," Suryatna told reporters after the hearing.
   Oka questioned why the government had assigned the National Council
for Defense and Security, instead of the Minister of Home Affairs, to
develop guidelines on campaigning for next year's election.
   President Soeharto has asked the National Council for Defense and
Security to draw up new guidelines for the 1997 election campaign.
   "Why should the task go to the council? Is the Home Affairs Ministry
too busy supervising the existing three political organizations to do
it?" Oka asked.
   Yogie said that next year street rallies involving huge numbers of
people would no longer be permitted because they had the potential to
disturb security and public order.
   "We should develop an electioneering system which emphasizes each
party's programs on offer to potential voters. It would be more
educational politically," he said.
   On the heating political climate in the lead-up to the 1997 general
election, Yogie said it was still within tolerable limits. (imn)

Vote-getters not needed, political scholars say

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   SEMARANG (JP): Political scholars said yesterday that the recruitment
of celebrities as vote-getters in next year's general election is an
outdated trick to attract voters.
   They said that vote-getters are effective only in uneducated
communities because on campuses and in the cities people know they need
politicians who can really defend their interests.
   Riswandha Imawan, a political scholar from Gadjah Mada University,
said that the use of vote-getters is a trick that tends to deceive the
public.
   The idea of recruiting vote-getters, he said, is to have celebrities
use their popularity rather than their political skill to attract as
many people as possible to vote for the party they represent.
   "Political studies should stop using vote-getters because it assumes
that people do not have enough of a grasp of the political games in
Indonesia," Riswandha said.
   "As Indonesians are increasingly educated, the vote-getting system
should be stopped," he said.
   The three political organizations: Golkar, the United Development
Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), will compete for
425 seats in the House of Representatives in next year's general
election.
   While the PDI and PPP do not have well-known figures in their front
lines, Golkar made headlines for recruiting king of dangdut music Rhoma
Irama, soap opera star Rano Karno and shadow puppet master Ki Anom
Suroto -- to name a few -- to attract voters.
   Golkar hopes to increase its domination in the House from its current
282 seats to at least 299. It wants to recapture the 16 seats it lost to
the PDI and one to the PPP in the 1992 election.
   Golkar has promised the much coveted seats to the popular
personalities.
   "Educated people will certainly ask why political organizations put
celebrities higher on their list of prospective House members than
professional politicians," said political observer Susilo Utomo from
Diponegoro University.
   "If it later turns out that the celebrities fail to defend the
public's interests as they promise during election campaigns, people
will feel cheated," he added.
   MT Arifin, rector of Surakarta Muhammadiyah University, has proposed
that political organizations stop recruiting vote-getters because their
political ability is questionable.
   He argued that those representing the people in the House should be
people who are well-versed in politics and have the courage to defend
average people, not just their peers.
   "The vote-getting system should be stopped if Indonesia wants to see
democracy flourish," he said. (har/pan)

Internal dispute among labor exporters drags on

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): The row in the Association of Labor Export Companies
(Apjati) heightened yesterday with the government-backed leader
threatening to take his opponents to court unless they surrendered the
funds belonging to the association.
   Abdullah Puteh, the chairman of the government-backed executive
board, demanded the old board to surrender the association's bank
accounts and their books peacefully, or face a court order.
   He said he has asked banks to freeze the association's accounts,
which are still controlled by members of the old board.
   He did not give an estimate of the amount involved.
   "You figure it out yourself. Each member paid a membership fee of Rp
5 million (US$2,127) and workers have to pay Rp 20,000 each," Puteh told
reporters after he met with Minister of Manpower Abdullah Latief, who is
also the association's patron.
   Puteh, a politician of the ruling political group Golkar, was elected
as Apjati chairman in a congress attended by 111 of the association's
128 members last week. The congress was boycotted by members of the old
executive board, headed by Mahfudz Djaelani, who called the event
"unconstitutional".
   The industry has continually been beset by politicking by companies
amidst pressure from the government to restrict the number of companies
in what is regarded as a lucrative business.
   Apjati was established in May last year at the urging of the
government to instill some order in the industry. Lack of
professionalism among workers' exporting companies has been blamed for
some of the problems facing many Indonesian workers overseas.
   One of the tasks of the association was to run basic training courses
for Indonesians before they were sent abroad.
   Puteh said that during the meeting, Latief asked the association to
be run more professionally, and that its finances should be made
transparent.
   He promised that under his leadership, he would submit a financial
report every three months to members and the minister. "I have no
problem about transparency," he said.
   Anton Sihombing, secretary-general of the new board, disclosed that
the board plans to "borrow" between Rp 2 million and Rp 3 million from
each member to finance the association's activities.
   But the fees charged on workers sent abroad would be scrapped, he
said.
   The new board will be working out of an office at the Persada
Executive Club in Halim Perdanakusuma, East Jakarta, and not from the
GKBI building, the secretariat of the old board. (ste)

'Hairy pollution crisis in Lampung'

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): Air pollution in the Lampung capital of Bandar Lampung
is so heavy that residents' hair is contaminated with industrial waste,
notably cadmium, an academic said yesterday.
   In her speech commemorating Lampung University's 31st anniversary,
Ida Farida Rivai said that her recent study on pollution in the city
proved that there was a direct relationship between intensive
industrialization and population concentration causing increased levels
of environmental contamination in cities.
   Ida, a chemistry expert, said that toxic industrial waste included
gas emissions from motorized vehicles and smoke and gases from
factories.
   Perpetual accumulation of heavy metal compounds such as cadmium, lead
and mercury is hazardous to humans, Ida, who graduated from the Gunma
University of Japan, said.
   Prolonged exposure to mercury destroys the nervous system, cadmium
diminishes the kidney's function and lead can cause lung cancer, she
said.
   Ida, the founder of the science department at the university, said
that chemical contamination and poisoning from industrial waste cannot
be minimized by rejecting industrialization.
   "Perhaps preventative measures and control can be socialized and
managed in a wiser manner," she said.
   Ida also encouraged chemists and biologists to undertake more
research on toxic waste by-products which are inadvertently consumed by
the public.
   "A thorough understanding of environmental toxicology is one way of
improving the quality human resources. It is futile to tell people of
the danger without providing a solution or telling them how to prevent
the danger," Ida said. (14)

NGOs demand controls on land ownership

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): A group of non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
yesterday renewed their long-held demand for a government regulation to
limit the size of land ownership across the country.
   On the eve of the 26th anniversary of the Land Reforms Law, the
Consortium of Agrarian Reforms said the 1960 legislation has not been
fully upheld, particularly on the question of limiting land ownership.
   The 1960 law recognizes the need to limit land acquisition to ensure
justice and recognizes the rights of indigenous people over land, said
consortium chairman Noer Fauzi Rachman.
   But the implementation has not lived up to the spirit of the law,
Noer said. "The 'social function' of the land as recognized by the law
has, in practice, become the 'business function.'"
   The 1960 Land Reforms Law was seen as a piece of landmark legislation
in the quest for justice in predominantly rural Indonesia. The
anniversary is marked each year either with a seminar or other
activities.
   Noer, whose consortium was founded two years ago by 65 NGOs to
educate people about their land rights, said the massive buying of land
is taking Indonesia back to the Dutch colonial era when plantation
owners were allowed to possess massive land tracts.
   Now more than 64 million hectares of land in the country are owned by
20 business groups, he said. Most of the land bought had been recognized
by customary laws as being owned by the indigenous people.
   Noer criticized State Minister of Agrarian Affairs/Chairman of the
National Land Agency Soni Harsono for saying over the weekend that
preserving customary laws would be a "step backward".
   Speaking in Yogyakarta, Soni, as reported by Antara, said customary
laws regarding land ownership would disappear as Indonesia develops
further.
   With the trend toward individual land ownership, these customary laws
would eventually die a natural death, he was quoted as saying. He said
the government will continue to respect customary laws, but will not
help preserve them.
   The government marks the anniversary of the 1960 law more quietly
because the legislation was often associated with the Indonesian
Communist Party (PKI). The party, banned since 1966, politicized the
1960 law, turning it into a tool to force land redistribution.
   Noer shared the view that the 1960 law has been mistakenly considered
as communist-sponsored legislation.
   "The content of the law was actually prepared by land experts from
Gadjah Mada University of Yogyakarta," he said.
   He said the unfortunate association with the PKI is one of the
reasons why reforms have been slow and why massive land buying continues
unchecked.
   Many timber estates, oil palm plantations and the pulp industry have
been built on vast forest tracts that were originally part of the local
people's customary land, he said.
   "The government has often labeled the indigenous people as 'forest
wanderers', but really they are people who inhabit the forest and live
by cultivating it," Noer said. (16)

7-day cruise to Banda Islands

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): A new seven-day cruise to the Banda islands, known as
the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, will operate for the first time to
coincide with the island's annual Kora Kora boat race from Nov. 12 to
Nov. 19.
   Sailing on the Modern Group's Awani Dream, the tour will cast off
from Bali's Benoa harbor on Nov. 12 and will call first at Komodo
island. On Nov. 15, the ship will arrive in Bandaneira and be greeted by
dozens of Kora Kora boats, which will escort the ship to the quay.
   "The Kora Kora boats symbolize the heroism of Banda's natives as the
boats were used in the defense of Banda against the colonists," State
Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs Hayono Isman says. (ste)

Medication too pricey for 50% of TB sufferers

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 2

   JAKARTA (JP): About 50 percent of the 500,000 Indonesians taking
medication for their tuberculosis (TB) stop half-way through the course
of treatment because they are too poor to continue it, a health activist
said yesterday.
   Chairwoman of the Indonesian Foundation for Tuberculosis Eradication
Mrs. Soepardjo Rustam said that the price of the second round of
medication is more expensive than the first.
   TB can be cured within six months, she said, but many sufferers who
undergo medical treatment fail to complete the entire process; some
because they are too poor, others because they think they have already
recovered the moment they stop coughing.
   "Consequently, they have to repeat the medication," she said after
meeting with President Soeharto.
   Community health centers can ask for free TB medicine from the
association for poor patients," Mrs. Soepardjo, wife of the late
coordinating minister for people's welfare, said.
   According to her, TB bacteria can be found everywhere and people who
are physically or mentally tired are particularly prone to contracting
the disease.
   She said her foundation offers Rp 80,000 (US$34) in transport costs
to all TB patient who are too poor to go to the nearest health center
for further medication.
   She said that there are currently about 500,000 Indonesians suffering
from contagious TB and guessed that there are about 500,000 others who
have not reported their illness.
   In 1993 the World Health Organization estimated that 1.9 billion
people, or one in every three worldwide, are infected with the disease.
In the next decade, 300 million more people will become infected, 90
million people will develop the disease, and 30 million people will die
of it, according to the organization's research. (ste)

Public participation in crime prevention sought

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): Jakarta Police Chief Maj. Gen. Hamami Nata called on
the public yesterday to join the battle against crime in the city.
   "Caring about others' fate should be developed to build togetherness
to fight crime," the two-star general said in a weekly ceremony at the
headquarters prior to handing over rewards to a number of police
personnel and civilians.
   "Discard the ego which has become the trademark of metropolitan
people," said Hamami.
   "Should we let a person become a victim of a crime, we could be the
next victim," he said.
   That's why, he said, active public participation in fighting crime is
absolutely necessary.
   "The limited number of Jakarta police personnel and a shortage of
equipment required for their operations could be compensated by public
cooperation in making the city secure," said Hamami.
   Shortly after the ceremony, the police chief handed rewards, in the
form of certificates and cash, to three security guards for their
outstanding efforts in fighting crime.
   Among the three were M. Dasri, 66, a security guard at the residence
of Egyptian Ambassador Mahmoed Mohamed Osman in Menteng, Central
Jakarta.
   Dasri lost two fingers and suffered a serious head wound last week
fight when he struggled with at least five criminals in the
neighborhood.
   On behalf of the police force, Hamami handed Dasri Rp 500,000
(US$212.80) in recognition of his performance.
   "I really appreciate the present, which I can use for my medical
treatment which so far has cost me Rp 400,000," said Dasri.
   "The police gift means a lot to me and my family because I have
received nothing from my employer," continued Dasri, who works for Rp
140,000 per month.
   A reader of The Jakarta Post also presented Dasri with Rp 250,000 to
help with his medical expenses.
   Besides Dasri, Hamami also presented Rp 100,000 to two other security
guards, Mat Sani, 26, and Pulung Mahmudin, 30, for their roles in
stopping a group of burglars in front of the BCA bank in Penjaringan,
North Jakarta, in June.
   Hamami also presented cloth to 41 police officers, who were
considered meritorious but unable to buy new uniforms while they awaited
uniform distribution from the National Police headquarters.
   The police chief then gave rewards to nine police officers who
participated in the recent national sports games and collected medals.
   Each of the nine officers received a certificate and Rp 750,000 in
cash. (bsr)

   JAKARTA (JP): A road construction worker has been crushed to death by
a steamroller driven by a friend in the East Parking Lot, Senayan,
Central Jakarta.
   Lasman, the victim, was asleep on the road he and his friends were
repairing early yesterday morning when his colleague Azis decided to
move the steamroller to another place.
   Azis told police that after traveling a few meters he noticed that
the steamroller was running unsmoothly. He said he thought the machine
was running over a heap of garbage or soil. He was horrified to see that
the body of Lasman, who hailed from the same town of Banyumas, Central
Java, had been broken under the steamroller's steel wheel.
   Azis screamed hysterically before other workers came, the Terbit

Sarwono hails idea to build homes on stilts

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): State Minister of Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja is
in favor of a proposal that homes in water catchment areas be built on
stilts.
   The proposal, from South Jakarta Mayor Pardjoko, was among other
suggestions to help preserve water catchment areas.
   "But the municipality should serve as an example and build its
offices on stilts" in such areas, Sarwono said.
   Locations in the mayoralty have been designated as the city's main
water catchment areas. However, given the relatively cooler climate,
they are also favorite sites for residential areas.
   Sarwono had earlier addressed a seminar, which was held by the
mayoralty, on preserving South Jakarta as a water catchment area.
   Sarwono also urged that more information be given to residents on the
need to build more water catchment wells.
   Given the decreasing amount of water catchment areas, the mayor said
houses planned for construction on plots of less than 500 square meters
should be built on stilts.
   The districts of Jagakarsa, part of Cilandak and a part of Pasar
Minggu, all in South Jakarta, are particularly designated for water
catchment areas. The current rule states that building is allowed on a
maximum of 20 percent of the plots in the districts. In order for a
building permit to be issued, a plot must be a minimum of 500 square
meters.
   A further decrease in water catchment areas in South Jakarta is also
indicated by only two remaining natural ponds, the Mangga Bolong and
Babakan ponds.
   Pardjoko, Sarwono added, could easily secure support from high-
ranking residents on policies to preserve water catchments, as "most
ministers live in South Jakarta".
   Pardjoko had also proposed that the city change rules on building
limitations in water catchment areas.
   But Pardjoko said given the increasing price of land, violations were
likely to become rampant because many residents had smaller-sized plots.
More buildings will be found without building permits, he said.
   A way out of this problem, he said, would be to make mandatory the
provision of collective areas for groundwater preservation.
   He said this was suggested six months ago to the municipality, which
is working on the idea.
   The central government or the municipality, Pardjoko said, could buy
the necessary plots from residents, but he acknowledged the source of
funds might be a problem.
   Deputy Governor for Developmental Affairs, Tb.M. Rais, said in his
address that a maximum of 35 percent, or 800 million cubic meters of
annual rainfall, enters into the ground. From this figure, he said the
city's annual groundwater potential is around 77 million cubic meters
per year.
   As the safe limit for groundwater use is up to 70 percent, or 48
million cubic meters per year, Rais reiterated warnings that the intake
has become critical. The city-owned water company, PDAM Jaya, has only
catered to 48 percent of homes in Jakarta. (anr)

Lawyers demand acquittal of client

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): The defense lawyers of a man charged with murdering the
owner of a recording studio asked the North Jakarta District Court
yesterday to acquit him of all charges.
   "Our client is accused of complicity with two other men in the murder
of the late Beng Seng," said Tommy Sihotang, the leading counsel for the
defense, "so, to prove the allegations beyond reasonable doubt whether
TP, alias Opiu, was involved in the murder, the prosecutor should have
presented the two key witnesses to testify."
   Nyo Beng Seng was killed in his mansion in Pluit, North Jakarta. Also
known as Darmansyah Sujadi, Beng Seng was the owner of a leading
recording company, PT. Irama Tara, and several massage parlors and night
clubs in Jakarta.
   The businessman was stabbed to death with a samurai sword. His death
drew much public attention because it was widely believed to have been
linked to fierce competition in the entertainment industry.
   Police believe the murder was masterminded by renowned gambler Hong
Lie, who is still at large. He denied being involved in the murder at a
press interview in Singapore last year.
   The two key witnesses, Agiono bin Syafran and Sudartono, alias Atok,
were sentenced to 20 years and 15 years imprisonment respectively in
August last year.
   Prosecutor Muhammad Yusuf told the court in earlier sessions that he
did not call the two witnesses to the trial because they were imprisoned
in Nusa Kambangan, a prison island off the coast of Central Java.
   Defense lawyer Tommy Sihotang said the prosecutor had recited the
testimonies given by the two witnesses to the police instead of hearing
the witnesses' testimonies in court.
   "Article 185(1) of the Criminal Code Procedures dictate that
witnesses' testimonies are those given in court, not those given to the
police," Tommy said.
   He then presented a letter from one of the witnesses in Nusa
Kambangan claiming that Opiu had nothing to do with the murder.
   Prosecutor Yusuf had told the court that Opiu drove Agiono to Beng
Seng's mansion on April 7, 1994, and gave him Rp 5 million (US$2,200).
He said that Agiono used the money to purchase a motorcycle on which he
escaped after the murder a week later.
   Yusuf accused Opiu, of violating Article 56 of the Criminal Code
which states that anyone who helps another party to commit a capital
crime is liable to a maximum of 15 years imprisonment.
   When asked to rebut the defense lawyers' statement, Yusuf said he
maintained his earlier sentencing demand.
   Judge Suwardi adjourned the trial for two weeks to prepare the
verdict. (26)

Clarity requested for 'public info campaign'

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): The City Council would like the municipality to explain
the effectiveness of its Rp 4 billion campaign to familiarize the public
with city regulations, deputy council speaker Ismunandar said yesterday.
   The city's public relations office reportedly questioned the deputy
speaker's request, who responded by saying that he was not singling out
any one particular office of the municipality for its fund-handling
methods.
   Councilor Romulus Sihombing of Commission D for development affairs
said last week that both the city's legal department and the public
relations office are the offices most involved in the campaign.
   City Council Speaker M.H. Ritonga earlier conveyed his impression
that many Jakartans are still in the dark about city regulations and
questioned the allocation of the Rp 4 billion (US$1.7 million).
   The city information budget for this fiscal year climbed to Rp 4.131
billion, an increase over last year's Rp 3.61. The budget includes Rp
825 million for a "public information project."
   Meanwhile, the legal department has been allocated Rp 1.07 billion to
disseminate information about recently passed legislation and current
bills.
   City public relations officer Soesilo Darmoadji recently sent a
letter to several newspapers in response to the recent queries. He said
that the funds being used in the campaign are also at the disposal of
other offices, including the Ministry of Information's branch in
Jakarta.
   "We ask for an explanation from the municipality, which could send
representatives from the public relations office to explain the use of
campaign funds to the council," Ismunandar said.
   "We would then suggest that the public relations office coordinate
the other offices which it says are also privy to the funds."
   Helmy AR Syihab, the head of Commission C for city revenues, said
that his commission will formally raise the issue when it meets with
municipality executives to discuss the city budget in October. (anr)

Defendant tells court of previous 'sin'

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   TANGERANG, West Java (JP): A 41-year-old woman standing trial for
allegedly attempting to smuggle 9,000 Ecstasy pills into Indonesia told
the Tangerang District Court yesterday that she had twice succeeded in
smuggling the drug into the country in 1993 and 1994.
   "In 1993 I managed to smuggle 200 Ecstasy pills from the Netherlands
into Indonesia through the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. The
following year I smuggled in 300 pills," ELW told the court presided
over by Judge M. Nawir.
   Motivated by her desire to make a large sum of money, the defendant
confessed that she stashed 9,000 pills in her suitcase and sports shoes
and attempted to enter the country on March 27 through Soekarno-Hatta
Airport, where she was apprehended by customs and excise officials.
   "In The Hague I bought for 10 guilder (Rp 14,000) each. I intended to
sell the pills in Jakarta for Rp 30,000 each," she said.
   She claimed that she bought the pills from someone named Sonny Luis
Lai in The Hague. She then boarded a Lufthansa flight.
   If found guilty, the defendant could be imprisoned for up to 15 years
and fined up to Rp 300 million.
   The defendant's lawyers, Nuryanto and Rusdi Sovian, earlier asked the
court to drop the charges against their client.
   According to the lawyers, Health Regulation No.23/1992 cannot be used
to convict their client.
   The lawyers argued that only institutions, professional and business
groups having expertise in public health are subject to the regulation,
not individuals.
   The defendant has no expertise in public health and had the Ecstasy
pills just because she thought the pills could make her a lot of money,
the lawyers said.
   The trial was adjourned until Monday when prosecutor Sarwono will
read his sentence appeal.
   Last Thursday the West Jakarta District Court sentenced Ng Wi Hon,
alias Awi, 56, to 10 months imprisonment after finding him guilty of
trafficking Ecstasy pills.
   The case, the first of its kind in Jakarta, followed an intensive
government campaign against the abuse of Ecstasy.
   The government has been forced to use the 1992 Health Law to
prosecute people because Ecstasy is not yet classified as a narcotic,
and therefore is not covered under the 1976 Narcotics Law. (28/bas)

Idea on Jabotabek needs clear planning: Ginandjar

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 3

   JAKARTA (JP): State Minister of National Development Planning
Ginandjar Kartasasmita says the idea to unite Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang
and Bekasi (Jabotabek) into one province under one governor of
ministerial level reflects the complicated development problems in the
area.
   Ginandjar said if the idea was accepted, the supporting systems and
all legal aspects should be thoroughly prepared.
   "The idea aired by Pak Emil (Prof. Emil Salim) mirrors his concern
about the complex problems in Jabotabek," Ginandjar was quoted by Antara
as saying.
   Emil Salim, former state minister for both population and
environment, said two weeks ago that the Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang and
Bekasi area needs one governor of a ministerial level to anticipate
future challenges.
   He said such a move would enable better management to enhance
services in the capital city as well as support decentralization, which
is needed for future economic autonomy.
   "That is a positive idea. However, clear systems must be prepared for
that," Ginandjar said.
   Presently, governors are elected or proposed by the provincial
legislative councils, while ministers are appointed by the President.
   He said that comprehensive discussions on development in Jabotabek
are needed, citing poverty eradication programs as the main focus to
develop an area like Jabotabek.
   Minister of Home Affairs Moch. Yogie S.M. said earlier that such an
idea requires comprehensive feasibility studies.
   West Java Governor R. Nuriana has said on separate occasions that the
idea could create many problems. One of the problems that should be
tackled is the formulation of the size and status of the new province.
   Ginandjar, who is also chairman of the National Development Planning
Board (Bappenas), said that his office does not specifically handle the
development of Jabotabek. "Bappenas deals with the development of
densely-populated areas in connection with master spatial planning," he
said.
   Ginandjar said he has not looked into the possible economic benefit
Jabotabek would gain from becoming a single province.
   Efforts to deal and synchronize the development of Jakarta, Bogor,
Tangerang and Bekasi have been made by the government by setting up a
coordination body in early 1980s.
   However, according to urban experts, the body has failed in its
function as Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang and Bekasi have their own targets
and concerns with their respective development programs.

Military

   Meanwhile, Bekasi regent Moch. Djamhari said yesterday that Jabotabek
would need a greater military command under one commander, a lieutenant
general, should they be merged into one province.
   Djamhari, an army lieutenant colonel, said this at a meeting with
Jakarta military commander Maj. Gen. Sutiyoso and hundreds of local
public figures.
   The regent said that a greater military command would need to be
headed by an officer of at least lieutenant general in rank if the
province was to be headed by a governor with ministerial level authority
as suggested by Emil Salim.
   Djamhari said that a greater military command would enhance order and
security in Jakarta and its surrounding areas.
   Bekasi is a regency under the West Java provincial administration,
but in military and security matters it is controlled by the Jakarta
military command and the Jakarta police headquarters. (sur/kod)

Our art for sale?

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 4

   The current furor over the aborted auction in Singapore of two
paintings that were allegedly stolen from the National Museum's
collection in Jakarta once again puts the spotlight on the lamentable
conditions of our museums and monuments. The two paintings -- Portrait
of a Dutch Governor Wearing the Willems Order by the 19th century
Indonesian master Raden Saleh and Metamorphosis, a nude painting by
Basoeki Abdullah -- are believed to be among at least six paintings
missing in recent years from the National Museum in Jakarta. More sadly,
the thefts might never have become known to the public were it not for
the fact that public attention was focused on Christie's auction and
that some people questioned the origin of two of the paintings listed in
their catalog.
   Indonesians and Jakartans especially are right to be proud of their
National Museum. Its collection of ancient Hindu-Javanese art objects is
unrivaled. Its collection of antique Chinese and Southeast Asian
ceramics is reputed to be among the best and largest in this part of the
world. Its numismatic collection and its collection of gold artifacts
stand up to comparison with those of any other museum in this region.
   Yet, this showpiece of Indonesian museums has been said by some
observers, in several respects, to resemble no more than a warehouse for
the storage of art objects. This appears to be particularly true in the
case of paintings. It wasn't such a long time ago that newspapers
reported that a number of paintings by contemporary French masters,
donated during the 1950s, had disappeared. Others were damaged because
of neglect.
   Paintings, however, are not the only art objects that are vulnerable
to theft. About a decade ago, about 20 pieces were reported stolen from
the museum's collection of antique Chinese and Southeast Asian ceramics.
A big furor arose over the incident and measures were reportedly taken
to step up the museum's security. Yet, as far as is known to the public,
none of the pieces appear to have been recovered or traced.
   If such incidents can occur at Jakarta's National Museum, which is
the showpiece of Indonesian museums, one would hate to think of what
could happen in museums of lesser standing in our big cities or in
museums in the more remote areas of this archipelago. The Kutai Museum
in Tenggarong, East Kalimantan, for example, was reputed to house a
magnificent collection of antique ceramics. There, too, many pieces are
said to have since disappeared.
   The picture becomes even more dismal, of course, when one takes into
consideration the fact that many art treasures have also been reported
stolen from our ancient temples and other archaeological sites. Years
ago, the heads of stone figures at the Bima temple in the Dieng complex
in Central Java -- one of the most ancient of Hindu temples in Indonesia
-- were reportedly chopped off by thieves. Similar cases of vandalism
for the sake of monetary gain have occurred in numerous other sites.
   It is a sad fact that it appears that thieves are among the first of
us to recognize the value of our art objects. It is well enough known
that art nowadays is in many cases no longer something to be appreciated
for its esthetic value only. People with more businesslike dispositions
have long appreciated the fact that many art objects, paintings in
particular, make good investments. Hence, the flourishing of not only
private galleries, but also of art theft around the world.
   Protecting our art objects by stepping up security, proper cataloging
and improving treatment in storage and during displays are obviously
among the first steps that must be taken. It is to simplify matters,
however, to say that these tasks belong to museum curators only. The
public and private institutions, with the support of private business,
can and should help by raising the necessary funds and especially a
greater public awareness of the value of our art objects.
   As for the present, the best we can do is to try to recover what has
been unduly taken from our national art collections. This,
unfortunately, is not an easy task to accomplish. In time, with better
funding and with growing public appreciation, we hope that our art
treasures can be housed in the proper, modern edifices which they
deserve.

Visa card surcharges

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 4

   Thanks to Ms. Pauline Sahetapy for reaffirming my view that
surcharges on payments with Visa card or in fact with any credit card
are illegal.
   What she omits, however, is to mention what Visa and the card issuing
banks are going to do in order to stop this widespread practice.
   I am using my Swiss Visa card frequently, that's what it is here for.
If a shop assistant or cashier, who after all are only following orders,
mention a surcharge, usually between 3 and 5 percent, I ask her or him
to write this clearly on the credit slip, so that I could claim it back
from Visa Switzerland.
   In over 90 percent of the cases, sometimes after consulting the boss,
no such charge is added. If my ploy fails, I will sign the credit slip
and then send it together with the cash register slip or receipt to
Visa, who, without any fuss will credit my next statement. I suggest
that all cardholders do the same. As this process will mean a lot of
work for the banks they may kneel on their contract partners -- the
shops.
   The card issuing banks on the other hand should inform their
customers of their right to refuse surcharges, not just encourage them
to report errant shop-owners, and that without telling us what the
consequences, if any, are.

Dewi A. Rais Abin

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 4

   Thank you for printing on Sept. 21 a photograph of my husband and I
on the occasion of the launching of my book Notes from Sinai: A
Nostalgia on Sept. 20.
   I would like to clarify that my husband, retired Lt.Gen. Rais Abin,
is a former commander of the United Nations Emergency Force-Middle East.
The force comprised seven contingents from seven countries: Canada,
Finland, Sweden, Ghana, Indonesia, Australia and Poland. He was not the
commander of the Indonesian contingent which you referred to as the
Indonesian Peacekeeping Force. The Indonesian Peacekeeping Force was the
Indonesian contingent usually called Batt. Garuda.
   The Indonesian contingent was one among seven contingents of other
countries which were assigned to the United Nations Emergency Force-
Middle East. My husband happened to be force's commander.

Polio vaccine safe

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 4

   It is most unfortunate that a child died on the day of National
Immunization Day and gave the impression to some that this death was
associated with polio vaccine (Sept. 12, 1996). Careful investigation by
the health authorities found that this child had been ill for several
days and happened to receive a dose of polio vaccine orally hours prior
to his death. There is no logical association of the death of this child
with the oral polio vaccine.
   We wish to point out that with more than 200 million doses of oral
polio vaccine given annually worldwide, there is not a single known
adverse effect within hours after vaccination. The short term safety
record of oral polio is incontrovertibly established. It is through such
efforts as the National Immunization days that Indonesia has an
excellent chance of eliminating polio within the next few years. We hope
this incident, which is not related to polio vaccine, will not detract
from the current effort of eliminating one of the most deadly disease of
childhood.
   What is more unfortunate than the case reported on Sept. 12 however
is the unreported fact that 1000 under-five children still die everyday
in Indonesia, mainly as a result of relatively easily preventable
illness, and that the Ministry of Health and ourselves are committed to
dramatically reduce this toll. This effort deserves financial and other
support from all sectors of society.

Museums need help to protect cultural legacy

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 7

   JAKARTA (JP): Fine art is becoming more popular in Indonesia, but
this new found appreciation is not all positive.
   When at least six paintings were allegedly stolen from the National
Museum recently, the thieves took advantage of the dilapidated condition
of Indonesian museums.
   There are now more painters and art collectors in Indonesia, and the
works of a few painters have improved tremendously. There are also
significant increases in the quantity and quality of art exhibitions
held by galleries. The galleries are being run with increasing
professionalism. And art writers are working with them closely to
promote their shows.
   While the artists, galleries and art writers have been quick to meet
the challenge of an Indonesian art boom, museums have failed to develop
as quickly, due to their limited budgets and authority. "I feel sorry
about what happened at the National Museum, but honestly it could easily
have happened in any museum in Indonesia. We need to give more attention
to the registration and storage systems of our museums," said Sudarmadji
Damais, the head of Jakarta History Museum at Taman Fatahillah, Central
Jakarta.
   The government is beginning to pay more attention to its museums, but
its efforts need public and private sector support.
   The public must pay more attention to its museums. "We need to be
more respectful toward our cultural heritage," said Guruh Soekarnoputra,
an artist and art collector, in response to the recent theft. Hopefully
this incident will make the community pay more attention toward cultural
patrimony in Indonesia, especially toward art in museums.
   The municipal government of Jakarta is working hard to improve its
museums. Its own fine art museum is being renovated in response to
greater public interest in art, particularly in paintings.
   Perhaps the time has come for both the public and the private sector
to establish museums which are not merely warehouses for works of art
and culture, but also institutions of learning through the display of
educational exhibits and places where people can enjoy and pursue their
interests. It seems that it is time for the concept of a National Art
Gallery to be planned and realized.

Mystery of missing RI paintings puzzles art world

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 7

By Amir Sidharta

   JAKARTA (JP): The Indonesian art world was shocked by the news of the
alleged theft of six paintings from Jakarta's National Museum. Even more
shocking was the fact that at least two of the allegedly stolen
paintings, A Nude (Metamorphosis)  by Basoeki Abdullah and Portrait of a
Dutch Governor Wearing the Willems Order by Raden Saleh, may have been
included in the catalog of the upcoming Christie's auction in early
October 1996.
   A cartoon by GM Sudarta published in last Friday's Kompas showed a
Christie's employee auctioning the Bronze elephant which symbolizes the
National Museum, also popularly known as Gedung Gajah or "Elephant
Building".  It clearly implied that the 230-year-old auction house was
in the business of auctioning off Indonesia's national treasures.
   In fact, the alleged theft would have probably not been revealed if
it were not for the publication of the auction catalog. Members of the
Basoeki Abdullah estate recognized lot 319 in the catalog, A Nude,  as
Metamorphosis, one of the paintings that was in the custody of the
National Museum. Meanwhile, lot 363 bore great resemblance to a painting
reproduced in a catalog published by the Directorate of Culture of the
Ministry of Education and Culture, in preparation for the National Art
Gallery in 1988. The pictures in the catalog were almost identical.
There was a green stain on the figure's trousers, and damage was seen in
the same location on both reproductions. The only difference was that in
the later publication (the Christie's catalog), to the right of  the
figure's face, the painting had been torn and poorly restored.
   Although auction houses mainly facilitate the sale of artworks at the
highest possible prices according to the market condition in a certain
region, they also become centers of documentation. "That is why we need
Christie's. It records much of the changing of hands in the world of
art," said Sudarmadji Damais, head of the Jakarta History Museum at
Taman Fatahilah after hearing about the alleged theft last week.
   "Christie's often helps locate stolen art," someone in the field of
art auctions explained. Perhaps it has in other parts of the world. But
in this case, we can only hope that the paintings will be returned.
   The reappearance of allegedly stolen Indonesian paintings in
Christie's auction of Southeast Asian paintings has happened previously.
One of Ida Bagus Made's 14 paintings, which was stolen a while ago, and
a Basoeki Abdullah's from the collection of former president Sukarno
were offered at the Christie's auction in March 1995. However, because
of insufficient evidence, no investigation was pursued. Neither Ida
Bagus Made nor Guruh Soekarnoputra, the youngest son of the late
president Sukarno, filed police reports when the paintings were stolen
or found missing. The inclusion of the painting in the album entitled
Paintings in the Collection of President Sukarno, compiled by Dullah,
apparently was not sufficient proof of theft. "It is Christie's policy
not to reveal the identity of either the seller or the buyer of the
artworks in their auctions," explained art writer Agus Dermawan, who is
an avid observer of Indonesian auction trends. Therefore, the alleged
theft could not be traced.
   Whether or not Christie's can be required by law to reveal the
identity of the seller in the case of the two paintings allegedly stolen
from Indonesia's National Museum will depend on the laws in Singapore.
Laws concerning stolen goods differ from country to country. According
to a prominent Japanese art dealer, in Japan, when a stolen painting has
been sold, it becomes the legal right of the buyer, and the original
owners have to buy the painting back from the new owner. In other
countries, legal ownership depends on whether the purchase was made
before or after the official report of theft was reported to the police.

Time

   At this point, we can only predict the time of the alleged theft and
the characteristics of the alleged thief. It might be helpful to try to
analyze the mystery. Considering that it takes at least three months
before artworks can be included of artworks in a Christie's auction, Art
observer Agus Dermawan T. estimates that the paintings were allegedly
stolen before June.
   Taking into account the fact that the estimated prices of the
paintings were still quite reasonable, it seems that the paintings were
probably stolen before the sale of Raden Saleh's Deer Hunt  in late
March of this year. If the alleged theft took place after the news of
this landmark sale, the alleged thieves would certainly expect rather
high prices, at least for the Raden Saleh, and therefore would have
increased the expected reserve price in the auction.
   Unfortunately, the reserves for the pieces remain confidential.
However, it seems that the price of portrait still within reasonable
limits and is therefore considered suitable for auction.
   It seems that the theft also may have occurred after the publication
of the Christie's catalog of the March auction. The catalog revealed the
high estimate of the piece to parties interested in Indonesian art. High
prices for Indonesian art may have seduced the alleged culprits to steal
the Raden Saleh which they knew was in the neglected possession of the
National Museum. It is also possible that the pieces were stolen even
earlier, perhaps after the announcement of the auction of the Deer Hunt
late last year or earlier this year. Profile
   In terms of the profile of the alleged thief/thieves, we can almost
be sure that the seller of the paintings was not involved in the alleged
theft, unless he/she were completely naive. As this case has proven, the
inclusion of stolen items in auctions tends to reveal cases of alleged
theft.
   It seems safe to say that the paintings have changed hands at least
twice before the paintings reach the seller. We can assume that the
alleged theft was masterminded by someone who had reasonable knowledge
of art, and even knew that there was a Raden Saleh in the National
Museum's collection placed in its storage area.
   If there had been any indication of forced entry into the museum's
storage space, the theft would have been revealed immediately. It is
almost certain that no sign of forced entry to the storage facility was
traced, because the theft which, based on reliable sources, happened at
least three months ago, was only revealed two weeks ago. This suggests
the involvement of insiders.

Worth

   Basoeki Abudllah's A Nude has been estimated as being worth between
S$8,000 to S$12,000. Was it worth stealing? If the piece was expected to
sell at around Rp 20 million, then, minus commissions and other
expenses, the seller would have bought it for Rp 12 million at most.
Therefore, we can assume that the persons behind the alleged theft paid
less than Rp 2.5 million for the job.
   Then we can almost be sure that the six paintings were stolen as a
lot, and later sold to the seller as a lot as well. The Raden Saleh is
estimated between S$100,000 to S$150,000. If the painting were to be
sold (which I doubt, because of its poor condition), I think it would
only reach the low end of the estimate. At Rp 165 million, minus
commissions and expenses, the seller would have bought it for around Rp
100 million. For this painting, the alleged culprits behind the theft
may have paid Rp 20 million for the job. Coupled with the other
paintings in the lot, the value of the job may have reached Rp 30
million. This amount would presumably be divided among two to three
persons. Although the sum, averaging Rp 10 million, might not seem
large, it is actually still quite substantial, considering the wages of
government employees in this country.
   If the involvement of insiders is revealed, then punishment is of
course necessary. However, we should not treat the involved insiders as
having sold national treasures, even though they are in the National
Museum's collection. It should be taken into account that the paintings
most likely had been neglected in the museum's storage space and treated
as insignificant pieces.
   Of more crucial importance is to reveal the masterminds of this
alleged theft. It should be stressed that the masterminds have
significant knowledge about art, including Indonesian art, and the
existence of important paintings in certain collections in the
government. They also seem to know that some key paintings are kept in
storage spaces of certain museums, although cooperation with insiders
may lead them to this kind of information. Certainly, there is
possibility that it is the work of a syndicate, which may also be
involved in other art crimes, including art forgery, which is also
rapidly developing in the country.

Concessionaires told to set aside wood for locals

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 8

   JAKARTA (JP): Minister of Forestry Djamaludin Suryohadikusumo said
yesterday only 45 forest concessionaires, or about 10 percent of the
total number, have allocated a portion of their log harvests for local
communities.
   He said that 405 out of about 450 forest concessionaires operating in
Indonesia have yet to set aside at least 5 percent of their log harvests
for local people, as stipulated by the government earlier this year.
   The stipulation not only calls for the concessionaires to provide
locals with quality wood, but also to ensure an adequate supply at
marketplaces at reasonable prices.
   Speaking at a hearing with members of the House of Representatives
Commission IV on forestry and agricultural affairs, Djamaludin said the
total log volume obtained from the 45 concessionaires has reached only
84,165 cubic meters.
   He said he would send warnings to the negligent concessionaires and
would revoke their concessions if they failed to respond after a third
warning.
   Djamaludin calculated that if log production from natural forests
currently reached 22.7 million cubic meters and if wood-processing cut
back this amount to 11 million cubic meters, then a 5 percent allocation
of the processed wood by each of the country's 450 concessionaires would
provide local communities with at least 550,000 cubic meters of wood.
   He considered the 84,165 cubic meters collected from concessionaires
so far as being far from satisfactory.
   Djamaludin said that the low supply of wood at local markets had led
to illegal trade of timber.
   Commenting on this issue, Director General of Forest Utilization
Titus Sarijanto was convinced that the government's campaign against
illegal trade of timber would not increase timber prices on the domestic
market.
   "The prices which are currently created with the existence of illegal
timber are abnormal. Once we can get rid of illegal timber, the market
will have its own way of creating the prices... And people will get used
to the new prices," he said.
   He was also confident that the situation would not cause a slump in
exports.
   "What the wood-processing industry must learn to do is give added
value to its products. This way, companies can get more revenues for the
same amount of wood harvested," he said.

Shortage

   According to recent reports, a number of large wood-processing
companies are currently suffering raw material shortages.
   Titus said the total production capacity of Indonesia's wood-
processing industries is presently 48.2 million cubic meters a year,
consisting of 31.95 million cubic meters for the sawmill industry and
16.25 million cubic meters for the plywood industry.
   The wood-processing industries, however, have an operational capacity
of only 45 million to 46 million cubic meters a year.
   Meanwhile, supplies for these industries, which include a certain
amount of trees cut from the opening up of the one million hectares of
peat land in Central Kalimantan, reach only about 36 million cubic
meters a year.
   As a way out, the government has encouraged the industries to apply
technologies with minimum waste and restructure their machinery.
   Titus said yesterday there are currently technologies that can help
companies carry out such short-term plans.
   These include installing machinery that is capable of peeling off
layers of wood barks until the core diameter of a log reaches seven
centimeters -- smaller than the 20 to 25 centimeter diameter core
produced by most machinery currently used -- and cutting back on
industrial waste from 30 percent to 20 percent.
   "This waste can further be burned to generate the boilers used in the
plywood industry," he said.
   Titus said Indonesia's plywood industry production reached nine
million cubic meters a year, while state revenues obtained from this
sector in the past five years reached an average of US$4.5 million each
year, with an increasing trend. (pwn)

PT Gobel diversifies to build three-star hotel

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 8

   JAKARTA (JP): PT Gobel Development Corporation, a major electronics
manufacturer, is entering the hotel business by constructing a three
star-hotel on Jl. Saharjo in South Jakarta.
   The planned hotel, to be called Hotel Clarion Jakarta, is owned by PT
Dharmagraha Nusantara, a Gobel subsidiary, and will be managed by PT
Choice Hotels Indonesia, the master license holder of Choice Hotels
International of the United States.
   The ground breaking ceremony of the US$125 million hotel took place
yesterday and was led by a Gobel commissioner, Abdullah Gobel, Choice's
executive chairman, David Schaefer, and the chief of the Jakarta office
of the Ministry of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications, Pudjo Basuki.
   Gobel said that the planned eight-story hotel will include 172 rooms,
a business center, meeting rooms, a conference hall, a swimming pool,
restaurants and a health center.
   The hotel is expected to open in early 1998 and to employ some 250
Indonesians, he said.
   Pudjo admitted that the 1.5-year construction period is relatively
short for such a project.
   "I am quite happy that this hotel will be up and running soon. There
are currently 11 star-rated hotel projects in Jakarta delayed by the
owners, mostly owing to financial problems."
   A number of star-rated hotels in Jakarta are currently carrying out
renovation or expansion projects, including the Borobudur Inter-
Continental and Le Meridien, while dozens of new star-rated hotels, such
as the Conrad, the Marriott, the Kempinski, the Marco Polo, the Traders
and the Park Lane, are being prepared to open in the city in the next
few years.
   However, Pudjo said, Jakarta might lack star-rated hotel-rooms if the
growth rate is slow and more hotel projects are delayed. He refused to
name the delayed hotel projects.
   "Jakarta now has some 18,000 star-rated hotel rooms. This figure is
expected to increase to 30,000 by the year 2000."
   Choice currently operates six hotels, in Yogyakarta, Bandung and
Anyer in West Java, Parapat in North Sumatra and Pacung and Taman Mumbul
in Bali.
   Choice expects to see four hotels open in 1997, located in the
Central Java city of Surakarta, Batam in Riau, Carita beach in West Java
and Surabaya in East Java.
   In addition to the Clarion Jakarta, Choice will also manage two
further hotels, in Palembang in South Sumatra and Bogor in West Java in
1998.
   Today Choice, which uses Quality, Clarion, Comfort and Sleep as it
brands, is scheduled to sign an agreement with the Lippo Group to manage
the Carita Clarion Suites at the Carita beach in West Java. (icn)

ACeS gets US$60 million loan

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 8

   JAKARTA (JP): Jakarta-based satellite operator PT Asia Cellular
Satellite (ACeS) signed a US$60 million loan facility yesterday from a
domestic financial consortium led by the state-owned PT Danareksa
Finance.
   The nonrevolving bridge finance facility was prepared by Danareksa
($15.5 million), Bank PDFCI ($15.5 million), Bank Niaga ($15.5 million),
Bank Dagang dan Industri ($3.5 million) and Panin Bank ($10 million).
   Reksadana's president, Edgar Ekaputra, said that the loan syndication
was the first ever for a satellite project in the country.
   "This is the first time that financial institutions have joined
together in supporting the infrastructure development of the satellite
industry," he said.
   He acknowledged that the satellite-based telecommunications business
is complicated, causing the consortium to pledge only $60 million in
loans.
   "ACeS plans to look for bigger loans, but we will learn together
first about the satellite business," Ekaputra said.
   ACeS's president, Adi R. Adiwoso, said that the loans will be used to
finance company projects, including the construction of Garuda
satellites and telecommunication networks.
   ACeS, set up in June 1995, is equally owned by PT Pasifik Satelit
Nusantara, the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company and Jasmine
International Overseas Company of Thailand.
   By operating a satellite-based mobile communications system, ACeS
will facilitate the making and receiving of calls to and from places
within the spacecraft's coverage. Garuda satellites, manufactured by
Lockheed Martin Corporation of the United States, will allow subscribers
to call fixed telephone users anywhere in the world through its gateways
located in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia.
   The cost for using the satellite service is estimated at $1 for one
minute of air traffic.
   Today, ACeS is scheduled to sign an agreement with Proton of Russia
on the launching of the first Garuda satellite in the middle of 1998.

Rukindo admits leakage

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 9

   JAKARTA (JP): The president of state-owned dredging company PT
Rukindo, Baharudin Wahab, said yesterday that his company has
experienced some "financial leakage."
   "Deviation and financial leakage did occur in our companies, but we
shouldn't necessarily relate them to corruption," he said at a hearing
with House Commission V for finance, trade, cooperatives and logistics.
   He did not give any overall figures, saying only that in the second
quarter of this year the company incurred Rp 7.8 billion (US$3.4
million) in "financial leakage" (unexpected expenses).
   Baharudin admitted that his company has been having efficiency
problems and has experienced setbacks due to delays in dredging projects
in west and east Ancol, North Jakarta, and in the Krakatau port of
Cilegon, West Java.
   The inefficiencies were partly caused by his employees, many of whom,
he said, lack professionalism.
   Baharudin also reported other problems that plagued his company's
performance during the second quarter, including equipment failures and
problems with its dredging ships.
   He said that his company expects to receive a loan of Rp 60 billion
for equipment and ship repair. "We're currently negotiating with a
number of financial institutions to get the loan," he said.
   He projected that his company would gain a profit of about Rp 3.5
billion this year. "At the least we hope to avoid incurring more losses
this year," he said. (13)

Inflation rate expected to hit 8.5% this year

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 9

   JAKARTA (JP): The Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) expects
Indonesia's inflation rate to reach 8.5 percent this calender year and
8.9 percent next year.
   The agency attributed the high estimates to continued increases in
demand for consumer products.
   A BPS economic forecast for 1996 and 1997, made available yesterday,
said the projected rates are not expected to affect confidence in the
rupiah. Higher inflation is to come from increases in demand rather than
slower growth on the supply side, the report said.
   The government had planned to keep the inflation rate at 5 percent
per annum in the current five year development period, ending in 1999.
The target has yet to be achieved.
   The inflation rate, for example, was recorded at 8.65 percent in
1995, down slightly from 9.24 percent in the previous year. In the
January to July period of this year, the inflation rate was checked at
4.98 percent, down from 6.41 percent during the same period of last
year.
   According to BPS, government policies to fight inflation through
fiscal and monetary measures have not been effective due to growth in
short-term foreign funds through domestic equity and money markets.
   "The increase in the inflow of foreign funds through the capital and
money markets makes it difficult for the monetary authority to control
the money supply," the bureau said.

Investment decline

   It also reported an expected drop in the growth rate of foreign
investment approvals to 15 percent both in 1996 and 1997, from 25
percent last year.
   The projected declines in the value of foreign investment approvals
were attributed to inconsistencies in the government's microeconomic
policies. BPS did not elaborate.
   Foreign investment approvals, according to the Investment
Coordinating Board (BKPM), declined in value by 2.7 percent to $21
billion between January and July 15 this year from $27.2 billion in the
same period of last year. Meanwhile, the value of domestic investment
approvals rose 127 percent to Rp 70.6 trillion from Rp 31 trillion.
   In 1995, foreign investment approvals rose 68 percent to $39.9
billion from $23.7 billion in 1994, while domestic investment approvals
increased 30 percent to Rp 69.9 trillion from Rp 53.3 trillion.
   BPS said that slower foreign investment growth would result in a
decline in the aggregate growth of gross domestic capital to 7.67
percent in 1996 and 7.91 percent in 1997, compared to 8.4 percent in
1995.
   It said that slower growth in foreign investment approvals would also
slow domestic demand and the importation of consumer goods and services.
   The actual growth rate of imported goods and services is expected to
decline to 12 percent next year from 24 percent last year, BPS said.

Gajah Surya to buy a 51.8% share of BDNI

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 9

   JAKARTA (JP): The independent shareholders of PT Gajah Surya Multi
Finance, of the Gajah Tunggal Group, approved yesterday the company's
plan to acquire a 51.8 percent share of PT Bank Dagang Nasional
Indonesia (BDNI), together with four other proposals.
   The company said in a statement that all proposals, including those
for a rights issue and a change in its line of business, won unanimous
approval from approximately 80 percent of its independent shareholders
who attended yesterday's extraordinary meeting.
   The statement said that the planned acquisition will cost Rp 734
billion (US$313 million), representing a price of Rp 1,725 per share,
which will be financed by funds raised from the proposed rights issue.
   "The shareholders have also endorsed our plan to issue seven new
shares at Rp 1,300 each for every two old shares to raise total funds of
Rp 728 billion," it said.
   Gajah Surya shares yesterday closed at Rp 1,400 on the Jakarta Stock
Exchange and BDNI shares at Rp 1,675.
   The company said that after the acquisition it will become the Gajah
Tunggal Group's investment holding company under the name PT BDNI
Capital Corporation Tbk.
   "In line with the restructuring of our business line, we will hand
over all of our multifinance activities to PT Gajah Surya Finance and
we, therefore, increase our ownership from 86 percent at present to 98.8
percent."
   It was reported that Gajah Surya will increase its authorized capital
from Rp 800 billion to Rp 2.8 trillion, including a paid-up capital of
Rp 720 billion, after the planned right issue.
   The meeting also appointed Karmady Arief as a new commissioner
replacing Sutrisno, and  F.T. Chong and Arie Yandi Taswar as new
directors replacing Eddy Sanusi and Hendra Alimin.
   Gajah Surya, established in 1982 as a leasing company, also operates
in general and life insurance, insurance brokerage, stock brokerage and
venture capital, with total assets of Rp 779 billion.
   "The management has planned to make use of BDNI's nationwide

Indonesian horse riders lack basic skills: Expert

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 10

   JAKARTA (JP): Indonesian horse riders are among the best in Southeast
Asia, but surprisingly they lack basic skills, an international
equestrian expert said yesterday.
   Wolfgang Niggli, former chairman of the international equestrian
federation (FEI), the world equestrian body, told The Jakarta Post after
a three-day coaching clinic here that many Indonesian riders are not
familiar with basic training techniques.
   "I can see that a lot of basic training skills are still lacking.
Maybe the basics are not known well enough," he said.
   Of 12 riders invited to the clinic only five turned up; the others
returned home after the just-concluded 14th National Games last week.
   Niggli said, however, the riders have good prospects for success in
international events. "Look at Chiang Mai. If only the Indonesian riders
had had good horses, they would have won," he said.
   In the 1995 Southeast Asian Games in Chiang Mai, host Thailand
adopted a ruling saying that all participants had to use local horses.
Indonesia blamed the regulation for its failure to win gold medals in
both the individual and team dressage events. Indonesia had to be
content with a silver and a bronze.
   Niggli, who prefers to come here by himself instead of sending
somebody, said that the FEI issues passports for horses to enable them
travel around the world for competitions.
   "It is still difficult to do more because each country has its own
rules. We can't do much about it," he said.
   Thailand and Malaysia have just opened their borders to foreign
horses.
   Commenting on Indonesia's decision to exclude equestrian events from
the 25 proposed medal sports when it hosts the SEA Games next year,
Niggli said that the country will lose its biggest chance to win gold
medals.
   "It's a shame that the National Sports Council wants to drop
equestrian events based on medal-tally judging. It will also prevent the
sport's development here," he said.
   Wijaya, treasurer of the Jakarta Equestrian Association, told the
Post that despite the absence of equestrian events in the SEA Games, two
series of the Volvo World Cup will be staged here in September next
year.
   The first leg of the tournament will be held on Sept. 7 at the
Arthayasa Stable in Cinere, South Jakarta, which is owned by Radinal
Moochtar's son Rafiq Radinal. The second leg will be staged a week later
at the Ciater Stables in Sukabumi, West Java.
   The championships will feature dressage, jumping and three-day-event
competitions. (yan)

Games medal winners cash in on victories

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 10

   JAKARTA (JP): Cash bonuses for National Games winners made the
headlines in the country's sports pages over the weekend after 12 days
of hectic competition finished Friday.
   The size of the awards, a preferable substitute for traditional
floral garlands, varied from province to province, but there is no
denying that the vast majority of medal winners across the archipelago
are richer than they were before the Games.
   Central Java is the only province not rewarding its sporting heroes.
Governor Suwardi told his athletes arriving in Semarang Sunday that his
administration would not provide anything for the medalists.
   "As long as I am at the helm of this province, there will be no cash
bonuses for Central Java's athletes. For those who don't agree with my
policy I'll let you race to other provinces for cash," Suwardi was
quoted by Antara as saying,
   Leftovers from the province's Games budget are to be used to build
sports facilities, said the governor.
   Suwardi promised that rewards will be given in other forms, such as
jobs in provincial offices and direct admittance to state-run
universities.
   In Kendari, Governor La Ode Kaimoeddin handed out Rp 5 million
(US$2,146) to each of Southeast Sulawesi's 11 gold medalists, Rp 3
million to the four silver medalists and Rp 2 million to the nine
athletes who won bronzes during a ceremony yesterday attended by
Minister of Public Works Radinal Moochtar, who was there on an official
visit.
   The province finished 14th in the medal standings, three places lower
than three years ago. Nine of the golds in this year's Games came from
water sports.
   "Don't look at the amount, which may be less than that received by
athletes from other provinces. We have to thank this province's 1.4
million people who contributed to the bonuses," Kaimoeddin said.
   Jakarta's medal winners are enjoying the biggest bonuses, with each
gold medalist receiving three times the amount given to their Southeast
Sulawesi counterparts. A Jakartan silver medalist is Rp 7.5 million
richer, while the bronze medalists bagged Rp 4 million.
   Each member of a gold, silver and bronze medal-winning team received
Rp 7.5 million, Rp 5 million and Rp 2.5 million respectively. And
athletes who left the Games empty-handed were awarded consolation
bonuses of Rp 1 million.
   Record-breaking performances were also worth whopping bonuses, with a
Southeast Asian Games mark priced at Rp 5 million, a national record
worth Rp 3 million and a meet record going for Rp 2.5 million.
   "The amount of the bonuses is small compared to your efforts and I
don't think that you fought for glory because of the bonuses," Governor
Surjadi Soedirdja told his athletes during a get-together celebration on
Sunday.
   Jakarta was crowned the overall champion for a record eighth
successive time, scooping 141 golds, 83 silvers and 79 bronzes.
   West Javanese medal winners lived up to their status as runners-up to
Jakarta, emerging the second richest with Rp 12.5 million given to a
gold medalists, Rp 6.2 million to silver medalists and Rp 3.1 million to
bronze medalists.
   Central Kalimantan awarded Rp 6 million to its gold-medal winners, Rp
3 million to the silver medalists and Rp 1.5 million to the bronze
medalists. (amd)

Chess meet lures top players

from THE JAKARTA POST -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1996 -- PAGE 10

   JAKARTA (JP): Indonesia's three grandmasters -- Utut Adianto, Edhi
Handoko and Ardiansyah -- and defending champion international master
Ruben Gunawan are to take part in the Rp 25 million (US$10,638) Intisari
Cup chess tournament from Oct. 6 to Oct. 9 here.
   Utut is the only player who will receive a bye into the last-32 round
of the tournament, to be held at the F. Sumanti chess hall in Tanah
Abang, Central Jakarta, and the nearby Auditorium building.
   The tournament, organized by the Intisari monthly magazine and PT
Asia Sejahtera Perdana Pharmaceutical, has not been sanctioned by the
world chess governing body FIDE. (arf)

Sending a Perfectly Terrible Year Into History, Yen & Stocks Soar

     Sending what was a perfectly terrible year firmly into
history, the Tokyo markets opened 1996 with a tremendous surge,
in a half day session today. The dollar climbed above Yen 105 for
the first time since June of 1994, and the stock market soared
750 points, or 3.77% to close at 20,618.00 on the Nikkei, its
highest finish since September 2, 1994. Helped along by heavy
foreign buying, about 400 million shares changed hands on the
Tokyo Exchange--close to double the volume in many full day
sessions of recent months. Stock prices had climbed sharply in
the week before shogatsu, the year-end holiday, finishing above
20,000 at midweek before dropping back a bit before the year
ended. Tokyo brokers told news agency reporters they believe
foreign buying will continue because the higher dollar will help
corporate profits, and Japanese stocks are currently underpriced
in comparison to New York and other foreign markets. It was all a
sharp contrast to last year's opening, when prices fell for five
days running and volume dropped to levels that hadn't been seen
since the early 1960s, setting a tone that persisted through much
of Japan's most troublesome year since 1945.

MoF Vice Minister Shinozawa Resigns After Just Seven Months on
Job

     In a move that jolted Kasumigaseki just as the government
was shutting down for the year-end holiday, Vice Finance Minister
Kyosuke Shinozawa resigned 12/29 after just seven months as
Japan's most powerful bureaucrat, the shortest incumbency ever.
His successor is National Tax Administration Agency director
general Tadashi Ogawa, a former administrative secretary to
Noboru Takeshita. Shinozawa said he quit to help "renovate the
hearts and minds... and lift up morale" at MoF. Both he and
Finance Minister Takemura vehemently denied he was taking
responsibility for anything specific. But reports said there was
no doubt his departure stemmed from MoF's inept handling of a
several financial crises culminating in the controversy over use
of government funds to bail the banks out from under trillions of
yen in bad debt owed by seven jusen or mortgage lenders (Digest,
12/20-22). Asahi said Shinozawa acted to prevent a politically
disruptive interrogation by the opposition Shinshinto when the
Diet reconvenes late this month. Shinshinto's new president
Ichiro Ozawa is already attacking on the issue. Persistent calls
are also heard for Takemura's head, but the Finance Minister
huffed that "My responsibility, which I have to carry out, is to
resolve the housing loan problem."
     Punishment: Shinozawa is the second vice minister in a row
to leave before his time. Predecessor Jiro Saito was forced out
in May, a month before his term was up, in what was widely
interpreted as punishment both for MoF's ineptitude and for his
connections to the political opposition. Taken together, their
departures are read as a signal that the ministry's formerly
uncontested clout is in deep decline--and more broadly, so is the
general power of Japan's almighty central bureaucracy. "I never
thought the post of Finance vice minister could be so fragile,"
one bureaucrat told Asahi. But several commentaries also observed
that one resignation or even several won't cure incompetence and
misbehavior. "The problem is that once well-functioning decision
making system made up of bureaucrats and politicians no longer
works in today's dynamically changing economy. Unless the
government and the ruling parties tackle this problem straight
forwardly, there will be no essential difference regardless of
how many vice ministers' heads fall," Yomiuri lamented.

Despite MoF Assurances on Bank Crisis, S&P, Moody's Lower Debt
Ratings

     The Finance Ministry's self-assured contention that the
jusen [mortgage lender] settlement and other actions to shore up
the financial system have finally brought the banking crisis
under control (Digest, 12/20-22), didn't cut much ice with
American rating agencies. Standard and Poor's lowered the debt
ratings of seven major Japanese banks over the year-end, and
Moody's did so on two large regionals. Affected were Mitsubishi,
Sumitomo, Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Sanwa, Fuji, its Chicago subsidiary
Heller Financial, Sakura, Industrial Bank of Japan, Hokkaido Bank
and Ashikaga Bank. S&P said bluntly that Japanese banks "remain
under considerable stress resulting from a high level of under-
reserved problem loans, exacerbated by a continuous slide in real
estate prices." The big banks, said S&P are also plagued by low
profitability, serious difficulties in foreclosing on property,
and quite possibly by exposure to the problem loans of many
smaller financial institutions. Moody's added that with property
values still falling, actual bad loan losses could well be larger
than anyone now imagines. About the only thing that will get the
banks healthy again, S&P said, is either a general economic
pickup that generates an ability among borrowers to pay, or a
turnaround in property prices.

Farm Co-op Banks Hold Yen 2 Trillion in Bad Loans To Other
Institutions

     The farm co-op banks, whose political allies limited their
losses in the collapse of the seven jusen to Yen 530 billion
($5.1 billion), are owed an additional Yen 5.1 trillion ($49.5
billion) by 68 other nonbank lenders--and more than Yen 2
trillion ($20 billion) is a dead loss, Yomiuri reported 1/1. The
paper said 27 of the lenders are paying no interest or making
reduced payments on Yen 2.23 trillion owed to the co-op banks.
Largest of the debtors is Nippon Lease, an affiliate of Long Term
Credit Bank of Japan, which owes them Yen 456.2 billion. LTCBJ
hasn't asked the co-ops to forgive any of the debt yet, Yomiuri
said, but Nichiboshin wants them to abandon some of the Yen 41.8
billion it owes, and Yen 21.3 billion owed by Hyogin Factor, a
subsidiary of bankrupt Hyogo Bank, is gone. Largest single lender
among the co-ops is their central bank, Norinchukin, with Yen
551.9 billion outstanding, but the National Federation of
Agricultural Co-op Mutual Aid Associations and its 47 prefectural
chapters hold Yen 720.3 billion in loans among them, while
separate prefectural co-op associations hold the remaining Yen
609.7 billion.

Leading Indicators Climbed To 80, But Other Statistics Are Mixed
Bag

     The index of leading indicators climbed to 80 on a scale of
100 in October, the Economic Planning Agency reported 12/26. That
was its first trip in six months over 50, the point at which it
theoretically begins to predict expansion 6-9 months hence. But
other statistics reported over the year end, many of them
November numbers, were mixed at best, with a majority of them
still pointing down. Details:
     -- Retail sales by major department stores and supermarkets
fell 0.5% from a year ago in November, to Yen 1.84 trillion, MITI
said. Department stores gained 0.1% to Yen 904 billion but
supermarkets fell 1.1% to Yen 932 billion. October sales had
fallen 3.2%.
     -- The Prime Minister's office said consumer prices through
November averaged 0.7% below a year ago, and added that if the
trend continued through December Japan would have seen its first
full year of deflation since 1958. Prices in Tokyo were actually
off 0.5% from a year ago in December.
     -- November industrial production gained 0.5% from a year
ago, MITI reported 12/27, adding that manufacturers it surveyed
reported plans to raise output in December and January. Chief
statistician Harumi Takahashi told reporters she expects 4th
quarter output to gain 0.9% from a year ago. "Industrial
production is better than we had expected," she said.
     -- New construction orders to 50 major companies in November
fell 10.4% from a year ago to Yen 1.4 trillion yen, the
Construction Ministry reported 12/27.
     -- MOC also said November housing starts gained 0.1% from a
year ago to 137,180, the first rise after eight months of
decline. Private homes fell 8% to 45,953 and company housing
dropped 2.8% to 2,314, but rental units gained 2.6% to 56,040--
and housing for sale (mainly condos) climbed 9.4% to 32,862.
     -- MITI said 12/25 it forecasts crude steel production will
fall 9.2% from a year ago to 23.2 million tons in the first
quarter of 1996.
     -- November unemployment climbed to 3.4% after six months at
3.2% (see Labor).

Ozawa Wins Shinshinto Presidency in a Walk, But Unity is a
Question

     Longtime behind-the-throne power broker Ichiro Ozawa moved a
long step toward putting himself in the seat of authority by
defeating erstwhile ally Tsutomu Hata 2-to-1 for the presidency
of Shinshinto, 12/28. Ozawa got into the race only after Hata's
people started to talk about removing him as secretary general, a
spot he'd held since he organized the party. But with a little
help from his friends in organized labor and other local groups,
he managed in two weeks to put together a 1,120,012 to 566,998
rout of the former prime minister. That tally included anybody
willing to pony up Yen 1,000 ($10) for the right to cast a
ballot. Among the 223,578 regular party members, Ozawa garnered
only a slim margin. Most commentary approved his enunciation of
clear policy proposals, over Hata's emphasis on consensus-
building, and suggested that once LDP President Hashimoto takes
over from Prime Minister Murayama, Japan will finally return to
real politics.
     No Shutting Up: Always provided Ozawa can hold his forces
together. Neither Hata nor his allies seem in a mood to shut up
and follow the leader. About 15 Hata supporters, including former
Prime Minister Hosokawa, said they'll organize yet another "study
group" (read incipient faction). Ozawa put Hata, former prime
ministers Hosokawa and Kaifu, and other senior politicians on a
board of senior advisors, but several said they will continue to
criticize him. He named as his secretary general Takashi Yonezawa
who once held the same job in the old Democratic Socialist party,
and who had delivered the union vote for Ozawa. He kept follower
Kozo Watanabe as Political Affairs chairman, but coopted longtime
critic Kazuo Aichi, a Hata man, as policy chairman, and named
another Hata backer, former postal minister Hajime Funada as his
political affairs deputy.

Dietman Yamaguchi Indicted for Illegal Loans from Failed Credit
Associations

     Tokyo prosecutors indicted former Labor Minister Toshio
Yamaguchi 12/27 on embezzlement, fraud and other charges,
culminating a year's investigation into financial irregularities
of two defunct Tokyo credit co-ops, Tokyo Kyowa and Anzen.
Yamaguchi is accused of conspiring with former Tokyo Kyowa
director Harunori Takahashi to get Yen 2.7 billion in unsecured
loans that are in default. The fraud charge stems from a
conspiracy to extract Yen 180 million from Kumamoto Engineering
University, ostensibly to help build the `Washington
International University' project in Reston, VA., though there
was no prospect of construction. Those funds also went to pay off
debts of his family firm. He is also accused of using assets of
non-profit foundations he created as collateral for other loans
from the two credit co=ops--and of perjuring himself before the
Diet by testifying that he knew nothing of the conspiracies.
Prosecutors said their year-long investigation of the two
institutions uncovered Yen 38.2 billion in illegal loans to a
variety of people, a record in a Japanese bank fraud case.

Report That Murayama Agreed to Hand Power to Hashimoto Is Denied

     Yomiuri reported 12/31 that Prime Minister Murayama has
secretly agreed to hand his office over to LDP president Ryutaro
Hashimoto in April, but Murayama himself denied it, and perhaps
more important, so far you've read it in Yomiuri, and nowhere
else. Murayama told reporters at a year-end press conference he
plans to go to Lyon, France for the next G7 summit in June. He
added that there's no plan to dissolve the Diet. Yomiuri had said
Murayama, Hashimoto and Finance Minister Takemura, hashed up a
deal to make the switch after the FY '96 budget passes the Diet
this spring, and to have Hashimoto call an election about three
months later, giving the Murayama's Socialists and Takemura's
Sakigake party time to prepare. The paper said the switch might

Clinton Reschedules Japan Visit for April 17

     The White House said 12/26 that President Clinton
rescheduled his state visit to Japan April 17-18, on his way to
Moscow to see Boris Yeltsin and attend the atomic energy summit.
Clinton canceled a trip in November for the ASEAN summit and a
follow on visit to Tokyo because of the U.S. government shutdown.
Main purpose of the visit is to issue a joint declaration that
the U.S.-Japan security relationship is intact and should remain
so despite the end of the Cold War and a measure of public
unhappiness with the presence of U.S. troops, exacerbated by the
Okinawa rape.

Lockheed Martin, Timken, Other U.S. Firms Plan Joint Japan
Business Base

     Lockheed Martin, Timken and other U.S. firms are laying
plans to establish a joint business base in Japan that they hope
will allow them to serve the Japanese market better while keeping
costs to a minimum, Nihon Keizai reported. So far, seven firms
including Caterpillar, Cooper Automotive, and electrical parts
maker AMP have agreed to join, and the group wants to attract at
least 20 companies before making a firm go-ahead decision. But it
already has the unreserved support of MITI and is likely to get
both tax breaks and a low-interest loan from the Japan
Development Bank to execute the project, Nikkei said. The
planners are looking for a 30-year lease on 20,000-30,000 sq.m.
(215-325,000 sq.ft.) of floor space that could be subdivided into
individual company offices, small R&D facilities, design shops,
conference rooms and an exhibit hall for joint use. Even
companies that already have offices in Japan would benefit from
using the joint facilities, the paper said. The group is working
with MITI and local governments to pick a location early this
year, and is looking hard at Yokohama and Kobe, Nikkei said.

Nissan Will Move All Sentra Assembly To Mexico, Export Altima
from U.S.

     Struggling to stanch its cash hemorrhage in Mexico, Nissan
will move all assembly of Sentra sedans for the U.S. market from
Smyrna, Tenn. to its plant in Aguascalientes, while raising
output of the Altima in Tennessee so it can export 30-40,000 a
year to Japan. A separate report said it will also restart
production of the AD Van at Aguascalientes, mainly for export to
Japan. Nihon Keizai said 12/23 the Sentra shift will be completed
by 1998, when the car is due for its next major model changeover.
Smyrna currently makes about 170,000 Sentras a year, so the
switch would just about bring the Mexican plant up to capacity.
It made 100,000 last year, vs. a capacity of 270,000. It already
makes an earlier version of the Sentra, which Nissan sells in
Latin America under the same Sunny nameplate it uses in Japan.
The company itself announced 12/27 it plans to resume production
of the AD in Mexico for export to its home market.
     NAFTA: Nihon Keizai said the main motive for the shift is to
take advantage of both NAFTA rules and lower costs in Mexico
generated by the declining value of the peso. Decision to export
the Altima from Tennessee, the paper added, is meant to short
circuit organized labor and other opponents of NAFTA. The switch
will help Nissan make use of a plant that became a white elephant
when the peso collapsed. Nissan borrowed heavily in dollars to
enlarge Aguascalientes--and banking on continued prosperity in
Mexico, it even quit exporting the Mexican-made AD home to Japan.
But the Mexican auto market disintegrated: sales are now 30-40%
of year ago levels, and that helped generate Yen 60 billion ($600
million) losses in Mexico last year and this. What isn't clear,
Nikkei said, is whether it will help the company's bottom line.
Given competition from the Toyota Avalon and Honda Accord,
Nissan's U.S.-made Altimas could well wind up eating into sales
of its own domestic plants.

Pressured By Fearful Koreans, Ssangyong Scrubs Plan To Start
Sales in Japan

     Under stiff pressure from Korean makers and officials
fearful that its action could force Seoul to open its domestic
market to Japanese autos, Ssangyong Motor scrapped plans to sell
its Mercedes-designed Musso sport utility in Japan this month,
Nihon Keizai reported 12/30. The company had said it planned to
become the first Korean automaker into the Japanese market with a
location in Nagoya and plans to expand its dealer network
nationwide within 2-3 years (Digest, 12/11). The paper didn't
give details of exactly what happened in Seoul, but said that
Ssangyong, currently the midget of the Korean auto industry (it
made 50,000 Mussos in 1995, and exported 15,000), ran head-on
into worries that its action would give Tokyo an excuse to demand
that the Korean market be opened. The Koreans lifted some import
barriers effective Jan. 1, but the impact will be felt mainly in
the luxury and semi-luxury categories, while the bread-and-butter
market for sedans with engines under 3 liters will be left mainly
untouched. There was also some worry, Nikkei said, that if the
Korean market is fully opened, Japanese makers like Nissan and
Mazda who've been selling technology to the Koreans as a way to
get into the market, might be tempted to cancel the arrangements
and start sales on their own.

Japanese Makers Bought $10.3 Billion of U.S. Parts in FY '95
First Half

      Japanese makers bought a record $10.3 billion worth of U.S.
automotive parts in the first half of FY '95, ended Sept. 30, up
8.3% from the year ago period, the Japan Auto Manufacturers
Association reported. The figure was about $800 million above the
previous record, set in FY '94. About $8.7 billion of the parts
were for use on transplant assembly lines in the U.S., up 8% from
FY '94, and imports for domestic operations totaled $1.65
billion, up 9.8%. Although Japanese makers, with MITI's backing,
refused to set a new industry-wide parts purchasing target during
the autos and parts negotiations that ended in June, the figure
would seem to indicate a substantial increase for all of FY '95,
from the $19.9 billion they bought in FY '94. A JAMA briefer
warned, however, that declining vehicle exports, which are
knocking down production, could limit parts imports.

Hurt By Exports, November Domestic Vehicle Output Plunged 9.1%

     Stung by a rapid fall in exports stemming from the high yen
and rising output abroad, Japanese vehicle makers reported a 9.1%
plunge in November domestic output, to 863,460. It was a sixth
straight monthly drop, and among the big five, Nissan was the
only gainer, the Japan Auto Manufacturers' Association said. The
figure included 655,067 cars, down 5.7%, 204,047 trucks, off
18.9%, and 4,346 buses, up 8.1%. The decline was all in exports,
which plummeted 21%. Domestic sales gained 4.6% to 593,073, and
passenger cars were up 7% to 380,405. For all but Nissan, which
gained 7.6% to 143,448 on the strength of a domestic surge, the
results were bleak. Toyota hurt by falling exports to North and
South America and the Middle East, dropped 11.2% to 277,194.
Mazda, as usual, got hurt worst in percentage terms, off 24.9% to
65,789. Mitsubishi fell 15.4% to 106,581, and Honda, whose
domestic sales actually climbed 18.6%, saw production fall 9.5%
to 81,425 because of lower exports. Overall, production for the
first 11 months totaled 9,423,306, off 2.8% from a year earlier,
and JAMA said it projects the fully year total at around 10.2
million, which would represent a 2.4% drop from 1994.

Monju Coverup Officials Demoted; Fast Breeder Program To Be
`Rethought'

     The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. or
Donen said 12/23 it removed from duty four officials involved in
an effort to cover up the extent of the Monju reactor's
disastrous leak of three tons of sodium coolant (Digest, 12/22).
Donen had acknowledged that Monju operations director Yasutami
Omori and deputy Isao Sato conspired to cut 14 minutes from a
gruesome, 15-minute videotape of the accident scene. They gave
the 1-minute tape to TV stations the day after the accident, and
released an additional four minutes two days later, saying it was
newly shot. The Donen director in charge of Monju, Tadao
Takahashi, and a lower level official were also demoted. Reports
called the action highly unusual, especially since the reactor is
shut down and the investigation isn't finished. Some accounts
treated it as a ploy by Donen to get people who know too much out
of the way. "Why do they have to make personnel changes now?...To
find out what happened, it's better to leave those who were in
charge in place," Fukui governor Yukio Kurita told reporters.
     Rethinking: Asahi reported 1/1 that Atomic Energy Commission
has decided to "rethink" the entire fast breeder program, which
happens to be the centerpiece of Japan's long-term nuclear energy
policy. The Monju experiment was supposed to lead to construction
of another and bigger fast breeder a decade hence, and commercial
operation of plutonium-fueled reactors by 2030. AEC, which is
headed by Science and Technology Agency Director Yasuoki Urano,
thinks Monju and its aftermath necessitate formation of "a new
national consensus," Asahi said.

Tomen, B&W to Build Nuclear Waste Disposal Plant for Old Russian
Submarines

     With funding from the Japanese government, Tomen and Babcock
& Wilcox will build a facility to process nuclear waste extracted
from old Russian submarines, Nihon Keizai reported 12/31. The
Russian Navy was found dumping used submarine reactor coolant in
the Sea of Japan in 1993 to Japan's great dismay (Digest 10/19-
22/93). The incident led Tokyo to agree to spend about $100
million in foreign aid funds to help Russia find a better way to
dispose of the waste. The fund, now managed by a joint Japanese-
Russian commission, will pay Tomen and B&W to build a Yen 2.5
billion ($25 million) floating disposal plant, to be moored next
to a submarine dismantling facility in Vladivostok. It will have
an annual processing capacity of 7,000 cubic meters of waste--
enough to process all waste coming from the submarines--5,000-
6,000 cubic meters a year--plus what's stored on land in the Far
East. Prime Minister Murayama will formally announce the project
during an atomic energy safety conference in Moscow April 19-20,
Nikkei said.

Hitachi Plans Yen 230 Billion in Chip Ventures in Singapore,
Kuala Lumpur

     Hitachi is planning Yen 230 billion ($2.2 billion) worth of
new chip ventures in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur that would high
density memories and CMOS chips, Nihon Keizai reported. The Yen
100 billion Singapore venture, with Nippon Steel and the Economic
Development Board of Singapore, will be capable of processing 20-
30,000 eight inch wafers a month to make 16-and 64-meg DRAMs
starting in mid-1998, the paper said. It would be Nippon Steel's
first venture into overseas electronics production. The company,
like much of the rest of the steel industry, has been trying to
diversify into electronics for several years, but without a whole
lot of success so far. The Kuala Lumpur project, a joint venture
with South Korea's LG Semicon, will build a Yen 130 billion chip
plant capable of processing 30,000 8-inch CMOS wafers a month
with 0.3 micron technology. The Malaysian news agency Bernama
said it will be located at Kulim, Kedah. The venture is due to be
organized in the spring, but when production would actually begin
wasn't given. In Tokyo Hitachi said Singapore venture will
eventually create 1,000 jobs.

U.S. Proposes Joint Electronics Weapons Component R&D With Japan

     The Pentagon has proposed a joint R&D program with Japan on
parts that go into weapons used by both countries, Yomiuri
reported 1/1. The proposal was made during bilateral talks in
October and November, and what the Pentagon has in mind is mainly
the electronics that go into such systems as the F-15 fighter,
the P3C anti-submarine patrol plane, and Aegis series destroyers
and cruisers, the paper said. While the U.S. objective is mainly
to share R&D costs, the Defense Agency also sees benefit in such
projects: They would increase interchangeability of weapons and
help deflect criticism about the one-way flow of weapons
technology from the U.S. to Japan, Yomiuri said. But the agency
also wants to limit the proposal for now to "research" rather
than "development" because it's worried that Socialist and
Sakigake politicians in the ruling coalition may object to it as
a violation of Japan's long-standing ban on weapons exports.

Jobless Rate Hit 3.4% in November; Miyazaki Claims It May Signal
`Recovery'

     The unemployment rate jumped to a new post-war high of 3.4%
in November, up 0.2% from where it had rested since June, the
Management and Coordination Agency announced 12/26. Particularly
hard hit were first-time job seekers aged 15-24, for whom the
rate was 6%, up from 4.8% a year ago. That's consistent with
other surveys indicating the difficulty next spring's high school
and college graduates face in finding jobs. But the Labor
Ministry also issued a contradictory statistic, showing a
fractional rise to 0.63 in the ratio of job openings to job
seekers, from 0.61 in October. That led a Labor Ministry briefer
to theorize that with the economy now out of the darkest part of
the tunnel, some people are deliberately quitting to look for
better jobs. As evidence he noted an MCA survey that showed
850,000 of the 2.18 million unemployed in November, up 100,000
from a year ago, said they'd quit of their own volition. The
number forced out of work was 560,000, up just 60,000. Economic
Planning Agency Minister Isamu Miyazaki ventured that "A rise in
the jobless rate can sometimes be seen in the initial stage of an
economic recovery." Still, Miyazaki predicted the jobless rate
will hover at 3-4% "for some time." Because most big companies
seem determined to continue "restructuring" workers out the door,
the Labor Ministry is planning "consultations" with the managers
of up and coming venture businesses to encourage them to raise
employment, Asahi and Nihon Keizai reported.

Matsushita to Begin Hiring in Fall as Well as Spring

     Matsushita will recruit in the fall as well as the spring
starting next year, to make it easier to hire experienced workers
and graduates returning from study abroad, Nihon Keizai reported
12/31. Though the Itoyokado supermarket chain started hiring in
the fall last September, and competitor Seiyu said recently it
will begin taking on people year round, Matsushita is one of the
first industrial companies to do so, Nikkei said. The example, it
added, may encourage other manufacturers to break up a rigid,
decades-old hiring pattern, in which almost all new workers start
their jobs April 1. Matsushita plans to take on 600-700 employees
in 1997, up from 500 each last year and this. About half the
increase, or up to 100 people, will be taken on in the fall. Sony
has been hiring a handful of returning graduates from abroad in
the fall, and Kao began offering research and sales jobs in the
autumn, last year.

Mitsubishi Corp. To Abolish Clerical Track for Women

     In a step toward gender equality in the workplace generated
as much by office automation as by sentiment, Mitsubishi Corp.
will abolish the long-standing jimu-shoku, or "clerical track"
under which thousands of women worked at low pay, with no hope of
advancement, Nihon Keizai reported. The trading giant will set
aside up to one third of its new-hire slots for women, the paper
said. But more important, Mitsubishi will encourage some of the
2,800 clerical-track women already on its payroll either to join
their 6,500 male colleagues on the sogo-shoku "comprehensive
[career] track," or to get on a new intermediate career track it
will create.  The reason, said Nikkei, is that personal computers
now perform many functions previously handled by clerks, making
the women redundant. If and when additional clerical help is
needed in future, the company will use temps, Nikkei said. The
plan, the paper added, is likely to be copied by other big
companies considering women for serious work. There is a
downside, however, in that it will reduce the total number of
female hires, making it even tougher for young women to find
employment, Nikkei said.

Population Growth in 1995 Fell To Lowest Level of Post-war Era

     With fewer births and more deaths, Japan's population grew
at the slowest rate in 50 years during 1995, the Health and
Welfare Ministry said 12/31. Based on Jan.-October figures, the
ministry estimated there were 1.123 million live births during
the year, down 45,000 from 1994, and the second lowest post-war
figure, after 1993. That translates into 9.6 births per 1,000
Japanese, about the same level as in 1993. Meantime deaths rose
40,000 from 1994 to 916,000, the highest figure since 1950. The
figures were particularly high in the first quarter because of
the Kobe earthquake Jan. 17, and a flu epidemic that struck last
winter. As a result, the population grew only 277,000, or 10.6%
less than the 310,000 recorded in 1993. There is a slight hope
for more births this year, based on the fact that there were
784,000 marriages in 1995, up 1,000 from 1994. The increase may
have been generated by a confluence of dates: This was the
seventh year of Heisei, Emperor Akihito's reign, and July 7th, or
Tanabata, is a romantic date in Japanese astrology. Yomiuri said
about 30,000 couples arranged to marry on that day so the date on
their marriage certificates would be "7/7/7."

AN INTERVIEW WITH JAPANESE AMBASSADOR TAKAKAZU KURIYAMA

SUMMARY
       Any change of administration in Washington puts Japanese government
leaders and business executives on the alert.  A Democrat in the White House
after 12 years of Republican rule transforms caution into wariness.  As Japan's
ambassador to the United States, Takakazu Kuriyama is uniquely positioned to
assess the impact on bilateral relations of the transition from George Bush to
Bill Clinton.  In a recent discussion with JEI Senior Political Analyst Barbara
Wanner the ambassador offered some observations certain to calm the jitters in
Tokyo.


Q.     What will Bill Clinton's election to president mean for U.S.-Japan
relations?  Do you anticipate any changes?

A.     No, I do not anticipate any basic change in our bilateral relations.
Prior to the election, however, some Japanese commentators expressed their
unease with Mr.  Clinton because he is not well known in Japan, even though he
visited a few times as governor of Arkansas.  Whenever there is a new president
there will be an understandable feeling of uneasiness among some Japanese,
which can be attributed to a fear of the unknown.  There also was apprehension
about Mr. Clinton because of the Japanese tendency to identify the Democratic
Party with more protectionist elements in the United States.  All in all,
however, it is my impression that the president-elect has a broad and balanced
international outlook, so we can expect basically a continuation of the
economic, trade and political-security policies pursued by the Bush
administration.  Too, there is a solid recognition on the part of responsible
American political leaders that the U.S.-Japan relationship is critical for
both countries as well as the world.  That is why I believe we will see policy
continuity.

Q.     What trade issues do you think the Bush administration and the Japanese
government successfully have tackled during the past four years and what issues
await the Clinton economic team?

 A.     In the latter part of the 1980s the Japanese government and the Bush
administration made substantial progress on the trade front until the recession
hit the Japanese economy.  If you examine the trade statistics you will see a
remarkable increase in Japan-bound U.S. exports as well as an increase in
Japanese direct investment in the United States [see Appendix].   This was a
sound start in building a more balanced and beneficial relationship between the
two countries.  Work still needs to be done in several areas, however, if this
economic realignment is to continue.

       One of the most important factors contributing to the favorable
developments in the second half of the 1980s was the exchange rate
realignment.  The increase in U.S. exports, of course, was prompted by the
appreciation of the yen, which made U.S. products more competitive in the
Japanese market.  As the yen strengthened, the Japanese government also made a
conscious effort to try to shift the economy's gears to take advantage of
developments in the currency markets by implementing a number of measures to
stimulate domestic demand; these had the effect of substantially increasing
imports.  In addition, Tokyo pursued a number of initiatives designed to
improve foreign access to the Japanese market.  These factors have led to a
substantial reduction in the trade imbalance.  With this solid foundation I
think the bilateral trade picture will continue to improve once the Japanese
economy picks up again.

Q.     Do you foresee any specific sectoral issues that may challenge the
Clinton administration in its first year?

A.     Automobiles, automotive parts and semiconductors, of course, still will
be on the trade agenda.  But these industries have engaged in collaborative
activities, and the Japanese government has sought to promote the purchase of
U.S.-made automobiles, automotive parts and semiconductors, which over time
should yield tangible results.  While I cannot forecast specific results for
the coming year I do hope that these issues no longer will create as much
friction in bilateral relations.  It is very important that Tokyo resolve these
sectoral disputes as soon as possible so that imports can increase and Japan's
current account surplus, which now is rising, can be contained.

Q.     Turning to the political-security side of U.S.-Japan relations, I
understand there is growing support in the Japanese government for the
formation of a new Asian Pacific security forum that would involve the key
players in this region.  How would that arrangement complement or possibly even
change the U.S.-Japan security relationship?

A.     We must recognize the change that now is taking place in the Asian
Pacific political-security structure with the end of the Cold War and the
collapse of the so-called bipolar power configuration.  But a great deal of
uncertainty still exists because of the economic and political problems in the
republics comprising the former Soviet Union, tensions on the Korean peninsula
and developments in China.  Tokyo continues to believe -- and I imagine the new
administration also will recognize -- that the U.S.-Japan security relationship
is essential to ensuring regional stability.  For this reason I do not see any
need for or any possibility of changing our bilateral security ties in the
foreseeable future.

       On the other hand, we have reached a stage where we need a multilateral
forum to enable Asian Pacific countries, including, of course, the United
States, the countries of ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations],
Australia, New Zealand and South Korea, to exchange views on a regional
security situation in which all of these countries have an interest.
Admittedly, their perceptions of what constitute security threats may not be
quite the same.  Still, these countries have a common interest in maintaining
political stability and peace in this part of the world.

       The Japanese government feels that it would be useful to have a
dialogue among these countries so that we can develop a common understanding
of the security situation in the Asian Pacific and have a better appreciation
for our respective policies.  Last year Tokyo proposed this kind of
multilateral dialogue using the forum of the so-called post-ministerial
conference of ASEAN [an annual meeting with ASEAN's foreign ministers and
their dialogue partners, which include the United States and Japan].  The
reaction of the ASEAN countries at that time was somewhat cautious.
Evidently, they did not understand what we were trying to do.  This year,
however, the ASEAN countries appeared more agreeable to this approach. We
think it would be in Japan's interest as well as the interests of the region
as a whole if we pursued this two-track approach of maintaining Japan-U.S.
security ties and promoting regional dialogue to ensure stability in the
Asian Pacific.

Q.     In some of the articles that you have written on challenges facing
U.S.-Japan relations you discuss the difference between burdensharing and
responsibility sharing.  Please elaborate on why this is important in the
post-Cold War era.

A.     The notion of burdensharing, rightly or wrongly, often is perceived by
many in Japan as meaning that the United States first establishes its policy
and then expects its friends to foot the bill.  We do not think that is the
right way to manage the bilateral relationship.  If Japan is to become an equal
partner, then we should share with the United States the responsibilities for
political peace and economic growth.  If Tokyo were to participate in the
policymaking process, it would be all the more natural for us to share the
costs accordingly.  We have been telling our American friends that on major
political and economic issues we should maintain very close consultations so we
can coordinate our policies.  If that is done, it would be legitimate for the
United States to ask Japan and other allies to share more of the burden.

       Tokyo's request to participate in the CSCE [Council for Security
Cooperation in Europe] process also reflects the Japanese government's desire
to share more responsibility for ensuring world peace, as does our push for a
permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.  We think that in due
course we will be awarded an appropriate place on the Security Council since we
are expected to play a more active role in the United Nations.

Q.     Speaking of responsiblity sharing and Japan's participation in the
United Nations, not long ago the Japanese government for the first time since
World War II dispatched members of the Self-Defense Forces to support the
U.N.-sponsored peacekeeping mission in Cambodia.  If there was another Persian
Gulf-type crisis, do you think Tokyo could respond more quickly in terms of
sending nonmilitary assistance now that this law is on the books?

A.     The new law authorizes Japanese participation in peacekeeping operations
under the aegis of the U.N.  In the case of the Persian Gulf war, of course,
there was a Security Council resolution condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Strictly speaking, however, Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm were not U.N.
operations; they involved coalition forces led by the United States.  Legally
the cases of Cambodia and the Persian Gulf are different.   But insofar as
U.N.-sponsored peacekeeping initiatives are concerned, the Japanese government
does not intend to limit our participation to Cambodia.  We are quite willing
to participate in similar operations outside of Asia.

Q.     In light of the conclusion of the North American Free Trade Agreement as
well as developments in the European Community, is the Japanese government
worried that the global trading system may break down into trading blocs that
would shut out Japanese goods -- particularly if the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade talks remains deadlocked?

A.     The Japanese government certainly is concerned about that possibility.
Obviously, we do not want to see the world breaking up into three or even more
trading blocs.  Japan has a huge stake in maintaining and strengthening an open
global trading system.  And with the world becoming increasingly interdependent
there is a much greater need for a common set of rules governing trade.  The
prospect of escalating frictions and bilateral and multilateral disagreements
in the absence of these rules, in fact, creates a strong incentive for bringing
the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion.  On that point Japan, the United
States and the European Community all agree.

JAPAN ECONOMIC INSTITUTE REPORT via NewsNet

FY 1993 BUDGET REVEALS FISCAL STRAINS by Jon Choy

       Moving quickly to counter Japan's sluggish economic conditions, the new
cabinet of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa signed off on a spending plan for FY
1993 that diverts greater resources to public works and other stimulative
categories at the expense of other spending options.  The public had mixed
reactions to this reallocation.  Some observers said that the plan, which won
cabinet approval December 26, represented the most the government could do
given the tight revenue picture, while others criticized it as having little
real effect on the economy.

       The government was able to hold to its pledge not to issue new bonds to
fund general operations in fiscal 1993 only by deferring some payments and
transferring some new borrowing to local governments.  This sleight of hand
underscores the need for major tax reform, according to Japanese analysts.
Given the current turbulent domestic political situation, however, prospects
for smooth passage of the spending package and action on more weighty tax
reforms in the upcoming Diet session, set to open January 22, are uncertain.

       The overall 0.2 percent increase to Y72.4 trillion ($57.8 billion) in
the initial general account budget for the 12 months beginning April 1 points
to the preoccupation that the Ministry of Finance has with holding the line on
spending.  The bare rise in outlays is the smallest since FY 1987's zero growth
but masks a solid 3.2 percent increase in discretionary spending (see Table 1),
although that is the smallest gain for the discretionary side of the budget
since FY 1990.  The growth was made possible, in part, by a 1 percent cut in
transfers to local governments and a stunning 6.1 percent drop in the cost of
servicing the national debt.  Nevertheless, MOF estimates that the total amount
of outstanding national debt will reach Y176 trillion ($1.4 trillion) by the
end of the current fiscal year and then climb another Y6 trillion ($48 billion)
over the next 12 months.

       From a more disaggregated standpoint the cabinet's spending plan for the
year beginning April 1 reflects steadily growing demands on Japan from the
international community as well as new imperatives to boost the sagging
domestic economy.  The difference between the Ministry of Finance's draft
budget and the budget approved by the cabinet is stark and surprising in some
cases (see Table 2).  While MOF granted some leeway to defense spending and the
foreign aid program, budget planners had the greatest change of heart for
education and science as well as social security funding.

       These latter categories each showed respectable increases compared with
the current fiscal year's initial budget, but their gains in the general
account budget placed well behind the 6.3 percent increase for public works and
the 5.7 percent rise for economic cooperation.  When all government spending is
considered, public works outlays will be 4.8 percent higher in FY 1993 than
what was planned initially for the current fiscal year (see Table 3).  General
account outlays for official development assistance will top Y1 trillion ($8
billion) for the first time.  Although defense spending will go up just under 2
percent -- far below the Japan Defense Agency's 3.6 percent target, that gain
is better than the 1.7 percent figure penciled into MOF's draft budget.

       Food control programs suffered the biggest percentage cut among
programs, leaving this line item at less than one-third its FY 1991 level.
(The extraordinary category referring to proceeds from the sale of Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. stock is not a program category.)

       As for individual programs, MOF listed the following highlights:

       --  About 7.1 percent more money will be spent in FY 1993 on social
infrastructure, bringing the total to over Y2.5 trillion ($20 billion).
       --  A five-year road improvement program will be launched in FY 1993,
with a total spending target of Y76 trillion ($608 billion).
        --  Government aid to retrain employees or to pay temporarily laid-off
workers will skyrocket to Y50.9 billion ($407.2 million) from Y0.9 billion
($7.2 million).
       --  The Global Environmental Fund will be initiated with Y1.5 billion
($12 million) in funding.
       --  The Japan Patent Office budget will be increased by 4.7 percent to
speed processing of applications, a commitment made to the United States in the
Structural Impediments Initiative talks.
       --  The immigration staff at the Ministry of Justice will be expanded by
84 percent or 168 employees to assist with the influx of foreign visitors and
undocumented workers.  Another Y1.1 billion ($8.8 million) is penciled in to
bolster efforts to control and manage the problem of illegal workers.
       --  Funding for AIDS education and care programs has received new
impetus and will total Y10.1 billion ($80.8 million) in the upcoming fiscal
year.
       --  Income support for rice farmers will be slashed by 25 percent to
Y101.3 billion ($810.4 million).
       --  A program to encourage small businesses to reduce employees' total
annual working hours will operate under funding earmarked at Y7.8 billion
($62.4 million).

       The revenue side of the FY 1993 general account budget reveals the
impact of sluggish Japanese economic activity and MOF's commitment to fiscal
austerity (see Table 4).  Tax and stamp receipts are projected to decline for
the first time in a decade, mainly due to a plunge in corporate profits and
much lower growth in personal incomes.  This is quite a reversal from the boom
years of the late 1980s when tax receipt estimates regularly were exceeded.
The amount of money transferred to public works projects funded by the sale of
government-held shares of NTT also will continue to dwindle; the government has
not replenished these funds since the last auction of NTT shares was held in
October 1988.  Given that the current price of NTT shares is only about
one-fourth its historic high, further sales have been put on hold.  Despite a
projected 23.4 percent rise in nontax revenues (mainly expected to come from
Bank of Japan foreign exchange operations), MOF will be forced to raise issues
of construction bonds by 11.7 percent.  This will push reliance on debt to 11.2
percent in FY 1993, up from the 10.1 percent level estimated for the current
fiscal year.

       The Fiscal Investment and Loan Program, a separately funded budget
directed mainly at capital spending, again will play an important role in the
government's effort to boost the economy (see Table 5).  FILP spending will
rise 12.2 percent to a record Y45.8 trillion ($366.4 billion) on the strength
of double-digit increases in nine of 13 categories.  While nearly all public
works-related categories will post solid gains, trade promotion and economic
cooperation (which funds the Japan Development Bank and the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund) will get a minuscule increase of just Y500 million ($4
million).  As for FILP funding (Table 6), the role of government trust funds
and life insurance monies deposited in the government-run postal bank system
will continue to grow.  FILP's reliance on debt financing, which is expected to
post a large jump after several years of cuts, further shows MOF's constraints
under the economic downturn.

       While government officials and ruling Liberal Democratic Party leaders
have stressed that the FY 1993 spending plan is the maximum that can be done at
this time, critics have focused on several points of the budget.  The sharp
drop in the cost of servicing the national debt, some argue, merely disguises
the deferral until next year of between Y700 billion and Y1.5 trillion ($5.6
billion to $12 billion) worth of payments.  Moreover, even though issues of
construction bonds are expected to be increased to the current legal limit, the
public sector's reliance on borrowing is understated because the central
government will cut tax revenue transfers to local governments while
simultaneously instructing them to boost their borrowings by 18 percent to a
projected record Y10.3 trillion ($82.4 billion).  The expected fall in income
tax receipts also highlights Tokyo's excessive dependence on direct taxes.
Some critics of the government plan are calling for both a boost in the 3
percent consumption tax and a cut in income taxes.  While the LDP and the
government have been discussing these moves, there is no sign that any official
proposals will be made on these issues.


       Some business leaders welcomed next year's budget, but others criticized
the proposed outlays as being too little, too late to revive the economy
quickly.  This unhappiness already has spurred Prime Minister Miyazawa to
suggest that a supplementary budget will be considered for the first half of FY
1993.  The scandal-plagued LDP, however, may encounter the same difficulties in
pushing the FY 1993 spending package through the Diet as it ran into when it
sought to win Diet approval of a large supplemental spending bill for the
current fiscal year (see JEI Report No. 43B, November 13, 1992).

INCREASE IN FY 1993 DEFENSE BUDGET SMALLEST IN 33 YEARS by Barbara Wanner

       Against a backdrop of reduced East-West tensions and recession-related
fiscal constraints the Japan Defense Agency's spending plans for FY 1993 and
beyond were hit hard by Ministry of Finance budget crunchers.  The cabinet
approved a plan December 18 that calls on JDA to slice some Y580 billion ($4.6
billion at Y125=$1.00) from the FY 1991-FY 1995 defense buildup program, which
was budgeted initially at Y22.8 trillion ($182 billion).  The five-year
program, which was based on annual spending increases of roughly 3 percent,
will take its first hit in the upcoming fiscal year.  At Y4.6 trillion-plus
($37.1 billion) in FY 1993, defense spending will be not quite 2 percent higher
than in the current fiscal year.  That increase is the smallest in 33 years.

       JDA was not unprepared for MOF-imposed belt-tightening.  Finance
Ministry officials had indicated in no uncertain terms during November that the
days were long gone of defense spending increases in the 5 to 6 percent range
(see JEI Report No. 44B, November 20, 1992).  In light of the apparent
diminution of the threat from the republics of the former Soviet Union as well
as an anticipated drop in tax revenues in the coming fiscal year even the 3.6
percent spending increase that JDA had proposed for FY 1993 could not be
justified, MOF maintained.  Finance officials initially wanted to slash up to
Y1 trillion ($8 billion) from the five-year defense program and hold FY 1993
spending to a mere 1.7 percent increase.

       Defense planners countered that cuts this substantial risked
jeopardizing attainment of the FY 1991-FY 1995 plan and, in turn, undermining
JDA's efforts to comply with the equipment and the manpower goals contained in
the National Defense Program Outline, the overarching blueprint for Japan's
self-defense strategy.  After two rounds of National Security Council meetings
and numerous cabinet-level discussions in December MOF evidently decided to
compromise on the cut in the five-year plan.  During subsequent budget talks
between defense planners and finance officials MOF also softened slightly on
FY 1993 defense spending.

       JDA officials evidently viewed those outcomes as the best they could
hope for, given domestic and international developments.  Defense planners
suspected when the FY 1991-FY 1995 plan was approved in December 1990 that
inclusion of a special provision requiring a review in FY 1993 could result in
leaner times at JDA if developments continued in line with what appeared to be
relaxed East-West tensions.  At the time JDA budget analysts estimated the
agency would be pressured to scale back spending in the last two years of the
five-year program.  Given the subsequent dissolution of the former Soviet Union
as well as the pinch on government revenues, Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa -- no doubt urged on by MOF -- decided to push up the timetable by one
year.

       Speaking to reporters following his Christmas Day discussions with
Finance Minister Yoshiro Hayashi, JDA director general Toshio Nakayama sought
to assure the Japanese defense community as well as Japan's allies that the
country's defense effort would not be compromised unduly by the tightening lid
on defense spending.  "Despite a very difficult fiscal situation and a downward
revision in the five-year program, we were given a sufficient budget in both
frontline military spending and for improving living facilities," Mr. Nakayama
reportedly said.  The defense chief added that the revision of the current
five-year plan is a "starting line" for a review of the National Defense
Program Outline.  Numerous commentators and politicians have been pressing for
a reevaluation of the 1976 blueprint on the grounds that its Cold War-based
strategy no longer is relevant to the current international environment.

       The defense chief's positive remarks belie the impact of the revised
FY 1991-FY 1995 plan on procurement of frontline military equipment, which will
bear the brunt of the revised spending plan.  Of the Y580 billion ($4.6
billion) carved from the FY 1991-FY 1995 plan, Y440 billion ($3.5 billion) had
been earmarked for frontline equipment purchases.  As a result, the Ground
Self-Defense Force will have funds for 108 new tanks rather than the 132 it had
planned to purchase; the Maritime Self-Defense Force will be able to procure
only 37 combat aircraft instead of 45; and the Air Self- Defense Force will get
funding for 29 F-15s, rather than 42.  The Table shows other, similarly severe
equipment cuts.  Training and rear support will receive Y60 billion ($185
million) less in funding than originally outlined by the five-year plan, while
projected personnel costs will be trimmed by Y80 billion ($205 million).

       Despite the tightening purse strings, Tokyo has decided to proceed with
the planned procurement of several big-ticket U.S.-made weapons systems.  Kept
in the FY 1991-FY 1995 plan are four AWACS (airborne warning and control
systems), 36 multiple launch rocket systems and two Aegis destroyers.  Two of
the AWACS will be purchased during FY 1993.  Although Japanese defense
officials maintain that these systems are needed to address certain weaknesses
in Japan's self-defense capabilities, some commentators contend that Tokyo felt
pressured by Washington to go through with these purchases for both strategic
and political reasons.  At Y57 billion ($456 million) apiece, the AWACS
procurement, for example, would put a dent in the U.S. trade deficit with
Japan, these analysts have remarked.  Mr. Miyazawa also had a personal
political incentive, according to some observers; he did not want to renege on
a commitment to outgoing President Bush that Japan would purchase the
sophisticated Boeing Co.-built radar aircraft.

       In any event, the government's decision to sacrifice the procurement of
other frontline equipment to finance expensive, U.S.-made systems has raised
more than a few eyebrows in Tokyo.  Some Japanese defense officials reportedly
are concerned that the AWACS purchases could force additional cuts in Air
Self-Defense programs as well as those of the other services.  "The huge
expense for the AWACS might destabilize the equipment balance among the three
services," according to a JDA official who did not want to be identifed.  Some
defense commentators question whether the AWACS, Aegis and MLRS really are
needed since the threat of the Soviet monolith no longer exists.

       Japan's defense industry, already feeling the sting of FY 1992
procurement slowdowns, has made its objections known regarding Tokyo's
reordered spending priorities.  Japan's six major aerospace
manufacturers -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy Industries,
Ltd., Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd., Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Co.,
Ltd., ShinMaywa Industries Ltd., and Japan Aircraft Manufacturing Co.,
Ltd. -- estimate that their total defense sales will decrease by 35 percent
from 1991 to 1998, forcing the transfer to other divisions or subsidiaries of
some 900 engineers and 1,400 plant workers currently working in their defense
aerospace divisions.

       As Japanese defense planners begin to reassess how the country's
security needs have changed since 1976, their analysis no doubt will be
complicated by the uncertain transition to a new world order, the global
economic slump and Japan's sluggish economy, a shrinking international defense
market and Tokyo's long-standing policy banning the export of weapons systems.
Those anticipating a timely evaluation of Japan's overall self-defense policy
and weapons development programs should not hold their breath.

JAPANESE AID TO SOMALIA

       Aid to Somalia - The Japanese government announced plans December 18 to
provide $100 million to the United Nations-sanctioned multinational forces
guarding distribution in Somalia of famine supplies for the 2 million people
thought to be at risk of starvation there.  Tokyo set no restrictions on how
the contribution to the Trust Fund for the Somalia-Unified Command can be
spent, government officials said.  The contribution will be disbursed from the
reserve fund of the FY 1992 general account budget.

       Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated that the
$100 million figure was determined based on the ministry's assessment of the
likely length of the multinational operation.  The funds augment the $27
million-plus Japan provided earlier in 1992 for humanitarian aid in Somalia and
for Somali refugees in the region (see JEI Report No. 45B, December 4, 1992,
and No. 46B, December 11, 1992).  Both Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and the
Foreign Ministry in late December urged other nations to support U.N. efforts
to raise $400 million for the costs of Somali operations.

       Tokyo also is considering sending personnel to Somalia and neighboring
countries to provide medical and other humanitarian assistance.  In
mid-December Yoshiji Nogami, deputy director general of the Foreign Ministry's
Middle Eastern and African Affairs Bureau, headed a mission to Somalia,
Ethiopia and Kenya to study the feasibility of such assistance.  Foreign
Minister Michio Watanabe has indicated that after reviewing the mission's
reports Tokyo will consider ways to channel direct help for refugee and medical
needs in Somalia and the region.  Japanese participation in U.N.-led
peacekeeping activities in Somalia also will be studied, Mr. Watanabe said.

NTT PROCUREMENT

       NTT Procurement - Washington and Tokyo quietly agreed December 22 to
renew for another three years a 1980 bilateral arrangement governing Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. procurement.  Although both sides had identified
some areas for change in the opening round of extension talks in mid-November,
the 1993-95 pact is a carbon copy of the one in effect from 1990 through last
year.  That leaves unresolved the question of whether NTT procurement will be
brought under the disciplines of the international government procurement code
if that code is renegotiated as part of a successful Uruguay Round.  The
Japanese government still hopes to make this switch, which encountered stiff
opposition from the Bush administration (see JEI Report No. 16B, April 24,
1992).  But, like the 1990-92 pact, the new arrangement merely provides for a
review of the bilateral accord should the long-running multilateral trade
negotiations be concluded.

       The American negotiating team proposed the straight extension of the
existing NTT procurement agreement in the third and final round of
discussions.  In the initial talks U.S. trade officials had indicated places
where the pact could be strengthened based on an eight-point list drafted by
the American Electronics Association.  Although Japanese negotiators said these
changes were unnecessary, they were willing to incorporate some of them in the
new arrangement.  In exchange, however, Tokyo wanted to exempt from certain
pact provisions products that NTT buys but later resells or leases.  This
exclusion, which was part of a tentative agreement reached in early December,
proved unacceptable to U.S. equipment suppliers.  They worried that it could
lock American companies out of important market segments, including, possibly,
equipment bought by the communications giant for resale or lease to its NTT
Mobile Communications Network Inc. and NTT Data Communications Systems Corp.
subsidiaries.

       Both companies previously had promised to adhere to the terms of the
bilateral procurement pact (see JEI Report No. 29B, July 31, 1992).  Officials
of NTT Power and Building Facilities Inc., which was spun off as wholly owned
subsidiary December 1, 1992, also have indicated that the firm will not
discriminate against foreign suppliers in its purchases.  With domestic
industry unwilling to rely solely on these assurances, U.S. trade negotiators
apparently concluded that a straight extension was the only way to resolve the
linkage problem.

GOVERNMENT ANTICIPATES SLOWER GROWTH IN FY 1993 by Douglas Ostrom

       Just on appearances, Tokyo could be forgiven for believing that its
official economic outlook for the fiscal year beginning April 1 is, if
anything, too pessimistic.  The 3.3 percent projected rise in
inflation-adjusted gross national product (see Table) is the lowest growth
estimate adopted by a cabinet since the dark days of December 1973 when, in the
midst of the first oil crisis, Tokyo put the economy's expected growth at 2.5
percent.  The FY 1993 figure, if achieved, would represent one of the lowest
rates of expansion over 12 months in postwar Japanese history.

       Some analysts -- apparently including some in government -- believe,
however, that Tokyo was insufficiently gloomy in its December 20 announcement.
In a twist on the usual bureaucratic wrangling that pits the conservative
Ministry of Finance against the fiscally aggressive Ministry of International
Trade and Industry, MOF and MITI reportedly ganged up on the Economic Planning
Agency in insisting that a figure of approximately 3.5 percent be used.  EPA
argued for a number around 3 percent on the grounds that the government's
economic outlook should be realistic.  A compromise developed at 3.3 percent.

       EPA has both history and private-sector experts on its side.  The
government's outlook consistently has failed to anticipate fully either severe
downturns in the economy or sharp upturns.  For example, the economy actually
contracted 0.2 percent in FY 1974, implying that even the gloomiest outlook of
the past two decades was too optimistic.  Similarly, in revising its FY 1992
real growth estimate to 1.6 percent slightly more than three months before the
fiscal year ends, Tokyo now admits that its initial outlook of 3.5 percent
growth was too rosy.  If the revised figure is approximately correct, the
increase in GNP during the current fiscal year will be the smallest since FY
1974.

Source:  Economic Planning Agency




       Twenty-one well-known private economic forecasters also made predictions
during December.  Their average estimate of real economic growth in FY 1993
came to 2.7 percent, with the range between 1.7 percent (Japan Research
Institute) and 4 percent (Daiwa Institute of Research).  This same group was
less optimistic a year ago about the prospects for FY 1992 than the government
but, on the assumption that the government's revised estimate for the year
through March 1993 is approximately correct, even these private-sector
forecasters were too optimistic at this time last year concerning FY 1992
growth.

       The disagreements among economists inside and outside government
concerning the likely direction of the Japanese economy are reflected in
differences over two key variables:  private plant and equipment spending plus
the current account surplus.  For example, the pessimistic Japan Research
Institute envisages a 3.4 percent drop next year in business investment.  By
contrast, the government expects a 2.4 percent rise.  Given the large weight of
private capital spending in the Japanese economy, this single category explains
most of the discrepancy between the least and the most optimistic forecasts.
In light of the fact that plant and equipment spending remained at historically
high levels in 1992 despite the rapid deceleration of overall growth, a further
correction may be in store, implying a substantial drop in FY 1993.  As a
result, even the most pessimistic of the private research organizations may
have too rosy a view of this key component of the economy.


       Those making higher forecasts of overall growth tend to expect smaller
external imbalances because imports are assumed to grow in sync with the
economy.  For example, the Japan Center for Economic Research, which expects 3
percent GNP growth, projects a current account surplus of $143.1 billion for FY
1993, far above the government's figure of $115.5 billion.  By contrast, EPA
officials now estimate that the current account surplus will reach $116.5
billion in the year through March 1993.

       Even the government's relatively upbeat numbers are not likely to please
the incoming Clinton administration despite the suggestion reported in the
press that the president-elect was very much on the minds of MOF and MITI
officials pushing for a higher projected GNP growth figure.  Slow growth in
Japan, coupled with the expected sluggishness of European economies, could put
a crimp in U.S. exports, one of the few bright spots during America's recent
recession.

       The government's FY 1993 economic outlook, unlike the projections
developed by private forecasters, did not assume any major policy changes.
JCER analysts, for example, built into their estimate the prediction that the
discount rate would be lowered an additional half point sometime in FY 1993 and
that the government would adopt a modest fiscal stimulus package in the coming
fiscal year.  In addition, an increasing number of business leaders are calling
for a substantial income tax cut.  Against this backdrop, the government's
optimistic economic outlook for FY 1993 marks a continuation, rather than the
end, of the prolonged debate concerning appropriate countercyclical economic
policy in Japan.

GROWING GLOBAL ROLE IN JAPAN'S FY 1993 FOREIGN AID BUDGET by Margo Grimm

       While the FY 1993 foreign aid budget did not emerge unscathed from the
budget deliberations of the past few months, spending for official development
assistance will show less of the strain imposed by Japan's current fiscal
difficulties than most areas of the general account budget (see preceding
articles).  Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials said that Prime Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa firmly supported a plan to increase the general account portion
of Japan's foreign aid budget beyond Y1 trillion ($8 billion at Y125=$1.00) for
the first time.  As approved by the cabinet December 26, the ODA outlays funded
through the general account will total Y1,014.4 billion ($8.1 billion) in the
year starting April 1.  A Ministry of Finance budget examiner responsible for
foreign aid asserted in a news conference prior to cabinet consideration of the
budget: "With these aid figures, Japan made the maximum fiscal effort to live
up to its obligation to help developing nations despite its severe fiscal
situation."

       The FY 1993 foreign aid budget's 6.5 percent increase over the
comparable FY 1992 figure is more than double the expansion in total
discretionary spending.  Even so, that growth rate is the lowest for foreign
aid spending since the 6.5 percent rise posted in FY 1988.  Next year's 6.5
percent figure represented a compromise between the 9.7 percent increase
requested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Finance Ministry's efforts
to restrict the growth of spending.  The draft budget issued by the Finance
Ministry held the increase in ODA expenditures to 4.7 percent, but in a
December 25 meeting Finance Minister Yoshiro Hayashi agreed to Foreign Minister
Michio Watanabe's request to restore certain foreign aid funds cut during the
compilation of the budget.  Mr. Watanabe said that, among other things, the two
ministries negotiated an increase in the funds budgeted for bilateral grants to
Y243.1 billion ($1.9 billion), 6.7 percent more than allocated for the current
fiscal year.

       The Y1 trillion-plus ($8.1 billion) authorized for foreign aid in the
general account budget will be supplemented by Y675 billion ($5.4 billion) from
the Fiscal Investment and Loan Program, which mainly funds capital projects.
The Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, which oversees the concessionary loan
portion of Japan's economic assistance, will disburse this money as part of its
Y930 billion ($7.4 billion) lending program for the next fiscal year.

       The expansion of Japan's foreign aid budget for FY 1993 allows for
increased outlays in several categories, although some areas have been
trimmed.  Technical assistance, for example, is slated to grow 7.6 percent to
Y210.2 billion ($1.7 billion).  The Y147.7 billion ($1.2 billion) budgeted for
the United Nations and other international humanitarian organizations
represents a 0.2 percent drop, however, from the current fiscal year's level.
Among specific U.N. agencies to benefit from increased funding in FY 1993 will
be the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which is targeted to get Y10.1
billion ($80.8 million), a boost of 4.7 percent, and the U.N. Children's Fund,
which is to receive Y3.3 billion ($26.4 million), a 0.2 percent increase in
dollar terms.

       According to Japanese news reports, the Finance Ministry's foreign aid
budget examiner noted that Tokyo will disburse in addition to official
development assistance $5.3 million-plus to support U.N. peacekeeping
activities in FY 1993, more than double the amount appropriated for the current
fiscal year.  These funds will come from the Foreign Ministry portion of the
budget and will be separate from anticipated Japan Defense Agency expenditures
for the support of U.N. peacekeeping operations.

       Observers note that the Japanese government's plans to increase official
development assistance outlays in the next fiscal year reflect a recognition
that its contributions to the international community should match its economic
standing.  Alluding to the diverse objectives that factored into the drafting
of the FY 1993 spending plan, one Foreign Ministry official commented, "Japan
can impress the world of the seriousness of its international contributions
only by increasing the ODA budget."  Japan's commitment to meeting growing
global needs is expected to be spotlighted when the seven major industrial
democracies meet in Tokyo in July.

       International expectations for Japan's aid program have grown in tandem
with its expansion.  Tokyo's current foreign aid projections for the 1993-97
period are for outlays of $75 billion.  The Japanese government also is working
to address questions about the quality of its economic assistance (see JEI
Report No. 46A, December 11, 1992).  At the same time the growing demand for
resources worldwide coincides with domestic economic problems; that raises
issues of balance regarding domestic concerns and escalating foreign aid
expenditures.  As Japanese decisionmakers take these matters under
consideration, the focus of attention will point to how broadly Japan is
mapping out plans for greater international cooperation.

Japan Securities Finance to ease mortgage requirements+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan Securities Finance Co. said Monday it will ease mortgage
requirements in bond trading to lessen the burden on borrowers,
effective Jan. 5.
     Japan's leading securities financing company said the assessment
value of collateral to be offered by borrowers will be lowered to 102%,
above market value from the present rate of at least 105%.
     The company said the decision is in line with deregulation
implemented by the Finance Ministry and the Japan Securities Dealers
Association.
     Osaka Securities Finance Co. will take a similar step, company
sources said.

Stock market rebound reflects gov't policy, says official+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The recent rebound in stock prices reflects the government's
economic and financial policy, Vice Finance Minister Kyosuke
Shinozawa said Thursday.
     The market must have responded to the Finance Ministry's policy
actions, especially to policy for liquidating ailing housing loan
companies, Shinozawa told a news conference.  ''That's very
welcome,'' he said.
     The key stock market gauge topped 20,000 Wednesday in Tokyo for
the first time since October last year.

Kankaku Securities to shut down L.A. branch+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Japanese brokerage house Kankaku Securities Co. said Thursday
it will shut down its branch in Los Angeles at the end of this year
in line with its restructuring program.
     The Tokyo-based company said operations at the branch, with a
staff of two, will be transferred to the head office of its U.S. unit
in New York.
     The closure will reduce the company's overseas business bases to
nine -- five subsidiaries, one branch and three representative
offices.

Greater disclosure needed by firms listing on new mart++

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     More information needs to be disclosed by firms looking to list
their shares on a newly created section of the over-the-counter
(OTC) stock trading market as these companies may be fast-growing
but also have poor management, industry sources said Thursday.
     In addition to greater disclosure, brokerages will need to be
more discerning and more responsible when underwriting the shares of
these companies listing on the ''frontier market,'' they said.
     Already, two out of 31 companies expected to be registered for
OTC trading launched in July, have gone bankrupt after twice
dishonoring bills.
     The firms -- a Tokyo-based water processing plant operator and a
Yokohama-based computer development company -- were included in the
31 firms designated by the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) as subject to a new law designed to promote venture
businesses.
     The ministry is unfazed by the bankruptcy of the two firms.
''They are venture businesses, and some are apt to fail,'' one
ministry official said.
     The company failures make it only clear, however, that it is
difficult for the ordinary investor to predict the future of venture
businesses, and that more corporate data is necessary, industry
sources said.
     The frontier market was launched by the Japan Securities Dealers
Association with the aim of making it easier for entrepreneurial
companies to raise funds by relaxing the rules of stock registration.
     Next year, similar markets will be set up within the Tokyo Stock
Exchange and other domestic exchanges.

Levi Strauss Japan to pay 120 yen per share dividend+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Levi Strauss Japan K.K., the Japanese subsidiary of the world's
largest apparel maker, said Thursday it will pay a year-end dividend
of 120 yen per share for its business year ended in November.
     The Tokyo-based company said the payment will consist of a 42
yen regular dividend and a 78 yen special payout.
     The dividend ratio is 2.4 times the par value of 50 yen.
     The company said the dividend amount was decided by taking into
account a fair distribution of profits, including a share for
internal reserves.

Local gov'ts to issue 13% more bonds in FY' 96+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's local governments plan to issue a record 18,110.3
billion yen worth of bonds in fiscal 1996, which begins next April
1, up 13.0% over the current year, the biggest-ever growth rate, the
Home Affairs Ministry said Monday.
     The funds will be used to cover residential tax reductions of
1,642.5 billion yen and to invest in 2,030.0 billion yen worth of
public works, the ministry said.
     The public debt accounts for 15.2% of the local governments'
combined expenditures, up 1.5 percentage points from the previous
year, it said.
     The public works to be jointly carried out by central and local
governments include 270 billion yen for reinforcing buildings for the
public use against a big earthquake like the Jan. 17 Kobe quake,
according to the ministry.

Speculators buy bankrupt Hyogo Bank shares on TSE+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The bankrupt Hyogo Bank topped the list of most active stocks
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Monday as speculators engaged in a
heavy ''money game,'' traders said.
     They said an estimated 12.8 million shares were traded despite
the bank's delisting, set for Jan. 29 next year, boosting the price
of its stock to 2.00 yen per share, double its Friday closing of 1.00
yen.
     Hyogo Bank's operations will be transferred to newly inaugurated
Midori Bank early next year.

Long-tern bank forecasts 2.3% economic growth in FY '96+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan forecast Tuesday that
Japan's economy will grow 2.3% in real gross national product (GDP)
terms in fiscal 1996, led by recovery of capital investment.
     The bank report, however, said the recovery will be moderate.
     ''The recovery itself will make the transition from reliance on
public investment in the first half to self-sustainable recovery led
by private-sector demand in the second half,'' it said.
     The bank said capital investment will improve and the previous
adverse influence caused by an investment slump which has held back
growth in recent years will be eliminated.
     Public investment will support the economy through the first
half of fiscal 1996 while consumption, which has been restrained,
will improve.
     The bank, however, said the recovery depends largely on how well
the transition from a recovery supported by public investment to one
supported by private demand can be managed in the latter half of the
fiscal year.
     It said Japan's current account surplus will continue to shrink,
declining to 97 billion dollars in fiscal 1996 from 113 billion
dollars in fiscal 1995 and 124 billion dollars in fiscal 1994.
     In fiscal 1995, which ends March 31, 1996, the strong yen will
limit growth to 1.2%, compared with a 0.5% rise in the preceding
year, the bank said.

BOJ to inspect New York units of several Japanese banks++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Bank of Japan said Tuesday it will complete a series of
emergency inspections of the New York branches of half of Japan's 21
major commercial banks by the spring of 1996.
     Earlier this month, the central bank inspected three of the New
York branches of some 10 Japanese banks selected for an emergency
inspection, the central bank said.
     BOJ inspectors have detected some defects in the three banks'
risk management, central bank officials said.
     The planned inspections are designed to prevent a recurrence of
an incident similar to the Daiwa Bank scandal, in which Daiwa's
senior management is charged with ordering a cover-up for the 1.1
billion dollar bond trading loss at its New York branch.
     As a result, Daiwa was ordered by the Federal Reserve Board to
get out of the United States by Feb. 2.
     The 10 banks selected by the central bank have a relatively high
dependence on overseas banking operations.  The 21 banks comprise 11
''city banks,'' three long-term credit banks and seven trust banks.
     In a parallel step, the central bank will increase by seven to
20 the number of banks whose overseas branches are obligated to
accept a triennial inspection of their financial records and risk
management systems by BOJ inspectors, the central bank said.
     Among Japan's 21 major commercial banks, only Nippon Trust Bank
will be exempt from the new obligation, it said.
     The triennial inspection will cover the Hong Kong branches of
these 20 banks, on top of the central bank's current requirement that
the banks' New York and London branches be subjected to its triennial
examination.
     The central bank will draw up by next spring a list of checkup
points for reference by inspectors, according to which the inspectors
will examine the commercial banks' financial records and risk
management systems.
     The Bank of Japan will also make the ''check list'' available to
financial institutions, it said.
     The announcement came as Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura
unveiled a set of measures to help Japanese banks strengthen their
risk management and auditing systems as a way to prevent questionable
financial deals as in the Daiwa Bank scandal.

Creditors to be lenient toward failed Hyogo Bank+

OSAKA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Creditors have offered to allow the bankrupt Hyogo Bank to
recover about 20% of its claims on 16 nonbanking affiliates which
have applied for liquidation, financial sources said Tuesday.
     The sources said the creditors plan to hold another meeting next
spring to adopt a final agreement on the dismantling of the 16
affiliates of Hyogo Bank.
     Normally, the founding banks are required to abandon all claims
on the dissolved nonbanking affiliates to take responsibility for
their failures.
     The sources said Hyogo Bank may be allowed to lay claim to
about 20% of about 292.7 billion yen worth of loans to the failed
affiliates whose total liabilities are estimated at 1,545.1 billion
yen.
     The nonbanks have asked creditors to give up as much as 80% of
their claims due to a sharp fall in property prices, they said.
     The balance will be settled over a period of about five years,
the sources said.

Norinchukin Bank to go into red, farm minister says+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Norinchukin Bank, the core institution for agricultural
cooperatives, will plunge into the red in fiscal 1995 in connection
with the planned liquidation of housing loan firms, the farm
minister said Tuesday.
     Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries Minister Hosei Norota told
a regular cabinet meeting that about 20 financial organs under the
Mutual Credit Fund Association of Agricultural Cooperatives will also
lose money because of the housing loan firm fiasco.
     Financial institutions affiliated to agricultural cooperatives
are major creditors of the home mortgage loan companies, seven of
which are to be liquidated under a government scheme.
     The government's plan calls for the farm-linked institutions to
shoulder only some 530 billion yen of the liquidation losses
amounting to 6.41 trillion yen.
     The farm ministry will study the matter from early next year,
Norota said.
     In the past three years, 325 billion yen has been furnished to
the housing loan companies by the agricultural institutions in the
form of cuts in interest payments, Norota said.
     The burden of the 530 billion yen would undermine the farm
financial institutions' business standing as their internal reserves
are extremely small and their profit margins are also small, Norota
said.
     If they are required to take an additional financial burden,
they can not survive, which would create credit turmoil in Japan, he
said.

Tokai Bank may issue preferred stock+

NAGOYA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Tokai Bank may issue preferred stock if the domestic stock
market recovers in order to increase funds on hand, the president of
the Nagoya-based major commercial bank said Tuesday.
     By issuing preferred shares, the bank aims to keep its
capital-adequacy ratio from deteriorating in writing off
nonperforming loans to moribund mortgage companies, Satoru Nishigaki
said at a press conference.
     Preferred stock is guaranteed priority over common stock in
the payment of dividends to shareholders.
     Commenting on rumors that Tokai Bank may absorb Chuo Trust and
Banking Co. which belongs to the Tokai Bank group, Nishigaki said
''There is no likelihood of Tokai absorbing Chuo Trust in the
near future.''
     He said Chuo Trust's management condition will not worsen so
much in writing off its bad loans to the mortgage companies as trust
banks are expected to be allowed to use their special reserve funds
for guaranteeing the principals of their trust assets, in order to
make up for losses resulting from the write-offs.

IC, paper makers to enjoy good business in '96+

NAGOYA, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Tokai Bank predicted Thursday that Japanese integrated circuit
(IC) and paper makers will continue to enjoy a good business
environment in 1996.
     The bank's ''industrial weather forecast'' described the outlook
for IC makers as clear and that of paper makers as fair.
     The company based its forecast on brisk demand for personal
computers and paper for computer handling manuals and merchandise
catalogs.
     The business environment will improve slightly for automobiles,
machine tools and retail industries due to restructuring of their
operations and recovery of consumer spending, the bank said.
     Conditions will worsen for home electrical appliances and
housing industries in view of a continuing production shift overseas
and declining housing starts, it said.

Daiwa's N.Y. branch ex-manager indicted on conspiracy++

NEW YORK, Dec. 27 Kyodo

     A former manager of the New York branch of Japan's Daiwa Bank,
was indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday on charges of
conspiring to defraud the Federal Reserve Board by allegedly
assisting in a cover-up of 1.1 billion dollars in trading losses.
     The federal indictment against former branch manager Masahiro
Tsuda includes a charge of failure to report a felony.  If convicted,
he faces up to eight years in prison and a fine of 500,000 dollars.
     Tsuda was arrested and first brought up on charges Nov. 2, which
led to an indictment against Daiwa Bank and the closing of its 15
branches in the United States.
     Tsuda was freed on a 500,000 dollar bond and is scheduled to be
arraigned Jan. 4.
     Wednesday's indictment, returned by a federal grand jury in
Manhattan, replaces the original criminal complaint filed by the U.S.
Attorney's Office and further details Tsuda's alleged role in the
conspiracy.
     The charges describe how Tsuda allegedly concealed 1.1 billion
dollars in trading losses incurred by the branch's former executive
vice president, Toshihide Iguchi, through unauthorized trading in
U.S. securities over a 12-year period.
     Iguchi was arrested Sept. 23 and later pleaded guilty to fraud
and embezzlement charges, and is awaiting sentencing.
     The indictment alleges that Tsuda failed to report Iguchi's
crimes to the Fed between July, when he first learned about the
losses, and September.
     Tsuda's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, called the charges ''unwarranted
and unjustified.''
     ''Mr. Tsuda sought to be law abiding...and act consistently with
what his employer and the Japanese Ministry of Finance determined was
the only appropriate course here -- that a thorough investigation of
Iguchi's extraordinary trading loss be conducted before a report was
filed with U.S. regulators,'' Arkin said in a statement.
     According to the indictment, Tsuda met with Iguchi and other
senior managers to discuss ways of further concealing the losses.  It
said Tsuda considered a plan to hide the losses through a Cayman
Islands entity and asked an employee to figure out a way to
repurchase securities that Iguchi had sold so that it would appear
the losses had not occurred in New York.
     Prosecutors allege that Tsuda postponed an internal audit in
late August by ordering Iguchi to take a vacation so that the losses
would not be discovered.  Iguchi did not actually take a vacation but
actually went to Tsuda's apartment to meet with a small group of
managers to review all the records of his unauthorized trading and
reconstruct the trading losses, the indictment claims.
     The indictment alleges that two Daiwa employees repeatedly
warned Tsuda that the bank was required to report the loss to the
Fed but that Tsuda refused, telling them he would take full
responsibility if the matter was discovered.

Ex-Im Bank to extend 24 bil. yen loan to Ukraine+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The Export-Import Bank of Japan signed agreements Thursday to
extend a 24 billion yen loan to the Republic of Ukraine to help
stabilize the country's economy, the government-financed bank said.
     The bank said 18 billion yen will be an ''untied'' loan, which
allows the recipient nation to purchase necessary goods and services
from not only Japan but other countries.
     The remaining 6 billion yen will be used to finance the
country's exports, the bank said.
     The loan is in line with an agreement reached at the Naples
summit of the Group of Seven major industrial nations in July 1994 to
provide Ukraine with a total of 4 billion dollars in loans, the bank
said.  Japan pledged to put up 200 million dollars of the total.

S and P lowers Fuji rating, revises Sakura, IBJ outlooks+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Prolonged concern over Japan's banking system, plagued by bad
loans, led Standard and Poor's on Thursday to lower the debt ratings
of Fuji Bank and revise downward its outlook for the ratings of
Sakura Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ).
     S and P put Fuji Bank's senior debt rating at A-minus in light
of ''the length and severity of the problems facing the Japanese
banking sector'' as well as ''the bank's large problem loans,'' the
Japanese arm of the U.S. credit rating agency said.
     The outlook for the long-term rating is negative because the
bank's asset value could face further erosion and it is uncertain
when the nation's banking environment will improve, the agency said.
     Meanwhile, S and P revised its outlook for the senior ratings of
the IBJ and Sakura Bank to ''negative'' from ''stable'' due mainly to
the impact of a planned write-off of their exposure to ailing
mortgage lenders, it said.
     Sakura's long-term debt is currently rated A-minus by the
agency, while the IBJ's has an A-plus rating.

Bank managements looking to freeze salaries next spring++

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The managements of major commercial banks are intending to head
off rises in employee salaries during wage negotiations next spring
in hopes of keeping operating costs down, industry sources said
Friday.
     In addition to the need to stay competitive in the increasingly
globalized financial markets, the industry's unprecented plan to
freeze salaries is spurred by public criticism that salaries at banks
are high in comparison with other industries, the sources said.
     Criticism about the salaries of bank workers arose after the
government decided to use 685 billion yen in taxpayers' money to help
liquidate seven financially strapped housing loan companies.
     As a result of writing off losses stemming from the liquidation
of the mortgage firms, some banks are likely to post unconsolidated
pretax losses for fiscal 1995 ending March next year.
     At the same time, however, net operating profits at the
commercial banks are likely to rise to an all-time high due to
record-low interest rates which have reduced fund-raising costs.
     Labor unions at the banks are expected to strongly oppose the
attempts to freeze salaries.  ''They should first cut the bonuses of
executives,'' one labor union official at a major commercial bank
said.
     The labor unions are nevertheless expected to negotiate for much
smaller wage hikes than in the previous year as consumer prices have
declined.  In 1995, the benchmark Tokyo consumer price index fell for
the first time since 1970, declining 0.3% from the preceding
year.
     During spring negotations this year, the labor unions asked for
a rise of 1.0% and finally settled for a 0.5% increase.

Budget investment plan shows 2nd lowest rise++

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government endorsed the fiscal 1996 investment and loan
program Monday, calling for the second lowest rise ever against the
background of weak corporate cash demand and a trend toward limiting
the role of governmental corporations.
     The investment and loan program for fiscal 1996 was approved by
the cabinet of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama at an extraordinary
cabinet meeting Monday.  The program will be presented for approval
by the Diet at a regular parliamentary session starting in late
January.
     The government plan earmarks 40,533.7 billion yen for the core
general category of the investment and loan program for the year
beginning April 1, up 0.7% from the initial program for fiscal 1995.
     The figure was revised up 80.4 billion yen from the 40,453.3
billion yen in the Dec. 20 draft program after relevant government
ministries and agencies renegotiated it with the Finance Ministry to
restore their requests.
     Still, the growth represents the second lowest year-on-year
rise since the program started in fiscal 1953, following the 1.2%
fall in fiscal 1985, a Finance Ministry official said.
     The core program expanded 7.7% in fiscal 1994 and 2.1% in the
current fiscal year.
     Under the investment and loan program, often described as a
second state budget, funds raised from state-run postal savings and
insurance systems as well as public pension programs are invested in,
or lent to, government-affiliated corporations.
     The overall investment and loan program -- the core program
plus financial investment operations -- totals 49,124.7 billion yen,
up 1.9% from the initial program for the current fiscal year, which
envisaged a 0.7% growth.
     The increase compares with a draft 0.3% rise.  The upward
revision came mainly because allocations for financial investment
were raised to 8,591 billion yen, up 700 billion yen from the draft
stage.
     The 700 billion yen goes into the new account of a government
corporation managing postal insurance funds to bring the total
allocation for the account to 1.7 trillion yen.
     The portfolio was established in 1992 to invigorate sluggish
share prices.  The government earmarked 2 trillion yen for this
purpose in fiscal 1993, but the figure slid to 1.5 trillion yen
in fiscal 1994 from 1 trillion yen in fiscal 1995.
     ''The account chalked up a turnaround from recent declines
because of current stock market conditions,'' the official said.
     By project, the government earmarks 12,143.3 billion yen in the
core program for housing-related projects, up 1.2%.
     Housing Loan Corp. will receive 10,909.8 billion yen, up 2.6%,
to provide loans for 630,000 home purchases in fiscal 1996 as
envisaged in the government's five-year home construction scheme
beginning next fiscal year.
     The budget for projects related to small businesses falls 12.6%
to 5,506.6 billion yen after a 5.1% growth in fiscal 1995, the
ministry said.
     Allocations to the government-affiliated Small Business Finance
Corp. are down 27.3% to 1.87 trillion yen for the first decline
since fiscal 1986.  The allocation was raised 3.4% in the fiscal
1995 budget.
     The Finance Ministry said the lower allocation resulted from the
downtrend in corporate cash demand.
     But the decline also reflects falling demand for funds from
public corporations, with the fiscal investment and loan program rate
-- at which the government borrows money from postal savings and
other sources -- hovering above the private-sector long-term prime
lending rate.
     To develop social infrastructure to improve daily life, the
government allocates 8.73 trillion yen to local authorities, up 21.5%.
     Of the figure, 450.3 billion yen will go to providing water
services, up 12.6%, 1,495.2 billion yen will be spent on sewage
treatment, a rise of 12.9%, and 213.8 billion yen will be used to
build public housing units, up 26.5%.
     Some government-affiliated corporations have been criticized by
the private sector, which is demanding that the corporations should
do no more than supplement private-sector operations.
     Under these circumstances, Japan Development Bank, whose
operations are to be scaled back, will receive 1,434 billion yen from
the investment and loan program under the ministry draft, down 24.8%
from fiscal 1995.
     The Export-Import Bank of Japan will have its allocation reduced
by 17.1% to 1.07 trillion yen.
     Meanwhile, the government earmarks 402.7 billion yen for Social
Welfare and Medical Service Corp., up 19.4%, to step up loans for
building nursing homes and other facilities for the elderly under
its 10-year ''gold plan'' welfare policy.
     On the transportation front, the government allots 21.3 billion
yen to Kansai International Airport Co., up 153.6%.  Of that amount,
700 million yen will be used to start constructing more runways at
the airport, which serves Osaka and opened in September 1994.
     The government sets aside 1,004.7 billion yen for JNR Settlement
Corp., up 10.4%.
     The corporation is disposing of a 26 trillion yen debt incurred
by the former state-run Japanese National Railways (JNR) by selling
land and shares in the seven private rail companies into which JNR
was split when privatized in 1987.
     In October, the government called off its plan to seek a stock
listing for West Japan Railway Co., one of the seven privatized
railway firms, within the current fiscal year to avoid upsetting the
sluggish equity market.

financier for local public corporations to 10,418 billion yen, up
21.5%, to help improve local government finances and develop
social infrastructure.
     -- Spending 4.6 trillion yen outside regular financial
investment accounts to take in government bonds for ensuring the
smooth sale of state bonds on the market.

Gov't plans 4,845.5 bil. yen defense budget for FY '96+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government Monday proposed allocation of 4,845.5 billion
yen for the defense budget in fiscal 1996 starting April 1, allowing
a 2.58% increase over the initial budget for the current fiscal year.
     The year-on-year increase is a sharp rise compared with the
35-year low of 0.855% in the current fiscal 1995 that had an initial
defense budget of 4,723.6 billion yen.
     The rate of the year-on-year increase expanded for the first
time in six years after rises of 0.9% in fiscal 1994, 1.95% in 1993,
3.8% in 1992, 5.45% in 1991 and 6.1% in 1990.
     The increase is largely due to the 6.1% jump, to 1,778.8
billion yen, in payments for equipment bought previously but to be
paid for in fiscal 1996, such as aegis ships and the airborne
warning and control system.
     Other than the due payments, the proposed budget is composed of
2,076 billion yen for personnel expenditures and 990.7 billion yen
for other general expenses.
     Because of the sharp rise in the due payments, the government
has made efforts to restrain the defense budget as much as possible,
a Finance Ministry official said.
     The proposed budget sets aside 835.2 billion yen in fresh
contracts, a major part of which will be paid in fiscal 1997 or
later, to procure hardware such as tanks, fighters and destroyers, a
1.2% rise over contracts for fiscal 1995.
     The sum for such equipment shows its first increase in six
years, but if the effect of the planned rise of the 3% consumption
tax to 5% is excluded, the 1996 figure for such equipment is 820
billion yen, or a year-on-year decrease of 0.6%, the official said.
     The fiscal 1996 hardware procurement contracts include those for
11 F-2 planes -- once called the FSX next-generation support fighter
-- four F-15 fighter interceptor planes, 18 tanks, a destroyer and a
submarine.
     Under the government plan, Japan's host-nation support in fiscal
1996 for U.S. forces stationed in Japan will cost 273.5 billion yen,
a 0.8% increase over the current fiscal budget.
     The sum includes costs to move a U.S. night landing practice
site from the Atsugi base in Kanagawa Prefecture to Iwojima Island in
the Pacific, aside from wages for Japanese employees at U.S. bases
and utility fees for U.S. military facilities.
     The budget plan also consists of 153.9 billion yen in
expenditures for residents around military bases, a 2.9% decrease
over the current fiscal year, such as soundproofing their houses,
85.4 billion yen for training, 6.8 billion yen to build a central
command control system in a new Defense Agency building, 2.7 billion
yen to establish a unified information headquarters, and 201 million
yen for security dialogue and related works with nearby countries.
     The proposal includes 139.8 billion yen in contracts for
research and development of new midrange surface-to-air guided
missiles and rescue flying boats, 440 million yen in contracts to
research the so-called theater missile defense system, and 146.1
billion yen in contracts to improve facilities for housing personnel.
     The planned budget expenditure accounts for 0.968% of Japan's
500.7 trillion yen gross national product (GNP) as estimated by the
government for fiscal 1996.
     The 1996 defense outlays are the first annual defense budget
under the fiscal 1996-2000 Midterm Defense Buildup Plan, which calls
for a total of 25.15 trillion yen in defense expenditures during the
period.

Gov't ministers to discuss 'jusen' issues Tue.+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Government ministers concerned will meet Tuesday to discuss
measures to dispose bad loans on the nation's seven ailing ''jusen''
housing loan companies and disclosure of information related to the
problem, Chief Cabinet Secretary Koken Nosaka said Monday.
     The government is under fire over its plan to use 685 billion
yen under the fiscal 1996 budget to liquidate the companies, saddled
with huge problem loans during the asset-inflated bubble economy in
the late 1980s.
     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama told Monday's meeting of senior
officials from the government and the three ruling parties earlier in
the day his cabinet will try to gain public support for the use of
taxpayers' money, according to Deputy Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki
Sonoda said.
     The cabinet needs to provide various types of information to
the public rather than just making arguments, Sonoda quoted Murayama
as saying.
     Masajuro Shiokawa, chairman of the Executive Council of the
largest ruling coalition member Liberal Democratic Party, asked the
government to set timetables for the bad loan disposal under the
liquidation scheme of the seven ailing home mortgage companies,
announced last week.
     Takanobu Nagai, chairman of the Diet Administration Committee of
the Social Democratic Party (SDP) which is led by Murayama, said that
before an ordinary Diet session convenes on Jan. 22, the parliament
will discuss whether to set up a special committee on the housing
loan problem.
     The House of Councillors hopes to discuss the matter on Jan. 17
during a Finance Committee meeting, said Hisamitsu Sugano, chairman
of the upper chamber Diet Administration Committee of the SDP.

Gov't adopts 75.1 tril. yen budget plan for FY '96++

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government adopted a 75.1 trillion yen budget for fiscal
1996 on Monday, calling for issuing a record 21.03 trillion yen in
government bonds that will further tighten Japan's already strained
fiscal conditions.
     The draft general account budget for the fiscal year beginning
next April totals 75,104.9 billion yen, up 5.8% from the initial
budget for fiscal 1995.
     The draft budget, adopted at an extraordinary meeting of the
cabinet of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in the afternoon, will be
submitted to the ordinary Diet session that starts in late January.
     At a press conference after the meeting, Finance Minister
Masayoshi Takemura said, ''The government has compiled the fiscal
1996 budget, basically giving consideration to the Japanese economy
which remains at a standstill.''
     ''There is a wide gap between expenditures and tax revenues and
how to remove it will be a task for budget compilation in fiscal
1997,'' he said.
     To help shore up Japan's sluggish economy, the budget calls for
relatively high growth of 4.0% in overall expenditures related
to public works projects.  The government will continue income and
residential tax cuts for the third consecutive year.
     Growth in general operating expenditures as a whole, however,
will be limited to 2.4%, the second lowest growth since fiscal
1989.
     General operating expenditures -- general account spending minus
such obligatory costs as national debt-servicing costs and tax grants
to local governments -- are used to cover government policy measures.
     To make up for a huge revenue shortage stemming from a plunge
in tax revenues during the prolonged economic slump, the budget calls
for issuing a record 21,029 billion yen worth of government bonds,
including 11,998 billion yen in deficit-financing bonds, also a
record high.
     Despite budget-streamlining efforts, the 5.8% rise in total
budget size is the biggest in five years.
     This reflects a sharp increase in national debt-servicing costs
and the government's decision to use general account funds for the
planned liquidation of moribund housing loan companies.
     Under the fiscal 1996 budget, the government earmarks 1,145.2
billion yen for official development assistance, a major pillar of
Japan's international contributions.  But this represents the lowest
growth ever at 3.5%.
     The defense budget, the first under Japan's new medium-term
defense guidelines aimed at compact but effective forces, will rise
2.58% to 4,845.5 billion yen, for the first increase of the
growth rate in six years.  The rise stems from increased payments for
defense contracts concluded in the past.
     Social security spending will rise 2.6% to 14,287.9 billion
yen, placing emphasis on measures for the disabled and steps under
the so-called ''Gold Plan'' for the promotion of health and welfare
for senior citizens.
     While increases in many spending items are limited to low
levels, public works-related expenditures will rise 4.0% to 9,719.9
billion yen to help lift the sluggish economy.
     The total includes projects to be implemented with the proceeds
from sales of government-owned shares in Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp.
     The budget earmarks 758.8 billion yen for science and
technology, an exceptionally high growth of 10%, in a bid to promote
restructuring of Japan's economy.
     The budget allocates 685 billion yen to help cover losses
stemming from the liquidation of housing loan companies which have
huge bad loans.  The government calls the allocation an emergency
step to help stabilize the nation's financial system.
     National debt-servicing costs, meanwhile, will rise as much as
23.9% to 16,375.2 billion, partly because the Finance Ministry will
be forced to resume regular allocations from the general account to
the National Debt Consolidation Fund for the first time in four
years.
     The ministry suspended fixed-amount allocations to the special
account, which was created to secure fiscal resources for the
redemption of outstanding government bonds, from fiscal 1993 to
fiscal 1995, in a bid to reduce the apparent growth of budgetary
spending.
     Since a huge amount of government bonds is in the pipeline for
redemption, however, the ministry will disburse 3,479.7 billion yen
to the national debt-servicing allocations.
     Tax grants to local governments will increase 2.9% to 13,603.8
billion yen.
     On the revenue side, meanwhile, fiscal 1996 tax revenues are
estimated at 51,345 billion yen, down 2,386 billion yen from the
estimate in the initial fiscal 1995 budget.
     To bridge the gap between revenues and expenditures, the
government will raise a total of 21,029 billion yen by issuing new
government bonds, up sharply from 12,598 billion yen in the initial
fiscal 1995 budget.
     This will bring the ratio of government bonds to overall
revenue from 17.7% in fiscal 1995 to a 16-year high of 28.0% in
fiscal 1996 on an initial budget basis.
     The outstanding balance of government bonds will come to some
240 trillion yen at the end of fiscal 1996, equivalent to as much as
49% of the nation's gross domestic product.

Fiscal reform should not mean tax hikes: Takemura++

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura said Monday that while it
is necessary to reform Japan's fiscal system, that should not be
immediately associated with the idea of a tax increase.
     ''Revenues and expenditures should be discussed as a package,''
Takemura said at a press conference held after the cabinet of Prime
Minister Tomiichi Murayama endorsed a draft fiscal 1996 budget.
     ''Fiscal reform needs to be dealt with in wholesale debates from
the standpoints of how the government should function and how the
public-sector economy should relate to people's lives,'' Takemura
said.
     Under the draft fiscal 1996 budget, the government will spend a
total of 75.1 trillion yen in the year beginning April 1, with
general operation expenditures -- the core spending category --
totaling 43.1 trillion yen.
     The budget calls for a third income and residential tax cut in
as many years, a 4% rise in public works spending, and an allocation
of 680 billion yen to help clean up the huge debts amassed by
mortgage lenders.
     ''The government had to compile a budget addressing the economy,
which is still at a precarious juncture after four years of
stagnation,'' Takemura said.
     However, to finance the budget, the government had to decide on
the issuance of deficit-covering bonds totaling 12 trillion yen, of
which 1.9 trillion yen worth will be used for tax cuts and will be
compensated for with a future consumption tax hike.
     Takemura said he hopes to come up with good ways to improve the
current budget formulation system under which the Finance Ministry
sets limits on spending items.
     ''Given the huge discrepancy of more than 10 trillion yen
between revenues and expenditures, it is necessary to review the
ceiling-based system,'' he said.
     On the housing loan fiasco, Takemura conceded there were points
that were ''difficult to understand'' in the process of drawing up a
government scheme to dispose of problem loans using taxpayers' money.
     ''The government failed to map out an overview of the program
before putting the plan under discussion,'' Takemura said.  ''It
needs to disclose as much information as possible to win a final
consensus on the program.''

Hashimoto rates high FY '96 budget for MITI+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     International Trade and Industry Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
said Monday the budget allocated to his ministry for fiscal 1996 was
''satisfactory'' in light of economic conditions.
     Hashimoto said the 9.4 billion yen gain in the budget was a
''fruitful'' result for the ministry.  He made the comments at a news
conference after the government approved the fiscal 1996 budget plan.
     MITI is earmarked 394.7 billion yen, excluding spending for
structural adjustment in the energy sector, in the year starting
April 1996, up from 385.3 billion under the fiscal 1995 budget.
     Hashimoto said he hopes the new budgetary allocation will help
ensure smooth growth in the long term.
     The budget will be put toward four priority areas -- promoting
scientific research and development, boosting information-related
technologies, providing assistance to financially fragile small firms
and taking comprehensive steps for the energy sector, Hashimoto said.
     Hashimoto also said on the day that massive issuances of
deficit-covering bonds was an inevitable step.
     Such a move will pose a problem in the future by shifting the
burden of refunding to future generations, he said.  But a ''powerful
remedy'' is needed now with tax revenues sinking due to the slumping
economy, he said.

Business leaders welcomes FY '96 budget+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The leaders of some Japanese economic and industrial bodies on
Monday welcomed the government's fiscal 1996 draft budget.
     Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the powerful Federation of
Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said he ''appreciated'' the
decision to increase allocations for a survey on the relocation of
administrative functions from Tokyo as it reflected the federation's
request.
     Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, said he welcomed appropriations for the development of new
businesses and technologies.
     The structural change of Japanese industry is an urgent task, he
said.
     Meanwhile, Jiro Ushio, chairman of the Japan Association of
Corporate Executives (keizai Doyukai), urged the government to
drastically change the pattern of expenditures and distribution of
funds for public works projects.

Prosecutors reindict 2 key figures in huge loan scandal+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Prosecutors reindicted the former head of the now-defunct Tokyo
Kyowa Credit Association and the sister of detained former Labor
Minister Toshio Yamaguchi on Monday on charges of breach of trust in
connection with a giant loan scandal.
     Harunori Takahashi, 50, and Yoshie Yamaguchi, 60, were indicted
on charges of arranging some 1.9 billion yen in illegal loans from
the failed credit union for Yamaguchi's company.
     The move brought to five the number of indictments against
Takahashi, the central figure in the huge loan scandal that has
rocked political and business circles in Japan over the last year.
     Takahashi and Yamaguchi were earlier indicted for a similar
illicit loan case involving another failed credit union, Anzen Credit
Bank.
     The two have already admitted they arranged the 1.9 billion yen
collateral-free loans from Tokyo Kyowa to a golf course development
firm run by Yamaguchi from June 1994 to December 1994, prosecution
sources said.
     With the new indictment, the total amount of illegal loans
Takahashi is alleged to have arranged from the two credit unions
reaches about 22.1 billion yen, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors
Office said.
     Toshio Yamaguchi, who was arrested Dec. 6, is likely to be
indicted on Wednesday on four charges -- breach of trust,
embezzlement, fraud and perjury, prosecution sources said.
     The detention period for the 55-year-old independent member of
the House of Representatives will expire Wednesday.
     He was arrested on suspicion of breach of trust for having
arranged 2.7 billion yen worth of illegal loans from the two failed
credit unions for a company run by his sister.
     Toshio Yamaguchi will also be charged with embezzling some 180
million yen from a foundation to which he had served as a director,
the sources said.  He allegedly used the money as collateral for
loans to companies run by his relatives, they said.
     He will also be indicted on charges of fraud to the tune of some
170 million yen from a university in Kumamoto Prefecture, southern
Japan, in connection with a failed scheme to build a university in
the United States, they said.
     The politician will also be slapped with charges of perjury for
his statements made to the Diet in June in connection with the loan
scandal, the sources said.
     The Diet filed an accusation of perjury with prosecutors against
Yamaguchi Dec. 15 for giving false testimony before a lower house
committee.
     In the testimony, Yamaguchi denied any involvement in arranging
illegal collateral-free loans from the two failed credit unions.
     Yamaguchi denies he is guilty of breach of trust.
     In a related development, tax authorities have discovered that
three companies run by Yamaguchi's 52-year-old brother Katsuto Nemoto
underreported incomes by at least 420 million yen, tax sources said
Monday.
     The Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau has already instructed the
companies to revise their tax reports, the sources said.

Ministers agree on steps to collect housing loans++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Cabinet ministers agreed Tuesday on steps toward collection of
bad loans held by housing loan companies which are to be liquidated
by using taxpayers' money.
     The ministers agreed to ask the home mortgage companies to
maintain claims against bad loans and to rigorously seek to collect
them.
     They also agreed that the housing loan firms should inform the
finance and justice ministries, prosecutors and police authorities of
problems concerning their bad loans.
     The ministers held the unofficial meeting in response to public
criticism of the government plan endorsed last week to use 685
billion yen from the fiscal 1996 budget to liquidate the mortgage
firms.
     Justice Minister Hiroshi Miyazawa, Finance Minister Masayoshi
Takemura, farm minister Hosei Norota, National Public Safety
Commission Chairman Takashi Fukaya and Chief Cabinet Secretary Koken
Nosaka agreed that the government should do everything possible to
collect the companies' loans, Nosaka said.
     They also agreed that information about the housing loan problem
should be made available to the public, he said.
     Under Tuesday's agreement, the Finance Ministry, in cooperation
with other ministries, will start work on the gathering and
disclosure of information on the housing loan problem, and on ways to
help with the collection of loans, Nosaka said.
     The ministers are likely to meet again on the issue later this
year or early next year, he added.
     The ministers also agreed on measures to improve the functioning
of the Deposit Insurance Corp. and the establishment of a new
loan-collecting vehicle to take over debts and claims of the housing
loan companies.
     The Finance Ministry is to submit a bill to revise related laws
to the next Diet session so that the Deposit Insurance Corp. can set
up a section with enough staff to instruct the new vehicle on the
collection of loans .
     The new vehicle will have a loan-collecting division with strong
enforcement power.  Lawyers and real estate specialists will
participate in its activities.
     Both the Deposit Insurance Corp. and the new vehicle are
expected to keep close contact with Justice Ministry, prosecutors and
police authorities.
     In a related development, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama told
reporters he instructed the ministers to cooperate toward fulfilling
the people's expectations.

Jan. fund surplus to shrink on slow public lending++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Tuesday predicted a net fund surplus
in January will shrink below the year-earlier level because of
reduced interest revenue from public-sector lending.
     The net liquidity surplus will amount to 5.11 trillion yen, down
from a 6.22 trillion yen surplus posted a year before, the central
bank said.
     Public-sector loans continue to decrease, as their interest
rates remain higher than those by private financial institutions as a
result of a series of cuts in the central bank's official discount
rate to a record low 0.50% per annum.
     Less lending by public financial organizations like the
governmental Housing Loans Corp. has trimmed interest revenues in the
banking system, the central bank said, expecting the fund shortage to
total 428.0 billion yen in January against a surplus of 70.9 billion
yen a year earlier.

Detained ex-minister made huge bad loans by stock deals+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi, facing impending
indictment on charges of four counts of crime, caused huge bad loans
through stock trading on funds withdrawn from a firm affiliated with
a central figure in an aggravated loan scandal, investigation
sources said Tuesday.
     Yamaguchi withdrew as much as 38 billion yen from a nonbank
financial unit belonging to the EIE International group headed by
Harunori Takahashi, former head of the failed Tokyo Kyowa Credit
Association, the sources said.
     The 55-year-old independent member of the House of
Representatives funneled about 90% of the funds into stock
trading, resulting in uncollectable loans totaling some 13 billion
yen.
     The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office is expected to
indict Yamaguchi on Wednesday, the day his detention period is set to
expire, on charges of breach of trust, embezzlement, fraud and
perjury.
     Yamaguchi was arrested Dec. 6 on suspicion of breach of trust by
having conspired with Takahashi and his sister, Yoshie Yamaguchi, to
arrange 2.7 billion yen worth of illegal loans from Tokyo Kyowa and
another failed credit union, Anzen Credit Bank, for the sister's
company.
     The amount of loans Yamaguchi withdrew through accounts of eight
companies and two foundations he was affiliated with from the EIE's
financial arm reached a peak of 38 billion yen in 1989, the sources
said.
     Yamaguchi used most of the borrowed funds for stock trading, but
the prices of shares Yamaguchi had invested in fell sharply in tandem
with an overall bearish market.
     To salvage Yamaguchi from the snowballing bad loans, the
financial unit sold part of his stocks it had held as collateral,
succeeding in cutting the outstanding bad loans to about 28 billion
yen by November 1990, the sources said.
     Yamaguchi claims he is not guilty of breach of trust.

Shinozawa vows to tighten surveillance system+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Vice Finance Minister Kyosuke Shinozawa said Thursday the
ministry will proceed with a proposed reform of its inspection and
surveillance system in a bid to prevent illicit financial operations
like the Daiwa Bank scandal.
     ''The Daiwa Bank case taught the ministry a lesson and it will
do its utmost to flesh out measures proposed to make its banking
policy more transparent,'' Shinozawa said at a press conference.
     His comment came after a former manager of the New York branch
of Daiwa Bank was indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday on
charges of conspiring to conceal huge bond trading losses from U.S.
regulators.
     The ministry's response to the scandal drew strong criticism at
home and abroad over its obscurity.
     It only reported the incident to the U.S. banking authorities
some six weeks after Daiwa Bank notified the ministry of the losses
at the New York branch.
     While declining to comment on the indictment of the former Daiwa
Bank manager, Shinozawa said the ministry will make clear the
relations between its banking administration and inspection
activities, in line with reform measures announced by Finance
Ministry Masayoshi Takemura.
     Takemura announced on a set of measures on Tuesday to strengthen
the ministry's inspection and surveillance system, calling for a
shift in its banking policy to one based on market principles from
the current system of so-called ''administrative guidance,'' which
has been criticized for its lack of transparency.

Nov. tax revenues rise for 1st time in 4 months++

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Japan's tax revenues rose from the year-earlier level for the
first time in four months in November, supported by growth in
corporate tax revenues, the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
     Overall November revenues totaled 6,804.35 billion yen, up 1.9%,
the ministry said.
     But cumulative revenues for the first eight months of fiscal
1995 that ends next March 31 fell 2.7% to 25,793.37 billion yen,
accounting for only 48.1% of the government's current fiscal 1995
tax revenue target of 53,593 billion yen.
     Under a proposed third supplementary budget which reduces the
tax revenue target by 2,912 billion yen to 50,681 billion yen, the
ratio will come to 50.9%.
     ''Income tax revenues were sluggish, but this was more than
offset by an increase in corporate tax revenues with returns from
companies that closed interim account books at the end of
September,'' a ministry official said.
     Many major Japanese companies settle their interim accounts on
Sept. 30 and annual accounts on March 31.
     ''Compared with results for the year-earlier period, companies
posted relatively favorable earnings growth and this led to the rise
in corporate tax revenues,'' the official said.
     November corporate tax revenues rose 7.6% to 3,142.99 billion
yen, accounting for nearly half of the total revenue in the month,
the ministry said.
     Income tax revenues, however, fell 7.8% and totaled 1,602.82
billion yen, including 1,118.76 billion yen from withheld income
tax, down 6.8%, it said.
     Among other items, liquor tax revenues, mainly from September
sales, dropped 10.1% to 156.34 billion yen in reaction to a
high level a year earlier, the ministry said.
     Revenues from the securities transactions tax advanced 56.2% to
36.76 billion yen as securities transactions became more active
compared with a year before, it said.

Shinozawa's resignation reflects poor year for MOF+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The sudden year-end announcement by Administrative Vice Finance
Minister Kyosuke Shinozawa that he will resign early in the new year
reflects a series of incidents that have shaken the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) in 1995.
     The ministry has come under a storm of criticism over a string
of cases during the year, ranging from the bad loan issue at housing
loan companies and the huge loss cover-up at Daiwa Bank's New York
branch to the involvement of ministry bureaucrats in improper
activities.
     Unusually, much of this criticism has focused on the nature of
the ministry itself, which has always enjoyed the position of king of
the Japanese bureaucratic system.
     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura on Friday accepted
Shinozawa's offer to resign.  The ministry's top-ranking bureaucrat
will formally quit on Jan. 5 and be replaced by Tadashi Ogawa,
director general of the National Tax Administration Agency.
     Shinozawa said, ''I have decided to step down to let some fresh
air into the ministry with the start of 1996 at a time when the
morale of ministry officials has been shaken by a series of
incidents.''
     Shinozawa stresses he is not quitting to take responsibility for
the ministry's responses to any individual case.
     But observers said he had little choice but to resign to
demonstrate his responsibility as the top bureaucrat.
     Critics said the MOF's usual method of trying to put a lid on
scandals by reshuffling officials would intensify public distrust of
the ministry.
     The MOF's poor public reputation has increased with the
revelation of close relations between some of its officials and
Harunori Takahashi, the central figure in an illicit loan scandal
involving two now-defunct credit unions in Tokyo -- Tokyo Kyowa
Credit Association and Anzen Credit Bank.
     The MOF has also angered the public by its decision to use
taxpayers' money to help liquidate housing loan companies saddled
with huge bad loans, without seeking to pursue the people
responsible.
     The ministry has further come under fire from the United States
for its slow response to the Daiwa Bank case.  The MOF reported the
incident to U.S. regulators only six weeks after Daiwa Bank notified
it of its huge bond trading losses at the New York branch.
     This sparked criticism that the MOF, perceived to have cozy
relations with industry, tried to collaborate with the bank to
conceal the incident.
     Katsuto Uchihashi, a commentator on economic issues, said,
''Shinozawa's resignation does not mean an end to the series of
scandals that took place this year.''
     ''It should be the real start of the ministry's reconstruction
by clarifying its responsibility as an organization,'' he said.
     Uchihashi pointed out that one of the most pressing issues is
how to change the concentration of power on the ministry.
     The MOF currently deals with fiscal issues, while keeping an
eye on the banking and securities industries.  Such a concentration
of power has been often blamed for the ministry's often insalubrious
relations with industry.
     Uchihashi also said that relations between politicians and
bureaucrats should be discussed as part of the ministry's reform
efforts.
     Politicians have to take the leadership in decision making and
stop simply accepting policy measures set by bureaucrats, he said.
     There have been growing calls for Takemura to take
responsibility for the bad loan issue at housing loan companies and
other financial scandals.
     Takemura, however, said he currently has no intention of
resigning.  ''It is my responsibility to proceed with the liquidation
scheme recently mapped out by the ministry for debt-ridden mortgage
loan lenders,'' he said.
     In a bid to fend off mounting criticism of the ministry,
Takemura earlier this week announced a set of measures to strengthen
the ministry's inspection and surveillance system.
     He called for a shift in the ministry's banking policy to a
transparent one based on market principles, saying the current system
based on the so-called ''administrative guidance'' is internationally
unacceptable because it lacks clear objective criteria.
     But many analysts cast doubt on the ministry's ability to give
up behind-the-scenes policy management and adopt a more transparent
profile.
     Given the ministry's way of dealing with the scandals simply by
accepting Shinozawa's resignation, it is doubtful whether the
bureaucrats are even conscious of the MOF's responsibility, they
said.

Teramura quits as adviser to banking group+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Nobuyuki Teramura, former chief of the Finance Ministry's
Banking Bureau, quit the post of adviser to the Federation of
Bankers Associations of Japan Friday, industry sources said.
     Teramura assumed the post of special adviser to the banking
industry group Sept. 1.
     The reason for his retirement is not clear but is apparently due
to the strong public criticism of the Finance Ministry's policy of
using taxpayers' money for liquidation of housing loan companies
saddled with huge nonperforming loans, the sources said.
     Commercial banks which have been asked by the ministry to
shoulder heavy financial burdens for the liquidation are also
harboring resentment against the ministry.
     Teramura was involved in the management of the housing lenders
when he was head of the Finance Ministry's Banking Bureau.
     His resignation was revealed through letters sent to member
banks of the banking federation.

Shinozawa's resignation surprises financial sector+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Financial circles were taken aback Friday by Vice Finance
Minister Kyosuke Shinozawa's offer to resign his post just before
the Diet begins grilling the Finance Ministry over its plan to use
taxpayers' money to help clean up bad loans at ailing Japanese
mortgage lenders.
     Shinozawa, the top Finance Ministry bureaucrat, tendered his
resignation to ''refresh the ministry's personnel and boost its
morale.''  He is widely suspected to have made the decision to take
responsibility for the mortgage debacle and a series of scandals
involving senior ministry officials.
     The news came completely out of the blue at the end of the year,
of all times, a top executive of a major commercial bank said.
     The banking industry had expected the ministry would keep its
battle array intact for the time being, given the prospect of stormy
parliamentary debate on the contentious scheme involving 685 billion
yen from state coffers to help offset a 6.4 trillion yen loss
stemming from the writing off of irrecoverable loans amassed by the
mortgage companies.
     Under the program, creditors of the housing loan firms will
forego irrecoverable loans, with recoverable bad loans and performing
assets transferred to a planned debt collection vehicle.  But the
ministry has yet to work out a way to make up for losses generated
when the vehicle fails to recover such loans.
     Banks which founded the housing lenders harbor animosity toward
the ministry because the program forces them to forgive all their
outstanding loans to the companies to compensate for 3.5 trillion yen
of the 6.4 trillion yen loss on irrecoverable loans.
     ''How could he step down without clarifying bureaucratic
responsibility for the mortgage fiasco?,'' an official at one of the
founder banks fumed, fearing the resignation might now deflect
criticism to the private sector when the Diet convenes early next
year to discuss the matter.
     Meanwhile, some bankers appreciated Shinozawa's decision, saying
it indicates the ministry's intention to grapple with the New Year's
tasks in a fresh environment after losing public confidence both at
home and abroad in 1995, which Shinozawa describes as ''the kind of
year we never want to have again.''
     On top of the mortgage problem, two senior officials were found
earlier this year to have had cozy relations with and received
benefits from people related to the failed Tokyo Kyowa Credit
Association and Anzen Credit Bank that were implicated in illicit
lending.
     Hiroaki Taya, former chief of the Tokyo customs office, was
demoted from the position in March because he had traveled to Hong
Kong on a private jet owned by Harunori Takahashi, former head of
Tokyo Kyowa.  Taya is to retire Sunday.
     Yoshio Nakajima, former head of the Finance Ministry-affiliated
Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy, resigned from his post in
July as he had signed a sales deal for imported health drinks with a
business consultant who was close to Tokyo Kyowa's Takahashi, and
pocketed some 60 million yen in cash from another acquaintance.
     On the international front, a bond trading loss scandal at Daiwa
Bank's New York branch pit the ministry against U.S. banking
authorities.
     Toshihide Iguchi, then a bond dealer at the branch, had incurred
losses of 1.1 billion dollars over 11 years through unauthorized
trading.  The ministry infuriated U.S. authorities when it informed
them about the case six weeks after learning of the losses.
     Shinozawa's resignation, however, had little impact on stock
pri final trading day of
the year.  Foreign exchange and other financial markets were also
unaffected.
     ''A reshuffle of top Finance Ministry officials will not make
any change in the overall picture,'' a stock dealer said calmly.
''It will neither spur nor dampen equity prices.''

Grain prices could double by 2010, daily says+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Greater consumption in the developing world could cause
international grain prices to double by 2010 from the 1992 level, a
national daily reported Monday, citing a report by the agriculture
ministry.
     In a front-page story, the Yomiuri Shimbun quoted the report on
the world's food supply-demand outlook as forecasting that prices for
wheat in 2010 could be 2.12 times the level of those in the base year
of 1992 and those for rice could show a 2.05-fold climb.
     The report by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries will be made public at a cabinet meeting Tuesday, the paper
said.
     Japan relies on imports for 70% of its total grain demand.
     Given that household spending is greatly affected by
international grain prices, the Japanese may not be able to satiate
themselves with rich food in the next century, the daily said.
     The ministry's report prepared two scenarios, the paper said.
One of the scenarios envisages growth in grain production slackening
to half the present level in the next decade, while the other allows
for grain yield per hectare remaining unchanged.
     Under the first scenario, international grain prices would rise
steadily, reflecting net growth in consumption in the developing
world due to a rise in population and stronger demand for feed grains.
     This would lift prices for wheat and rice by more than two
times, while maize prices would increase by 1.95 times and soybean
prices by 1.81 times, the daily said.
     Under the second scenario, growth rates for international grain
prices would be limited to 10 to 18% over the period.
     In either case, however, grain imports by developing countries
will expand, mirroring greater consumption due to rises in population
and incomes, the paper said.
     According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
annual growth in the world's per-hectare grain harvest slowed down to
2.1% in the 1980s from 3.1% in the 1960s.
     Annual growth in grain output slackened to 1.8% from 3.6%, the
FAO says.

Gov't calls for keeping food self-sufficiency rate+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The government Tuesday unveiled a policy of keeping
self-sufficiency rates for food at current levels until fiscal 2005.
     The cabinet endorsed the policy, which is intended to stem any
further decline in the food self-sufficiency rates, in a long-term
prospect on demand and production of agricultural products.
     The overall rate should be maintained at 44-46% toward
fiscal 2005 on a caloric basis compared with 46% for fiscal
1992, according to the policy.
     The policy calls for the farm sector to expand productivity in
the coming decade by stepping up infrastructure improvement programs
and technological development.
     It also proposed diversification of farm products and cost-
cutting efforts by means of large-scale farming.
     At Tuesday's press conference, Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries Minister Hosei Norota said the policy will help stimulate
incentives for farmers in the future.
     The new prospect said Japan's food self-sufficiency rate would
decline to 41-42% if the current situation is left unattended.
     The policy said the self-sufficiency rate for grain should be
maintained at the current level of 28-29%.
     Rice self-sufficiency target rates in fiscal 2005 are set for
96-97%, almost unchanged from the present rate, while targets are
fixed at 12-15% for wheat and 5% for soybean, both up slightly from
current levels.

'95 commodity futures trading volume hits record high++

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The combined volume of futures trading on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange for Industry in 1995 increased 15% over the previous year
to hit a record high of about 35.12 million contracts, the exchange
said Thursday.
     Rubber futures trading volume surged 58% to 14.28 million
contracts while platinum futures trading climbed 31% to 5.97 million.
     The heavy trading was attributable to wild price fluctuations
caused by unstable foreign exchange rates and bad weather in
rubber-producing areas in Southeast Asia, exchange officials said.
     Another major factor was a rapid influx of operating funds into
the commodities market due to unprecedented low interest rates, they
said.

G-7 to keep dollar strong in '96, dealers say+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The pledge by the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized countries
to promote an ''orderly reversal'' of the dollar's excessive
weakness will probably keep the U.S. currency firm against the yen
in 1996, dealers and economists said.
     In addition, the dollar will be supported by the downward trend
in Japan's current account surplus as well as by increasing
investments in foreign currency-denominated bonds by Japanese
investors, they said.
     They said they expect the U.S. currency to move in a range of
95 yen to 115 yen during next year, compared with 79.75-104.70 yen in
1995, as of Dec. 25.
     ''Cooperation among G-7 nations to keep the dollar from plunging
will continue next year, preventing the dollar from sliding against
the yen,'' said Hirokazu Kawai, chief economist in the investment,
research and strategy division of Nikko Securities Co.
     His expectation stems from a joint statement issued after the
G-7 meeting Oct. 7, Kawai said.
     The statement said the G-7 finance ministers and central bank
governors ''welcomed the orderly reversal in the movements of major
currencies that began following their April meeting.''
     The October G-7 meeting took place against the background of the
dollar's rebound to just above 100 yen, a rise of about 20%
from April when the G-7 nations confirmed their support of the U.S.
currency.
     Therefore, there is little prospect of the dollar falling much
below the 95 yen line, given the possibility of coordinated
dollar-buying interventions by Japan, the United States and Germany,
said Kawai.
     ''The downward trend of Japan's current account surplus is
established and is preventing the U.S. currency from losing much
ground against the yen,'' said Akira Narumi, assistant general
manager of the foreign exchange division of Sakura Bank.
     According to the Ministry of Finance, the surplus in October
plunged 51.8% to 4.31 billion dollars, posting the second
straight month of falls from year-earlier levels.
     The fall is the sharpest since a 59.0% plunge registered
in November 1990.
     Moreover, the surplus during the April-September period
decreased 7.4% from a year before to 58.30 billion dollars,
the fourth consecutive half-year-term decline, the ministry said.
     As a result, the dollar might rise to the 115 yen level sometime
in 1996, exceeding the highest level for 1995 of 104.70 yen, which
was posted Sept. 20, Narumi of Sakura Bank said.
     Japan's investors, especially individuals, are expected to
continue going after higher-yielding foreign bonds, putting selling
pressure on the yen, said Takemi Kaneko, general manager at the
foreign exchange section of Marubeni Corp., a major trading house.
     The Finance Ministry's yen-curbing package adopted Aug. 2,
which eased regulations to promote overseas investment and loans by
Japanese investors, will contribute to the expansion of Japan's
foreign investment, Nikko Securities' Kawai said.
     The dollar's rise against the yen, however, is expected to be
limited, said Toshikimi Kaneki, an economist in the research
department of Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co.
     ''Fear that the gap between Japanese and U.S. market interest
rates might be reduced in the face of a slowdown in the U.S. economy
will weigh down the dollar's topside,'' Kaneki said.
     Furthermore, the dollar will probably be pressured by U.S.
efforts to balance the budget, which could lead to a decrease in the
number of Treasury bonds issued and thus to a possible reduction of
the rate gap between the two countries, he said.
     Lingering doubts about the planned creation of a common currency
for European Union member countries might continue keeping the dollar
from rising much against the yen or the German mark, Kawai said.
     That is because the persistent doubts may draw investors to the
mark, Europe's safe-haven currency, causing the yen to strengthen
against the dollar at the same time, he said.
     In 1995 in Tokyo, the dollar briefly plunged below the 80 yen
line April 19 to 79.75 yen, the lowest level since the modern
exchange rate system was established in the late 1940s.
     Later, however, a series of concerted dollar-buying
interventions by central banks, in addition to the Japanese
government's pump-priming economic package in September, pushed up
the U.S. currency, sending it to a high for 1995 of 104.70 yen Sept.
20.
     The Bank of Japan's accommodative credit policies, including the
cut in the official discount rate Sept. 8 to a record low of 0.5%
per annum, also contributed to the dollar's recovery to above
the 100 yen line.

Fisherman sentenced to 6.5-year jail term over gun trade+

SHIZUOKA, Japan, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A Japanese fisherman was sentenced to six and a half years in
jail at the Shizuoka District Court on Monday for masterminding
large-scale gun smuggling from South Africa for supply to crime
syndicates.
     Prosecutors had sought an eight-year prison term.
     Presiding Judge Katsutoshi Suzuki said in his ruling that
Hideaki Soga, 27, of Kagoshima, who worked aboard a tuna trawler,
''had sold almost all the guns, smuggled into Japan on an
unprecedented scale, to members of organized crime, who used the
weapons in crimes.''
     According to the ruling, Soga conspired with Hiroshi Irabu to
load a total of 191 pistols during a port call at Cape Town, South
Africa, and to land the weapons in Shimizu, Shizuoka Prefecture,
southwest of Tokyo, on Aug. 23, 1991.
     Irabu's trial in connection with the gun smuggling is still
pending at the court.

Auctioned imported rice prices sag to 262 yen per kg+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The wholesale price for two U.S.-grown rice brands dipped to an
average 262 yen per kilogram in this year's second auctions for
imported rice, organized by the Food Agency on Tuesday.
     The two brands are Akitakomachi and Koshihikari.  The two
high-grade brands were originally developed in Japan, but the seed
was exported to the United States to be grown by U.S. farmers for
sale back in Japan.
     The price of 262 yen was about two-thirds the average price the
same brands fetched at the first auction in July.
     Even after their prices are marked up by various middlemen and
distributors, these U.S. brands are expected to be priced at about
the same level as middle-grade domestically grown rice brands -- and
certainly lower than top-quality domestic brands -- when they are
offered on shelves at Japanese retail outlets, agency officials said.
     The lower prices materialized because the initial margin --
which a wholesaler must pay to the agency to win a contract to buy
the rice -- plunged to 150 yen per kg from 292 yen paid to the agency
in the first auction.
     The auctions are held under a special price-setting mechanism
devised by the agency after Japan agreed in 1993 to scrap its ban on
rice imports as a part of compromise arrangements under the Uruguay
Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  At the
time Japan vowed to allow foreign rice a ''minimum access'' of 4% of
the domestic market of 10 million tons a year, starting in 1995.
     The new system allows the Food Agency to buy all the rice
imported by trading houses and to resell it to wholesalers,
effectively preventing distributors from bypassing the agency.
     Under the simultaneous buy and sell (SBS) system, the agency
requires competing pairs of importers and wholesalers to submit two
bids simultaneously, one for the price at which the importer plans to
sell rice to the agency and the second that at which the wholesaler
offers to buy the same rice cargo from the agency.
     The auction mechanism mandates that the agency award contracts
to pairs offering the best profits to the agency through maximization
of the gap between the two bids.
     The agency-devised system allows an importer-wholesaler pair to
offer bids differing by up to 292 yen per kg of rice.
     Now that the final retail prices of the two brands are expected
to drop to levels matching those of middle-grade rice brands as a
result of the latest auction, they are likely to be competitive with
various Japanese brands, industry sources said.
     Japanese wholesalers and retailers who purchased imported rice,
including the two U.S brands, from the agency at the first auction,
suffered sluggish sales because the official markup system forced
their retail prices up, the sources said.
     In view of the development, the agency increased the volume of
imported rice offered for bids at the second auction from 2,800 tons
in the first auction to 10,000 tons.
     Bidders applied to purchase a total of 23,194 tons of imported
rice.  The government allowed the auctioning of a total of 7,894 tons
of imported rices in accordance with its preset mandatory standards
on auction prices.
     As a result, the ratio of the aggregate volume of rice which
bidders applied to buy on the one hand to the volume of actually
auctioned rice on the other came to 2.3 -- a sharp drop from the
previous auction's 9.6, agency officials said.

FY '95 crude steel output to fall below 100 mil. tons+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's crude steel output in fiscal 1995 is projected to fall
below 100 million tons for the first time in two years, the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry said Monday.
     In fiscal 1995, crude steel production is likely to reach 99.24
million tons, down 2.1% from the previous year, because output
in the January-March quarter is expected to fall 9.2% to 23.2
million tons.  Fiscal 1995 ends March 31, 1996.
     According to the ministry, crude steel production is likely to
hit 101.58 million tons in the 1995 calender year.
     While the number of workdays will decline in the January-March
quarter, the ministry said steelmakers will continue to be urged to
adjust inventories, which piled up in the April-September period for
reconstruction of Kobe and the vicinity hard hit by the Jan. 17
earthquake.
     In the January-March quarter, the ministry projects domestic
consumption of steel materials will drop 1.7% to 16.16 million
tons.

Steel wholesaler Hiuka Sangyo applies for bankruptcy+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     A steel materials wholesaler under the aegis of world leading
steelmaker Nippon Steel Corp. virtually went bankrupt Thursday, with
debts estimated at 24 billion yen, a credit research agency said.
     Teikoku Databank said Hiuka Sangyo Co., based in Tokyo, applied
to the Tokyo District Court for voluntary bankruptcy.
     The agency said Hiuka Sangyo was established in May 1950 as a
steel materials wholesaler designated by two steelmakers -- Nippon
Steel and Fuji Steel.  Nippon Steel's corporate name was later changed
to Yawata Steel which merged with Fuji Steel into Nippon Steel Corp.
     The company's U.S. subsidiary, Hiuka America Corp., has
suspended operations since three of its executives were arrested
recently on suspicion of fraud for allegedly forging documents to
obtain a 4.5 billion yen loan, the agency said.
     Beside Nippon Steel, the company also had business ties with
other major steelmakers and general trading houses, it said.
     The company's sales amounted to 20.85 billion yen in the peak
year, which ended in January 1991, the agency said.

Nov. supermarket sales fall 0.2% from year earlier+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Sales at supermarkets across Japan in November edged down 0.2%
from a year earlier to 1.3 trillion yen, declining for the second
straight month, an industry group said Monday.
     The Japan Chain Stores Association said that although food sales
were slow, sales of most other items were good.
     ''It still is too early to say that consumer spending has turned
upward,'' an association official said.
     Food sales fell 2.4% from a year earlier to 579.07 billion yen.
     Sales of clothing gained 0.5% to 308.10 billion yen while
household goods sales increased 1.4% to 290.88 billion yen.
     Sales of men's clothes rose 1.1% to 69.695 billion yen but
sales of women's clothes shrank 1.1% to 97.00 billion yen.
     The association said sales of home electrical appliances gained
4.0% to 48.45 billion yen while drugs and cosmetics sales climbed
6.2% to 36.20 billion yen.
     Supermarket store sales turned sluggish for the last two months
after making an upturn in September.

Average Tokyo CPI in '95 down for first time++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The average consumer price index (CPI) in the Tokyo
metropolitan area in 1995 dropped 0.3% from the previous year for
the first time since such an index was introduced in 1970 as a means
to monitor price movements, the Management and Coordination Agency
said Tuesday.
     The agency said this year's overall average CPI for Tokyo's 23
ward area stood at 107.0 against a base of 100 for 1990, compared
with 107.3 registered in 1994.
     In the preceding three years, the overall CPI was up 1.9% in
1992, up 1.2% in 1993 and up 0.7% in 1994, it said.
     Consumer prices in Tokyo in December remained unchanged from
the previous month but were down 0.5% from a year earlier, with the
preliminary CPI standing at 106.7, the agency said.
     ''Consumer prices were extremely stable,'' said an agency
official.
     The year-on-year decrease came for the third straight month,
following a decline of 0.9% in November and 0.9% in October.
     The agency official said the smaller decline in December was
caused by smaller falls in the prices of fresh vegetables, which
fell 14.8% in December from a year earlier compared with November's
26.7% drop.
     Excluding volatile prices for perishable foods, the prices fell
0.1% from the previous month and remained unchanged from a year
before.
     In December, prices for fresh fruit dropped 11.5% from a year
earlier and those for durable consumer goods such as word processors
and videocassette recorders shrank 11.8%.
     On the other hand, prices rose 7.1% in transportation and 2.6%
in school tuitions, according to the agency.
     The agency said overall nationwide consumer prices slipped 0.7%
in November from a year earlier and fell 0.4% from the preceding
month, with the overall index standing at 106.8 against the base of
100 in 1990.
     The year-on-year decline was the largest since February 1987,
the agency said.
     The agency attributed the steep decline mainly to bigger falls
in fresh fruit prices.
     Excluding such perishables, however, the index came to 107.7,
up 0.1% from a year earlier and unchanged from the previous month,
the official said.
     He said he expects the average nationwide CPI for 1995 to show
a decline of about 0.1%, also the first decline since the agency
began announcing such an index in 1970, because Tokyo-area prices
are considered an early indicator of nationwide price trends.

Nov. unemployment rate hits record at 3.4%++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate hit a record high
since 1953 of 3.4% in November, with the recent trend of higher
jobless rates among young workers continuing, the Management and
Coordination Agency said Tuesday.
     The previous official record high rate was 3.2%, registered
first in April and remaining until October, except for May's 3.1%,
as a result of the prolonged slump in the national economy.
     In a separate report released on the same day, the Labor
Ministry said the seasonally adjusted ratio of job offers to job
seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, rose fractionally in
November to 0.63 from the preceding month's 0.61.
     The reporting month's level compared with September's 0.60, the
lowest level since 1986 when the Japanese economy was hit hard by the
sudden appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar.
     However, the November rate means there were still only 63 job
offers for every 100 job seekers.
     The agency and the ministry said Japan's employment situation
remained severe in November and is unlikely to show notable
improvement immediately.
     In the unemployment report, the agency said there were a total
of 2.18 million unemployed people in November, up by 330,000 or
17.8% from a year earlier.
     The unemployment rate for men stood at a record high of 3.4%,
up 0.2 percentage point from the previous month, while that for
women was 3.3%, unchanged.
     An agency official said the unemployment rate climbed to a new
high probably because there were more people resuming job-hunting,
believing that the economy might pick up.
     Corporations, however, especially large ones, were not offering
many jobs, the official said, adding this left more people in the
situation of seeking jobs unsuccessfully at the time of the survey.
     The unemployment rate in the month was also boosted by the fact
that there were more people, particularly among young male workers,
who wanted to change jobs, the official added.
     The agency survey showed that the unemployment rate for male
workers in the 15-24 age bracket stood at 6.3%, up 1.1 point from a
year earlier.  The rate in the 25-34 age bracket was 3.5%, up 1.0
point, while that for the 35-44 age bracket was 2.2%, up 0.5 point.
     On the job seeker-offer ratio, the ministry said the number of
job offers during the month nudged up 0.5% from the previous month
for the second consecutive monthly rise, following a 2.6% increase
in October.
     The number of job seekers dropped by 1.6% from the previous
month, a turnaround from a 0.8% increase in October.
     By industry, job offers increased 7.4% from a year earlier in
the service business sector, 4.4% in the construction industry, and
4.1% in the wholesale, retail and food industries.
     Such offers dropped 4.8% in the manufacturing sector, while
they rose 3.2% in the transportation and telecommunication sector,
the ministry said.
     Behind the surge to a record high 3.4% in the jobless rate for
November lies a sharp increase in unemployment among younger
workers, private-sector analysts said.
     Many graduates face difficulties in finding jobs, affected by
corporate restructuring efforts which have led to a fall in the
hiring of new graduates, they said.
     They also noted a greater number of workers in their 20s are now
out of work because they find it hard to find new hoped-for jobs.
     Masatoshi Moriyama, a researcher at the Sanwa Research Institute
affiliated with Sanwa Bank, observed, ''There's a mismatch between
businesses which are seeking those who are useful immediately and
young workers who have left jobs to hunt for new jobs despite their
inadequate vocational ability.''
     Given persistent restructuring efforts among businesses, the
nation's unemployment rate will remain on a high plateau in the
months ahead, analysts say.
     The ratio of workers in their 20s who left jobs in the first
half of this year increased from a year earlier, according to Labor
Ministry figures.
     That ratio is taken by some analysts as a bright indication of
economic recovery.  They say the burgeoning economic comeback is
prompting young workers to enter the job-changing market.
     But Hiromichi Kinouchi, general manager for management and
planning at the Students' Assistance Association, said the rise in
unemployment among young workers stemmed largely from a drop in
hirings of new graduates and a larger number of workers who left jobs
under stronger restructuring pressure.
     ''Some of them easily left jobs as they are taken care of by
their parents,'' Kinouchi said.
     The higher jobless rate is also accounted for by the nation's
changing industrial structure, analysts said.
     Manufacturing-sector employment is following a downward pace due
to an increasing shift of production from domestic bases to overseas
while employment in the service sector is on the upswing.
     The service industries such as retailers, wholesalers and
restaurants are dominated by low-wage part-timers and moonlighters.
     ''While employment in the service industries is increasing,
their workers tend to leave jobs because of lower wages.  This in
turn results in a higher jobless rate,'' said Moriyama of the Sanwa
Research Institute.

phenomenon in the current process of economic recovery.
     ''I have little choice but to take a serious view of the
unemployment figure,'' Aoki said at a press conference after a
regular cabinet meeting.
     ''But the jobless rate tends to rise temporarily in the course
of an economic pickup because such recovery encourages some young
workers to seek new jobs,'' he said.
     On the job seeker to offer ratio, Aoki said the rise of 0.5%
in the ratio for the month under review indicates that the
economy is picking up to some extent, although he said the recovery
is not strong enough.

Rengo urges gov't to call meeting on employment+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Japan's biggest labor union urged the government Tuesday to
hold a meeting of business and labor union leaders as soon as
possible to discuss job-security measures.
     The eight million-member Japanese Trade Union Confederation
(Rengo) made the call in a statement issued after the Management and
Coordination Agency announced that the nation's jobless rate hit a
record high 3.4% in November.
     The organization said the government should make clear at the
meeting a policy of putting top priority on securing jobs.
     In order to avoid an unemployment crisis in Japan, it is
indispensable for the government, corporate management and labor
unions to introduce bold steps to secure employment, it said.

Organized workers hit postwar low of 23.8% in '95+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The ratio of labor union members to employees slid for the 10th
straight year in 1995 to a postwar low of 23.8% as the number of
organized workers fell for the first time in six years, the Labor
Ministry said Tuesday.
     A ministry official attributed the decline chiefly to a shift in
the nation's industrial structure toward service-oriented industries
and a subsequent decline in workers in the manufacturing sector, who
are better organized than those in the services sector.
     The latest rato of organized labor, tallied on statistics made
available as of June 30, was 0.3 percentage point lower than last
year's, the ministry said.
     The number of union members fell by about 85,000 to an estimated
12.61 million, the first decline in six years, with the number of
unions themselves down 835 to 70,839, it said.
     By industry, the number of union members in the manufacturing
sector was the biggest, totaling 3.92 million and accounting for
about one-third of the total union members, the ministry said.
     Union members in the services sector came in second with 1.93
million, followed by those in the transport-telecommunications sector
with 1.62 million, it added.
     Among major labor organizations, the nation's largest, the
Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), saw its membership slide
by 98,000 to 7.72 million, it said.

Winter bonuses up 1.9%, banks, insurers boycott poll+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Winter bonuses paid by leading private- sector companies this
year rose 1.9% over last year to a weighted average of 798,848 yen,
the Labor Ministry said Tuesday.
     The ministry said it was the second straight year of rises in
winter bonuses, showing improvement in corporate business performance
in the wake of restructuring and the downturn of the yen's value.
     The growth rate for last year stood at 0.1%.
     The ministry said the report was based on a poll taken on major
corporations, mostly those listed on stock exchanges, with 291
companies responding.  It has been conducting the survey since 1965.
     Four commercial banks and two insurance companies covered in the
poll continued to boycott the survey, disregarding a request for
cooperation, the ministry said.
     By industry, the ministry said bonuses paid by oil product
distributors and dealers showed the highest growth rate of 8.8% to
762,867 yen, reflecting brisk exports of petrochemical products to
Asian countries.
     In contrast, the construction industry posted a 16.9% fall to
1,253,606 yen due to the protracted real estate market slump, the
ministry said.

Nov. overtime work hours post 1st gain in 3 months+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Overtime hours worked in November at Japanese manufacturers
with 30 staff or more picked up from October's level for the first
monthly gain in three months, the Labor Ministry said Thursday.
     Manufacturing workers put in an average 14.0 hours of overtime
last month, up 2.9% from the previous month after seasonal
adjustments, the ministry said in a monthly report on labor
statistics.
     Overtime hours had shrank 0.8% in September and 0.5% in October.
     The figure also represents a 4.5% increase from the same month
a year earlier, compared with a 3.0% rise in October.
     Overtime work hours are widely counted as an indicator of
economic trends.  The growth for the reporting month came in line
with Wednesday's announcement of a 1.3% month-on-month pickup in
industrial output for November.
     Meanwhile, jobs at manufacturers with a workforce of 30 or more
totaled 7.78 million, down 2.3% from a year earlier and the largest
fall since October 1994, when the tally slid by the same margin, the
ministry said.
     Overall industrial employment contracted 0.8% year on year to
23.34 million, the ministry said.
     Service-sector jobs turned up 1.5% to 6.56 million, while
wholesalers, retailers and restaurateurs saw the number of workers
on their payrolls dip 1.0% to 3.55 million.
     Of the 7.78 million manufacturing jobs, 7.84% were part-time
positions, down 0.36 percentage point from November 1994. The
part-time ratio for industries overall stood at 11.81%, up 0.23
point.
     Monthly wages averaged 329,165 yen in the manufacturing sector,
down 1.0% year on year, and came to 296,095 yen overall, up 0.6%,
the ministry said.
     Inflation-adjusted pay gained 1.7% from a year earlier in the
manufacturing industry and rose 1.6% overall, the ministry said.

Labor, management at odds over small business workweek+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Labor and management remain at odds in a government panel
discussing whether to extend a moratorium designed to ease smaller
businesses into a 40-hour workweek set by the Labor Standards Law,
Labor Ministry sources said Thursday.
     The legal workweek was shortened to 40 hours in fiscal 1994.
But the law has allowed smaller businesses, which find it hard to cut
working hours due to labor shortages, to apply a 44-hour workweek on
condition that they shift to a 40-hour week in fiscal 1997.
     In a separate interim measure, minor enterprises in the commerce
sector and three other sectors are entitled to continue with a
46-hour workweek beyond fiscal 1997.
     While the Labor Ministry wants the panel -- the Central Labor
Standards Council -- to file a report by February, neither employers
nor employees are in the mood to climb down.  The report is not
likely to mention big reforms involving labor law revisions, the
sources said.
     Meanwhile, the Liberal Democratic Party, the largest of the
three ruling parties, is poised to set up a task force early next
year to study an extension of the moratorium at a request of lobby
groups representing merchants and industrialists.
     The Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), meanwhile,
adopted a resolution calling for full implementation of a 40-hour
workweek when they convened earlier this month to boost their morale
for ''spring offensive'' wage negotiations.
     The ministry, which will effectively compile the panel report,
hopes to achieve smaller businesses' transition to a 40-hour workweek
as planned.  ''Our stance is to make an effort to realize what has
been decided under the law,'' said Vice Labor Minister Kunihiko Saito.
     Given the yawning gap between labor and management, however, the
ministry suspects it will be difficult to guide arguments toward
presenting a bill to revise the labor law during the next regular
Diet session early next year, the sources said.

Employment of foreigners with skills on rise+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The Justice Ministry's Immigration Bureau approved the entry
into Japan of 6,564 foreigners in 1994 who planned to work in the
country using their skills, up 14 from the previous year, officials
said Thursday.
     The foreigners received permission to work in Japan as language
teachers, interpreters or other technical jobs, the officials said.
     The increase shows that foreigners with certain skills are not
affected by the country's prolonged economic slump, which is
deteriorating the domestic employment condition, they said.
     Of the total, the largest single group was 2,063 from the United
States, followed by 890 from Britain, 710 from Canada and 704 from
China.

Construction works head cases of local gov't corruption+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Some 30% of corruption cases discovered during fiscal 1994
among local government officials were related to public construction
works, a Home Affairs Ministry survey released Friday said.
     A total of 106 cases were discovered in the fiscal year from
April 1 1994 to March 31, 1995, representing a decrease of three from
the previous year, the ministry said.  Of these, 33 involved
construction projects.
     A total of 124 local government heads and officials were
implicated in the cases, down 11 from a year earlier, but the number
of local governments involved in the cases increased by two to 99.
     Of the 106, embezzlement accounted for 52 cases and graft 41.
     The cases included one in which a vice governor of Aichi
Prefecture was arrested in May last year for receiving 20 million yen
from a contractor in exchange for favorable treatment over a public
works project.

Homeless in Japan face hard times due to economy, cold+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Tokyo's homeless face a particularly grim few months now that
the metropolis is in the grip of winter.
     In an underground passageway used by thousands of people daily
near the western exit to Tokyo's busy Shinjuku Station stands a small
makeshift altar.
     It was placed beside a cardboard box whose former occupant, Jiro
Takahashi, 53, a homeless man and sometime poet, died a week ago from
hepatic cirrhosis.
     One of Takahashi's poems ironically became his own epitaph.
     ''Autumn's blossom, the Chinese bellflower has bloomed.
     ''To bloom and fall in underground passageways is a commonplace
in the world of people.''
     These days, Takahashi's colleagues pause to pay their respects
as they pass the altar.
     Sachiyo Ikeda and her group of some 30 volunteers who call
themselves the ''Shinjuku Egg Patrol'' regularly distribute boiled
eggs and other food to the occupants of the area's cardboard boxes.
     ''There are no people here who are homeless solely because they
like it,'' Ikeda said.  ''They all say they are here because they
have to stick with their friends, or because they can learn from the
more experienced ones.''
     The passageway is the future site of a moving walkway the
metropolitan government plans to install, but which homeless people
and welfare groups say is merely a way to get rid of them.
     The metropolitan government says it wants to move the 200 or so
homeless people now using the passageway to facilities it is building
on a reclaimed island on the edge of Tokyo Bay.
     Faced with continued complaints from pedestrians and owners of
shops near the passageway about the foul smell in the area, the
metropolitan government says the moving walkway must be installed and
that it is to assist elderly people.
     Toshiya Sasaki, a pastor with the United Church of Christ in
Japan and a member of a newly formed citizens' group working for the
homeless, said the numbers began to increase in Japan from 1990.
     That was the year when the so-called ''bubble economy'' began to
falter and opportunities for work in the construction industry
decreased.  Hardest hit were those 50 years and more.
     In August, the Tokyo metropolitan government claimed there were
some 3,300 homeless people in the 23 central wards in the metropolis.
     Local administrations and citizens' organizations familiar with
the problems of the homeless say there are an estimated 700 in
Shinjuku, and 200 in the Sanya area, a large concentration of cheap
flophouses for low-wage earners and unemployed people.
     Elsewhere, the homeless are a visible presence in and around
many of the larger stations like Shibuya and Ueno, where they can at
least stay warm and shelter from the elements during the day.
     In Osaka, the largest city in western Japan, the Airin quarter
in Nishinari Ward is currently home to about 150 homeless people
among the estimated 20,000 day workers there.
     There were twice as many homeless there this time a year ago.
     Police say the decline is attributable to increased employment
opportunities due to the recovery effort after the Jan. 17 Great
Hanshin Earthquake which devastated nearby Kobe and surrounding areas.
     But workers at a welfare center in the area say older homeless
and the sick still face the prospect of unemployment.
     Kawasaki which adjoins Tokyo's southern boundary in July
inaugurated a system of coupons which the homeless can exchange for a
daily meal.  The city has as many as 600 homeless.
     But residents near centers where the meals are supplied complain
that the homeless have begun settling in their neighborhoods.
     Sasaki said society's contradictions are encapsulated in the
problem of the homeless.
     ''They are not doing it because they are lazy,'' he said.  ''For
a start, the state and local bodies should adopt policies which give
them work.''

Corporate entertainment spending down 9%+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     In a sobering reminder of the nation's protracted economic
slump, Japanese companies spent less on entertainment expenses in
the year through January 1995 than the previous year for the second
straight year, official figures showed Tuesday.
     Japanese businesses spent an estimated 5,408.7 billion yen for
entertaining customers and business partners in the reporting year,
down 9.0% from a year earlier, the National Tax Administration
Agency reported.
     The agency surveyed tax reports by 61,365 companies nationwide
which closed their books between February 1994 and January 1995,
selected according to capital and business sectors.
     The total number of companies edged up 1.1% to 2.37 million,
but their total revenues fell 5.6% to 1,417.4 trillion yen.
     Corporate entertainment expenses dropped in the year through
January 1994 for the first time since 1961 to 5.95 trillion yen,
after peaking at a record 6.2 trillion yen the previous year.  The
agency started compiling such figures in 1961.
     In the latest year for which the statistics are available,
companies spent an average of 3.82 yen on entertainment for every
1,000 yen in operating profits, down 3.5% from the previous year.
     Companies capitalized at less than 10 million yen shelled out
7.63 yen, while those with capital of 1 billion yen or higher spent
2.28 yen.
     The construction industry topped the list of the most lavish
spenders on entertainment, followed by printing and publishing
enterprises and real estate firms.
     Expenditures on donations also dropped, for the third
consecutive year, by 8.9% to 477 billion yen.
     The most generous spenders were real estate companies, at 70.6
billion yen, followed by chemical producers and construction firms.

Firms pay 36,000 yen a month for transfers+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Japanese companies pay on average 36,420 yen a month as a
special allowance to section chiefs who are transferred to local
branches and choose not to take their families with them, a private
research institute said Thursday.
     On top of this allowance, 21% of companies pay such workers a
sum for transportation enabling them to have family reunions twice a
month, and about half pay for such tickets once a month, the
Industrial Labor Research Institute said.
     Four percent of the 215 surveyed companies pay transportation
fees for family reunions only six times a year, according to the
survey.
     Asked why they could not take their family members to the new
locations, 63% of the workers said they did not want their children
to change schools.
     An institute researcher cited the difficulties faced by senior
high school students who accompany their parents to local cities of
finding schools with curricula corresponding to those of their
previous schools and that readily accept students who have not sat
Japan's usual yearly entrance examination.
     Fifty-eight percent of the surveyed workers said their elderly
parents who live with them refused to move to new communities.
     Forty percent replied they did so through reluctance to sell
their homes and buy new ones in local cities, the institute said.
     The companies said on average for transferred workers choosing
not to take their families with them, they give three days off
before they start at the new office.  However, 27% said they do not
give such time off.
     The average special allowance paid to senior managing directors
who are transferred to local offices was 40,275 yen, while that for
managers came to 39,143 yen, the institute said.
     Such allowances for rank-and-file employees came to 32,067 yen
on average, it said.
     Seventy-six percent of the companies said they continue to pay
these special allowances until the assignments come to an end.
Usually such assignments are for a period between two and five years,
the researcher said.
     The survey was conducted in September and October and included
66 large companies whose workforces exceed 1,000.

Yamazaki Baking expected to see lower pretax profit+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Yamazaki Baking Co. is expected to post an 8% fall in
unconsolidated pretax profit to 22 billion yen in the 1995 business
year ending Dec. 31 from the previous year for the second straight
year of decline, a business daily reported Friday.
     The top Japanese baking company's expected profit fall is
attributable to lower sales of bread and other products due to
intensified competition and increased distribution costs, the Nihon
Keizai Shimbun said.
     Overall sales for 1995, including rice products, are estimated
at 563 billion yen, up 3%, the daily said.
     For the 1996 business year, the company is likely to post a
pretax profit of 24 billion yen, up 10% from this year, due to a
streamlined distribution system, it said.
     Sales are also expected to rise 3% to 578 billion yen, the
daily said.

Microbrewers bubbling but local gov'ts still thirsting+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Private microbreweries have been making heady progress in the
market for local beers but local public bodies are having trouble
tapping into schemes to launch small-scale breweries to revitalize
their economies.
     In early December, the first nationwide festival of locally
brewed beer was held at the Tokyo International Fairgrounds.
     More than 15,000 beer fans rushed to the site during the
three-day festival to sample some 11 different beers presented by
local microbreweries in places ranging from Hokkaido to Okinawa
prefectures.
     The government's revision of the Liquor Tax Law last April eased
the license requirements for commercially brewing beer.
     The revision included lowering the minimum beer production
volume from 2,000 kiloliters a year to 60 kl, a measure which has
prompted a growing number of entrepreneurs, beer enthusiast groups
and even local governments to apply for permission to begin producing
local beers on their own.
     After issuing the first licenses to a Japanese sake maker in
Niigata Prefecture and a business group in Hokkaido in December last
year, the National Tax Administration Agency has granted 18 such
licenses to local breweries and provisional licenses to another six
within the first year.
     ''Private microbrewers which have started operations so far are
doing well in the business,'' said Tomoyasu Ishikawa, an organizer of
the first Tokyo local beer festival.
     ''The variety of tastes in such beer is one of the reasons for
its popularity.  Major beer brewers sell many brands that have quite
similar taste but with different labels,'' said Ishikawa, also an
official of Japan Travel Bureau's special team designated to support
private microbreweries.
     ''I think local beers will take root in the country in the
future, just like 'jizake' (locally brewed Japanese sake),'' Ishikawa
said.
     ''The boom in local beers is expected to continue for a while,
and the number of private microbrewers will grow to about 50 by the
end of next year and to about 100 within the next three years,'' said
Motoki Takahashi, an official at the microbrewery public relations
section of Sapporo Breweries Ltd.
     The nation's four giant breweries are all helping local
microbreweries launch their new businesses.
     Sapporo Breweries, Japan's third ranking brewer, has set up the
section to provide local makers with know-how on beer brewing and
beer hall management.
     ''We expect the local beers to stimulate the whole domestic beer
market, which has an annual production of 7 million kl and has
recently seen a slowdown in growth,'' he said.
     Kojiro Hagi at the Promotion Conference of Brewery, Community
and Package Proposal, a business group consisting of eight companies
including Itochu Corp., a giant trading house, established to offer
assistance to local public bodies, is taking a brighter view of the
future of microbreweries.
     ''In the United States, where local beers are quite popular,
such beer occupies about a 1% share of the overall beer market.
Supposing local beers grab the same share in Japan, and taking into
account the break-even point for microbrewers, there could be some
200 to 300 (such breweries) within five years,'' Hagi said.
     In contrast with the solid start by private microbrewers, local
public bodies are facing difficulties getting into the business.
     ''Though many local governments have a keen interest in beer
brewing, not even one has applied for a license,'' Hagi said.
     One of the major obstacles public entities face is the
difficulty of securing a consensus within an assembly to break into
the business, Hagi explained.
     ''A business plan often develops into a political issue in a
local assembly and gets scrapped in the end,'' said Hagi, citing a
case in the town of Kubokawa, Kochi Prefecture, where the local
assembly voted down a 376 million yen brewery construction plan
proposed by the town last March.
     The city of Sanda, in Hyogo Prefecture, is another typical
example.
     As Sanda is the birthplace of Komin Kawamoto, a Japanese scholar
of Dutch studies who introduced beer during the Edo period in the
19th century, city authorities had planned to set up a semiprivate
brewery and produce an original beer to attract more tourists.
     The plan, however, is still pending and the prospects for
launching the business have lost a lot of fizz.
     ''Concern over profitability prevented the local community from
coming to a consensus.  It is difficult for the city to pour tax
revenues into a business for which profits are uncertain,'' said an
official at Sanda city hall.
     ''The rejection by Kubokawa's local assembly also affected our
decision to suspend the plan,'' he added.
     The official said the central government should take some
measures, such as a liquor tax cut, to help local public entities
trying to launch breweries to stimulate local economies.
     Hagi's group is currently providing consulting services to five
local governments still hoping to tap into the beer business.
     Hagi said, however, that it would be the middle of next year at
the earliest before any local government-affiliated microbrewery
tries its hand in the market.

Budget holds ODA spending to record low 3.5% growth+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government Monday approved a 1,145.2 billion yen budget for
foreign aid in fiscal 1996, with its growth restricted to a record
low of 3.5%.
     The rate of growth is the lowest since the government started
allocating budgets for foreign aid or official development
assistance (ODA) in 1976.  The previous low was the 4.0% increase
allowed in the current fiscal year ending March 31.
     It is the third consecutive year since fiscal 1994 for the
growth of the ODA element in the national budget to hit an all-time
low.
     The low rate of increase in the overseas aid budget is largely
attributable to the nation's severe fiscal condition and the need for
the growth of the overall budget to be curbed, government officials
say.
     The cabinet of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama gave its stamp
of approval to the ODA outlay, contained in the overall general
account budget for the next fiscal year.  The overall budget will be
submitted to a regular parliamentary session expected to open Jan. 22.
     The proposed ODA spending makes it look likely that Japan will
not achieve its fifth medium-term target of disbursing 70-75 billion
dollars in aid to the developing world between 1993 and 1997.
     Japan remained the world's top foreign aid donor in terms of
total amount for the fourth consecutive year in 1994, disbursing
13.24 billion dollars.  The United States ranked second with 9.85
billion dollars, followed by France with 8.45 billion dollars.
     In its budgetary request for fiscal 1996, the Foreign Ministry,
along with other government ministries and agencies, sought a 7.3%
rise in ODA spending, arguing that a high growth rate is necessary
to accomplish the five-year target.
     The government paid out 1.1 billion dollars in foreign aid in
1993 and 1.3 billion dollars in 1994, a slower pace of disbursement
than hoped for, according to Foreign Ministry officials.
     In the breakdown of the next fiscal year's ODA spending, the
government set aside 277.3 billion yen for bilateral grant aid, up
1.8% over the current fiscal year.
     Of the sum, the budget for small-scale ''grassroots''
grant-in-aid amounted to 4.5 billion yen, up 50.0%, in view of the
need to meet a wide variety of local demands and to promote
cooperation with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).
     The government also set aside 1.5 billion yen for fresh
emergency grant aid projects to help rehabilitate war-devastated
areas such as former Yugoslavia and some African countries.
     The ODA budget calls for a 5.7% rise to 348.5 billion yen in
bilateral technical cooperation funds.
     Such funds will be used for, among other things, inviting and
training students, engineers and researchers from developing
countries.
     As part of technical assistance, 1 billion yen is set aside for
subsidies to NGOs, up 31.6% from the initial budget for the current
fiscal year.
     The ODA budget recommends that low-interest yen loans, a key
component of Japan's ODA program, be increased 2.1% to 390.7 billion
yen.
     The proposal also included 76.3 million yen for new programs to
tackle global issues as part of the ''common agenda'' of Japan and
the U.S.
     The government also proposed 8.6 billion yen, up 5.0%, for the
''Peace, Friendship and Exchange Initiative'' to promote exchanges
between Japan and its Asian neighbors.
     The 10-year, 100 billion yen project was started in the current
fiscal year to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World
War II and express the nation's remorse for its wrongdoing before and
during the war.
     The government allocated 2 million dollars worth of assistance
to women in developing countries, up 100%, and 390 million yen for
programs of the Foreign Ministry-affiliated Japan International
Cooperation Agency to tackle population problems and AIDS, up 66.6%.
     The budget proposal also calls for 4.1 million dollars for U.N.
efforts to expand women's roles in society, up 96.2%, 6.7 million
dollars for U.N. efforts to control drugs, up 11.7%, and 1.2 million
dollars to help the United Nations protect human rights, up 9.1%.

Cambodian resident in Japan gets award for education aid+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A Cambodian resident in Japan has been given an award by King
Norodom Sihanouk for his contribution to reconstructing the
education system in Cambodia, wrecked during the 1975-1979 Khmer
Rouge communist regime of Pol Pot, his Japanese supporters said
Monday.
     Kong Vorn, 58, of Yokohama, received a first class medal for
national construction earlier this month.
     Kong Vorn had filed news reports for Kyodo News Service from
Phnom Penh until the last moment the Cambodian capital was taken over
by the Khmer Rouge on April 17, 1975.
     Although he was forced to work in rural area by the Khmer Rouge,
he managed to escape from so-called ''killing field'' to his home
town in Prey Veng Province on Cambodian-Vietnam border and hid there
until the Vietnamese invasion and installation of an anti-Pol Pot
rebel communist government in 1979.
     Kong Vorn, who survived Pol Pot's liquidation of ''educated
people,'' came to Japan in 1981 as an immigrant.  He settled in
Yokohama and has been working at a Japanese company since then.
     In 1990 when he temporarily returned to Cambodia, he was shocked
to observe the desperate state of education in his home country.
     He organized the ''Cambodian Education Assistance Fund'' in 1993
and launched a fund-raising campaign for the reconstruction of
education, his supporters said.
     The fund so far has financed the building of two junior high
schools and an elementary school in Prey Veng Province, and has also
donated more than 100,000 U.S. dollars for school projects.

UNHCR pondering special fund for Rwandan refugees+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is considering
setting up a special fund for Rwandan refugees whose houses became
in need of repairs while they were away, its chief said Monday.
     Sadako Ogata, the high commissioner of the U.N. body, revealed
the planned 30 million dollar fund at a meeting with Foreign Minister
Yohei Kono, a Foreign Ministry official told reporters.
     The fund, to be launched within the UNHCR, will appeal to the
international community for contributions and help for repairing
dilapidated houses of Rwandan refugees.
     Ogata, a Japanese national, is back in Japan for a winter
vacation.
     She also expressed appreciation for Kono's pledge earlier this
month of some 20 million dollars in humanitarian aid for refugees in
the war-torn former Yugoslavia, the official said.

Korea: Firms Select 9,044 Capital Goods Related Items for Localization

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

Conglomerates Discuss Import Cutbacks With FKI

The 30 largest business groups (chaebol) and other large business
enterprises reportedly have decided to go ahead with a plan to
localize capital goods-related items.

The decision came at a meeting of the chairman and vice-chairmen of
the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), one of the largest
businessmen's association in Korea, on September 18.

Through repeated consultations and readjustments among business
circles and by the goods office of the federation, 78 subsidiary firms
of 24 business groups have selected a total of 9,044 capital
goods-related items for localization schedules.

Of the total items, components topped the list with 8,562, followed by
machinery and equipment with 373 and advanced raw materials with 109,
sources at the federation said.

If the localization schedules are carried out successfully, import
substitution would reach 8 trillion won by 2000, along with huge
tangible and intangible indirect effects, the sources predicted.

Under the implementation program worked out by the federation, the
localization projects are estimated to cost about 2.8 trillion won, of
which 1.5 trillion won will be covered with internal funds and the
rest with borrowings from banks and rights offerings, the sources
explained.

To help raise sufficient funds by private enterprises, the government
needs to allow private enterprises to induce foreign cash loans, the
sources said.

Moreover, the business community is calling on the government to
extend varied financial supporting measures and to ease its
restrictions in a bid to help facilitate localization projects of
private enterprises, the sources disclosed.

Despite worsening economic situations at home, largest business groups
and private enterprises are bent on localizing capital goods-related
items, the sources said.

For instance, the Samsung business group plans to pour 500 billion won
by 2000 into localization of eight items, including laser processing
devices and automatic equipment and systems.  If these items are
localized, the group would be able to conserve about 1.16 trillion won
between 1996 and 2000 by replacing imports, group sources said.

The Hyundai business group intends to develop 6,521 items, including
turbo chargers for diesel engines and knock-sensors for passenger
cars. For localization projects, the group will invest 660 billion won
for the next five years, and it wants to conserve about 3.9 billion
won by replacing imports.

The LG business group reportedly is trying to develop 73 items with
its investment reaching 23.4 billion won through 2000 to attain import
substitution totaling about 300 billion won.

The Daewoo business group hopes to undertake 10 research themes, with
its investments in the heavy industries sector reaching 60 billion
won, those in the automobile sector amounting to 103 billion won and
those in the communications sector with 34 billion won, all by 2000.

The Sunkyong group plans to develop 68 items, including 33 quality-
and function-improvement items, cooling towers, pressure gauges and
the like.

The Ssangyong group is expected to develop 65 items with a total
investment of 258.6 billion won in collaboration with its
subcontractor firms.

The Kia group will undertake research and development of 1,321
research themes by 2001, such as those concerning automatic
transmission gears, with a total investment of 623 billion won,
including 44.3 billion won in its own fund.   If these items are
developed, the group would be able to conserve about 700 billion won
by replacing imports.

POSCO (Pohang Iron & Steel Co.) reportedly is trying to develop 661
items, including those related to the manufacture of refractory
bricks, rolls and machinery components by 2000, with a total
investment of 52.3 billion won.

The Hanjin group is pushing ahead with a plan to develop 14 items,
including key items for shipbuilding and rolling stocks, with a total
investment of 8.4 billion won.

The Hanwha group is moving to develop six items, including hub units
and bearings, by 1998 with a total investment of 76 billion won, in
collaboration of its subcontractor firms.

Bank of Korea Reports Potential Growth Rate Drops to 6% Range

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

Potential rate of growth has dipped to the six-percent level, sources
at the Bank of Korea said.

The central bank announced that potential rate of growth was 6.8
percent for three consecutive quarters from the fourth quarter of 1995
and the second quarter of 1996.

Potential rate of growth was 7.7-8.4 percent between 1980 and 1989,
7.2-7.8 percent between 1990 and 1993, and 7.1-7.2 percent between
1994 and the second quarter of 1995, all maintaining a level of more
than seven percent.

This was the first time that the potential rate of growth dropped to
the six-percent level, sources at the central bank said.

Consequently, it is inevitable for the government to readjust the
foundation for macroeconomic management such as growth, prices and
international balance-of-payments position, the sources said.

The declining trends of the potential rate of growth were ascribed
mainly to the diminishing contribution ratios of capital and labor to
the economic growth deriving from the slow growth rate of fixed
investment and slowdowns in the increase rate of the economically
active population, the sources analyzed.

The central bank's prediction for this year's growth rate is set at
7.2 percent, while the government forecast that the year's growth rate
will hover around 7.0 percent.

This indicates that the year's real growth would slightly surpass the
year's potential rate of growth, the sources explained.

The estimate results of the central bank showed that the potential
rate of growth between 1994 and the second quarter of 1996 was 6.9-7.1
percent.

In view of growing economic scales, the potential rate of growth will
slow gradually, the sources predicted.

As the general view that the business activities peaked in October of
1995, the central bank made its prediction on the potential rate of
growth beginning the fourth quarter of 1995, the sources said.

Amid such declining trends of the potential rate of growth, any
government's overheated business prop-up measures may bring about
adverse effects such as price hikes, the sources said.

Korea: MOTIE Asks for Lower Tariff Rates on Some Imports

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

The Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy has asked the Ministry of
Finance and Economy to apply lower import tariff rates for crude oil
and 10 other items in a bid to help exporters strengthen their
competitiveness.

The ministry calls for applying zero-percent tariff rates for three
items--central processing units for computer, raw wool and artificial
corundum--instead of the current 2-8 percent rates, sources at the
ministry said.

The ministry also recommended that the import quota tariff rate on
crude oil should be lowered from the current 5 percent to 3 percent,
for all crude oil imports during the second half of this year, the
sources said.

For the remaining six items, the ministry reportedly is asking that
the current tariff rates should be lowered to 2-4 percent levels, the
sources said.

Korea: MFE Works Out Guidelines for Commercial Loans

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

All small enterprises, including those engaged in business lines other
than manufacturing, will be allowed to induce commercial loans for the
import of plants and equipment, beginning in October this year.

At the same time, all private enterprises, small or large, may be
allowed to introduce foreign loans only for early repayment of foreign
loans they have already obtained, without limits, also beginning in
October this year.

Beginning in January next year, private enterprises participating in
the government-initiated projects such as huge infrastructure projects
to be financed with private capital will be permitted to induce cash
loans of up to $100 million per year for the projects only.

To this effect, a draft revision bill to the guideline for approvals
of commercial loan inducement, worked out by the Ministry of Finance
and Economy, will be put into force step by step, sources at the
ministry said.

Under the draft revision bill, foreign-invested firms which have
equity ownership of more than 50 percent will be allowed to induce
loans for the import of plants and equipment within the framework of
their invested amount here, effective from next year, the sources
said.

As for large enterprises, the introduction of commercial loans will be
allowed only for those big businesses engaged in the high-tech field
in principle, and amounts have yet to be fixed, which will be based on
the foreign exchange market situations during the first quarter of
1997, the sources said.

Until recently, only small enterprises engaged in the manufacturing
industry have been permitted to induce loans for the import of plants
and equipment.

From October this year, however, gas, communications and all other
business lines will be added to the permission list, and no annual
limits would be set if small firms comply with necessary terms and
conditions set by the government for the introduction of loans, the
sources said.

Private enterprises participating in huge infrastructure projects (the
first-grade facility projects such as roads, harbors, airports, etc.)
each involving more than 1 trillion won will be allowed to induce cash
loans each of up to 20 percent of the annual net project cost per
project or up to $100 million, for the projects only, the sources
added.

Korea: Financial Support for Industrial Estates to Greatly Expand

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

The government's financial support for industrial estates in
provincial areas will be drastically expanded next year, sources at
the Ministry of Construction and Transportation said.

Beginning in 1997, the government will finance construction of roads
and water-supply systems leading to industrial estates each covering
more than 300,000 pyong (one pyong equals 3.3 square meters) in
provincial districts, the sources said.

At the same time, the loomable amount for the formation of an
industrial estate each covering less than 300,000 pyong in provincial
areas will also be expanded next year far more than this year's level,
the sources explained.

In 1997, a total of 42.5 billion won in the state budget will be
allocated for construction of roads leading to nine industrial estates
in provincial areas, including Chonan, Pyongdong and Naju, the sources
said.

The lending amount for industrial estates each covering less than
300,000 pyong in provincial districts will increase by 20 billion won
to 70 billion won next year, and the loans will be repayable over 10
years in installments after a grace period of five years at an annual
interest rate of 5 percent, the sources said.

These draft budget plans, worked out by the ministry, will be
submitted to the forthcoming National Assembly session after further
consultations with the pertinent ministries, the sources added.

Korea: Five Largest Groups Sell Significantly More Than Others

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

The gap between the nation's top five largest business groups and the
remaining 25 other large business groups reportedly is widening
steadily in terms of turnover.

In the nation's 30 largest business groups, turnover of the top five
business groups showed a whopping increase of 1.6 times over those of
the remaining 25 other business groups in 1994.

This indicates that the top five groups' concentration of economic power
has become more involved, an analysis report of the Korea Development
Institute disclosed.

The share of the 30 largest business groups in the nation's overall
turnover of the manufacturing and mining sector was 39.6 percent in
1994, the report showed.

The share was 34.1 percent in 1977, surpassed the 40-percent level during the
1982-1985 period, dipped to the 35-percent level during the 1987-1989
period and began rising again sharply at the outset of the 1990s, it
said.

In particular, the share of the top five  business groups has become
higher, thus widening the gap between the top-ranking groups and
others.

The share of the top five groups in the nation's overall
manufacturing-mining turnovers in 1977 was 15.7 percent, slightly
lower than 18.4 percent of the 25 other large business groups.

In 1994, the manufacturing-mining share of the top five groups stood
at 24.6 percent, greatly surpassing 15.0 percent of the 25 other
business groups.

The ratio of the top five groups' turnover to overall turnover of the 25
other groups was 22.6 against 17.8 in 1983, and the ratio changed to
21.9 against 14.1 in 1988 and 23.4 against 15.4 in 1991.

This means that the nation's economic power has been heavily
concentrated on the top five business groups, sources at the institute
said.

As a result, the gap between the top five groups' turnover and overall
turnover of the 25 other business groups was 85 percent in 1977, 1.2
times in 1983, 1.5 times in 1991 and 1.6 times in 1994.

In the overall turnover of the 30 largest business groups, the share
of the top five business groups' turnover rose from 46 percent in
1977 to 55.5 percent in 1982 and 62.1 percent in 1994, thus
symbolizing the deepening monopolistic trends of the top five business
groups, the sources said.

Korea: Farm Products Imports Rise by 21% for Several Months

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

Imports of farm products in the first seven months of this year
totaled $3.86 billion, up 20.8 percent from a year earlier, sources at
the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said.

Imports of farm products from the United States have been increasing
sharply, largely because of the government's import opening policy of
farm products.

Of the seven-month import total, imports from the United States
amounted to $1.76 billion, up 24.7 percent from a year before, taking
the lion's share of 44.7 percent in the seven-month imports, the
sources said.

During the seven-month period, imports of corn from the United States
reached $99.7 million, up 35.5 percent from a year ago, those of
potatoes from the United States showed a rise of 59.6 percent over a
year before, those of grapes rose by 89.6 percent, those of cigarettes
by 44.9 percent, those of tomatoes by 77.4 percent and those of

Imports of farm products from China during the seven-month period
stood at $309.7 million, up only 13.3 percent from a year earlier, the
sources said.

Korea: Gov't Gives Port Constr. Firms Priority on Auxiliary Projects

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

Private enterprises taking part in private capital-financed new port
construction projects will have priority rights to undertake auxiliary
projects, including construction of a breakwater, dredging and others
to be funded by the government, on a negotiated contract basis.

To help facilitate new port construction projects, a set of various
supporting measures will be sought for local autonomous establishments
and organizations, sources at the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and
Fisheries said.

Local residents who will lose fishing grounds due to construction of
new ports will be employed by newly created business lines there on a
priority basis, the sources said.

To this effect, a draft bill governing the promotion of new port
construction, worked out by the ministry, will be submitted to the
forthcoming National Assembly session in October after further
consultations with other government ministries, the sources said.

Under the draft bill, various approval and licensing procedures will
be drastically simplified, the sources said.

At the same time, a promotion council for new port construction,
headed by the deputy premier-finance and economy minister, will be
formed with the heads of provincial governments and local
establishments to deal with basic issues such as designation of
potential areas for new ports, key policy directives, fund supply
programs and the like, the sources said.

If so designated, construction of new ports will benefit from
supporting measures stipulated under the draft bill, and once the
draft bill passes through the National Assembly session, new steps
will be taken for designation of new ports, the sources added.

Korea: Life Insurers Asset Management Yields Drop to 10.7%

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

FINANCE

Life insurance companies' yield on asset management has been dropping
in recent months, affected by the continued bearishness of the local
stock market.

According to life insurance industry sources, for the four month
period from April to July, the nation's 33 life insurers' average
yield on asset management declined to 10.7 percent, a drop of 0.4
percentage point from the corresponding period of 11.1 percent.

In particular, six top life insurers -- Je Il, Samsung, Heungkuk,
Kyobo and Dongah -- saw their combined yield on asset management
scaled back to 10.7 percent during the period, down 0.5 percentage
point from a year earlier.

In contrast, newly established underwriters including Daishin
witnessed a rise in their combined yield on asset management by 0.3
percentage point to 10.7 percent during the April-July period,
outperforming existing larger ones in risky asset management.

Of the big three life insurers, Samsung Life Insurance ranked first on
the yield list for asset management with 11.1 percent involving 858
billion won.

Second was Kyobo Life Insurance with a yield of 11.0 percent, a drop
of 0.6 percentage point from 11.6 percent a year earlier ago. Kyobo
racked up 501.5 billion won in income from asset management.

Korea Life Insurance came in third with 10.5 percent involving 326.8
billion won.

Bank of Korea Reports Bank Lending-Deposit Spreads Increase

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

BANKING

Local banks are expanding lending spreads by raising lending rates
much more than deposit rates, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said.

In a survey on the nation's 30 commercial banks' weighted average
interest rates conducted in July, the central bank said that their
average lending spreads edged up to 2.39 percent, an increase of 0.11
percentage points from the previous month's 2.28 percent.

The reason for this is that commercial banks' average lending rate
surged 0.15 percentage point to annual 11.45 percent in July from the
11.30 percent a month earlier. In contrast, average deposit rates rose
by merely 0.04 percentage point to 9.06 percent from 9.02 percent
during the cited period.

A closer look at the deposit rates by each instrument shows that only
those for time & installment deposits with maturity of three to four
years inched up to 10.57 percent in July from 10.42 percent in June.
Those for free savings deposits rather dropped to 5.67 percent from
5.90 percent, and those for time deposits with maturity of one to two
years skidded to 9.83 percent from 9.85 percent.

When it comes to lending rates, those for overdraft loans rose to
16.13 percent from 14.70 percent on an annual basis during the period.
And those for household loans also edged up to 12.31 percent from
12.17 percent. However those for corporate loans were lowered to 10.85
percent from 11.15 percent.

Samsung Electronics Floats $150 Million in CBs in London

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

FINANCE

Samsung Electronics Co. (SEC) successfully floated $150 million worth
of overseas convertible bonds (CBs) in London.

The nation's No.1 semiconductor manufacturer said that it had a
signing ceremony to issue $150 million worth of CBs in London on
September 20 with Samsung Securities Co. and SBC Warburg acting as
managing underwriters.

The CBs carry a coupon rate of 0.25 percent, and yield to put (YTP) of
5.8 percent.

Conversion premium was fixed at 25 percent. Given that most overseas
depository receipts (DRs) traded in the international markets have a
premium of 10 to 15 percent, SEC CBs' conversion premium is offered
under more favorable conditions.

Korea: Aug. Auto Sales Rise Only 1.8% Due to Sluggish Economy

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

Domestic auto sales edged up a mere 1.8 percent to 121,278 units in
August over last August, due to the stagnant economy. Daewoo Motor
enjoyed the highest sales growth of 14.2 percent to 21,872 units,
while Kia Motors saw its sales fall 8.4 percent to 31,374 units.
Hyundai Motor sold the most with 58,151 units.

Hyundai's Avante was the best selling car. Accent leaped to the third
position from seventh in July. Sales of Kia's Pride reached
2,576 units, exceeding sales of Avella. Elan, Kia's sports coupe,
only recorded one sale.

Ssangyong's jeep-type utility, Korando, turned in a fine performance
with sales of 543 units, helping Ssangyong to recover the second slot
in the jeep-type utility market with total sales of 1,850.  Meanwhile,
Hyundai Precision Ind.   suffered a set-back from 4,100 units in July
to 2,578 units in August, hurt by a labor strike.

President Indicates Shift in Policy Toward North 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      Employing the strongest rhetoric yet, President Kim Young-sam said 
yesterday South Korea will ``reconsider'' its policy toward North 
Korea in wake of the North's infiltration of armed commandos into 
the South.  

      Kim, meeting a group of Japanese political editors at Chong Wa Dae, 
did not go into details of what steps his government will be taking, 
but gave a clear indication of a shift to a hardline stance against 
the North.  

      ``What do you think would have happened if the same highly-trained 
and armed special commandos had infiltrated Japan or the United 
States,'' Kim was quoted as saying by presidential spokesman Yoon 
Yeo-joon.  

      ``I think that in that case, both Japan and the United States would 
have gone to war with the country which sent the guerrillas,'' he 
said.  

      Kim went on to say that if the United States had been put into the 
same situation, it might have already launched a military attack and 
wiped out the provoking nation.  

      Presidential officials said Kim's remarks should be interpreted as 
underscoring the gravity of the North Korean infiltration case.  

      President Kim has already termed the incursion not a simple matter 
of spying activities but a premeditated and deliberate act of 
military provocation against South Korea.  

      Senior administration officials have said that excluding military 
retaliation, South Korea will take all necessary measures to have 
the North pay due price for the intrusion of armed agents.  

      Kim met the Japanese editors, who are here on an exchange program, 
shortly after the South Korea's foreign minister, Gong Ro-myung, and 
its defense minister, Lee Yang-ho, discussed the issue with U.S. 
Amb. James Laney and Gen. John Tillelli Jr., commander of U.S. 
Forces in Korea.  

      The joint conference was part of South Korea's efforts to exert 
political and diplomatic pressure on North Korea.  

      President Kim told the Japanese editors that Seoul and Washington 
are in a full agreement to maintain close cooperation and deal with 
the incursion case in tandem.  

      South Korea has already taken the infiltration case to the United 
Nations, but neither South Korea nor the United States has taken any 
specific actions against the North.  

      Unconfirmed reports said that South Korea may ask the United States 
to resume the joint annual military exercise, Team Spirit, suspend 
economic aid to the North and slow down the pace of improvement in 
U.S.-North Korea relations.  

      South Korean civic groups are already suspending fund-raising 
campaigns for food aid to North Korea.  

      Minister Gong is scheduled to hold a series of discussions with the 
U.S. secretary of state, Warren Christopher, and Japan's foreign 
minister, Yukihiko Ikeda, in New York.  

      Senior diplomats from the three countries also are to hold a 
working-level discussion in the U.S. city, Korean officials said.  

      South Korea, Japan and the United States are leading the KEDO 
international consortium for building light-water nuclear reactors 
in North Korea in exchange for the North's freeze on its old nuclear 
program.  

      There has been no official word from any of the three capitals about 
whether the infiltration case would affect the work of the Korean 
Peninsula Energy Development Organization.  

      But senior South Korean and U.S. officials said they would push 
ahead with the four-way Korean peace talks with North Korea and 
China.  

      The peace talks, aimed at replacing the Korean armistice regime with 
a permanent peace mechanism, were proposed by President Kim and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton last April.

Resumption of Team Spirit Sought; Seoul to Ask Washington to Restart
Military Exercise 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Lee Sung-yul Staff reporter 

      South Korea will seek the resumption of Team Spirit, a massive 
ROK-U.S. joint military exercise, which has been suspended since 
1992.  

      Apparently angered by the incursion of a North Korean submarine and 
26 commandos, the Defense Ministry said yesterday that it would ask 
the Pentagon to restart the exercise, describing the infiltration on 
the East Coast as the most serious violation in decades following 
the Armistice Agreement that brought truce to the Korean War 
(1950-53).  

      The suggestion for resumption of Team Spirit will be officially 
delivered to the United States during the annual ROK-U.S. Security 
Consultative Meeting slated for Oct. 31-Nov. 1 in Washington D.C., a 
ministry official said.  

      The ministry's moves came while thousands of South Korean troops and 
reservists were searching for the five remaining infiltrators in the 
rugged mountains in the southern outskirts of Kangnung on the East 
Coast for the seventh consecutive day.  

      Team Spirit, which started in 1976, was suspended since 1992 except 
in 1993 to help ease tension in the Korean Peninsula. The ministry 
said that the suspension of the exercise was conditional on North 
Korea's promise to refrain from military provocations.  

      But the latest North Korean provocation is a direct challenge to the 
joint South Korea-U.S. efforts to ease tension on the Korean 
Peninsula, the ministry charged, calling the submarine incursion ``a 
grave act of military provocation.''  

      The ministry's statement came after early-morning high-level talks 
in Seoul between Foreign Minister Gong Ro-Myung, Defense Minister 
Lee Yang-Ho, U.S. Amb. James Laney and Gen. John H. Tilelli, the top 
U.S. general in South Korea.  

      Team Spirit was one of the world's largest-scale military maneuvers, 
involving some 218,000 troops at its peak in 1986, including 37,000 
U.S. Forces Korea and thousands of other troops flown from overseas 
bases.  

      North Korea, describing it as a rehearsal to invade the North, 
called for its suspension as a precondition for its agreement in 
1994 to stop its suspected nuclear weapons program.  

      The manhunt for the die-hard infiltrators continued, but there was 
no contact with the die-hard fleeing North Korean agents since 
Sunday morning till yesterday afternoon, the ministry said.  

      An estimated 26 armed North Korean agents have infiltrated the 
nation, abandoning their stranded submarine before dawn Sept. 19.  

      Three South Korean soldiers have been killed, while 20 North Korean 
intruders were either killed or found dead. One has been captured.  

      On Monday evening, the South Korean government flatly rejected a 
North Korean demand to return the submarine, which was found wrecked 
on a reef on a beach near Kangnung some 240 km east of Seoul.  

      ``The North Korean demand to return the submarine is not worth even 
a consideration, in that all the provocative intention surrounding 
the submarine has been brought to light,'' said Defense Ministry 
spokesman Yoon Chang-ro.  

      The North Korean submarine ``apparently had a well-planned, 
intentional mission which amounted to an armed provocation,'' said 
Yoon.  

      He also said that ``the North Koreans' intention is well 
demonstrated by the fact that all of the crew members were 
well-armed officers at the Reconnaissance Bureau under the North 
Korean Ministry of the People's Armed Forces, which specializes in 
infiltrating special agents and spies into the South.''  

      Yoon concluded that the Communist regime's demand to return the 
submarine, ``made six days after the infiltration, is just a sheer 
attempt to ease the worsening international atmosphere against its 
absurd infiltration.''  

      Another government spokesman said that the South could comply with a 
negotiation for the return of the submarine only after North Korea 
apologizes for the infiltration and punish those North Koreans 
responsible for the incursion.  

      Defense ministry officials said that the North Korean submarine 
never drifted nor had any engine trouble, but that it successfully 
infiltrated into the beach south of Kangnung.  

      The tide flew northward at that time, and it doesn't make sense that 
the submarine drifted southward. In addition, the submarine never 
sent an SOS message, the officials said.  

      The dead leader of the infiltrators, identified as Col. Kim 
Dong-won, had infiltrated into the South twice before, the officials 
said, quoting the captured North Korean, Lee Kwang-soo, 31.  

      They noted that North Koreans last week refused to accept a protest 
message of the United Nations Command at a meeting at the truce 
village of Panmunjom. At that time, the North Koreans alleged they 
never sent a submarine to the South, the ministry officials noted.  

      The submarine just ran aground while trying to return to the North 
after an unspecified mission, the officials said, adding that the 
stranded submarine actually had a clear-cut mission, which has yet 
to be known.  

      They also noted that some of the North Korean infiltrators were in 
South Korean Army uniforms and armed themselves with South Korean 
Army rifles. In addition, 11 of them were found dead, allowing 
themselves to be shot dead by their colleagues, apparently at orders 
from Pyongyang, they said.  

      ``North Koreans are trying to deceive the world, but all the 
evidence ran counter to their absurd allegation,'' a ministry 
official said. The official said that ``we are willing to return the 
bodies of the dead infiltrators.''  

      He further said that ``we are simply concerned how far the 
unpredictable nature of the North Korean regime would go.''  

      In a statement released Monday by the North Korean Central News 
Agency, Pyongyang called on the South to return the submarine and 
its crew.  

      The submarine was found wrecked on a reef just scores of meter from 
a beach before dawn Wednesday, from which an estimated 26 North 
Korean agents have landed.

Korean, U.S. Officials Decide to Remain Vigilant; In the Wake of Armed
North Korean Agents" Infiltration Last Week 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Kim Kyung-ho Staff reporter 

      Top South Korean and U.S. officials decided yesterday to maintain a 
higher degree of vigilance in wake of armed North Korean agents' 
infiltration into South Korea last week.  

      The decision was made at a meeting among Foreign Minister Gong 
Ro-myung, Defense Minister Lee Yang-ho, U.S. Amb. James Laney and 
Gen. John Tilelli, Jr., commander of the U.S. forces.  

      The top foreign policy and defense officials reaffirmed the South 
Korean and the United States' position to maintain strong joint 
defense capabilities to cope with any possible military adventure by 
North Korea.  

      At a breakfast meeting at Gong's residence, the four officials also 
agreed to issue a strong warning to North Korea against its 
infiltration of ``armed commandos'' into the South.  

      ``Participants agreed on the necessity of sending North Korea a 
strong warning that the military provocation not only betrays Korean 
people's sincere wish to establish peace and stability on the Korean 
Peninsula through inter-Korean talks, but also runs counter to the 
efforts of the international community that has donated humanitarian 
aid to North Korea,'' said a press release issued after the meeting. 
 

      The officials agreed the infiltration of armed North Korean 
commandos is not only a violation of the 1953 Armistice Agreement 
that ended the Korean War but also a serious threat to the security 
of the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding region.  

      They emphasized that the armistice agreement should be maintained 
until a new peace regime is established on the peninsula through 
direct negotiations between South and North Korea.  

      Furthermore, the officials agreed to take strong measures to 
dissuade North Korea from what they termed the anachronistic 
illusion of unifying the Korean Peninsula by military means.  

      They also agreed South Korea and the United States will maintain 
close coordination in bringing the whole truth about the 
infiltration to the light.  

      But the South Korean and U.S. officials did not discuss whether to 
resume the South Korean-U.S. joint military exercise, Team Spirit, 
suspended in 1994, said a South Korean Foreign Ministry official.  

      ``At this stage, adding new military capabilities is not being 
considered,'' he said.  

      Specific measures to be taken against North Korea, including details 
of the warning, will be discussed at a meeting between Gong and U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher in New York Tuesday, the 
official said.  

      Gong left for New York after yesterday's meeting.  

      Following his talks with Christopher, he is scheduled to meet with 
his Japanese counterpart Yukihiko Ikeda to discuss the North Korean 
provocation.  

      The foreign ministers' meetings will be followed by tripartite 
consultations among senior officials from South Korea, the United 
States and Japan to be held in New York Thursday.  

      While seeking measures to make North Korea pay the price for the 
armed provocation, South Korean officials have suggested they will 
maintain the framework of the existing policy toward North Korea.  

      Gong recently said the infiltration of armed North Korean agents 
would halt economic cooperation with and humanitarian aid to North 
Korea for a considerable time.  

      Seoul officials have left open the possibility of South Korea 
reconsidering its commitment to a U.S.-initiated international 
project to build light-water reactors in the North in return for 
Pyongyang freezing its suspected nuclear weapons program.  

      They have also pledged to pursue punitive measures against North 
Korea within the U.N. Security Council when the details of the 
incident are uncovered.  

      But Gong said South Korea will continue to push for the four-way 
peace talks Seoul and Washington proposed to hold with Pyongyang and 
Beijing.  

      While rejecting North Korea's claim its submarine was on a routine 
mission when it ran aground off South Korea's eastern coast, 
Washington expressed its hope that the incident will not worsen 
tensions on the Korean Peninsula.  

      U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry told a news conference in 
Stockholm Monday ``All of our evidence suggests that this North 
Korean submarine was not on a routine mission.''  

      But he said Washington wants South and North Korea to ``work to try 
to keep this from becoming an incident beyond the damage that has 
already been caused.''  

      He said it is still important to proceed with the proposed four-way 
peace talks.

Foreign Ministry Officials Assigned to New Posts 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The government yesterday appointed Kim Hang-kyung, deputy foreign 
minister for planning and management, as ambassador to Canada.  

      In a reshuffle of eight high-ranking diplomatic posts, Moon 
Dong-suk, chief of protocol at the Foreign Ministry, was named as 
ambassador to Australia.  

      Kim and Moon were replaced by Chung Tae-ik, deputy foreign minister 
for political affairs, and Chung Kie-ok, ambassador to Poland, 
respectively.  

      Ambassador-at-Large Song Young-shik took up the post of deputy 
foreign minister for political affairs.  

      Choi Dae-hwa, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs, was 
appointed as ambassador to India, and Chun Yong-duc, former deputy 
director general of the ministry's Treaties Bureau, was named as 
ambassador to Zambia.  

      Choi was succeeded by Hong Jung-pyo, ambassador to Sri Lanka.  

      New ambassador to Canada Kim, 55, a graduate from the college of law 
at Seoul National University (SNU), had served as director general 
for consular and overseas residents affairs, ambassador to Myanmar 
and consul general to Los Angeles before he was appointed as deputy 
foreign minister for planning and management in January 1995.  

      The new envoy to Australia, Moon, 53, who majored in international 
relations at SNU, had worked as presidential secretary for foreign 
affairs, director general of the ministry's International 
Organizations and Treaties Bureau and ambassador to Turkey before he 
was named as chief of protocol in January 1995.

Rep. Lee Myung-bak's Election Scandal a Political Liability for NKP 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Shin Yong-bae Staff reporter 

      With two of his staff members under arrest, Rep. Lee Myung-bak 
accused of election fraud, has become a political liability for the 
ruling New Korea Party.  

      The ruling party is considering expelling Rep. Lee from the party in 
an effort to contain fallout from the scandal involving Lee's 
campaign spending during the April general elections.  

      While the ruling party is trying to extricate itself from the 
uproar, the main opposition National Congress for New Politics is 
stepping up an offensive against its rival.  

      Ruling party leaders were embarrassed when the secret departure of 
one of Rep. Lee's former campaign workers, Kim Yu-chan, to a foreign 
country was found to have been arranged by Lee's aides.  

      Kim disappeared after alleging two weeks ago that Rep. Lee had spent 
more money than legally allowed in the April vote.  

      On Sunday, the prosecution arrested two of Lee's aides on charges of 
helping Kim escape to Hong Kong Sept. 15. They were under suspicion 
of giving him $18,000 in travel expenses.  

      In a statement issued Monday, the ruling party apologized to the 
public for the alleged involvement of Lee's aides in Kim's escape.  

      The ruling party also offered an apology to the National Congress 
for New Politics for its previous claim that the opposition party 
helped Kim leave the country.  

      It is unusual for the ruling party to offer an official apology to 
an opposition party.  

      Ruling party officials expressed anger that the party was humiliated 
because Rep. Lee had allegedly lied about the accusations. They were 
referring to a news conference last week, in which Rep. Lee denied 
Kim's allegations.  

      The officials said party leaders are nearing a consensus that Rep. 
Lee should leave the party, holding himself responsible for the 
scandal.  

      Party Secretary-General Kang Sam-jae hinted that the party will soon 
expel Rep. Lee if he should refuse to leave the party voluntarily.  

      ``It will not take much time for the party to decide what measures 
it will take against him because the outcome of the prosecution's 
investigations into the scandal will come out soon,'' 
Secretary-General Kang said.  

      The opposition National Congress for New Politics, which welcomed 
the ruling party's apology, demanded Rep. Lee resign immediately.  

      A spokesman for the opposition party said that Rep. Lee should 
resign as a member of the National Assembly for his alleged 
implication in Kim's escape though it has yet be confirmed.  

      A ruling party official, who contacted Lee, quoted him as saying 
that he did not order his aides to arrange Kim's escape.  

      The National Congress for New Politics also urged the prosecution to 
summon Rep. Lee immediately and take legal action.  

      The opposition party, which believes that the scandal is the tip of 
the iceberg of election fraud allegedly committed by the ruling 
party during the April vote, is preparing to intensify its attack on 
the ruling party.

Democratic Party Moves Closer to a Breakup 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The small opposition Democratic Party (DP) is moving closer to a 
breakup, with its leader, Lee Ki-taek, demanding that Rep. Jei 
Jung-gu from his rival faction resign as floor leader.  

      Lee's mainstream faction's attack on the minority group of reform 
advocates is fueling speculations that the party is headed for a 
breakup.  

      ``Rep. Jei should resign as floor leader because he abandoned his 
job as party official and joined a reformist group,'' Rep. Lee 
Choong-jae, a leader of the main faction, said on behalf of the 
main-stream faction in a party caucus held in the National Assembly 
yesterday.  

      Rep. Jei, a leading member of the party's reformist faction, has 
been under pressure to step down since his faction launched an 
organization, the Council for National Unification, Monday in a 
revolt against party president Lee's leadership.  

      The launch of the council was seen as the reform-minded group's move 
to seek a divorce from Lee Ki-taek's main faction.  

      Earlier this week, the DP leadership accused the reformist group of 
damaging party unity by launching a separate faction.  

      The strife between the DP's rival factions surfaced when Lee was 
elected to the top post in a national convention in June.  

      Members of the reformist faction, including Rep. Jei, have since 
refused to work under Lee's command.  

      Rep. Jei refused to accept the main faction's demands, saying, ``Our 
council is only part of regular party affairs. Party president Lee 
should take proper procedures before demanding my resignation.''  

      Among the members of Rep. Jei's group, led by former party Chairman 
Kim Won-ki, are Reps. Lee Soo-in, Lee Mi-kyung and Kim Hong-shin and 
former lawmakers who failed to retain congressional seats in April's 
elections.

Search Operations Likely to Be Protracted; Inspections on Streets Stepped
Up in Case Agents Break Blockade 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      With five North Korean intruders presumed to be still at large in 
mountains near Kangnung, the search operations showed signs 
yesterday of becoming protracted.  

      Military officials said they were preparing for the possibility of 
long-term operations, as the manhunt for the fleeing infiltrators 
was at an impasse.  

      Thousands of troops continued to comb through mountains and possible 
escape routes, but failed to track down the North Koreans.  

      Out of an estimated 26 North Koreans from a submarine which was 
found wrecked on the Kangnung shores Wednesday, 21 had been 
accounted for as of yesterday _ nine were killed in shootouts, 11 
found dead and one captured alive.  

      The search operations focused on Mt. Chilsong, where some of the 
remaining North Koreans were believed to be hiding.  

      Loudspeakers blared taped messages of the captured submarine 
crewman, Lee Kwang-soo, and leaflets calling for surrender were 
scattered from helicopters.  

      The Army also stepped up security along coastal roads to block the 
North Koreans from attempting to escape by sea.  

      It was unlikely that the intruders escaped through several layers of 
cordon in the areas, the officials said.  

      They, however, began to talk about the possibility of changing 
tactics if the intruders are not rounded up within a few days.  

      No traces of the North Koreans have been found since the captain of 
the submarine was killed in a shootout on Mt. Chilsong around 6:40 
a.m. Sunday.  

      Some analysts said some of the North Korean agents might have 
escaped the cordons and were heading toward North Korea via mountain 
routes. They also raised the possibility that the intruders might 
have sneaked into Kangnung after camouflaging themselves as South 
Korean civilians.  

      To cope with such possibilities, the officials said, the military 
has stepped up inspections along the streets of the city.  

      They also said they were considering mobilizing Cobra combat 
helicopters for pursuit operations in mountains.  

      While search operations were under way on Mt. Chilsong Monday 
evening, a light suspected to be reflected from a weapon was spotted 
moving along a ridge. Search teams, however, could not find traces 
of the intruders.

Controversy Expected Over Medical Compensation Bill 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Song Jung-tae Staff reporter 

      Years-long controversy will likely flare up again as the Ministry of 
Health and Welfare is seeking to legislate a law designed to mediate 
medical disputes between doctors and patients.  

      The ministry made public yesterday a draft bill on mediating medical 
disputes, which would make it mandatory for doctors, herb doctors 
and dentists to join the tentatively named ``Medical Compensation 
Mutual-Aid Association.''  

      Concerned parties who does not join the association will be fined up 
to 10 million won.  

      The ministry, after collecting from opinions from the parties 
concerned, plans to submit the bill to the National Assembly within 
this year for legislation, officials said.  

      They said the ministry, if things go well, plans to put the law into 
effect beginning 1998.  

      According to the draft bill, the association would compensate for 
patients or their families when disputes occur over accidents, which 
occur without any remarkable errors committed by doctors.  

      `` Anyone who wants to receive compensation would be required to go 
through mediation before bringing accident cases to court,'' said 
Rhie Dong-mo, director general of the ministry's Bureau of Medical 
Affairs.  

      For this, a mediation committee on medical dispute would be set up 
under the ministry, and city and provincial governments beginning 
1998, he said.  

      Those who can file a mediation with the mediation committee would be 
limited to patients, or their representatives. Those who are 
eligible to become representatives would include lawyers, medical 
personnel, legal representatives, spouses and direct family members 
such as brothers and sisters.  

      Anyone who assaults doctors or is involved in other violent actions 
during medical disputes would be severely punished.  

      There has been many reports that family members of patients have 
destroyed medical equipment or facilities, employed violence against 
doctors when patients die in the process of medical treatment.  

      The draft bill, however, faced opposition in part from the medical 
society.  

      The Korean Hospitals Association (KHA), a group of hospitals, said 
that it is irrational for the government to force the Medical 
Compensation Mutual-Aid Association alone to compensate the patients 
for accidents which occur without any remarkable errors committed by 
doctors. In other words, these cases involve accidents whose exact 
cause is not revealed.  

      Lee Jun-hyup, a spokesman for the KHA, said, ``In such cases, 
government should shared a burden together with the Medical 
Compensation Mutual-Aid Association.''  

      The Korea Medical Association, a group of doctors, took a similar 
stance.  

      Kim Jung-soo, a spokesman for the KMA, said, ``We cannot accept the 
bill. It is absurd for medical personnel to take the whole 
responsibility for accidents.''  

      He asked back, ``When patients die despite every effort by doctors, 
who should take responsibility for the cases? In the cases, the 
government should compensate.''  

      Doctors are regulated to provide medical treatment for all patients 
including those who in their terminal stage. However, such cases 
involves the likelihood for doctors to be engaged in dispute, Kim 
explained.  

      In 1994, a similar bill was submitted to the National Assembly by 
the ministry for legislation amid desperate opposition from the 
medical society, and was under deliberation at the National 
Assembly's Health and Welfare Committee last year.  

      But the bill was discarded in the wake of the end of the term of the 
14th National Assembly in earlier June.

KATA Chairman Honored With Silver Tower 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      Chung Un-sik, chairman of the Korea Association of Travel Agents 
(KATA), yesterday received the Order of Industrial Service Merit, 
Silver Tower, becoming the first representative from the travel 
agent industry to be honored by the government for their 
contribution to spurring the nation's economy.  

      The tourism industry has been promoted by the South Korean 
government as an ``industry without chimneys,'' and Culture and 
Sports Minister Kim Young-soo conferred the order and other awards 
at the Seoul Sejong Cultural Center yesterday in commemoration of 
the 23rd World Tourism Day which fell on Sept. 27.  

      Chung, 61, who also heads the Edu Tours Co., is widely hailed in the 
industry as a pioneer in the development of new travel products and 
diversifying tourism markets including the former Communist bloc of 
Eastern Europe and Latin American countries.  

      The most representative of his innovative approach to new travel 
products is the ``Backpack Europe Trip with the Eurail Pass,'' which 
enjoyed phenomenal success with collegians after foreign travel was 
completely liberalized in 1989.  

      His lifetime devotion to the tourism industry started out in 1959 as 
a travel manager. He then was promoted to executive sales director 
of C.F. Sharp Co., a representative agency for Northwest Airlines 
sales office in Korea.  

      From these experiences, he set up his own company, the Seoul Travel 
Co., in 1971, the predecessor to Edu Tours.  

      He is widely involved in international tourism associations. As a 
member of the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), he brought the 
43rd PATA Annual Conference to Seoul in 1994 as the city celebrated 
600th anniversary as the nation's capital.  

      In 1993, he was elected the first international representative from 
the Asian region of the American Society of Travel Agencies.  

      For his work in furthering international tourism, he received the 
``Golden Helm'' Award at the 1992 International Travel and Tourism 
Berlin held in Germany.  

      Chung was awarded along with Chung Hee-ja, president of Hilton Hotel 
Seoul who received the Gold Tower, and Her Tae-hak, head of Yongin 
Everland, who received the Bronze Tower.

Editorial; Sober, Austere Chusok Holidays 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      An intrinsic desire of human beings to lead a better life often 
serves as the strongest motive to propel society to further develop 
itself. History testifies, however, that a society's ability to 
enjoy enduring development depends largely on how it values the 
better life. Invariably, overindulgence in luxuries has ended in 
catastrophes.  

      In Korea, moderation and decency have long been regarded as 
overriding virtues and a guiding philosophical value inherent among 
the Korean people for centuries. Certainly, Korea has achieved 
remarkable progress, especially economically, in the past decade or 
two. And we Koreans can surely deserve and afford to lead a life 
matching our economic affluence.  

      Yet, it is a pity to see some people indulging in indiscreet 
consumption and extravagance. Korea's per capita GNP is still in the 
neighborhood of $10,000. But the lifestyle pursued by some people 
makes us wonder if our per capita income has already reached the 
$30,000 mark. A Seoul department store reports that it daily sells 
about 500 ready-made suits that each costs more than 600,000 won, or 
roughly $700, offering us an example of the trend of the times.  

      Imports of such nonessential consumer goods as chocolate and golf 
clubs are reported to be increasing sharply. For instance, imports 
of carpets increased 32 percent to more than $15 million last year, 
while that of refrigerators rose 58.4 percent to $32 million during 
the same period. The nation, of course, needs to import more 
products to defuse foreign trade pressure and to live up to the 
spirit of reciprocity in world trade. However, excessive importation 
of luxury consumer goods poses problems outside the sphere of 
economics.  

      Moreover, our country is divided, the northern half of which is 
dominated by constantly belligerent Communists whose ultimate goal 
remains the communization of the whole Korean Peninsula. At this 
very moment, armed North Korean infiltrators are foraying our 
countryside in a vicious scheme to frustrate our stability and 
integrity. It is in such an environment that we must pursue and 
maintain our national harmony. Overindulgence in luxury by some 
segments of society undermines that harmony and solidarity. Some may 
argue that it is up to the individual to lead the lifestyle of his 
choosing. Yet it must be fully realized that they cannot be immune 
to the obligations and morality of society.  

      During the Chusok holidays that begin tomorrow, people are inclined 
to be a bit too lavish with their clothing, gifts and shopping 
sprees. That people make sure they enjoy every bit of the festive 
season is good and laudable. However, they should plan for the 
holidays within their means and in ways possible. A more simple, 
austere and streamlined lifestyle, corresponding to the realities he 
or she faces, should be in place. Everything that is traditional 
cannot necessarily be considered good. As regards to gift-giving, 
choosing prohibitively expensive luxury items comparable to bribery 
may reveal bad taste and could endanger the good will of the 
receiver.  

      Local mass media could be chided for their sensational treatment of 
such joyous holiday activities as superfluous shopping and 
merrymaking. They allegedly are serving the interests of their 
audiences and that may be true to some extent. However, they are 
guilty of engaging in what amounts to advertisement and agitation 
for a variety of Chusok sprees.  

      In order to help ease horrendous traffic gridlocks, visitors to 
homes and ancestral graveyards in the countryside could either 
stagger their traveling times or advance the dates for visits under 
the guidance of a credible public organization.  

      Extravagance by some indiscreet people leads to the detriment of 
others. The wasteful quest for luxury never results in good. 
Moderation and decency is what must supplant such a quest. The 
overall tenor of Chusok events is centered not so much on the 
material side as it is on the showing of gratitude for the bountiful 
blessings of the season.

Over 7,000 Cars Sold in January-August; Chrysler Takes Lead in Top 5
Foreign-Made Car Sales 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Lee Kap-soo Staff reporter 

      Despite the worsening economic situation in the country, foreign 
automakers here are enjoying a lucrative business performance 
nowadays.  

      According to statistics released by the Korea Automobile Importers' 
Association (KAIA), the domestic sales of foreign-made cars totaled 
7,073 units in the first eight months of this year, up 52.9 percent 
from the 4,627 units recorded in the same 1995 span.  

      The number of foreign-made cars sold in Korea rose sharply from 
1,827 units in 1992 to 1,975 units in 1993, 3,903 units in 1994 and 
further to 6,399 units in 1995.  

      The top five best-selling foreign cars on the domestic market so far 
this year were Chrysler of the United States, Volvo and SAAB of 
Sweden and BMW and Mercedes-Benz of Germany.  

      Chrysler sold the most on the domestic market during the 
January-August period of 1996 with 1,398 units, followed by BMW with 
1,064 units and Mercedes-Benz with 961 units.  

      Volvo ranked fourth with 821 units, followed by SAAB with 586 units, 
Audi with 485 units, Ford with 432 units and General Motors with 412 
units.  

      By country, U.S.-made cars topped the list of domestic sales with 
3,238 units during the first eight months of 1996, accounting for 45 
percent of all the foreign-made cars sold in the country.  

      Cars from Germany came next with 2,428 units (34 percent of the 
total), followed by those from Sweden with 1,210 units (17 percent) 
and those from France with 177 units (2 percent).  

      By size, foreign-made cars with an engine capacity ranging from 
2,001cc to 3,000cc sold the most on the domestic market with 3,508 
units during the January-August period of 1996, representing 49.6 
percent of the total sales of foreign cars here.  

      Mid-size foreign cars with an engine capacity of less than 2,000cc 
ranked second with the domestic sales figure of 2,072 units (29.3 
percent of the total), followed by big-size sedans with an engine 
capacity of 3,001cc-4,000cc with 1,125 units (15.9 percent) and 
super-size luxurious sedan with an engine capacity of over 4,000cc 
with 368 units (5.2 percent).  

      Auto experts here attributed the surge in foreign car sales on the 
domestic market mainly to the lowering prices of foreign cars 
stemming from a sharp reduction in the acquisition and special 
excise taxes on medium- and large-size cars and intensified sales 
activities of foreign automakers here.  

      In July alone, 1,320 foreign-made cars were sold in Korea, a 
whopping rise of 78.8 percent from a year earlier, indicating that 
the domestic demands for foreign cars are showing an explosive 
growth, even though the Seoul government strongly calls for the curb 
of excessive consumption out of fear about the nation's snowballing 
trade deficits.  

      If this trend continues, the domestic sales figure of foreign-made 
cars is expected to reach some 14,000 units this year and 30,000 
units next year, far exceeding the 7,804 recorded in 1995, they 
said.  

      The Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association (KAMA) also forecasts 
that the nation's import of foreign-made cars would exceed 100,000 
units in 2000, accounting for some 3-5 percent of the domestic 
automobile market.  

      The comparable portion of foreign automobiles was 0.44 percent in 
1995, 0.55 percent in May this year and 0.7 percent in August.  

      Most market watchers even predict that foreign automakers will 
rapidly encroach upon the domestic passenger car market over the 
coming 10 years at the least.  

      One of the key factors behind these rosy prospects is the changing 
attitude of Korean consumers toward foreign-made cars.  

      According to a recent survey of car owners conducted by Hyundai 
Motor Co., for instance, 39.9 percent of the respondents replied 
that they would choose a foreign-made car rather than a Korean-made 
one if the prices of the both are pretty much the same.  

      Aggressive sales promotion activities and the introduction of new 
and diversified models by foreign automakers here have also greatly 
contributed to the brisk sales of foreign-made cars in Korea, market 
experts say.  

      Among those are the introduction of relatively low-price 
foreign-made cars ranging from 10 million won (some $12,300) to 20 
million won per unit, the free supply of some expendable auto parts 
to consumers and guaranteed vehicle maintenance lasting for three 
years after the purchase.  

      However, there are still several negative factors.  

      ``We can cite the social climate here as the Achilles' heel for 
foreign automakers. Accordingly, the domestic sales of foreign-made 
cars may turn from a sharp rise to a steep drop if the nation's 
current account deficit continues snowballing rapidly and the social 
environment turns against excessive consumption in the future,'' 
said Kim Young-tae, a senior official of the KAMA.  

      ``At the same time, the competitiveness of foreign automakers still 
lags behind that of domestic car producers in terms of after-sales 
service mainly because of the insufficient number of service centers 
and vehicle maintenance technicians-plus the slow supply of some 
auto parts,'' he said.  

      If foreign automakers remove such negative factors, the domestic 
market share of foreign-made cars is likely to expand at a rapid 
pace in the years ahead, he added.  

      Reflective of the brisk sales of foreign-made cars here, in the 
meantime, two out of the 11 importers and sales agents for foreign 
cars in the country saw the annual sales figure exceed 1,000 units 
for the first time.  

      The annual sales figure of 1,000 cars is regarded by most auto 
experts as the break-even-point of foreign automakers.  

      Woo Sung Industrial Co., an importer and domestic sales agent for 
Chrysler, sold 1,398 units during the first eight months of the 
year, a significant rise of 79.2 percent from the same period of 
1995.  

      Kolon International Corp., a sales agent for BMW, also sold 1,064 
units in the eight-month period, a 121.1 percent surge from a year 
ago.  

      The domestic sales figure during the same period stood at 961 for 
Han Sung Motor Co., a sales agent for Mercedes-Benz; 821 for Hanjin 
Engineering & Construction Co., a Volvo agent; 693 for Hyosung 
Corp., a Volkswagen and Audi agent; and 602 for Inchcape Korea, a 
sales agent for General Motors, Jaguar, Land Rover, Rolls-Royce and 
Avalon of Toyota.  

      Ford Korea, a subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. in Seoul which initiated 
the domestic car sales business in early June, sold 432 units during 
the June-August period of 1996.

Market & Economic Viewpoint (By Seong C. Gweon); Are All Banks the Same? 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Seong C. Gweon 

      This is what actually happened in an executive meeting of a major 
bank, according to a recent (Sept. 21) report in the Korea Economic 
Daily. The bank had to reach a final decision to submit a bid for a 
deposit as much as 118.5 billion won to the Ministry of Information 
and Communication. ``An annual rate of 13.5 percent is a must,'' 
said a director of business at large while another director in 
charge of investment argued for 13 percent at the highest. The 
latter said, ``The going market rate is a little over 12 percent and 
thus it is almost impossible to earn more than 13 percent even if we 
get the money.'' Guess what? The majority opted for 13.5 percent, 
the higher rate, as usual.  

      Many Korean banks _ firms in other sectors as well _  still think 
size or market share is more important than profitability. 
Operations of banks have been heavily controlled by the government, 
which would like to pump money into strategic sectors. Therefore, 
the management of a bank is more sensitive to what the government 
wants to do rather than how much its shareholders want them to earn. 
 

      This can explain the differences in profitability between Korean 
banks and foreign banks. For example, the average return on assets 
for 25 Korean banks in 1995 was 0.32 percent whereas that for the 
branches in Seoul of foreign banks was 1.17 percent. This difference 
is too big to be explained by the fact that domestic banks operate 
in a more restrictive environment. Here are a couple of more 
comparisons: The seven largest U.S. banks as a whole earned 1.62 
percent on their assets and the top seven British banks earned 1.29 
percent. Net income per employee for Korean banks was only one fifth 
of that for U.S. banks and a third of that for Japanese banks.  

      Is the bank mentioned at the beginning going to lose money to pay 
more than they will be able to earn? Better not. After all, they 
will not lose because it won't be a difficult task to charge more 
than 13 percent on their lendings. How? It's almost certain that 
there will be a sufficient number of companies, more often smaller 
ones, which are in desperate need of money. This is said to be one 
of many reasons why Korean firms are suffering from a low margin. In 
other words, firms, i.e., their clients, fall victim to less 
competitive, and thus less productive banks.   

Banks on buy list  

      Still, banks are making money! Ironically, as the economy becomes 
weaker, they seem to be better positioned than any other industries 
in Korea. A broker in the international marketing department of a 
major securities company said the other day that foreign 
institutions showed more interest in Korean banks, but the question 
is: Are all banks the same?  

      The 12 banks headquartered in Seoul and the 13 provincial banks were 
analysed. Prices as of Sept. 18 are on the y-axis in the chart shown 
and earnings per share (EPS) on the x-axis. The regression line fits 
the 25 points, which stand for the banks (their names appear only if 
they are specifically mentioned) and expresses the ``positive'' 
relationship between price and EPS. The line cuts the y-axis at 
6,813 which means that a bank with a ``zero'' EPS may still sell for 
6,813 won. A bank located above the line is considered to be 
relatively overvalued and vice versa. For example, Cheju and Shinhan 
look way off this line, meaning they are ``more expensive'' in a 
relative sense than the other banks.  

      There are three more diagonal lines, denoting the 
price-earnings(p/e) multiples equal to 5, 10 and 20 times. For 
example, the price being equal to 10,500 won and the EPS equal to 
2,198 won, the multiple for Kyongnam is 4.7 times, which makes the 
corresponding point just off the p/e5 line. Similarly, the p/e for 
Foreign Exchange is 10.2 times with the price being equal to 9,150 
won and the EPS equal to 893 won. Those 25 banks have been grouped 
arbitrarily. The banks in the first group realized a loss in the 
first half of this year. Those in the second group, 13 in total, 
have a p/e multiple of 10 times or above. Considering that the 
market multiple is about 18 times and that bank stocks in general 
are supposed to be less volatile than the market average, they seem 
to be somewhat overvalued except those near or below the p/e10 line 
such as Cho-hung, Foreign Exchange and Commercial. The last group 
consists of 6 banks whose p/e's are a little larger or smaller than 
5 times. If the p/e multiple sums up everything relevant in valuing 
a stock, these stocks should be fundamentally undervalued.  

      What if the two valuations were combined? Stocks below both the 
p/e10 line and the regression line may be said to be ``truly'' 
undervalued. Those belonging to this category are Commercial, Pusan, 
Daegu and Kyongnam.  

      Although this kind of analysis has its own merit, one caveat should 
be properly given. The earnings per share used in the analysis were 
computed by doubling the first-half figures, assuming the full-year 
results would be as good, or bad for some banks, as the first-half 
ones. Instead, the most recent full-year figures (the second half of 
1995 plus the first half of 1996) may be used.  ____

Contemporary Korean Art on Show in Tokyo; Works of 14 Artists Reflecting
"90s Trend Exhibited as Part of Exchange Program 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Cho Yoon-jung Staff reporter 

      The last major exhibition of Korean art to be held at the National 
Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo, Japan, was in 1968. Almost 30 years 
later, a show titled ``An Aspect of Korean Art in the 1990s'' opens 
there today through Nov. 17 featuring the work of 14 artists in 
their 30s and 40s.  

      The exhibition is part of an exchange relationship with Korea's 
National Museum of Contemporary Art and has been in the works since 
1992. In preparation, three curators from Japan have been coming to 
Korea regularly over the years to meet with artists and see the 
major exhibitions going on around the country.  

      Next year, an exhibition of Japanese art will be held in Korea.  

      While small shows of Korean art have been held in Japan on a private 
level, none has been able to give a comprehensive view of the state 
of art here. For Korea, Japan has always been a country which has 
been ``so close and yet so far away'' but, in the idealistic view 
perhaps, art has the power to break down barriers and prejudices and 
spark understanding, and this is the context in which the exhibition 
is considered to be important.  

      The 1968 exhibition featured Korea's monochrome art, one of the 
country's most unique art movements when seen in an international 
light. In the time between, art has changed and expanded its 
territory greatly. Into the '90s, art here is as varied and complex 
in expression as it is in other parts of the world reflecting 
greater exposure to international movements and greater dialogue and 
exchange with other artists around the world.  

      The 14 artists chosen cover the fields of painting, sculpture, 
photography and installation. Together their work points to a 
certain emerging direction for Korean art, a direction which has yet 
to be defined in any concrete way even in Korea.  

      The art form to come out of the great expansion in artistic 
expression is the installation though as recently as five years ago 
installations were quite a novelty on the scene.  

      Five artists in the exhibition work on installations _  Kim Soo-ja, 
Park In-churl, U Son-ok, You Maeung-gyun and Yun Suk-nam. Of these 
Kim and Yun tackle the subject of women. Kim makes her statement 
with bundles wrapped in brightly colored cloths, called ``pojagi,'' 
which were indispensable in Korean households. The motif of cloth 
and sewing is one which links generations of women in silent 
sisterhood.  

      Yun is a popular artist who took up her art after first fulfilling 
the expected roles of wife, mother and daughter-in-law. A proponent 
of feminist art here, she presents wooden figures of ``mother,'' 
often using wooden washboards, to symbolize the pains and sorrows of 
women in this society.  

      Both Yun and Kim are also taking part in an exhibition in New York 
titled ``Contemporary Art in Asia: Traditions/ Tensions,'' presented 
by the Asia Society.  

      With the great expansion in artistic mediums, Oum Jeong-soon and Kim 
Ho-deuk are two artists who are still into drawing. Oum is into 
finely detailed, skeletal and almost scientific pictures of plants 
while Kim takes a Zen approach to nature.  

      The environment is an important issue for Bae Bien-u and Kim 
Myung-sook, the trees lovers. Bae is a photographer who concentrates 
on the pine tree, a symbolic tree for the Korean people. Kim draws 
forests, detailed, fine and dense packed with lines going over and 
over each other in pencil, conte and charcoal, leaving no blank 
space on the paper.  

      The rest of the artists _ Je Yeo-ran, Lee Young-bae, Kim Hong-joo 
and Kim Jong-hak _ are painters with a strong experimental streak.  

      Je's work is especially interesting as it shows how the monochrome 
tradition has developed into the '90s. Kim Jong-hak's work shows how 
painting overlaps into the world of installation by incorporating 
nuts and bolts, movie posters, apples and pears. Kim Hong-joo 
presents realist portraits created by inspecting himself in a 
mirror.  

      Realism is an art area where exchange between Korea and Japan is 
also taking place on a private level. While the exhibition of Korean 
art is under way in Tokyo, 12 Japanese artists are taking part in 
``Beautiful Fiction _ Exhibition of Contemporary Realism'' at POSCO 
Gallery in Samsung-dong through Oct. 24.

Family Values Highlighted by Chusok Celebrations 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Kim Min-hee Staff reporter 

      Koreans will celebrate Chusok, the traditional Korean Full Moon Day, 
Friday. The nation's biggest holiday after New Year's Day, the day 
is devoted to ancestral worship and family reunions.  

      Coming on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, Chusok is also 
called Chungchujol, meaning ``mid-autumn day'' or Hangawi, the 
origin of which is unclear.  

      This year, the official Chusok holiday begins tomorrow to last 
through Saturday. But as Sunday follows immediately, most people 
will take four days off in a row.  

      Similar to America's Thanksgiving Day in spirit, the holiday, whose 
unique custom dates back to the reign of King Yuri (24-57 AD) of the 
Silla Kingdom, is originally a time of offering thanks for a 
bountiful harvest combined with the ritual of ancestral worship.  

      Although the tradition is still kept intact, for modern-day Koreans, 
the day's primary function has shifted to the reunion of families as 
a result of the disintegration of the country's extended family 
system.  

      As in the past years, the expressways and other major roads 
throughout the nation are expected to be jampacked with cars 
carrying millions of hometown visitors during the holiday period. 
Last year, more than 27 million people were reported to have 
crisscrossed the nation. This year, the number is expected to be 
less.  

      The festive mood surrounding Chusok is accompanied by a solemn 
spirit. On Chusok, people get up early, change into their Sunday 
best and conduct memorial services, called ``charye,'' at home and 
visit the graves of their ancestors.  

      For the services for the ancestors, people set up tables laden with 
offerings of freshly harvested crops such as rice, an assortment of 
dishes, fruit, and wine made from fresh rice. The day's most popular 
delicacy is ``songpyon,'' half-moon shaped rice cakes. It is made of 
well-kneaded steamed rice powder, stuffed with chestnuts, beans, 
dried Chinese dates or powdered sesame.  

      For those who plan to remain in Seoul during the holiday period, a 
number of cultural events have been organized by the Ministry of 
Culture and Sports.  

      The five ancient palaces in Seoul, Toksu Palace, Kyongbok Palace, 
Changgyong Palace, Chongmyo and Changdok Palace, and the National 
Folklore Museum will remain open to the public.  

      Under the administration of the Cultural Property Preservation 
Bureau, Toksu, Kyongbok and Changgyong palaces and the museum will 
make available their outside grounds for visitors to enjoy some of 
Korea's outdoor folk games, such as ``nolttuigi'' (sea-saw jumping) 
and ``chegichagi'' (shuttlecock kicking).  

      Various concerts of Korean music are also scheduled.  

      In a concert titled ``Song of Hometown'' on Sept. 26, 7:30 p.m., at 
the National Theater, Hanwoori Opera Company will perform lyric and 
popular songs of Korea, targeting specifically those who have left 
their homes in North Korea. Also to be held at the National Theater 
are a pansori performance by Choi Yong-gil and a performance of 
popular and screen music by Seoul Romance Orchestra, at 3 and 7 p.m. 
Saturday, respectively.  

      Sponsored by the Foundation for the Preservation of Cultural 
Properties, there will also be a performance of traditional Korean 
songs and dances Sept. 27-29 at Seoul Norimadang, an outdoor stage 
in Chamsil in southeastern Seoul.

Patent Law Worker Wins Top Prize in National Practical English Contest 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The first prize of the 1996 National Practical English Contest, 
which was held Sept. 21 at KM-TV Hall in Nonhyon-dong, southern 
Seoul, was awarded to Jang Young-yun, who works for Koreana patent 
law firm in Seoul.  

      The second prizes went to Kim Joo-hoon and Jeong Eun-young and the 
third to Kim Young-sook, Kim Young-hwa and Park Jung-chul.  

      Winners of the special prizes for the foreigners who participated in 
the seminar as non-contestants were Aya Katsurayama from Japan and 
Li Jiangping from China.  

      Kim Joo-hoon, one of the two second prize winners, is a junior at 
Yonsei University in Seoul majoring in English language and 
literature. The other winner Jeong Eun-young is a freshman of 
English education at Kyungnam University.  

      The National Practical English Contest is totally different from 
conventional speech contests. At this year's event, each contestant 
was asked to randomly choose a topic regarding the 2002 World Cup or 
an everyday scenario written on a scrap of paper, and then each had 
a spontaneous three-minute conversation with a native speaker based 
on the topic.  

      Fifteen finalists who passed interviews and semifinals held across 
the country competed.  

      The contest was supported by The Korea Herald along with MBC-TV and 
BCM Publishers, Inc. Its sponsors included Daishin Group and WICOM 
Co., Ltd.  

      The first prize winner has been given an opportunity to participate 
in a four-week English language program at the University of 
California, San Diego. The second prize winners will have the chance 
to attend a three-week intensive English- language program at New 
York University, American Language Institute, and at Pacific Gateway 
International College in Vancouver, Canada.

Budget Bill Totals 71.6 Trillion Won; Government Projects 13.7 Percent
Spending Hike Over 1996 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Kwak Young-sup Staff reporter 

      The government yesterday unveiled its 1997 budget plan, which calls 
for total spending of 71.6 trillion won ($89.5 billion), a 13.7 
percent rise from this year's 63 trillion won.  

      The budget proposal is composed of a general-account portion of 
67.78 trillion won, up 12.8 percent from 1996, and a 
3.82-trillion-won special account for fiscal investment and 
financing, a 33.9 percent increase from this year, the Ministry of 
Finance and Economy (MOFE) said yesterday.  

      Approved at a cabinet meeting yesterday, the budget bill will be 
submitted to the National Assembly Oct. 2 for approval.  

      Korean taxpayers face a heavier tax burden next year than this year 
in proportion to the budget increase.  

      The total tax revenues will rise to 21.6 percent of gross national 
product (GNP) next year from this year's 20.9 percent. A Korean 
taxpayer will shoulder an average of 2.06 million won in national 
taxes.  

      The total tax receipts will be composed of 64.23 trillion won in 
national taxes and 3.54 trillion won in nontax revenues.  

      Ministry officials said the 1997 budget bill focuses on expanding 
the nation's infrastructure to help reduce growing logistical costs 
and minimizing a rise in the public sector's fixed expenditures.  

      ``The 1997 budget proposal is characterized by a drastic rise in 
spending on infrastructure projects,'' said Kim Jung-gook, MOFE's 
assistant minister for budget. ``Great emphasis has also been placed 
on improving the productivity of the government sector by cutting 
fixed costs as much as possible.''  

      According to the budget bill, fixed expenditures such as defense 
spending, wages for government workers and grants will rise 11.1 
percent to 37.16 trillion won from this year, while spending on 
government-initiated projects will increase 16.7 percent to 34.44 
trillion won.  

      Defense spending will surge 12 percent to 14.27 trillion won next 
year from this year's 12.73 trillion won, the highest year-on-year 
growth rate since the current ``civilian'' government took office in 
1993.  

      ``We had to take into account the present security situation on the 
Korean Peninsula in raising the defense spending,'' said Kim, the 
chief architect of the 1997 budget proposal.  

      About 47 percent of the defense budget will be used to purchase 
advanced weapons.  

      Spending for the expansion of infrastructure such as ports, highways 
and railroads will jump 24.4 percent to 10.13 trillion won next year 
from this year.  

      The sharp rise in spending on infrastructure projects is designed to 
ease the nation's growing physical distribution costs, which is 
cutting into the overall national competitiveness, Kim said.  

      The government will take the lead in eliminating the nation's 
high-wage structure by restricting growth in the number of 
government workers and their wages.  

      A wage freeze will be imposed on 6,000 senior government officials 
next year, while lower-level employees will be given a 5 percent 
rise in their basic pay only.  

      Spending on education will surge 17.6 percent to 18.63 trillion won 
and 6.67 trillion won will be earmarked for improving the structure 
of the agro-fisheries sector.  

      The 1997 budget will also include a 27.3 percent increase in 
spending for technology and computerization, or 3.22 trillion won; a 
36.3 percent rise in spending on environmental protection, or 2.11 
trillion won; and a 43.4 percent jump in spending for culture and 
sports, or 540.8 billion won.

Current Account Deficit Surges to $15.2 Billion; Chalks up Record High of
$3.4 Billion in August 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The nation's current account deficit surged to a record monthly high 
of $3,487 million in August, bringing the cumulative shortfall in 
the first eight months of the year to $15,243 million, according to 
the Bank of Korea (BOK) yesterday.  

      The aggregate January-August figure already exceeded the 
government-revised latest shortfall prediction of $15 billion for 
the entire year.  

      The central bank predicted Korea's current account deficit for the 
year would reach about $18 billion, accounting for about 3.6 percent 
of the nation's gross national product (GNP).  

      The BOK attributed the galloping current account shortfall mainly to 
a slowdown in exports and a rise in imports and invisible trade 
deficits.  

      ``The January-August current account deficit represents about 3 
percent of the nation's GNP and the expected deficit for September 
would amount to $1.5 billion,'' said Paeng Dong-joon, director of 
the BOK's Statistics Department.  

      The BOK said that trade deficit amounted to $2,848 million in 
August, compared with a trade shortfall of $387 million in August 
last year and $1,662 million in July this year.  

      Exports decreased 8.7 percent from a year ago to $9,553 million on a 
free-on-board basis in August.  

      Cumulative trade deficits during the January-August period amounted 
to $9,715 million, compared with a shortfall of $4,814 million 
during the same 1995 period.  

      ``The slowdown in exports was mainly affected by a continued low 
export price of semiconductor prices,'' Paeng said.  

      He said that the unit export price of Korean-produced 16 mega DRAM 
chips averaged $11.5 in August, a sharp decline from $40 to $45 last 
March. ``But there would be no further drop in the export prices of 
16 mega DRAM chips.''  

      August saw its invisible trade shortfall amount to $592 million, up 
from a deficit of $557 million in July.  

      The central bank cited as major reasons for the hike in invisible 
trade shortfall a surge in overseas travel and shipping expenses.  

      Korea saw a net capital inflow of $1,103 million in August, from a 
net outflow of $140 million in July this year.  

      The nation's foreign exchange holdings decreased from $35 billion at 
the end of July this year to $33.56 billion as of the end of August 
on an outstanding basis.

LG Securities Holds Signing Rite for Korea Bond Fund 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      An international fund investing in Korean bonds has been launched 
for the first time, offering foreign investors an opportunity to 
acquire stakes exclusively in the local bond market.  

      LG Securities Co. held a signing ceremony for its Korea Bond Fund 
(KBF) at the Rainbow Hotel in London Monday. LG is acting as the 
lead manager for the $105 million fund with the participation of 
Nomura International PLC.  

      This is the first time that a country fund designed exclusively for 
foreigners seeking to invest in local bonds has been set up. The 
Korea Fund, the first overseas fund for investment in the Korean 
stock market, was set up 12 years ago.  

      Scudder, Stevens and Clark, Inc., an American investment firm which 
acted as a manager for the Korea Fund, is also acting as a fund 
manager for KBF.  

      Originally planned as a $100 million fund, the KBF had to be 
increased by an additional $5 million due to popular demand by 
foreign investors. The fund is due to be listed on the London Stock 
Exchange in October.  

      The KBF portfolio will be composed of financial and development 
bonds (50 percent or more) and nonguaranteed bonds (20 percent or 
more), both issued by small- and medium-business; nonguaranteed 
bonds with a five-year maturity (10 percent or less) and 
nonguaranteed convertible bonds (10 percent or less), both issued by 
large businesses; and short-term fund management including cash (10 
percent or less).

Globalization Drive Forces Companies to Hire Foreign Staffers 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      Korea's giant industrial conglomerates, while cutting back on 
domestic employment to cope with slow business, are sharply 
increasing the hiring of foreign workers as part of their 
globalization strategies, business sources said.  

      The employment of overseas staffers, previously focused on a few 
industrial countries such as the United States, Japan and Canada, 
are now spreading to newly industrializing nations, including China, 
they said.  

      Major conglomerates _  Samsung, Hyundai, LG and Daewoo _  are hiring 
twice as many foreigners as last year to meet the international 
manpower demand in such areas as automobiles, telecommunications and 
computer software. Among the local staff are Korean students 
studying abroad, ethnic Koreans abroad as well as other foreigners.  

      Hyundai Group, for instance, is set to employ 1,000 foreign workers, 
up 200 from last year and has already hired 100 among the majors of 
electronics, bioengineering and high molecule at a recent employment 
fair in the United States. It plans to hold similar fairs in Japan, 
China and Europe to employ 900 others.  

      Samsung Motors Inc., scheduled to roll out assembled passenger cars 
from 1998, picked up seven veteran technicians who retired from 
Japan's Nissan Motor as managers responsible for model development, 
R&D, design and car test. It lately has hired Dr. Song Ji-oh, a 
Korean with career at the General Motors Corp. as the head of the 
in-house research institute.  

      The company plans to hire 110 foreign staff by running ads at 
foreign news media, holding manpower recruitment sessions in major 
industrial countries and accepting recommendations from foreign 
business associations, the sources said.  

      Daewoo Group, under its managerial watchword of global management, 
has recently opened a``global manager's course'' and hired 200 
international staff members who will operate its 16 overseas 
offshoots in Britain, France, Germany and other countries.  

      LG Group also hired 100 foreigners among majors of 
telecommunications and semiconductor in the United States in July to 
meet the manpower demand in these new businesses.  

      The brisk employment of foreign staff, while providing Korean 
employees with fresh incentives for self-development, has its own 
problems, such as the relatively long period of one-to-two years 
required for the foreigners to adapt themselves to the Korean 
corporate culture, the business sources said.

Business Survey Index Hits 92 in Fourth Quarter '96 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The ongoing business slump is expected to continue to grip the 
nation's manufacturing industry in the fourth quarter of the year, 
the Bank of Korea (BOK) said yesterday.  

      In its survey of 2,480 manufacturing and nonmanufacturing companies 
with an annual turnover of 500 million won in the country on their 
business prospects, the central bank has found that the business 
survey index (BSI) for the fourth quarter stands at 92 on average.  

      A BSI reading of 100 means that respondents who see improvements in 
business conditions equal those who expect declines.  

      The fourth-quarter BSI of 1,429 manufacturing companies stands at 94 
and of 1,051 nonmanufacturing companies it is 88.  

      In the meantime, the BSI for the third quarter was 81 for 
manufacturing companies and 76 for nonmanufacturing companies.  

      The manufacturing companies' BSI of 81 for the July-September period 
was the lowest since the index marked 72 in the first quarter of 
1993.  

      Major reasons behind the gloomy prospects for the October-December 
period are the weak value of the Japanese yen, the slow growth in 
domestic consumption, and the decline in export prices of major 
export items, including semiconductors, steel, and petrochemicals, 
BOK officials said.  

      Reflective of the bleak prospects, domestic manufacturing companies 
are moving to curtail their facility investment volume in the months 
ahead with the facility investment BSI standing at 83 for the third 
quarter and 86 for the fourth quarter.  

      The turnover BSI in the fourth quarter was 103 for manufacturing 
companies, up from 90 in the third quarter, and the comparable BSI 
stood at 92 for nonmanufacturing companies, up from 86, indicating 
that their sales are likely to recover from their slump.

Seoul-Inchon Canal Work to Start Next Year 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      Work to build an intracity canal passing through the western tip of 
Seoul to the western port city of Inchon will be launched in the 
second half of next year, the Ministry of Construction and 
Transportation said yesterday.  

      The two-phase project for the 18-km waterway primarily intended to 
alleviate heavy inland cargo traffic will be completed in 2010, 
according to the ministry's basic plan.  

      Bidding applications will be accepted until next January and the 
successful bidder will be announced next March.  

      Corporations wishing to participate in the project are required to 
form a consortium with the Korea Water Resources Corporation.  

      The canal will be built for feeder container ships with a maximum 
capacity of 2,500 tons. The waterway will measure six meters in 
depth and 100 meters in width.  

      The project is valued at about 1,000 billion won ($1.25 billion). Of 
the amount, the land acquisition cost which is estimated at 260 
billion won ($325 million), will be funded from the state coffer and 
the remaining cost will be provided by private builders.  

      The successful bidder will have the right to operate the canal and 
charge tolls for 40 years.  

      The canal essentially aims at reducing the ground transportation 
linking Seoul to port facilities of Inchon.  

      Sand excavated from the seabed of the West Sea, containers, steel 
and automobiles will constitute the bulk of the traffic on the 
canal.  

      Upon completion, the canal is expected to help to relieve the 
serious traffic congestion of the Seoul-Pusan highway.  

      ``Currently, the transportation of containers to Seoul from Pusan is 
heavily dependent on the Seoul-Pusan Expressway,'' said a ministry 
official. ``When the canal is completed, containers will be carried 
on sea to Inchon and then through the canal, to Seoul.''

Cultural Dimensions (Column By Robert J. Fouser); Experiment in Korea-Japan
Relations 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Robert J. Fouser 

      Many Japanese writers on Asian affairs refer to Korea as the 
``near-but-far country.'' By this, they mean that Korea is 
culturally and geographically near to, but emotionally far from, 
Japan. Despite the Japanese media's emphasis on distance, changes in 
Japan in the 1990s offer the hope of bringing Korea and Japan 
closer.  

      These changes are occurring the following three areas: travel, 
Korean language education, and research on Korea.  

      An increasing number of Koreans now visit Japan for tourism and 
business. About one third of all foreigners entering Japan are 
Korean. The rapid increase in numbers of Korean tourists means 
increased interaction with Koreans in Japanese tourist and business 
centers. The sight of well-dressed Korean tourists enjoying 
themselves in Japan has dispelled the image of Korea as a poor 
country. Growing trade and business contacts bring more Korean 
business people to Japan.  

      In reverse, a large number of Japanese continue to visit Korea; 
about forty percent of all foreigners visiting Korea are Japanese. 
Intimidated by the high cost of travel in Japan, many Japanese, 
particularly those in western Japan, find it cheaper to visit Korea 
than to go to Tokyo. An increasing number of high school students 
visit Korea for school trips to learn about Korean history.  

      Language learning often follows increased travel and cultural 
exchange. Until the Seoul Olympics in 1988, most Korean language 
education took place in schools for Korean residents in Japan. Since 
the Olympics, Korean language education has spread rapidly beyond 
the Korean community.  

      Although few universities offer a major in Korean language and 
literature, many famous universities now teach a variety of Korean 
language courses. A recent survey by Keidanren, the largest business 
association in Japan, showed that people in their twenties and 
thirties ranked Korean as the third most important foreign language 
for Japanese people to learn. English ranked first, followed by 
Chinese. People in their forties and fifties placed sixth out of the 
eight choices given.  

      Korean language education has also entered the commercial language 
teaching market. A growing number of language institutes offer 
Korean conversation courses. The educational service of NHK TV 
offers a regular course in Korean. A Korean language proficiency 
test is offered twice a year, attracting an rapidly growing number 
of testees.  

      A recent poll by the Japanese Agency for Culture showed that 76 
percent of those polled believe that Japanese people should make a 
greater effort to learn Asian languages (no languages were specified 
in the poll). All of these developments point to continued growth of 
Korean language education in Japan.  

      Related to the boom in Korean language education, is the continued 
growth of research on things Korean in Japan. Armed with ample 
research materials and excellent language skills, Japanese scholars 
of Korean studies produce more research on Korea than in any other 
country outside Korea. Many Koreanologists in Japan have received 
graduated education in Korea and have close contacts with Korean 
researchers.  

      In recent years, Korean studies in Japan has done much to shake off 
the residue of its colonial past. In history, for example, many 
younger scholars have condemned the distortions of Korean history in 
Japanese history textbooks. Internationalization of universities in 
Japan has helped to give institutional support for Korean studies 
and academic exchanges with Korea.  

      None of these developments guarantees that Korean-Japanese relations 
will become chummy over night. Different interpretations of history 
continue to make emotional reconciliation difficult. Korean 
residents in Japan continue to face discrimination in critical 
areas, such as housing and employment. Politicians in both countries 
use mutual feelings of antipathy to whip up nationalist feeling for 
their own political purposes.  

      At the level of human exchange, however, the growing presence of 
Koreans and the Korean language in Japan brings about a sea change 
in Japanese attitudes toward Korea: Korea is now worth taking 
seriously. As a competitor or partner, Japan can no longer afford to 
pretend that Korea is far away.  

      The change in Japanese attitudes is not an accident of history. 
Throughout Japanese history, sudden threats from the outside have 
forced Japan to recognizes changes in the world order. The military 
alliance between the Silla and Tang China against Paekche stimulated 
the growth of strong centralized rule in Japan in the seventh 
century. Commodore Perry's black ships in 1853 led to the Meiji 
Restoration in 1868, which opened Japan to the West.  

      On a smaller scale, the decision to co-host the World Cup in 2002 is 
a similar shock to the collective Japanese psyche. The World Cup is 
also a useful metaphor for recent changes in Japanese attitudes 
toward Korea because the bitter competition to host the event ended 
with both countries being forced to cooperate as partners. With the 
aura of World Cup legitimacy, changes in Japanese attitudes toward 
Korea will accelerate as 2002 approaches.  

      Competition and partnership between Korea and Japan is, like the 
co-hosting of the World Cup, an experiment in relations between the 
two countries: never before have these two countries worked together 
as equal partners. From early sixth century, when the Korean scholar 
Wani gave the Japanese emperor Buddhist sutras and Confucian 
classics, to the controversies over textbooks and the comfort women, 
dominance, whether cultural, political, or military, was the 
prevailing paradigm in Korean-Japanese relations.  

      Soon, the average Japanese person will probably point to Russia when 
asked to find the ``near-but-far country'' on a map. And who knows, 
maybe other geographical controversies will become a thing of the 
past.

MOTIE Plan to Issue Green Cards to Hi-Tech Experts Hits Snag 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The attempt of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy to issue 
special identification cards for high-tech foreign manpower has hit 
a snag, officials said yesterday.  

      It has been pushing for the introduction of the so-called ``green 
card'' system for foreigners with Ph. D degrees or who are 
technological experts with M.A. or M.S. degrees as part of its plan 
to lure more foreign industrial and scientific experts.  

      Under the system, the government will treat the foreign experts like 
overseas Chinese in Korea, by issuing them permanent resident 
permits and allowing them to purchase land up to 660 sq. meters. 
They will also enjoy medical insurance benefits and be able to make 
savings deposits at domestic banks.  

      The ministry had tried to include the related clause in the revised 
External Trade Act but reportedly abandoned the attempt, faced with 
opposition from other ministries, the officials said.  

      Instead of introducing a special ID card system, it decided to 
dispense with the inconveniences foreigners suffer by revising the 
relevant decrees and regulations, they said.  

      The abortive bid is expected to make it more difficult for  the 
nation's major conglomerates to recruit foreign talent, while their 
demand for overseas experts is ever increasing, the officials said.

Business News Briefs; KT Develops CD-ROM Telephone Directory 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The Korea Phone Directory Co. (KPDC), a unit of Korea Telecom, has 
introduced a CD-ROM (compact disc-read only memory) phone directory. 
 

      The CD-ROM phone directory, the first of its kind here, contains all 
of the 4.3 million phone subscribers in Seoul on two diskettes.  

      Equipped with a multimedia service function, the electronic 
directory is capable of classifying all of the paper directory's 
listings into 3,300 kinds of different business or brand groups.  

      KPDC has manufactured 30,000 units of the CD-ROM directories and 
plans to distribute them free of charge.

Dead Leader Infiltrated South Three Times 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      It was the third time for the dead leader of the estimated 26-member 
North Korean infiltrators to have intruded the South since last 
year, a captured North Korean agent has been quoted as saying.  

      Lee Kwang-soo, who was captured unhurt Wednesday evening near 
Kangnung on the East Coast, has told investigators that Col. Kim 
Dong-won had infiltrated into the South aboard a submarine on three 
occasions since last year, a reliable intelligence source said 
yesterday.  

      Col. Kim was the head of a North Korean spy department in charge of 
transporting secret agents, said the source, quoting Lee. He was one 
of the 11 North Korean infiltrators who were found dead on a 
mountain near Kangnung after they deserted their wrecked submarine.  

      It demonstrated that North Koreans have several times sent 
submarines to the South on various missions, said the source who 
demanded anonymity. Lee was brought to Seoul Saturday evening for 
further interrogation.

Business News Briefs; Korean-Made Car Sales in Sweden Rise in '95 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      A total of 2,365 Korean-made cars were sold in Sweden last year, up 
96.4 percent from 1,204 cars in 1994, according to the Korea 
Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) yesterday.  

      The Korean cars accounted for 1.3 percent of 169,756 cars sold in 
the Swedish auto market last year.  

      KOTRA's Stockholm Trade Center, quoting statistics released by the 
Association of Swedish Automobile Manufacturers and Wholesalers, 
reported that the 2,365 cars break down to 2,289 from Hyundai and 76 
cars from Ssangyong Motor Cos.  

      During the January-August period of this year, 2,196 Korean 
automobiles were sold, up 65 percent from the same period of last 
year.  

      The report said sales of Korean cars have continued to grow sharply 
especially after Hyundai's subcompacts ``Accent'' and ``Elantra'' 
have received good response from young Swedish customers.  

      The strong Swedish krona has weakened the competitiveness of Swedish 
cars such as ``Volvo'' and ``Saab,'' while increasing the sales of 
foreign cars, it said.

Foreign Business Briefs; Adidas AG Chairman in Seoul for 2-day Stay 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      Robert Louis Dreyfus, chairman of Adidas AG, a globally recognized 
sportswear brand, arrived in Seoul yesterday for a two-day visit.  

      During his stay in Korea, he looked into plans for a joint venture 
with a local partner, Jewoo Trading Co., according to a Jewoo 
spokesman. The company, temporarily named ``Adidas Korea,'' will be 
in charge of manufacturing, as well as importing Adidas sports 
goods, including shoes, bags, clothes and accessories.  

      The Jewoo spokesman said the joint venture is a natural result of 
the growing demand in the Asia-Pacific region, and that the venture

Card May Carry 7 Phone, Contact Numbers; Hyosung Group to Launch One-Number
Service in December 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Yoo Cheong-mo Staff reporter 

      How many telephone numbers are printed on your customer's business 
card?  

      The card may carry up to seven different phone and contact numbers _ 
office phone, car or cellular phone, home phone, pager, fax and 
Internet address.  

      Such a labyrinthine card may cause a lot of confusion, in case you 
would want to contact someone immediately.  

      With the imminent launch of the so-called ``one-number service,'' 
however, your troublesome guesswork of whether to call someone's 
office phone, pager, computer, fax or car phone will soon become a 
thing of the past.  

      The Hyosung Group, ranked 28th in the corporate hierarchy, is now 
pushing to launch the nation's first commercial one-number service 
in Seoul in December. To that end, Hyosung has already created ties 
with AccessLine Technology Inc. (ATI) of the United States, and NTT 
and Marubeni, both of Japan, to establish a 3-billion-won 
joint-venture company, named ``Hyosung One Number Co.'' Hyosung, 
ATI, NTT and Marubeni raised the initial capital at a ratio of 61 
percent, 19 percent, 10 percent and 10 percent.  

      O Hyo-won, who took office as representative director of Hyosung One 
Number Co. early this month, said, ``The individual one number will 
soon emerge as a new symbol of VIP status here.''  

      ``An important business call, if missed because of your absence at a 
certain place, would create billions of won in losses to your 
business. The one number service will prevent such a mishap one 
hundred percent,'' O said.  

      One-number service is a wholly new concept of intelligent 
communications, which is intended to make it easier for people on 
the move to stay in constant touch with their important business and 
personal contacts. One-number subscribers are given a single 
personal number which will integrate all different numbers of their 
communication devices, including office phones, home phones, 
cellular phones, pagers, faxes or car phones. Then, they can always 
be tracked and contacted through one of the six communicators, 
wherever they are staying within the country.  

      Personal numbers are different from regular phone numbers in that 
they're tied to a person, not a place.  

      ``In the near future, nearly a quarter of cellular users will 
subscribe to the one number service,'' O quoted a U.S. market 
research firm as forecasting. ``High-ranking government officials, 
business executives, lawyers, self-employed men, public accountants, 
entertainers and others who are constantly on the move but need to 
be contacted, are among the potential customers of the service,'' he 
said.  

      Despite such enormous convenience and market opportunities of the 
one-number service, the majority of local telecom experts are 
painting a gloomy picture of its future.  

      The number of pagers now in use in Korea has recently exceeded the 
11 million mark. With the paging service already covering the entire 
country, the one-number service will not appear attractive to many 
people.  

      In addition, a new cellular-phone model with built-in paging 
functions will soon come on the market, further narrowing the room 
for Hyosung's successful entry into the one-number market.  

      ``Hyosung has cleared the regulatory hurdle of the Ministry of 
Information and Communication (MIC), which regards the one-number 
service as a value-added service. But it may be too early for the 
one-number service to settle in the Korean market, due to a host of 
unpredictable factors,'' said an industry analyst.  

      ``Considering the unique characteristics of the one-number service, 
active cooperation from existing telecom service carriers, such as 
Korea Telecom (KT), Korea Mobile Telecom (KMT) and paging service 
operators, will be indispensable for the success of the service,'' 
he said. He predicted that it would be very difficult to expect that 
Hyosung can gain proper support and network accesses from KT, KMT 
and paging companies, which are themselves preparing to enter the 
same market.  

      The service's excessively high charges will also pose a big obstacle 
to the immediate popularization of the service, he noted. Hyosung 
forecasts that its one-number subscribers may have to pay more than 
20,000 won in monthly service charges, in addition to an initial 
membership fee of 30,000 won. At present, monthly service rates for 
paging and voice mail services do not exceed 8,000 won and 3,000 
won, respectively.  

      Hyosung's O countered the mounting pessimistic views by 
saying,``We're well aware that potential profitability of the 
one-number service is not as high as it could be. But Hyosung sees 
the one-number industry as a kind of niche market, which may be able 
to secure substantial subscription bases particularly from corporate 
customers.''  

      Commercial one-number services, launched by carriers in the United 
States, Japan and Europe last year and this year, are also suffering 
from a shortage of subscribers.  

      AT & T, which kicked off a $45-a-month one-number service early last 
year, has managed to secure just 280,000 customers so far. The 
number of subscribers to NTT's one-number service, launched in May, 
now totals just 5,000. NTT's subscription target for this year does 
not exceed 10,000. Partly because of the highly uncertain prospects 
for the one-number service, KT, KMT, paging carriers and other 
domestic companies are reportedly taking a very careful approach to 
the market. Hyosung One Number Co. aims to secure about 20,000 
subscribers by the end of next year

Emperor hopes for better year following '95 disasters+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Emperor Akihito said Monday he hopes the new year will be more
fortunate than 1995, which was overshadowed in Japan by January's
Great Hanshin Earthquake and March's nerve gas attack on Tokyo
subways.
     In his New Year message, the 62-year-old emperor said, ''It is
my ardent wish that the new year will be a happy one for the Japanese
people as well as for all the people of the world.''
     He also said the year 1995 was ''deeply meaningful'' in that it
marked the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, which
deepened awareness about the nation's past and renewed the desire for
peace.
     Expressing his concern for the tens of thousands of people in
western Japan whose lives have been affected by the massive
earthquake last January, the emperor said, ''I sincerely hope that
the devastated area will be restored without delay and that the
people may know some ease and comfort in their lives.''
     Almost 6,300 people were killed when the quake hit the port city
of Kobe and its vicinity in the small hours of Jan. 17 last year, and
some 800 have since died as a result of the temblor.
     Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko as well as Crown Prince
Naruhito and his wife Princess Masako, visited the devastated areas
in a bid to help boost the victims' morale.
     The imperial couple is considering attending a memorial service
for those who died in the disaster, to be held in Kobe on the first
anniversary of the quake.
     The emperor had to undergo surgery to remove a polyp from his
large intestine last June, but he and the empress were both spared
from other health troubles in 1995.
     No trips abroad are scheduled for 1996 but as last year, the
couple will visit a number of places across Japan.
     The crown prince and princess will celebrate their third wedding
anniversary in June.  The empress dowager, who is said to be healthy
despite an occasional cold, will celebrate her 92nd birthday this
year, making her the longest living empress dowager in Japanese
history.
     Princess Nori, the emperor's only daughter and the youngest of
his three children, who began taking a more prominent public role
last year by making her first official trip abroad to Brazil, will
turn 27 in April, an event that is certain to fuel speculation about
whether she is planning to marry.

Emperor Akihito's New Year message+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     The following is the full text of Emperor Akihito's New Year
message which was released Monday.
     Soon a year will have elapsed since we were struck by the most
terrible disaster since the war, the great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake
that brought deep sorrow to so many people.  During this past year the
victims who had to suffer the death of relatives and friends or bear
the pain of losing their homes, have striven hard to cope.
     Now that the weather is getting colder and colder, I am worried
about the health of those victims who are still living under severe
conditions, especially the elderly.
     I sincerely hope that the devastated area will be restored
without delay and that the people may know some ease and comfort in
their lives.
     Since last year marked the 50th anniversary of the end of the
war, various memorial events and ceremonies were held.  For all of
us, I think it was a deeply meaningful year, being an occasion to
mourn the war dead, to deepen our understanding of past history and
to renew our desire for peace.
     In early summer we had a prolonged wet period, which was
worrying since it brought back to mind the cold summer of three years
ago.  But luckily the weather changed for the better and I am happy
that in most regions the harvest was good.
     It is my ardent wish that the new year will be a happy one for
the Japanese people as well as for all the people of the world.

Great Hanshin Earthquake, and Okinawa and Hiroshima after 50 years
of the end of World War II.
     (Great Hanshin Earthquake)

Kobe and Hiroshima.

Murayama vows to do utmost for economic recovery in '96+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama pledged Monday to do his
utmost in 1996 for the recovery of the Japanese economy by promoting
deregulation and helping develop new businesses to create new jobs.
     ''By promoting structural reform, deregulation and
liberalization, the outlook for the economy will be bright this
year,'' Murayama said in his New Year's Day press conference.
     A recovery is already on the horizon, he said, promising to
continue implementing pump-priming measures.
     Murayama recalled various unhappy incidents in 1995 such as the
Jan. 17 Great Hanshin Earthquake that killed more than 6,300 people,
the March 20 poison gas attack on the Tokyo subway which killed 11
people, and the Dec. 8 accident at the fast-breeder reactor Monju.
     He also listed among such incidents the Sept. 4 rape of an
Okinawa schoolgirl for which three U.S. servicemen are on trial, and
reiterated he would ''firmly maintain'' the Japan-U.S. security
treaty despite the case but promised efforts to respond to Okinawa
people's wishes to cut the number of U.S. bases there.
     ''I hope to candidly discuss the issue, too, when U.S. President
Bill Clinton comes to Japan in April,'' he said.
     He said, ''The security setup is the basis of Japan-U.S.
relations.''
     Murayama also vowed to implement all possible measures to
collect the bad loans of seven moribund housing loan companies.  His
government is under fire for its plan to use 685 billion yen in
taxpayers' money to help liquidate the companies.
     He said he understood taxpayers' anger at the liquidation scheme
but said the government had to draft the plan before the situation
grew worse.
     The three ruling parties -- Murayama's Social Democratic Party
(SDP), the Liberal Democratic Party and New Party Sakigake -- should
strengthen the foundation of their coalition government, he said.
     The fiscal 1996 budget should pass the Diet as soon as possible
to help economic recovery, he said.  The 150-day regular Diet session
is expected to convene Jan. 22.
     Murayama also said his SDP will reform itself in line with the
changes of the times and gather pacifist and democratic political
forces to form a new party that can play a role in government.
     Murayama hosted a New Year's party at his official residence
Monday for his cabinet members and coalition leaders, including trade
minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who heads the dominant coalition force
Liberal Democratic Party, and Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura,
leader of the third and smallest coalition partner New Party Sakigake.
     ''Last year was the milestone 50th anniversary of the end of the
war and we saw various incidents happen as if all bad things had come
out at once,'' Murayama told the gathering.
     ''We would like to clear them up and put them behind us, and
make 1996 a challenging year to make a fresh start so we can open a
new horizon toward the 21st century,'' he said.
     Murayama took office in June 1994 as Japan's first socialist
premier in nearly half a century.

Japan-U.S. JV to build LRW disposal facility for Russia+

MOSCOW, Dec. 31 Kyodo

     A Japanese-U.S. joint venture has won a 25 million dollar order
for building a liquid radioactive waste (LRW) facility in Russia's
Far East, Itar-Tass news agency reported Sunday.
     The joint venture between Tomen Corp., a major Japanese trading
house, and Babcock and Wilcox Co., a U.S. power generation system
maker, will begin to implement the project soon, the news agency said.
     A formal contract is to be signed Friday.
     The joint venture will dispose of the Pacific Fleet's LRW and
the required funds will be fully assigned from Japan's 100 million
dollar aid package to help countries of the Commonwealth of
Independent States dismantle nuclear weapons.
     The facility is expected to be constructed at Vladivostok
shipyards and will be capable of processing 7,000 cubic meters of LRW
a year, Itar-Tass said.
     The bulk of work to build the facility is expected to be
completed by the time the leaders of the Group of Seven
industrialized nations and Russia meet in Moscow in April to discuss
nuclear security issues, it said.
     The Japanese government decided to assist Russia in building a
new LRW disposal facility immediately after the Pacific Fleet
discharged LRW, due to the dismantling of nuclear-powered submarines,
in October 1993.
     The realization of the project was stalled, however, due to
technical problems and difficulties in the selection of contract
companies.

Toyota, Nissan in talks for tie-up in forklifts: daily+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Japan's ''Big Two'' automakers, Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan
Motor Co., are in negotiations to enter into a tie-up in the area of
forklifts in North America, an industrial daily reported Monday.
     The Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun quoted sources familiar with the talks
as saying the two auto giants plan to supply each other with key
components of forklifts to be turned out in the United States.
     Specifically, Nissan's forklift manufacturing unit in Illinois
will provide gasoline engines for forklifts to Toyota's forklift
manufacturing subsidiary in Indiana, while Aisin Seiki Co. of the
Toyota group will supply power shift transmissions to the Nissan
subsidiary.
     The Toyota and Nissan subsidiaries in the U.S. are to begin
production of forklifts in July and the summer, respectively.

More than 1,100 set to run in next general election+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     More than 1,100 people have already decided to run in the next
general election, the first poll for the House of Representatives
since a new system combining single-seat constituencies with
proportional representation was put into effect a year ago,
according to a Kyodo News survey.
     The final number of candidates could balloon to more than 2,000
from the 1,128 who say they have already made up their minds.
     Some 1,020 are now planning to run in the 300 single-seat
constituencies in the election, which is widely expected to be held
by the end of the year.
     The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the dominant group in the
ruling coalition, has already settled on 270 candidates for the
single-seat constituencies, while the main opposition Shinshinto (New
Frontier Party) has selected 230.
     The two parties are likely to clash head on in at least 190
constituencies.
     Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and New Party
Sakigake, the LDP's partners in the tripartite coalition, are lagging
far behind the LDP and Shinshinto in their election preparations.
     For the 200-seat proportional representation race, only about
100 are already set to declare their candidacy.  Among them are 26
from the LDP and 42 from Shinshinto.
     The focus of the election will be whether the LDP or Shinshinto
will secure a majority.
     The outcome will likely determine the political landscape in
Japan for the next several years, deciding whether a bipolar picture
will emerge or the era of coalition will continue.
     The SDP, which is being wracked by disputes over its plan to
launch a new party, has secured only about 80 candidates for the
single-seat constituencies.
     Sakigake is also tardy in working out a candidate lineup, with
only 45 prospects secured so far for the single-seat portion.
     Displaying its usual swiftness in election preparations, the
Japanese Communist Party has decided on candidates for all the
constituencies and 35 for the proportional representation.

Births down, deaths, divorces up in '95+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Births in Japan continued their 20-year downward trend in 1995,
while the number of deaths, inflated by January's huge earthquake,
topped 900,000 for the first time since 1950, the Health and Welfare
Ministry announced Sunday.
     Ministry estimates, based on population statistics reported
through October, showed that 1,193,000 babies were born in Japan in
1995, down about 45,000 from the previous year and resuming a slide
that began in 1973 and was only briefly interrupted last year.
     It was the second time, following 1993, that the number of
births in Japan dipped below 120,000 in one year.  The birthrate of
9.6 per 1,000 people also equals that for 1993 as the lowest recorded
ever.
     Some 40,000 more deaths were recorded in 1995 than the previous
year as the killer quake that leveled much of Kobe and the
surrounding area Jan. 17 and claimed thousands lives and an influenza
epidemic added to the 916,000 total for the year.
     A total of 784,000 marriages were recorded in 1995, an increase
of 1,000 over 1994.  But divorces increased by 5,000 in 1995 as
200,000 couples formally ended their marriages.
     The largest killer of the year was cancer, which claimed 263,000
lives in 1995, followed by cerebrovascular diseases at 148,000 and
heart diseases at 139,000, the ministry reported.

NEC to build its 2nd microchip plant in U.S., paper says+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     NEC Corp. will start construction of its second U.S.
semiconductor plant in California as early as spring at a cost of 80
billion to 100 billion yen in a move aimed at taking the lead in the
global market for 256-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
chips, a business daily reported Monday.
     The Japanese electronics titan intends to begin operations of
the state-of-the-art plant by the end of 1998, the Nihon Kogyo
Shimbun said.
     The plant will be built at a 200,000-square-meter site adjacent
to the existing factory of NEC Electronics Inc., which is now
producing 4- and 16-megabit DRAMs, the paper said.  NEC has already
acquired the land plot for 400 million yen.
     The new factory will first mass-produce 64-megabit DRAMs and
plans to start churning out 256-megabit chips as early as 1998.  The
256-megabit chip is expected to become the mainstay semiconductor by
the end of this century.

More men find joy of cooking: good side of dull economy?+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Maybe it is part of the recent trend in Japan to shift to a
plainer lifestyle in the prolonged recession, or it could be a sign
that more men recognize the need to be self-supporting later in life
as people live longer than before and as more women go out to work,
leaving their husbands at home.
     Or perhaps it is because there are more men living alone through
''tanshin funin'' -- transfer to another town while their families
stay behind for reasons such as children's school needs -- resulting
in the fathers having to take care of themselves.
     Whatever the cause, an increasing number of Japanese men are
discovering the joy of cooking.
     Although there are no official statistics, the trend can be seen
in the recent boom in cooking magazines that are targeted at men.
     Ryori-Tengoku magazine, started in February 1994 by a Tokyo
publisher, Ryori Tsushinsha Inc., has become one of the best-selling
magazines of its kind within two years.
     With articles about restaurants, well-known professional cooks
and their work as well as some of their recipes, the magazine now
sells more than 100,000 copies a month.
     Launched in December 1990 by another Tokyo publisher, President
Inc., the Danchu magazine promotes the concept of cooking as a man's
hobby and sells 240,000 copies.
     In an area where monthly sales of 50,000 copies are said to be
the threshold of success, the two magazines can be seen as clear hits.
     The common features of the two magazines are that both primarily
target men in their 30s or 40s, and the cover designs and layout of
pages are different from women's magazines about cookery.
     At book stores, both are likely to be found in the hobby-leisure
corner, not among books and magazines on housekeeping.
     Other evidence of the boom in men's cooking is seen in
television programs.  Among them, Fuji Television Network Inc.'s live
weekly show ''The Iron Men of Cooking'' scores a consistent 15-20%
audience rating by showing professional chefs competing with
each other to make several dishes within a given time.
     ''The gimmick of the program is to show the backstage process of
cooking, the sweat of the cooks and the drama of cooking,'' says
Toshihiko Matsuo, the producer of the program.  The three-year-old
program has now made stars of some of those chefs.
     In Japan, as has probably been common around the world, cooking
has traditionally been considered a women's activity.  Delving back
into history, such an attitude may stem from the conservative ideas
of Confucianism.
     The ancient Chinese philosophy was brought into Japan in the
fourth century and was favored by Japanese rulers throughout the
medieval period up to modern times, until at least the end of World
War II.
     One of the books on which Confucianism is based contains the
phrase ''Men should not enter the kitchen.''  Though many Japanese
today may have never read the book, they probably know the phrase.
     The saying reflects the Confucian emphasis on the importance
of maintaining clearly defined social roles and hierarchies, which
discouraged men from doing ''women's work'' and made those who wanted
to cook rather embarrassed.
     But in recent decades, attitudes have gradually changed.
Schools have begun letting boys take classes in basic living skills
together with girls.
     Moves toward women's liberation in the 1960s and 1970s also
contributed to the change.  Now, in the 1990s, with the rapid aging
of Japanese society, increasing calls are heard for men to become
more self-supporting.
     These trends of the times, along with the men's cooking
magazines and the TV programs, have encouraged men who love cooking
to come out of the closet.
     Danchu magazine organizes a ''Men's Original Cooking Contest''
every month, and once a year selects a grand winner who is awarded a
prize of 500,000 yen and a round-trip ticket for two overseas.
     The contest draws some 3,000 contestants a year, according to
the magazine, suggesting that men are no longer embarrassed to show
their cooking skills.
     ''I was surprised that one of my colleagues congratulated me
after I won Danchu's December contest,'' said Ryozo Nakamura, a
53-year-old mathematics teacher, ''because I did not expect that
readers of the magazine existed so close-by in my life.''
     For Nakamura, cooking was a daily necessity from his childhood
because his mother had poor health.  ''For a long time, it was
embarrassing to go to the supermarket because there were so few men
buying groceries,'' Nakamura says.
     But he continued cooking and actually found himself enjoying it
especially after he also became fond of fishing, he says.  His
winning recipe was a fish dish featuring snapper with burdock.
     Nakamura says the Danchu contest was not the only one he
entered, though it was the first in which he won a major prize.
     A recent article in a Japanese daily newspaper reported a rapid
increase in the number of men entering numerous cooking contests
around Japan.
     Some analysts say the boom is an effect of the ''bubble
economy'' of the 1980s.  Aside from the much-discussed negative
aspects of that period in Japan, it gave people opportunities to
taste materialistic luxuries such as buying high-quality brand goods,
taking overseas trips and eating out at gourmet restaurants.
     Of all these new pleasures, the habit of eating well is
something that people find difficult to abandon, the analysts say,
and so they became more interested in cooking at home.
     But some say men's enjoyment of cooking goes further back.
''The boom in cooking among men is not new at all,'' says Shigemasa
Kuroki, manager of a men's cooking group which was set up 18 years
ago and now has some 800 members across the nation.
     The group holds a monthly cooking session with 40 to 50 members
at a time, at which a professional cook teaches them on a completely
voluntary basis.  Because the group has existed for a long time,
teaching its members has become a prestige activity among some
professionals, Kuroki says.
     A 77-year-old member of the group said cooking is a tool that
helps him communicate with his grandchildren.  And perhaps it is also
spreading new ideas across the generations -- after all, the group's
name can be translated as ''Men in the Kitchen.''

Governor advocates admitting foreigners to public service+

KOCHI, Japan, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     The governor of Kochi Prefecture on Japan's smallest main
island of Shikoku on Monday reiterated his intention to scrap this
year a regulation that makes Japanese nationality a prerequisite for
entry into prefectural public service.
     In his New Year's message, Gov. Daijiro Hashimoto said he has
gained the impression that allowing foreign nationals to sit for
entry exams for regular administrative posts ''does not have any
negative influence.''
     A number of local municipalities have hired foreigners in their
administrations, but so far the doors to the prefectural and national
public service have remained closed to non-Japanese.
     It remains to be seen how the governor will realize his plans
given that the Home Affairs Ministry remains skeptical, arguing that
the controversial nationality clause is based on the government's
interpretation of the Cabinet Law ''which is binding.''
     Exactly a year ago, Hashimoto, a reporter-turned politician and
half-brother of trade minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, first said he
wanted the clause scrapped so that foreigners may take entry exams
for nonmanagerial public-service posts.
     After encountering considerable resistance from within the
prefectural government, Hashimoto decided to postpone the move for a
year.
     The governor insists that local administrations must be seen as
a service industry and that anyone regardless of nationality can meet
the requirements of such duties ''if only the person is passionate
about his work.''
     Foreigners account for about 1% of Japan's 125 million
population.  Most of them are ethnic Koreans and Chinese who are
permanent residents, and many have been born in Japan.

Housing loan fiasco spells trouble for Murayama+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama faces a tough time over the
controversial government scheme to use 685 billion yen of taxpayers'
money to liquidate seven crippled housing loan companies.
     The 150-day regular Diet session is expected to convene Jan. 22,
primarily to discuss the government's 75.1 trillion yen budget
proposal for fiscal 1996 beginning April 1, under which the
liquidation scheme will be funded.
     Diet discussions on the housing loan companies' liquidation is
likely to be hot as the main opposition party Shinshinto (New
Frontier Party), backed up by taxpayers' frustration, will give
Murayama's tripartite coalition government a hard time on the issue.
     The government handout represents a burden of 5,500 yen for
every Japanese.
     Shinshinto says the use of tax money should not be allowed
without disclosure of information concerning the problem and pursuing
the responsibility of the government, the housing loan companies, the
banks which founded the crippled companies, and agricultural
financial institutions.
     Newly elected Shinshinto President Ichiro Ozawa pledges to
demand that Murayama dissolve the House of Representatives for a snap
general election immediately after the budget clears the Diet,
probably in late March or early April.
     The Japanese Communist Party also opposes the use of public
money and accuses the government of being responsible.
     Murayama, announcing the liquidation plan at a midnight press
conference Dec. 20, asked the public to support it.
     The prime minister said he has made a ''painful decision''
because the problem needs a swift solution in order to restore
domestic and overseas confidence in the Japanese financial system and
to invigorate the stagnant Japanese economy.
     Murayama pledged the government would do all it could to collect
money owed to the housing loan companies, vowing to thoroughly pursue
the responsibility of both their creditors and debtors.
     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura acknowledged his ministry's
responsibility in the problem of the housing loan companies, although
he did not state how the responsibility will be pursued.
     Shinshinto is expected to demand in the parliamentary debate
that Takemura resign.
     The opposition camp blames Murayama, who is chairman of the
Social Democratic Party (SDP), Takemura, head of the smallest
coalition force New Party Sakigake, and Ryutaro Hashimoto, trade
minister and president of the dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
     The mortgage companies extended massive amounts in loans to real
estate companies partly because housing loan lenders were exempted
from the March 1990 government restriction on loans to realtors.
     At that time Hashimoto was finance minister, and he has admitted
limited responsibility of ''politics'' as a result.
     The LDP hopes Hashimoto will succeed Murayama as prime minister,
but the criticism of him has begun to affect the prospect.
     Veteran LDP politician Seiroku Kajiyama said the next general
election should take place sometime later now because of the setback.
     Even some in the ruling camp advocate pursuing the
responsibility of the administrative staff at the finance and farm
ministries as well as the financial institutions and the debtor
realtors involved in the fiasco.
     LDP Secretary General Koichi Kato said, ''The public will not
consent until those concerned go behind bars.''
     The Diet is also expected to discuss the role of organized crime
in the scandal.  Some of the unrecoverable loans were to companies
connected with mobsters.
     Takemura promised to use ''every available means,'' in
cooperation with police and prosecutors, to recover as much as
possible of the loans in question.
     Ministers concerned, including Takemura, Justice Minister
Hiroshi Miyazawa and Home Affairs Minister Takashi Fukaya in his
capacity as National Public Safety Commission chairman, set up a
forum to discuss ways to collect the debts.
     The government vows to implement criminal investigations and seek
prosecution, if necessary, in the process of trying to collect the
loans.
     The coalition government promises to disclose information
related to the problem so that the public will understand why their
money is needed in the liquidation scheme.
     The public has been given only limited information on the
scandal.  No details have been released about the bad loans held by
the housing loan companies, such as names of debtors, or the role of
the companies' founding banks in the extension of the loans.

Mitsubishi to unveil low-priced teleconferencing system+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Mitsubishi Electric Corp. will introduce in the domestic market
as early as this month a new low-priced teleconferencing system that
is capable of transmitting motion pictures with telephone lines, an
industrial daily reported Monday.
     Using the broadband-integrated services digital network (B-ISDN)
of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., the system sends such
pictures by compressing them to 7 to 10 megabits per second, based on
the Motion Picture Experts Group-2, or MPEG-2, international standard
for data compression, the Nihon Kogyo Shimbun said.
     Currently, standard teleconferencing systems transmit analog
data at a speed of 150 megabits per second.
     The new system converts and compresses analog information into
7 to 19 megabits of digital signals using an encoder, and transmits
the data into monitors through a decoder which again converts the
digital data into analog signals.
     Mitsubishi plans to set the price for the new system at about 20
million yen, much lower than those of conventional systems, the daily
said.

Gov't panel to review fast-breeder reactor project+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     A government advisory panel plans to review Japan's
fast-breeder nuclear power reactor development program following a
coolant leak at a prototype reactor last month, the Asahi Shimbun
newspaper reported Monday.
     The daily said the Atomic Energy Commission, an advisory panel
to the prime minister, will open debate over the issue at a
commission meeting set for Jan. 9.
     It is unprecedented for the commission to review Japan's
national nuclear energy policy, the Asahi said.
     A fast-breeder reactor produces more nuclear fuel than it
consumes, and the technology is the centerpiece of Japan's energy
policy for the 21st century.
     Under the national nuclear energy program, the government aims
to build a demonstration fast-breeder reactor early in the next
century and put fast-breeder reactors into commercial use by around
2030.
     The prototype Monju reactor in the western Japan city of Tsuruga
has been closed down since the Dec. 8 accident in which highly
corrosive sodium leaked from a secondary cooling system.

U.S. proposes joint R and D for military gear parts+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     The U.S. Defense Department has proposed to its Japanese
counterpart that the two conduct joint research and development of
parts for military equipment in common use in the two countries, a
national daily reported Monday.
     The move seeks to expand the scope of joint development of
defense equipment following the production of a new generation of jet
fighters starting in fiscal 1996, the Yomiuri Shimbun said.
     But two pacifist partners in the tripartite ruling coalition,
including Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's Social Democratic Party,
may take issue with the move on grounds it could run counter to the
government's policy of banning arms exports, the paper said.
     The Defense Agency is considering limiting the proposed project
to research, stopping short of development, in order to alleviate
such concern, it said.
     The Pentagon proposal, apparently aimed at trimming U.S.
military spending, was advanced during a regular meeting of defense
officials from the two countries on military equipment and
technology, held in Tokyo between late October and early November,
the Yomiuri said..
     Military equipment parts targeted by the project appear to
include electronic components for fighters, antisubmarine planes and
other state-of-the-art hardware, it added.

20 U.S. firms to form joint research-sales base in Japan+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     About 20 big U.S. businesses will jointly establish a research
and sales base in Japan as early as 1997 in an effort to develop
products tailored for Japanese needs, a business daily reported
Monday.
     Of the U.S. companies, seven companies have already decided to
participate in the project.  They include Lockheed Martin Corp., a
major aircraft manufacturer, Timken Co., a bearing maker, and
Caterpillar Inc., a tractor maker, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
     The Japanese government, responding favorably to the move, plans
to extend all-out support for the project through low-interest
funding and tax breaks as it is likely to help reduce Japan's large
trade surplus with the United States, the daily said.
     The project will be formally adopted early this year, the paper
said, adding that among candidate sites for the research-sales base
are Yokohama and Kobe.

Big supermarkets open on New Year's Day+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Daiei Inc., Ito-Yokado Co. and other major supermarkets Monday
opened their stores across the nation on New Year's Day when such
stores have customarily been closed.
     Until last year, supermarket operators had opened their stores
on the second day of the new year while discount and other mass-sales
stores had opened their shops on the first day of the year.
     Supermarkets' moves are targeted primarily at children who
received ''otoshidama'' or New Year's gifts of cash from their
parents and relatives, industry analysts said.
     Daiei, the industry leader, opened 339 of its stores throughout
the country, which account for more than 90% of the total.
     At Tokyo's Himonya store, about 200 people, mostly children and
their parents, queued to buy goods before the opening at 10 a.m.
     Bought actively were personal computers, video game machines and
software, and fresh foods such as vegetables and sushi, store
officials said.
     A housewife, who dropped in at the store after paying her first
visit of the year to a shrine, said, ''It's really convenient because
we no longer need to stock up on food for the New Year's holidays.''

Canon to boost annual stepper output 60%, daily says+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Major precision instrument maker Canon Inc. is to increase its
annual production capacity of steppers for use in manufacturing
semiconductors for fiscal 1996 by 60% from the current fiscal year
to 800 units, a business daily said Monday.
     The Nihon Keizai Shimbun said the Tokyo-based company will soon
begin construction of a new factory in Utsunomiya, Tochigi
Prefecture, north of Tokyo, to start operations around this summer.
     Construction costs are estimated at 5 billion to 6 billion yen,
the paper said.
     With the new plant, Canon intends to catch up with Nikon Corp.,
the stepper industry leader that holds 50% of the world's stepper
market compared with about 40% for Canon.
     Nikon also plans to raise its annual stepper output capacity by
65% during fiscal 1996 which starts in April.
     The production increases by Nikon and Canon are in response to
strong demand from semiconductor manufacturers.

values, two Japanese dailies reported Monday.
     The Tokyo Shimbun and the Sankei Shimbun said in front-page
stories that Jyuso Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary had more than
130 billion yen in outstanding loans to the corporate group at the
end of March 1987 when the loans peaked.
     The figure represented 17% of total outstanding loans provided
by Jyuso and its subsidiary, the Sankei said, identifying the real
estate company as Taiyo Estate.
     It could constitute breach of trust for a lender to purchase
real estate provided as collateral for above-market value while
knowing such a deal would result in losses, legal experts said.
     The Sankei said the Taiyo group is run by a relative of a
lawmaker belonging to the Liberal Democratic Party, the biggest group
in the tripartite ruling coalition.
     The Tokyo Shimbun said Jyuso took real estate used as collateral
for the loans to the corporate group between 1990 and 1991 for two to
four times more than the market value, bringing the sum of
outstanding loans to the group to some 42.4 billion yen at the end of
March 1995.
     The market value of the real estate provided as collateral has
fallen sharply since the bursting of the so-called bubble economy, a
stock and real estate boom seen in the late 1980s.
     Jyuso and six other housing loan companies or ''jusen'' have
been tottering under the weight of some 8.1 trillion yen in combined
bad loans as a result of their excessive real estate loans during the
bubble economy.
     The government has decided to set aside some 685 billion yen
under the fiscal 1996 budget for the liquidation of the seven failed
mortgage companies.
     The Asahi Shimbun said Monday law enforcement authorities and
financial regulators will scrutinize financial reports to be
submitted by the seven mortgage companies to decide whether to file
criminal charges against those allegedly involved in the bad loan
problem at the companies starting in early January.
     The national daily said the criminal charges are expected to
include breach of trust, embezzlement and fraud.

Farm banks lent 5.1 tril. yen to 68 nonbanks, paper says+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Agriculture-related financial institutions which had extended
loans to seven bankrupt housing lenders also supplied 5.1 trillion
yen in loans to 68 other nonbank institutions, a national daily
reported Monday.
     The Yomiuri Shimbun said a list of the nonbanks' creditors which
it had obtained shows that the farm banks had lent more than 2
trillion yen to 27 nonbanks that are now receiving emergency funds
from their founder banks.
     The paper quoted analysts as saying the institutions had lent
money for real estate transactions during the ''bubble economy'' of
the late 1980s and that many of the loans would soon be regarded as
unrecoverable.
     The information is likely to intensify pressure for clarifying
the role that top executives of farm banks played in huge bad loans
at housing loan compnaies, widely known as ''jusen'' in Japan,
according to the newspaper.
     The list shows that among the 68 nonbanks are leasing and
consumer credit companies.
     The daily said the large creditors include the Shizuoka
prefectural association of agricultural credit cooperatives, which
loaned 55.1 billion yen, and the Hyogo prefectural association of
agricultural credit cooperatives, which extended 51.5 billion yen in
loans.
     The National Mutual Insurance Federation of Agricultural
Cooperatives (Zenkyoren) and the prefectural associations of mutual
insurance agricultural cooperatives across the nation extended a
total of 720.3 billion yen, while Norinchikin Bank extended 551.9
billion yen, the paper said.
     On the borrower side, Japan Leasing Corp. received the largest
amount of loans, totaling 456.2 billion yen, it said.

Daiwa Bank eyes plea-bargaining with U.S. authorities+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Scandal-tainted Daiwa Bank plans to enter into plea-bargaining
as early as next month with U.S. federal law-enforcement authorities
over 24 counts of criminal fraud filed against it, a national daily
reported Monday.
     The fraud charges, filed by federal prosecutors in November,
including allegations of tampering with bank records and misleading
regulators, could subject the Osaka-based commercial bank to as much
as 1.3 billion dollars in fines.
     The Asahi Shimbun, quoting a Daiwa Bank official, said in a
front-page story that Daiwa hopes to bring the case to a settlement
through the plea-bargaining by the end of March when it closes its
books for fiscal 1995.
     Meanwhile, an official of Sumitomo Bank, another major
commercial bank that is taking over U.S. operations of Daiwa,
reportedly said Sumitomo plans to begin talks with Daiwa on their
possible merger in specific terms as early as April after the
conclusion of such bargaining.
     In November, the U.S. Federal Reserve expelled Daiwa Bank from
the United States for allegedly trying to disguise 1.1 billion
dollars in losses due to fraudulent U.S. Treasury bond trading by
Toshihide Iguchi, a trader at its New York branch, over an 11-year
period from 1984.
     In its documents to be submitted to U.S. regulators Jan. 8,
Daiwa Bank is expected to plead not guilty to the fraud charges but
is unlikely to be found not guilty, the daily said.

Kim urges efforts to make S. Korea 1st-class country+

SEOUL, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     President Kim Young Sam called on the nation Monday to work to
make South Korea a first-class country, pledging he would be at the
forefront of such efforts.
     ''I will spare no effort in accomplishing this sacred task with
a sense of solemn responsibility for the people and history,'' Kim
said in his New Year message to his fellow citizens.
     He said the Korean people should unite to achieve a bright
future for the nation and to make the new year a new starting point.
     He also urged South Koreans to support his campaign to prosecute
the crimes of the nation's previous military-ruled governments.
     ''Setting straight the historical record in order to rectify
past wrongs will be a starting point in which we should take pride
and a signal marking the birth of a new society,'' Kim said.
     He was referring to the recent indictment of former Presidents
Roh Tae Woo and Chun Doo Hwan on charges of corruption and
instigating a 1979 military coup that eventually carried them to
power.
     Kim also ordered in late November special legislation allowing
the prosecution of those involved in the military crackdown of the
1980 civilian uprising in the southern city of Kwangju that claimed
at least 192 lives.
     Kim was elected in December 1992 as the first president with no
military background in more than 30 years.
     The South Korean leader also said he hopes the new year will be
one of hope and joy for North Korean people who are suffering many
difficulties.

ISLAMABAD, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Goods worth several million dollars are estimated to have been
gutted in a fire at a Karachi Port warehouse Sunday in the worst
blaze at the port in 10 years, port officials said.
     The fire, which raged for five hours, was brought under control
by nearly 25 fire engines from Karachi Port Trust, the Pakistani navy
and other organizations.
     Karachi Port Trust Chairman Akbar Khan told reporters that an
inquiry committee is to probe the cause of the fire.
     The warehouses at the port had received consignment of 3,000
tons of cargo that included newsprint, soda ash and assorted

Sri Lankan president promises 'new beginning' for Jaffna+

COLOMBO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     President Chandrika Kumaratunga in a New Year's message has
promised the people of northern Jaffna that the government will set
up a civil administration in the former rebel stronghold as soon as
possible so they can return to their homes and accustomed lifestyles.
     There is no need for the government to continue maintaining a
military administration in Jaffna, said the president, adding her
government will lay the foundation for a new era with the arrival of
Thai Pongal on Jan. 15, the beginning of the Hindu month of Thai.
     An estimated 200,000 civilians are alleged to have been coerced
by the Tamil Tiger guerrillas to leave Jaffna as government troops
involved in operation ''Riviresa,'' launched Oct. 17 to capture
Jaffna, began advancing toward the city in the north.
     The displaced are now housed in makeshift accommodation in
Vanni, south of the Jaffna Peninsula, where the Tigers have relocated
themselves.
     ''If the military victory achieved should become a victory of
the people, it should be transformed into a victory of peace,
strengthening the sociopolitical field in its entirety,'' said the
president.
     Meanwhile, seven security personnel were killed in two separate
incidents in the island's north and north-central provinces in the
24-hour period ending noon Monday, military officials said.
     Five soldiers were killed and five others injured when the
tractor they were traveling in was blown up by a guerrilla pressure
mine in Kopay north in the northern Jaffna Peninsula Sunday evening,
the Defense Ministry reported.
     The Tamil Tiger rebels are said to have laid several mines
before fleeing the area in the face of advancing government troops.
     In a second incident, Tigers attacked a police post at
Puliyankulam in the north-central province, killing two policemen and
injuring two others, the ministry said.
     Dislodged from their northern Jaffna base Dec. 2, the Tigers
have turned to other vulnerable targets.

Trial of alleged coup plotter begins in Pakistan+

ISLAMABAD, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     The military trial of four senior army officers arrested in
September last year for allegedly plotting an Islamic coup started
Sunday at Attock Fort in northern Punjab Province, informed sources
said.
     The accused, including two-star Gen. Zaheer Ulislam Abbasi and
Brig. Mustansar Billa, have refused to accept the charge sheet but
are being defended by a retired justice, family members of one of the
defendants said.
     The five-man military court headed by Maj. Gen. Zahid Ehsan has
the power to sentence the accused to death.
     Military intelligence had arrested 40 army officers in
Rawalpindi last September for allegedly plotting the elimination of
military and political leaders, and to then declare an Islamic state
in Pakistan.
     While some of the detainees have been released, others have
turned witness and only four of the main suspects accused have been
formally charged by military authorities.
     The Public Relations Department of the Pakistani army has not
given out any details about the start of the trial for the arrested
army officers.
     Several politicians and retired military officers have demanded
an open trial for the accused but that has been rejected by the
government.

     Pakistan has expressed concern over reported plans by the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to try to destabilize Iran through
covert operations.
     Foreign Minister Asif Ahmad Ali told the Senate on Sunday that
''continuous acrimonious exchanges between the United States and Iran
-- an important power in the region -- are not conducive for peace in
the region.''
     He offered mediation by Pakistan between the two countries for
resolution of their differences through peaceful means and said
Pakistan has already been in touch with Iran about the matter.
     The U.S. government is reported to have allocated 20 million
dollars in CIA funds for ''destabilization of the Muslim government

6 die, more than 700 injured in New Year's revelry+

MANILA, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     At least six people were killed and more than 700 others
injured, mostly from powerful firecrackers or gunshots, during New
Year's revelry in the Philippines, health officials said Monday.
     Police said two of the killings took place in the southern
cities of Iligan and Ozamis.
     Reports reaching the Health Department said at least 700 people
were rushed to 52 hospitals nationwide for treatment from burns and
gunshot wounds.
     Health Secretary Hilarion Ramiro told a news conference that a
total of 478 people were injured by explosives and 34 were hit by
stray bullets despite a government ban on the use of powerful
firecrackers and guns to greet the new year.
     He said at least 74 revelers sustained stab wounds and 115
others were injured in road accidents.
     At least 29 others were reported injured in some southern
provinces, including a 6-month-old baby girl who was accidentally hit
by a firecracker thrown by her elder brother, police said.
     Fires, sparked by exploding firecrackers, razed markets, houses
and offices in the capital and provinces, reports said.
     Ramiro noted a 50% decrease in the number of fireworks-related
accidents this year.  Last year, he said more than a dozen people
died and at least 4,500 people were injured in welcoming the new
year.
     Filipinos usually light powerful firecrackers and pyrotechnics
at the start of the new year to scare away evil spirits and invite
good luck.

Pessimism growing in Pakistan, says Gallup+

ISLAMABAD, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Despair is on the rise in Pakistan, although it still lies at
the halfway point on a listing of countries optimistic or
pessimistic about the future, a Gallup survey shows.
     Five years ago, the pessimists were negligible with less than
10% of those Pakistanis polled expressing pessimism and the
optimists standing at 70%.
     But the latest survey by Gallup Pakistan has found the number
of pessimists has increased to 26% against the 46% who believe the
new year will be better than the one just ended.
     The report said 39% of the people interviewed believe
that Pakistan will witness more violence and troubles in 1996.
     ''It seems that Pakistanis are turning inward.  They are
somewhat hopeful about their immediate environment but suffer from
despair about the national economy,'' the survey said.
     The survey was based on a sample of 1,000 households belonging
to a cross section of income, education and linguistic backgrounds.
It was conducted as part of an international survey by Gallup
International to list ''optimistic'' and ''pessimistic'' countries of
the world.
     Pakistan was 20th among 21 countries found to be optimistic
while Japan was found to be among the major pessimistic nations.
     A pessimistic country was defined as one where less than 40% of
the people believe 1996 will be better than 1995.  Only 21% of those
polled in Japan believed the new year will be better than 1995,
according to the survey.
     In fact Japanese people are found to be the world's fourth most
pessimistic people after Hungary where only 7% of the people were
optimistic, Austria at 14% and the Netherlands at 15%.

Taiwan premier proposes special zone links with mainland+

HONG KONG, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Taiwan's Premier Lien Chan has proposed legislating a special
zone in Taiwan to promote economic exchanges with China's
counterparts, two of the island's newspapers said Monday.
     Lien told the China Times and the United Daily News in a New
Year interview that such a zone would allow greater liberalization of
movement of capital, personnel and goods with the mainland.
     As part of its policy of unification, China has been urging
Taiwan to open direct transport, commercial and communications links.
     Because of the issue of sovereignty, Taiwan has not responded to
these overtures, but Lien told the papers that if both sides can
agree to the special zone idea, it could open the way to more than
the type of links China is proposing.

Kim Jong Il again fails to give New Year's message+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     North Korea's de facto leader Kim Jong Il failed to deliver a
New Year's message Monday for the second year in a row.
     His father Kim Il Sung, who died in July 1994, used to give an
annual New Year's announcement on the first day of a year.
     In place of such a message, wide coverage was given to a New
Year's Day editorial stressing North Korea's achievements amid
adversity and calling for unity in 1996.
     Calling for uniting ''closely around the Workers Party of Korea
Central Committee headed by comrade Kim Jong Il,'' the editorial,
which was broadcast throughout the nation, was entitled ''Let us
advance vigorously in the new year, flying the red flag,'' according
to a report of the Korean Central News Agency monitored in Tokyo.
     ''Last year the internal and external situation of our
revolution was very rigorous.  The imperialists and reactionaries
persistently tried to isolate our republic...,'' said the joint
editorial by the ruling party's Rodong Sinmun daily, the army
newspaper Joson Inmingun and the Rodong Chongyon paper for youth.
     ''All the victory and achievements gained in the revolution and
construction last year are very valuable and proud because they were
won in face of the acute political and military confrontation with
the enemy, persistent economic blockade and unprecedented natural
disaster,'' said the editorial.
     North Korea, which was already suffering a food shortage, was
hit by massive floods in July and August last year.
     A U.N. report said North Korea's worst flooding in 100 years
left some 500,000 people homeless and destroyed nearly half the
country's farmland, or 1.2 million hectares.
     ''The great victory and achievements were possible only under
the tested leadership of comrade Kim Jong Il.
     ''We must defend respected comrade Kim Jong Il...at the risk of
our lives...He is the publicly recognized leader of our party and
people...is also our eternal supreme commander,'' the editorial said.
     Kim Jong Il has yet to officially take over two of his father's
top titles, president of North Korea and general secretary of the
Workers Party of Korea.
     The editorial said the party's stand of reunifying the Korean
Peninsula ''in a peaceful way'' remains unchanged, reiterating that
reunification ''is possible only by the confederation formula''
comprising the communist North and the capitalist South.
     However, it accused South Korea and its main backer, the United
States, of having ''brought the situation to a hopeless phase.''
     ''No matter how the world situation may change, our party will
steadfastly maintain the banner of socialism, the banner of
independence against imperialism,'' it added.
     Radio Pyongyang reported at 8 a.m. that there would be an
important broadcast on TV and radio starting at 9 a.m.  The broadcast
carried the joint editorial.
     Meanwhile, the name of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping
was missing from among the list of Chinese leaders with whom Kim Jong
Il exchanged congratulatory New Year's messages, the monitoring
agency Radiopress said Monday.
     Radio Pyongyang listed in a broadcast the same day names of
foreign government and party leaders with whom Kim had exchanged New
Year's greetings, with the names of Chinese leaders introduced first.
     President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and National People's
Congress Chairman Qiao Shi were among them but Deng's name was not
mentioned.
     Last year Radio Pyongyang gave Deng's name top billing,
Radiopress said.

Pakistan's ban on reconditioned cars to stay+

ISLAMABAD, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Commerce Minister Ahmad Mukhtar said Monday he would oppose any
relaxation in the ban on the import of reconditioned cars, due to
expire next month.
     Mukhtar told the Senate that the ban on the import of
reconditioned and secondhand cars was essential for development of
the national industry and not advisable for the sake of the
environment.
     The ban on reconditioned and old car imports imposed in February
1993 was to last until Feb. 8, 1996, but the minister said he would
oppose lifting the ban whenever the matter comes up for consideration
before the cabinet.
     Only Pakistani expatriates returning from abroad to reestablish
permanent residence in Pakistan are now allowed to bring back used
and reconditioned cars, which were previously being imported by
hundreds of car dealers.
     Pakistan has joint ventures for the assembly and progressive
manufacture of cars with Suzuki Motor Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and
Honda Motor Co., all of Japan, and Kia Motors Co. of South Korea, as
well as a growing vendor industry supplying parts to the auto
manufacturers.

     Police said four of the victims were riddled with bullets and
their bodies dumped on the roadside after being stuffed into gunny
sacks.
     At least 1,800 people were killed in ethnic violence and police
operations in Karachi during 1995, making it one of the worst years
for violence in the city's history.

Atlanta Olympics marks new era of globalism, big bucks+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     The Atlanta Centennial Games this summer will probably serve as
less of a nostalgic return to the past and more a symbol of how much
has changed in the Olympic movement.
     When the inaugural Games opened 100 years ago in the Greek
capital of Athens, 360 athletes from 13 countries competed in the
male-only event.
     Come this July, as many as 15,000 athletes and officials,
including an anticipated record high 3,700-plus women, are expected
to converge on the southeast U.S. city.
     Furthermore, as the Olympic family has grown into 197 national
Olympic committees (NOCs), 196 of them have accepted invitations to
Atlanta.
     If North Korea also participates, it will be the first time for
an Olympics to feature every NOC.
     Whatever North Korea's position, Atlanta will easily surpass the
previous record set at the Barcelona Games in 1992, with 169 nations
and territories participating.
     The Olympic Charter notwithstanding, politics has certainly
played a big role in the vagaries of the Olympic movement.
     Three Olympic Games -- 1916 scheduled for Berlin, 1940 scheduled
for Tokyo and 1994 scheduled for London -- were canceled because of
the two world wars.
     The Cold War too cast dark clouds over the Olympic movement as
both the 1980 Games, which took place in Moscow, and the 1984
Olympics in Los Angeles were targets of boycotts and counterboycotts.
     The Soviet Union's breakup in 1991 also jacked up the number of
NOCs.  Come this July, Russia and the other new republics, which
entered under one flag at Barcelona, will compete as separate nations
for the first time at Atlanta.
     The Olympic Games have also undergone radical changes under
International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Juan Antonio
Samaranch, who has led the Olympic movement since 1980.
     Instead of celebrating amateurism in sports, the Olympic Games
have inched toward professionalism in recent years under Samaranch's
vow to make Olympics a showcase of the world's best athletes in all
sports.
     In addition to the U.S. basketball ''Dream Team'' of National
Basketball Association (NBA) stars, which grabbed the gold medal at
Barcelona, top world professionals in athletics, cycling, volleyball
and other sports will fight for the limelight in Atlanta.
     The changes do not end there.
     While former IOC head Avery Brundage once boasted during his
20-year reign that the Olympics could survive without television, the
cash-rich electronic media has turned the Games into a multibillion
dollar marketing affair.
     In December, the U.S. television network NBC announced a record
2.3 billion dollar deal to gain the U.S. broadcasting rights for
three Olympics through the year 2008, well before the actual venues
have been decided.
     Dick Pound, the IOC executive in charge of new financial
sources, says the NBC contract will provide long-term financial
stability to the Olympic movement, which once was on the brink of
bankruptcy almost two decades ago.
     The fact that the Centennial Games will be held not in the
Olympic birthplace of Athens but in the United States -- the well
spring of the largest chunk of Olympic sponsorship money -- is
perhaps indicative of the trends to come.
     Of the 10 current member corporations of TOP (the Olympic
Program) -- the IOC's worldwide sponsorship progam -- nine of them,
including Coca-Coca, Xerox and Sports Illustrated, are based in the
U.S.
     The only exception is Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., which
is based in Japan.
     Atlanta Games organizers are also depending on a huge amount of
corporate support, with nearly 30% of its 1.61 billion dollars
in projected revenues expected to come from sponsorship deals.
     Despite rumors that Atlanta is having trouble gathering
corporate funding, A.D. Frazier, chief operating officer of the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG), said they do not
expect a significant shortfall.
     ''Ticket sales are exceeding our expectations, so as a whole we
have been successful,'' Frazier said in an interview with Kyodo News.
     Frazier, however, conceded that lack of public funding has posed
a burden, saying, ''We aren't using tax money so we have to be even
more prudent with our budget.''
     One example is AGOC's decision earlier this year to abandon
plans to build an amphitheater, which would hold concerts featuring
stars like James Brown and Gloria Estefan.
     According to Frazier, the biggest challenge facing the Atlanta
organizers now is managing a personnel structure that will balloon
from 3,000 workers to 70,000, ranging from volunteer shuttle bus
drivers to marathon competition officials.
     ''What concerns us most is how to organize the staff, train
them, and where to place them,'' he said.

Foreign sportsmen indispensable -- up to a point+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Foreign athletes are an indispensable part of professional
sports in contemporary Japan, but their presence is sometimes
regarded as a double-edged sword.
     The presence of foreign players is felt most acutely in Japanese
soccer, where the quality of the J.League would drop markedly without
the skills of the foreigners.
     Ever since the league started in 1993, foreign players, led by
Zico of the Kashima Antlers, have captured the imagination of
Japanese fans as the sport knows no national boundaries.
     In a match at the National Stadium in October between a Japanese
selection and foreigners playing in the league, the fans cheered the
foreign players as much as they did the Japanese.
     But the league has set a limit for foreign players -- five per
team and only three on the pitch at any one time lest the league be
monopolized by them, soccer officials said.
     In baseball too, foreign pitchers have particularly shone in the
recent season with Kip Gross of the Nippon Ham Fighters notching 16
wins to capture the Pacific League's most wins title -- the first
time for a foreigner.
     Eric Hillman of the Chiba Lotte Marines posted 12 wins to
contribute to the team's fine showing, while Robinson Checo of the
Hiroshima Toyo Carp was regarded as a new pitching sensation.
     Except for the Orix BlueWave, all 12 Japanese teams had foreign
pitchers on their rosters when the season started in April since the
quota of foreign players to be registered was expanded by one to
three in 1994, provided that the third is a pitcher.
     Through the introduction of foreign players, each baseball team
or soccer club is hoping to boost its overall ability and improve the
quality of Japanese players.
     But J.League officials have no intention of increasing the
number of foreigners allowed to play in Japan, while Central League
President Hiromori Kawashima still espouses the idea that ''Japanese
baseball should be controlled by Japanese players.''
     In team sports, the bottom line for Japanese fans is to see
their favorite club win, and as long as it does it is not so
important to them who hits the home runs or scores the goals,
according to sports sources.
     But in individual sports the situation of foreign athletes is a
little different.
     In sumo, although there is no set quota, some Japan Sumo
Association officials were once alarmed by the ''encroachment'' of
foreign wrestlers headed by yokozuna Akebono and ozeki Musashimaru.
     Although the officials' apprehensions have so far proved to be
needless owing to the dominance of yokozuna Takanohana, the officials
want to see each stable exercise ''restraint'' and not seek to raise
too many foreign wrestlers.
     To suit the taste of the tradition-bound association, top
foreign wrestlers have no choice but to observe the famous adage ''If
you can't beat them, join them'' -- and Akebono and Musashimaru, both
Americans, have applied for Japanese citizenship, following in the
footsteps of Konishiki.
     In pro boxing, three of the nation's five world champions are
foreigners, and their Japanese managers are having a hard time
promoting their fights in Japan.
     None of the title fights of World Boxing Association lightweight
champion Orzubek Nazarov of Kyrgyzstan was televised live in Japan as
potential Japanese sponsors showed little interest in his fights for
two reasons -- he is not Japanese and is too strong.
     Nazarov's stablemate and World Boxing Council flyweight kingpin
Yuri Arbachakov of Russia is luckier since either Tokyo Broadcasting
System (TBS) or Television Tokyo has televised all of his seven title
defenses so far.
     If Arbachakov, who at first glance looks Japanese, were in fact
Japanese, his would be a household name.  Casual boxing fans appear
uninterested in these foreign-born champions no matter how strong
they may be, boxing sources said.
     Both Nazarov and Arbachakov once adopted Japanese fighting names
after well-known Japanese boxers to make it easier for their managers
to sell tickets.
     But to the average Japanese, foreigners are foreigners under any
name, and the two boxers eventually reverted to their real names.

Nagoya beats Hiroshima 3-0 to win soccer Emperor's Cup+

TOKYO, Jan. 1 Kyodo

     Takafumi Ogura scored twice and Takashi Hirano added a third as
Nagoya Grampus Eight blanked Sanfrecce Hiroshima to win the 75th
Emperor's Cup on New Year's Day on Monday.
     Nagoya dominated the entire match in a final between the two
J.League clubs to capture its first all-Japan championship contested
by all soccer clubs in Japan, 2,800 in all.
     ''The team played very well in the past year.  It is just an
award for them,'' said Nagoya's French manager Arsene Wenger after
the match at Tokyo's National Stadium.
     Nagoya, which finished as runner-up in the J.League second stage
last season, opened the scoring in the 18th minute as Hirano set up a
beautiful short pass which Ogura volleyed home from just outside the
penalty box.
     The rampaging Grampus Eight pumped in two fast goals early in
the second half to seal the victory, with both goals set up by
Yugoslav striker Drajan Stojkovic, last season's J.League Player of
the Year.
     The second Nagoya goal came in the 52th minute when Ogura, the
22-year-old Japan international, picked up a loose ball Hiroshima
goalkeeper Kazuya Maekawa deflected from a Stojkovic attempt and
slotted it home from close range.
     Before the Sanfreece team can recover from the shell shock,
Nagoya turned the score 3-0 one minute later as Hirano fired home a
cross-field pass from Stojkovic.
     Lines-up:
     Nagoya -- Yuji Ito, Seiichi Ogawa, Go Oiwa, Kazuhisa Iijima,
Torres, Tetsuya Okayama (Yasuyuki Moriyama, 85th minute), Franck
Durix, Tetsuya Asano, Takashi Hirano (Naoki Mori, 89th minute),
Drajan Stojkovic, Takafumi Ogura (Tetsuo Nakanishi, 73th minute).
     Hiroshima -- Kazuya Maekawa, Hiroshige Yanagimoto, Mitsuaki
Kojima, Kenichi Uemura, Ryuji Michiki, Hajime Moriyasu, Pieter
Huistra (Tsutomu Ogi, 61st minute), Masato Fue (Yoshiro Moriyama,
61st minute), Hiroyoshi Kuwabara, Noh Jung Youn, Takuya Takagi.
     Attendance: 47,021.

 BRAZIL: RATES OF EXCHANGE AND RECOVERY

 Rudiger Dornbusch's claim that the Brazilian real is heavily overvalued has 
once again raised the question of whether Brazil and indeed the whole of the 
region is running a sustainable mix of economic policies. Dornbusch, a 
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, claims that Brazil 
is in the same position Mexico was in 1994 and that the real is between 30% 
and 40% overvalued.

 We do not believe him, as we explain overleaf in our commentary on Brazil. 
We argue that unlike Mexico, the real's exchange rate against the dollar is 
not a proxy for an overvalued or undervalued exchange rate. 

 Brazil does much less trade (about 20% of its total) with the US than most 
Latin American countries. Mexico by contrast does more:  almost 70% of its 
trade is with the US. We argue that this difference means that whether 
Brazil's currency is overvalued should be assessed on a trade weighted 
basis.

 We would argue that Brazil's ability to maintain export growth suggests 
that its currency is not too overvalued. The Brazilian government's 
ruthlessness in slapping on tariffs when domestic industries are threatened 
makes it difficult to gauge whether the currency is overvalued, judging by 
whether imports are rising or falling. 

 What does seem clear to us is that Brazil is more likely to follow 
Argentina than Mexico in its method for adjusting domestic prices. Mexico 
devalued, and thus made domestic prices internationally competitive. 
Argentina is sticking to the more difficult, but probably ultimately more 
rewarding, policy of using a fixed exchange rate to force the domestic 
economy to become competitive. 

 Like Mexico, the result of this has been a painful recession, huge numbers 
of unemployed and more recently a pretty feeble economic recovery. The 
economic recovery, like Mexico's, is being led by investment and exports, 
rather than by growth in domestic spending.  

 Argentina's problem is its tax structure. This is tilted heavily towards 
consumption taxes which are not very productive in periods of recession. The 
government has to push on with its tax reform plans, and actually get some 
of them through congress if it is to avoid disaster. 

 What Argentina's policymakers are doing is using the recession to force 
domestic prices to adjust to international prices in real terms. Under the 
convertibility scheme goods and services in Argentina appeared to be 
expensive and imports started to flood the market. Although imports fell as 
Argentina's economy slowed down and then went into recession last year, 
exports actually continued to rise. Although Argentina's export performance 
is distorted by its heavy exports of wheat and other grains, it does seem 
that manufactured goods have managed to find export markets, particularly in 
Brazil. This suggest that the economy is adjusting successfully.

 Of course the same could be said of Mexico. If anything, its increase in 
manufactured exports has been more impressive: 30% last year and on top of 
that 25% this year. The problem though is that the performance of Mexican 
manufactures is distorted firstly by the effects of the maquiladoras, which 
are simply cheap labour operations, and secondly by the dominance of the US 
market in its foreign trade.

 This means that it is far from clear that the whole of the economy is 
benefitting from the devaluation. Even the government is now concerned by 
the fact that exports are so concentrated. It should be even more concerned 
by the sharp increase in luxury car imports which we report on in our 
analysis of Mexico. This suggests that the centrifugal forces in the economy 
are getting stronger.

 BRAZIL: REALISTIC FORECASTS: AS TRADE ACCOUNT TURNS AROUND

 Pedro Malan, the finance minister, gave a realistic assessment of where the 
Brazilian economy stood to two senate commissions, finance and tax, last 
month. He has downgraded the official forecast of growth for this year from 
5% to between 3% and 3.5%. He said that over the first two quarters of the 
year the economy had actually contracted, though there was now evidence that 
this recessionary phase had ended and the economy would grow strongly in the 
second half of the year. 

 The Instituto de Pesquisa y Economia Aplicada (Ipea), which is attached to 
the planning ministry, said the GDP growth rate for the 12 months to June 
1996 was 1.2%. It pointed out that this was an improvement on the minus 2.1% 
figure to the end of March.

 Other Ipea indicators are also beginning to flash green for growth. Its 
survey of industrial production found that there was a 3.9% increase in 
April compared to March. This franked the findings by the Federacao das 
Industrias de Sao Paulo (Fiesp) which reckoned that industrial output had 
surged by 4.7% between March and April. 

 Fiscal deficit. Malan was equally optimistic about the prospects for the 
fiscal deficit. He told the senate committees that the operating deficit 
would come down from 5% of GDP (last year) to 2.5% this year, and the 
nominal deficit would be about 5% of GDP, compared to 7.3% last year. He 
added that progress on the fiscal deficit depended on the government getting 
its constitutional reforms through congress. In particular, it wants to 
reform the social security system and the bureaucracy, the two main 
consumers of tax revenues.

 The treasury reckons that it ran a 671m reais surplus in May after 
collecting taxes worth 7bn reais. The surplus was largely because it did not 
have to make any extraordinary payments. The accumulated deficit for the 
first five months of the year is around 3.8bn reais, the treasury reckons. 

 The deficit is likely to increase sharply in June as the 13th month bonus 
falls due and 500m reais of holiday payments to bureaucrats fall due. 
Foreign debt payments are also likely to increase from May's 1.26bn reais.

 Trade. The really encouraging statistic comes from the trade account. 
According to Malan, export revenues are up by 10% in the first five months 
of the year (despite the collapse of coffee revenues), while the import bill 
is down by between 8% and 9%. Export revenues in May were US Dollars 4.5bn, 
and imports were worth about US Dollars 4.1bn. 

 The government is calculating on the trade account being more or less in 
balance by the end of the year. Some trade officials though believe this 
could be an underestimate and that the country is on course to  register its 
traditional trade surplus.

 The authorities are certainly doing their best to boost exports. On 19 
June, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced that the government was 
restoring an export credit scheme which had been suspended as part of its 
cost cutting programme. The Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ^mico now 
has US Dollars 1bn to finance particular categories of exports. It is 
offering credit at the rate of 5.5% over Libor for 15 months. 

 Antonio Kandir, the planning minister, said that rate was around a third of 
what the commercial banks were charging. The credit is aimed at 10 
industries: shoes, clothes, carparts, furniture, ceramics. whitegoods, 
electrical products, ironmongery, plastics and ornamental stone. 

 The credit is designed to help industries such as clothes and shoes which 
have been badly hit by the trade liberalisation policies while boosting the 
prospects of industries such as whitegoods and ceramics in which Brazil 
reckons it has a competitive advantage. The government is particularly keen 
on boosting ornamental stone exports: exports of marble and granite trebled 
last year to US Dollars 35m.

 Industrialists were pleased by the credit line. Luis Fernando Furlan, 
director of foreign trade at the Federacao das Industrias de Sao Paulo, 
reckoned that the effects of the credit line would be as beneficial to 
exports as a devaluation. 

 Besides putting the credit line in place, the government is also musing 
over creating an export credit guarantee agency, which would be capitalised 
largely with money from the private sector. This agency would try to compete 
with the Eximbanks, Cofaces and Hermeses of the developed world, which offer 
long term specialised finance to exporters. Brazilian industrialists reckon 
that this financing often offsets higher production costs in OECD countries 
and keeps exports from these countries competitive.

 Brazilian industrialists and trade officials moan that the system does not 
give exporters as much help: in fact they often face export taxes. Malan 
said that the government was trying to reform this, but its tax reform 
package was being stalled by congress. 

 Dagoberto Godoy, president of the Federacao das Industrias de Rio Grande do 
Sul, said that one possible answer would be to copy what Argentina had done: 
it had ended taxes on exports. 

 Current account. Malan's testimony to the senate committee was optimistic 
about the country's overall balance of payments. He reckoned that the 
country would run a current account deficit of around 2.5% of GDP, largely 
because of interest payments. He said the country should have little trouble 
financing this deficit because inflows of long term capital were so strong.

 In the first five months of the year longterm investments amounted to US 
Dollars 3.2bn, he said. The government was forecasting US Dollars 7bn by the 
end of the year. The country also had US Dollars 60bn in foreign exchange 
reserves at the end of May. 

 Dornbusch. The reserve figure and the strong inflows of foreign capital do 
not support Rudiger Dornbusch's claim that Brazil is about to face its own 
version of the 1994 Mexican devaluation crisis. Dornbusch claimed that the 
real is between 30% and 40% overvalued. He asserted that bringing the 
currency back towards its proper value would cause an economic dislocation 
on a par with what has happened in Mexico.

 We disagree with both Dornbusch's premise and his conclusion. To take the 
conclusion first. We believe that the quality of economic management in 
Brazil is far superior to that in Mexico. 

 There are two reasons for this. The first is that Brazil produces superior 
statistics and economic research: this breeds a lot more objective criticism 
of economic policy. 

 The second reason is related to this. The Brazilian government tends to be 
more responsive to alternative ideas and follows policies that are broadly 
related to what is happening in the Brazilian economy. Mexico is still far 
too interested in doing what pleases its international creditors. That 
attitude, above all else, was the reason for the Mexican crisis. Gimmicks 
such as Tesobonos which guaranteed investors against a devaluation boxed the 
Mexican government in and prevented it from devaluing until the economy was 
past the point of caring. 

 We do not accept Dornbusch's premise that the real is 40% overvalued. It 
may well be 10% to 20% overvalued against the dollar, but on a trade 
weighted basis the real is probably pretty fairly valued. The dollar is 
still cheap compared to DM and Yen.

 Unlike Mexico, Brazil's trade is not dominated by the US: almost 70% of 
Mexico's exports go to the US; only about 35% of Brazil's do. This means 
that a trade weighted measure of whether the real is overvalued is a more 
appropriate analytical tool, than a simple calculation against the dollar. 
(By analogy, the Swiss franc, French franc and DM all may be overvalued 
against the dollar but fairly valued against each other which is much more 
important from an economic point of view because so much of the three 
countries trade is with each other). 

 We would say that the Argentine peso is certainly at least as much 
overvalued against the dollar as the real. Yet the pattern of trade between 
Argentina and Brazil suggests to us that the two currencies are now pretty 
much fairly valued against each other.  The growth in Brazilian exports and 
drop in imports, plus the strength of direct investment in Brazil all 
suggests that the real is not massively overvalued. 

 Inflation: The government is forecasting an inflation rate of between 12% 
and 13% for the year. In the first five months of the year, inflation was 
5.1% according to the Fundacao Getulio Vargas and 14% for the 12 months to 
May. In May the rate of 1.55% was higher than the rate of devaluation 
against the dollar and the return on 30-day fixed deposits (1.5%). 

 Textiles: The government has imposed quotas on textiles from Panama, China 
and Taiwan (none of these countries yet belongs to the WTO) and is 
considering taking measures against four WTO members: Pakistan, South Korea, 
Hong Kong and Thailand. The authorities are under pressure from the textile 
industry to curb cheap imports. According to the textile industry, the 
number of companies has fallen from 832 in 1994 to 621 this year and that 
20,000 workers have lost their jobs because of unfair competition. 

 Unemployment: The Departamento Intersindical de Estudios Socioeconomicos 
calculates that unemployment is 15.9%. The government maintains that the 
official figure (which has risen from 5.7% to 6.4%) is more accurate. 

 The government admits that 2.1m jobs have been lost between 1988 and 1995. 
It blames the combination of the 1988 constitution, which guaranteed workers 
an annual bonus of a month's salary, maternity leave and lavish pensions, 
for pricing Brazilians out of jobs. It also says that the heavy investment 
in improved technology might have had something to do with the job losses. 

 Black economy: One in four workers in Rio de Janeiro makes a living from 
the black economy. That is 625,000 out of a total of 2.5m.

 MEXICO: GETTING BETTER: BUT STILL NOT OUT OF THE WOODS

 The gulf between what international investment bankers think is happening 
in Mexico and what Mexican businessmen know is happening seems to be getting 
even wider. On 22 June, Carlos Abascal, president of the Confederacion 
Patronal de la Republica Mexicana (Coparmex) urged his members not to panic. 
He said that while it was impossible to ignore reality and to believe that 
things were starting to improve, industrialists should not just give up and 
believe that things would never get better. 

 Abascal called upon the government to face reality and to stop pretending 
that everything was going swimmingly. He pointed out that the government 
could make a good case for itself, without saying that everything was rosy.

 Abascal is particularly concerned about the state of the banking system. He 
claimed that the government had so far done pretty well, pointing out that 
the rescue of the financial system had cost a mere 6.5% of GDP compared to 
the 30% of GDP Chile had to spend at the beginning of the 1980s when its 
financial system was wrecked by a devaluation following a period of peso 
overvaluation. 

 Coparmex, however, is not sure that the financial system has got over all 
its difficulties. Abascal said that the government needed to pay more 
attention to the banks' bad debt problems and come up with more schemes to 
convert debt into equity. He said that more help for the agricultural 
sector, which is also facing another year of drought, is urgently needed.

 Abascal also said that the government needed to introduce a more 
stimulatory fiscal policy (reduce taxes on new cars and corporate assets and 
rethink income taxes) and to ensure that the exchange rate remained 
competitive. 

 By contrast. The investment banks, on the other hand, can barely see 
further than the next mandate. Guy Erb, head of Goldman Sachs's Mexico 
office said that there was no sign that Mexico had saturated the 
international capital markets with its paper. John Donelly, head of Chase 
Manhattan's Mexico operations, said that the international markets were 
pleased by President Ernesto Zedillo's implementation of last year's 
economic plan. He said that the President had stuck to the letter of the 
plan. 

 Jaime Alatorre, from the Consejo Mexicano de Inversiones, claimed that 
foreign investors had poured US Dollars 1bn into the Mexican stockmarket 
this year. This was twice what they invested in the whole of 1995. Overall 
Mexico expects to attract financial investments (ie foreign investment in 
the Bolsa, GDR issues or debt issues on international markets) of US Dollars 
8bn this year. 

 Unemployment. To be fair there is some evidence that the economy has 
touched bottom. The most obvious indicator of this is the drop in 
unemployment. According to the official statistics agency, the Instituto 
Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia e Informatica, the rate in May was 5.4%. 
This is a whole percentage point below the 6.4% recorded in January. This 
means that 2.67m Mexicans were officially unemployed in May.

 Inegi also reported that the percentage of workers either on strike or 
looking for a job has fallen from 10% in January to 8.8% in May. According 
to the agency 21% of Mexican workers still work less than 35 hours a week.

 Car sales. Another encouraging statistic is the pick up in car sales. In 
the first quarter domestic car sales were 24% higher than in the same period 
of 1995. Car imports increased by 65%. The most popular imports have been 
off-road vehicles (such as Explorer, Cherokee, Voyager and Land Rover) 
though imports of Mercedes Benzes and BMWs also increased sharply.   

 Even so, car sales still have some way to go to make up the ground they 
lost last year. The value of car sales dropped by 70% in 1995; volumes fell 
by 17% and sales of imports dropped by 65%. The industry, which supplies 18% 
of the country's manufacturing jobs, pulled through by increasing exports: 
these jumped by 28% in 1995.

 Exports are still strong. In the first quarter they increased by 39%. 
Overall production was 305,592 units.  

 Growth. The finance minister, Guillermo Ortiz, is still confident that the 
economy will grow by 3% this year. He said that his main concern now was 
ensuring that the growth rate remained at or above this level for the next 
few years.

 Even Ortiz is now conceding (what industrialists know) that the domestic 
market is still in difficulties. He said that domestic demand would grow by 
about 2% this year: a pretty feeble recovery after the 14% fall in 1995. 
Ortiz admitted that the recovery of the domestic economy was slower than had 
been expected because of the over-indebtedness of individuals and companies. 

 Inflation. The OECD's forecast for inflation in Mexico this year is 33%. 
This is well above the government's forecast of 21%. For 1997, the OECD is 
forecasting 17%. 

 In May, the CPI figure was 1.81%, well below the 2.8% recorded in April. 
The rate for the 12 months to June was 34%. The rate for the first five 
months of the year was 13.5%.

 What is slightly alarming about the inflation figure is the sharp rise in 
fruit and vegetable prices in May.

 Agriculture. The rise in food prices is partly due to the drought in the 
north of the country. This has hit the cattle industry particularly hard: 
Mexico's imports of meat increased by 94% in the first quarter of the year 
(admittedly to only US Dollars 11m) while its imports of milk almost 
quadrupled (to a more economically significant US Dollars 136m). 

 Already the number of cattle has fallen by a third to 9m as farmers cut 
their losses by slaughtering stock rather than buying expensive feed. 

 The government is also expecting to have to increase its imports of grains, 
especially maize. 

 OECD. Besides being more realistic about inflation than the government, the 
OECD is also pretty gloomy about growth prospects. It reckons that the 
economy will grow by at most 3% this year, but does not offer a figure for 
1997. The OECD highlights the fragility of the banking sector and the 
weakness of domestic demand: two of our themes over the past year. 

 More encouragingly, the OECD expects imports to pick up this year, but it 
does not expect more than a small current account deficit. The OECD expects 
this deficit to increase to 2% of GDP (US Dollars 6bn) in 1997.

 Trade account. The Secretaria de Hacienda reported that the country had 
record exports in May. It exported goods worth US Dollars 8.046bn and ran a 
trade surplus of US Dollars 532m.

 This brings the trade surplus for the first five months of the year to US 
Dollars 3.17bn. In 1995, the country ran a trade surplus of US Dollars 
7.35bn after running a deficit of US Dollars 18.5bn in 1994.

 What is encouraging is the increase in imports. These rose by 25% (year-on-
year) in May to US Dollars 7.5bn. This is sharply higher than the increase 
for the first five months as a whole which was only 8%. 

 Equally encouraging is the continuing growth in manufactured exports: these 
amounted to US Dollars 31bn for the first five months of the year (22% above 
the comparable figure for 1995). Oil revenues accounted for 12% of Mexico's 
total export revenues of US Dollars 37.7bn. This was 16% more than for the 
same period of 1995.

 MEXICO: THE REAL ECONOMY: STILL TILTED: TOWARDS EXPORTS

 The economic recovery is still heavily skewed. A study by the newspaper El 
Financiero, based on data from the finance ministry and the central bank for 
the first quarter, found that while exporting companies grew by 13.4% in 
real terms, domestic consumption grew by just 1.3%. and investment fell by 
4%.

 The investment figures are particularly disappointing. Another newspaper, 
Reforma, took a look at how companies had made out on the investments they 
promised to make in November 1995. The government had trumpeted the fact 
that the private sector would invest US Dollars 6bn in 1996.

 In fact, as Reforma found, very little of this investment has actually been 
made. Of the 28 companies quoted on the stockmarket which promised to invest 
US Dollars 4.4bn, 11 have invested nothing and have no plans to do so this 
year.

 Among these companies are ICA, a construction company, which promised to 
invest US Dollars 590m but has invested nothing; Bufete another construction 
company which promised US Dollars 255m but has invested nothing. Nine other 
companies have invested less than they promised (including Telmex, Iusacell 
and Alfa). 

 On the other hand three companies, Televisa, Gissa and Soriana have 
invested more than they promised and 14 have delivered on their promises. 

 EU: The European Union has formally given the go-ahead for the commission 
to start negotiations with Mexico about a free trade agreement. The 
agreement had been blocked by Britain as part of its non-cooperation policy 
with the EU in order to force concessions from its EU partners over the EU 
ban on exports of British beef and beef products.

 The EU and Mexico have agreed to set up a bilateral steering group which 
will decide on methods and a schedule for overcoming both the tariff and 
non-tariff barriers which block the way to freer trade. 

 Mexico believes that it should benefit from freer trade with the EU. In 
1995, it ran a deficit of US Dollars 3.35bn with the EU. 

 Steel production: Mexico's steel production in the first four months of the 
year was 11% higher this year (at 4.3m t) than in the same period of 1995, 
the Camara Nacional de Acero reported. The Camara says that if the industry 
keeps on at the current rate the country will produce 13m t of steel this 
year. This would represent a capacity utilisation rate of 92%. The biggest 
increase has been in laminated products where output has increased by 52% to 
1.6m t. 

 Teachers: A large number of the country's most important group of 
employees, the teachers, has rejected the government's offer of a 12% wage 
increase which was accepted by the official teachers union. The teachers 
launched a series of protests and demonstrations in the first half of June 
to back up their demands for a doubling of their wages. They currently 
receive US Dollars 226 a month.

 What unnerved the government was the strength of support for the claim. On 
five consecutive days over 20,000 people marched through the capital, 
demanding higher wages.

 The government felt that it had to respond, and officials from three 
ministries (interior, education and finance) met leaders of the dissident 
teachers. President Zedillo also asked the head of the capital's police 
force to resign after his heavy handed policing of the teachers' 
demonstrations left a dozen people injured.

 ARGENTINA: A BIT OF A JAGGED RECOVERY: QUESTIONS ABOUT FIRST QUARTER GROWTH

 The claims by the economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, that the economy 
contracted by only 3.2% in the first quarter has been greeted with 
scepticism in Buenos Aires. Given that in the first quarter, agriculture 
probably declined by 5%, industry by 6% and construction by 17%, the rest of 
the economy (which accounts for the remaining 60% of output) must have done 
remarkably well.

 To be fair, the evidence is that oil and gas production, mining, power 
generation and other utilities had a good quarter. Equally, anecdotal 
evidence suggests that the tertiary sector of the economy had a poor 
quarter.

 More worrying is the most recent industrial trends survey from the 
Fundacion de Investigaciones Economicas Latinoamericanas which suggests that 
industrialists are revising downwards their expectations for business in the 
next six months.

 Just as alarming is the data for bankruptcies. Although the number of 
companies seeking reschedulings with their creditors fell by 10% between 
February and May 1996 (compared with the same period of 1995), the size of 
the debts involved increased by 13% in real terms. As for bankruptcies, the 
number of companies going bust increased by 74% although the amount of money 
involved increased by only 7%. 

 Lowest interest rates. Even the steady increase in bank deposits is not yet 
having a beneficial economic effect. Bank deposits topped US Dollars 50bn at 
the end of the May. This is a third more than in the same month of 1995 and 
11% up on 1994's figure.

 The government points out that this increase in liquidity has allowed 
interest rates to fall by two and a half percentage points: the prime rate 
is now 6.4%. These are the lowest rates since the convertibility plan 
started in 1991.  

 Bankers say that this abundance of liquidity has yet to tempt consumers to 
start borrowing again. They say that both companies and households are not 
yet confident enough about their economic prospects to gear up.  

 External sector. What seems clear  is that the external sector is still 
doing much better than the domestic part of the economy. Car exports to 
Brazil are still strong and agricultural exports have risen impressively. 
According to the Instituto Nacional de Estadisticas y Censos, agricultural 
and food exports, (excluding rice, sunflowers and soya oil, which are major 
revenue earners) were US Dollars 910m for the first two months of the year. 
This was 28% up on the comparable period of 1995. 

 Indec noted that meat, fish and fruit had been the biggest revenue earners 
but the biggest increases had come from sugar and alcoholic drinks. 

 The government is continuing to revise upwards its figure for agricultural 
exports. It now reckons that the country could export US Dollars 10bn worth 
of primary and processed foodstuffs. 

 Brazilian business. Exports are hugely dependent on what happens in its 
larger neighbour. The Argentine ambassador to Brazil, Alieto Guadagni, said 
that Argentina's exports to its neighbour should be worth US Dollars 7bn 
this year. Last year Argentina shipped US Dollars 5.6bn worth of goods to 
Brazil.

 Cavallo himself underlined how important a flourishing Brazil now is to 
Argentina's economic recovery. He paid a quick visit to Brasilia to meet the 
whole of the Brazilian economic team to check that they would not change the 
economic policy in early June. During a series of meetings with everyone 
from President Cardoso down, Cavallo said that it was clear that Brazil 
would not change its exchange rate nor its economic policy. 

 Cavallo claims that the two economies were now in some sort of economic 
sync: both would grow this year and register low inflation. Low inflation is 
likely. A more open question is whether Argentina will hit Cavallo's target 
of 5% growth this year: the consensus in Argentina is that the economy will 
do well to grow by 3%.  

 Deficit. The government's fiscal position is still under pressure. The 
fiscal deficit may not just be a temporary problem caused by the 
sluggishness of the economy which has hit revenues. The creation of private 
pension funds has deprived the government of an important source of cash. It 
can also be argued that the decision to lower employers' compulsory 
inflation adjust for pensions (a liability which has been switched to the 
government) will also put pressure on government finances, even when the 
economy recovers. 

 The government has already consulted the IMF about getting some leeway for 
this year's fiscal targets. In the first four months of the year it had 
already run up a deficit equivalent to 70% of the US Dollars 2.5bn that was 
envisaged for the year as a whole. 

 The government is likely to be able to muddle through this year, but next 
year the problems will be even worse. Firstly its debt service payments will 
rise, as principal payments started on Bocones and the costs of the huge 
amount of borrowing in the past year or so start to have an effect. The 
other problem will be the consolidation of the (bust) provincial pension 
funds into the national state fund. 

 The government is still shirking structural reform measures: its only 
response to the growing problem has been to borrow more to shore up this 
year's accounts. In 1995 the country increased its net debt by US Dollars 
5.8bn and this year it has borrowed between US Dollars 4bn and US Dollars 
6bn.

 This is a dangerous policy. If US interest rates start to rise in the 
autumn, as the US credit markets expect, Argentina could find the door to 
the international credit markets slammed shut in its face. The crunch could 
come at the beginning of 1997.

 VENEZUELA: INFLATION KEY: AND CUTTING THE BUREAUCRACY

 The planning minister, Teodoro Petkoff, is clear about the economic 
variable which will determine the success or failure of the current economic 
plan: inflation. He recently told an audience of New York bankers and 
businessmen that nothing was more important for the poor and lower middle 
class than a lower inflation rate.

 Petkoff is still confident that the inflation rate will start to ebb this 
month: he is still aiming for a 2% monthly rate by December. 

 Petkoff was more guarded about the government's spending plans: he said 
that the government could not slash the social payments, but would take 
action to reorientate them. This is a reference to the increased social 
security payments the government announced along with its adjustment package 
in April.

 The government doubled the value of the payments it makes under its food 
stamps programme: this enables the poor to buy staples such as milk, eggs 
and rice. The government also doubled pensions and announced youth job 
creation schemes and an increase in the subsidised medicine programme. The 
IMF has put pressure on the government to reduce these payments. 

 Bureaucracy. The government is unwilling to cut these payments by as much 
as the IMF wants. Petkoff has made it clear that he would prefer to cut 
government spending by slimming down the civil service. He notes that 
Venezuela has 800,000 civil servants: that is 300,000 more than Brazil, he 
claimed. 

 Petkoff said that he did not expect to push through a six month programme 
to slash civil service numbers, as this would produce chaos and unrest. The 
first government move, he said, would be the imposition of a hiring freeze.

 Managing this process, Petkoff reckons, will be far from easy. But he said 
that the bureaucracy had to be cut back if the fiscal deficit was to be 
brought under control. 

 The banking system. There are signs that the banking system is on the mend: 
Jose Maria Nogueroles, president of Banco Provincial, the country's solidest 
bank, said that the bank's capital position was 13% stronger in real terms 
in March 1996 than in March 1995.

 The government is hoping to take advantage of this favourable wind to sell 
two of the banks it rescued in 1994. The big sale will be Banco de 
Venezuela, the country's second biggest bank but the government is also 
trying to sell the smaller Banco Tequendama.

 Banco de Venezuela now has assets of US Dollars 812m and according to a 
private consultancy, Softline, deposits of US Dollars 700m. Salomon Brothers 
is advising the government on the sale. Prequalification for potential 
bidders closed on 7 June. 

 The government has also pencilled in November as the date for the sale of 
Banco Consolidado, the country's fourth biggest bank. 

 Petkoff said the country hoped to get a loan of US Dollars 1bn from the 
multilaterals to help pay for the restructuring of the banking system. He 
reckoned this would be about half the total cost of sorting out the system.

 IMF. Petkoff has refused to give details on exactly how much the country is 
hoping to get from the multilaterals. The IMF has agreed to lend the country 
US Dollars 1.4bn over 12 months, and the deal is scheduled to be signed this 
month. 

 According to Petkoff, the loan can be converted into a structural 
adjustment facility at the end of the year if the government and the IMF 
agree. 

 Petkoff is also negotiating loans from the World Bank and the IDB. The 
country is expecting to get US Dollars 900m from the World Bank and US 
Dollars 1bn from the IDB. These loans will be designed to help pay for the 
restructuring of the financial sector and to ease the adjustment burden. It 
is likely that these loans, especially the money from the World Bank, will 
be tied to the privatisation programme. 

 Airlines: Other airlines are joining American Airlines in demanding 
compensation from the government for the losses caused by the government's 
exchange rate policies. American Airlines has asked for US Dollars 8m. 
Another 10 airlines say that the changes in the exchange rate have cost them 
US Dollars 21m. The airlines say that the losses were caused by the 
government's policy of exchange controls which tried to hold the bolivar at 
170 (and then 290) to the dollar. 

 American and the other airlines claim that their applications to exchange 
bolivars for dollars were blocked from July to September 1995 (when the rate 
was 170) and that they were only paid when the bolivar had dropped to 290 to 
the dollar. Under international agreements with the airlines, countries 
undertake to recompense airlines for losses caused by exchange rate 
variations. 

 Although the government is fighting the case in the courts, the finance 
minister, Luis Matos Azocar, is making conciliatory noises and says that an 
out-of-court settlement should be reached. He also pointed out, however, 
that the exchange control regime did not guarantee that companies would be 
able to get all the dollars they had asked for. 

 Reformulated petrol: The government is pleased by the WTO's decision in its 
favour. The WTO has ruled that the US was acting in a protectionist way by 
allowing US refineries more time to meet clean air standards. Imported 
reformulated petrol had to meet the new standards immediately. Venezuela, 
which was exporting between 55,000 and 60,000bpd of reformulated petrol, 
argued that the measure discriminated against its exports because US 
produced products did not have to meet the same standards. The state oil 
company PDVSA said that the unfair trade practice cost it about US Dollars 
50m because it had to ship the product to less profitable markets.

 CHILE: BANK LAW READY FOR APPROVAL: FROM IMPORTER TO EXPORTER

 Congress is on the point of passing a new banking law. This would both free 
the banks to do more internationally and domestically, define bank secrecy 
and force banks to meet the so called Basle committee's minimum, risk-
weighted capital adequacy standards.

 The law was designed by the previous government and included provisions to 
sort out the subordinated debt question. The state still holds a lot of 
subordinated debt issued by Chilean banks to stave off their collapse at the 
beginning of the 1980s. This issue has now been separated from the other 
issues which will modify the Ley General de Bancos. 

 Chile has 34 banks, of which 19 are foreign owned, three are sociedades 
financieras and one is state owned, Banco del Estado. Standard & Poor's, one 
of the world's most important credit rating agencies, recently issued a 
report which claimed that Chile had the solidest banking system in the 
region. Indeed the banks' non-performing loans have fallen from 2.1% of 
total assets in 1990 to about 1%. 

 The new businesses that banks will be able to get into are insurance (but 
not life assurance) stockbroking, factoring, running mutual funds and funds 
for investment overseas, custody of securities and financial advice.

 Subordinated debt. The banks have until 23 July to do a deal with the 
central bank to sort out the subordinated debt issue. The central bank now 
holds US Dollars 4.58bn worth of subordinated debt. The banks with the 
biggest amounts still outstanding at the end of March 1996 were Banco de 
Santiago (US Dollars 1.7bn);  Banco de Chile (US Dollars 1.7bn); Banco de 
Concepcion (US Dollars 654m); BHIF (US Dollars 380m) and Banco Internacional 
(US Dollars 127m). Under the terms of the deal to rescue banks in 1982 the 
central bank bought the bank's non-performing loans from them with 
subordinated debt: the banks undertook to buy the debt back over time, but 
no deadline was set. 

 The economy: The government is still concerned about inflation. It wants to 
hit its target of 6.5% for the year and is prepared to keep the currency 
overvalued (at least against the dollar) until the 12 month lagging rate 
comes closer to that target. The 12 month lagging rate stood at 8.6% at the 
end of May. The government has also indicated that it will not hesitate to 
increase interest rates (as it did in March) if it believes that the economy 
is growing too fast. In the first quarter the rate of growth was verging on 
9%. Growth last year was 8.25%, the highest in Latin America. 

 Investment: The finance minister said that the public sector would spend US 
Dollars 7.89bn between 1996 and the end of the millennium on infrastructure 
projects. He hoped that the private sector would invest a similar amount. 

 The president of the Camara Chilena de Construccion, Eugenio Velasco, 
reckoned that the country needs US Dollars 14.2bn worth of infrastructure 
over the next five years: he said that bottlenecks at ports and poor roads 
cost the country US Dollars 1.65bn in lost exports and repairs every year. 

 This year private sector investment in infrastructure is likely to 
increase. In 1995 it jumped to US Dollars 509m from US Dollars 31m in 1994. 
The government's target for 1996 is US Dollars 2.5bn. Most private sector 
construction projects are financed by bank loans. 

 Pension funds: The pension funds are finding the going tough. In the year 
to May they have returned only 1.2%., well below the average annual return 
of 12.6% since 1981.  The fund administrators point out that the worst may 
now be over: the funds rose by 1.7% in May. The best performers were 
Habitat, Aporta and Valora, which rose by 9%. The funds have assets of US 
Dollars 26.8bn, 40% of which is in Chilean government debt, a third in 
shares and 24% in private sector debt. Less than 0.2% of the funds' assets 
are invested internationally.

 COLOMBIA: SAMPER CLEARED: BUT QUESTIONS REMAIN

 President Ernesto Samper was cleared of knowing that his successful 
election campaign was financed by the drug cartels. He was cleared after an 
investigation by the Camara de Representantes. The US attitude to Colombia 
is still unclear though the omens are not good.

 Although the US ambassador to Colombia, Myles Frechette, said that the US 
wants to boost trade between the two countries, the Colombians are fretting 
about sanctions that may be taken because of a dispute involving American 
Airlines. Until 1993 American flew from new York to Bogota; but it then 
suspended the service, saying it was not making money. The Colombian 
authorities awarded the route to Continental Airlines earlier this year, 
producing squawks of outrage from American. The US government has taken up 
American's complaint and threatened Avianca's daily flight from Bogota to 
New York. The Colombians have rejected the suggested compromise from the US 
that two airlines from each country should fly the route: the Colombians say 
that this would produce too much capacity. 

 Car sales: Sales of imported cars fell by 23% in the first four months of 
the year. Sales of domestically assembled cars dropped 13%. 

 Investment: Foreign investment in Colombia increased by 19% in the first 
two months of the year to US Dollars 160m, according to the Corporacion 
Invertir en Colombia. The financial sector was the most popular, accounting 
for US Dollars 75m of new investment.

 Ganadero: A Spanish bank, BBV, bought 40% of Banco Ganadero for US Dollars 
300m. Ganadero has assets of US Dollars 3bn and made US Dollars 14m in the 
first quarter of this year.

 ECUADOR: BUCARAM AHEAD: BUSINESS ALARMED

 Businessmen are alarmed at the strong support for the Guayaquil populist 
Abdala Bucaram. He did much better in the first round than the opinion polls 
had suggested and looks more confident going into the run-off with Jaime 
Nebot on 7 July. Nebot is the candidate of the firmly middle class Partido 
Social Cristiano and if he should lose there is likely to be a bout of sucre 
weakness. The new government does not take office until August. 

 Bucaram's economic policies are not particularly clear. He has refused to 
debate with other candidates, preferring to issue pamphlets saying that he 
will not follow the current economic policies which he says pander to the 20 
national monopolies. Exactly who he will use to advise him on how to run the 
economy is unclear: all Bucaram will say is that he is a friend of Roberto 
Isaias, the owner of Filanbanco, one of the country's biggest banks, and 
interests in sugar and the media. Bucaram made his career as a populist 
mayor of Guayaquil where he developed a taste (reputation) for wild 
rhetoric. He was not generally considered to be a likely winner of the 
election. 

 Nebot, by contrast, was the longtime favourite. He is known to support more 
liberalisation and privatisation. 

 The country's electoral law bars opinion polls from being published in the 
run up to the election. One of the last, published on 2 June, after the 
first round results, gave Bucaram 44% of the votes against 31% to Nebot and 
24% undecided. The problem for Nebot is that the supporters of the third and 
fourth candidates in the first round, Freddy Ehlers and Rodrigo Paz, are 
unlikely to support his economic policies which form a key part of his 
platform: Ehlers was against opening up the economy and Paz and his party 
have opposed economic reform. 

 Although the second round will determine who becomes President, the first 
round has elected the members of congress. Here Nebot seems to have fallen 
short of the 30 seat target he set himself.

 PERU: MORE BUREAUCRATS TO BE SACKED: TO BOOST CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

 The government wants to cut the number of bureaucrats. This was one of its 
main promises to the IMF in its recent letter of intent. Over the past five 
years the government has already trimmed its workforce by 1m. Nevertheless, 
900,000 people still work for the government. 

 Despite these cuts, paying for the bureaucracy still swallows 65% of the 
country's tax revenues. The country collects US Dollars 242m a month in tax 
and customs duties. 

 This heavy bureaucratic expense means, the government says, that its 
spending on capital projects and debt payments is reduced. 

 In parallel with its plans to reduce the bureaucracy, the government is 
also trying to create 130,000 jobs a year as part of its anti-poverty 
programme. 

 The government wants to streamline both the central government and regional 
government. It says that there are still too many rules and regulations 
covering budgeting, accounting, cash management and procurement. 

 The government now wants to get each part of the administration to set its 
own systems, which it hopes will be more practical than a generalised system 
to cover every bureaucratic eventuality. The government also says that it 
will try to make individuals in the bureaucracy responsible for their 
actions.

 Tax overhaul. The government points out that the IMF has already welcomed 
some of its bureaucratic reforms, in particular its achievement in 
increasing the tax take from 5% of GDP to 14% in only four years. 

 The government also says that the IMF has said its privatisation and anti-
poverty programmes are models for other countries to follow. 

 The IMF has agreed to lend Peru US Dollars 150m to finance its Brady plan. 
This involves buying back debt and US Treasury bonds to back new bond 
issues. The government expects to sign its Brady deal in October. 

 Pension problems: The country's private pension system has lost US Dollars 
3m so far this year. Of the six Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones, only 
two, Horizonte and Integra, made profits. Both figures were marginal. 

 The companies say they are losing money because their marketing and 
operating costs are higher than their income. The main reason for this is 
that Peruvian companies are well behind on their payments to the AFPs. The 
official figure is that they are 50% in arrears. The AFP superintendency is 
mulling over the idea of offering companies easy terms to bring themselves 
back up to date. 

 So far the pension funds have signed up 1m people and built up funds of US 
Dollars 1bn. 

 Chilean investment: The Camara de Comercio de Santiago expects Chilean 
investment in Peru to hit US Dollars 3bn this year. This will be 30% more 
than the US Dollars 2.7bn registered at the end of 1995.

 The surge of Chilean investment has increased trade between the two 
countries, and led to a hefty Chilean trade surplus. Of the US Dollars 586m 
in total trade between the two countries, Chilean exports amounted to US 
Dollars 438m.  

 Tariffs: The government says that it will only move its tariff system to 
harmonise with the Andean Group's when that group lowers its tariffs to 
Peruvian rates. Peru still does not seem inclined to adopt the Andean 
Group's four rates for external tariffs (20%, 15% 10% and 5%). Peru's 
external tariff rates are 5%, 10% and 15%. 

 Currently Peru has partial free trade agreements with Colombia, Ecuador and 
Venezuela but does not apply the Andean groups external tariff system.

 BOLIVIA: DEBT NOT A PROBLEM: SAYS CAMDESSUS

 Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, said that the country's 
foreign debt with the multilaterals should not impede its growth and 
economic development. Camdessus, who stopped in Bolivia during his tour of 
South America, said he was not coming to La Paz as some sort of 
international monetary policeman. He also said that it would be wrong to 
muddle up Bolivia's efforts to reduce its foreign debts with its fight 
against poverty. 

 Exports: The government is hoping that it can increase its soya exports 
once it is linked to the transport systems of the Mercosur.

 Banking system: Two thirds of the country's US Dollars 2.2bn in bank 
deposits are fixed term. A further 20% are held in current accounts, the 
Superintendencia de Bancos y Entidades Financieras reported in its 1995 
annual report.

 COSTA RICA: MISSING THE IMF TARGET: AS FIGUERES SNUBBED

 T
he government has admitted that it will miss the fiscal deficit target it 
agreed with the IMF this year. The target is 0.5% of GDP, but Fernando 
Herrero, who resigned as finance minister in June said that the likely 
outcome for this year would be a deficit of 2%. 

 Herrero said the government had been undone by two things: higher interest 
expenses (the government has run up domestic debts of US Dollars 2.9bn) and 
lower than expected tax revenues. The latter he said was due to the poor 
growth of the economy. 

 Herrero, who is handing over to Francisco de Paula Gutierrez, said the IMF 
may well take a lenient view of the missed targets, especially if it thought 
that other parts of the structural reform programme were going well. He did 
add, however, in his resignation report on the economy, that the government 
would need to raise new taxes to pay for its education, infrastructure and 
health programmes.

 De Paula Gutierrez. Herrero said he had resigned for personal reasons. He 
was married to another former member of the cabinet, Florisabel Rodriguez. 

 Herrero had presided over a fierce adjustment package to undo economic 
damage done in the first two years of President Jose Maria Figueres' 
administration. The worry is that political pressures will mean that the 
government will try to engineer a boom in the run-up to the elections in 
1997. The President has promised not to go for growth, but with over 50% of 
Costa Ricans reckoning that he has been a lousy President, this might 
change. 

 De Paula Gutierrez is a professional economist and has said the 
government's economic policy should not change. Before joining the 
government he was head of the Instituto Centroamericano de Administracion de 
Empresas. He is considered to be more of a free-marketeer than Herrero.  

 Contralor general: The government was forced to drop its contralor because 
of his closeness to the President. This made it doubtful that he could take 
an objective view of government spending. The new contralor, selected after 
three months of political bickering, is Luis Fernando Vargas, a member of 
the ruling PLN and a deputy labour minister in the Oscar Arias 
administration. Vargas's election is another snub to the President who 
supported another candidate. The (PLN) president of the legislative 
assembly, Walter Coto, led the rebellion by three PLN members.

 CUBA: LAGE FORECASTS 5%: GROWTH THIS YEAR

 The country's Vice President Carlos Lage reckons that the economy will 
slowdown after registering a 7% growth rate in the first quarter. He is 
sticking to a forecast of 5% growth for the whole year. 

 Lage said that the economy was boosted in the first half of the year by the 
increase in sugar production. The country just scraped through to  the 4.5m 
tonne target set by the government. In mid-June, with two or three sugar 
mills still grinding, the country had produced 4.45m t of sugar. This year's 
crop though was a big improvement on 1994/95's 3.3m t.

 Lage claimed that the economy grew by 2.5% last year, but the government's 
statistical information is still rudimentary and there are few ways of 
verifying statements made by leading politicians. 

 One of the fastest growing sectors of the economy appears to be the nickel 
industry. The government says that the country will produce a record 50,000t 
of nickel this year. This is a 40% increase on the 1995 figure. The problem 
is that nickel mining does not have much effect on the rest of the economy. 
At most  2,000 people benefit directly from the increase in production. 

 More important is the increase in tourism. Last year 730,000 people visited 
the island (20% more than in 1994) and the government is hoping for 1m 
visitors this year. Also important is the 25% increase in tobacco production 
and the 22% increase in agricultural output.

 The only downbeat part of Lage's report on the state of the economy 
concerned foreign investment. He noted that this had stalled, following the 
decision by the US Congress and then the administration to turn the Helms-
Burton bill into law. This allows the US to take punitive action against 
companies and individuals who have bought assets in Cuba claimed by US 
companies or individuals. Lage said that although new investment had not 
been forthcoming, no companies had yet said they would pull out of Cuba 
because of the law.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: ELECTIONS AND FRAUDS: FROM IMPORTER TO EXPORTER

 The country faces a second round of the presidential elections on 30 June. 
The issue is whether the frontrunner in the first round, Jose Francisco Pena 
Gomez, can hang on and win. Ranged against him is not only the runner-up in 
the first round, Leonel Fernandez, but also the ruling party and the current 
President Joaquin Balaguer whose candidate, Jacinto Peynado, came a poor 
third.

 Balaguer is, apparently, very much against Pena Gomez, largely because Pena 
Gomez is black. Pena Gomez from the Partido Revolucionario Dominicano won 
46% of the votes in the first round, well ahead of the 395 won by Fernandez 
from the Partido de la Liberacion Dominicana. Peynado, from the Partido 
Reformista Social Cristiano, won 16%. 

 Corruption. The Contraloria de la Republica Dominicana revealed that 
800,000 state cheques had been forged, costing the government US Dollars 
47m. The contralor, Victor Grimaldi, pointed out that no official had yet 
been charged or convicted of any crime. The cheques seem to have been issued 
by the Tesoreria Nacional.

 EL SALVADOR: MAKING A GESTURE: BOOSTING PUBLIC WORKS

 The government is still under pressure from industry to take the brakes off 
the economy. The government was obliged to tighten monetary policy last year 
in order to stop credit growing at a destabilising rate and inflation 
getting out of hand. The private sector still reckons that policy is too 
tight. It wants the economy to be growing by at least 6% a year.

 The Camara de Comercio e Industria de El Salvador said that achieving 
stability was not enough: the economy had to also recover its dynamism. In 
1992 and 1993 the economy grew by over 7% a year in real terms. This rate 
dropped to 6% in 1994 and 1995. 

 The government of President Armando Calderon Sol clearly felt that it had 
to at least make a gesture. So at the beginning of June, on its second 
anniversary of accession to office, it announced a US Dollars 114m public 
works programme. 

 Besides this, the President also announced that the tariff reform programme 
would be slowed down: in particular the government says that it will give 
local industry more time before tariffs on consumer goods are lowered.

 The government is still planning to lower tariffs on capital goods to zero 
by the end of the year. Exports are also eligible for a 6% tax refund. 

 Crime. The opposition is linking the problems in the economy with the huge 
increase in crime. Marta Valladares, a leader of the former guerrilla group, 
the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional, claims that there 
were 8,000 murders in the country last year. This was more than the annual 
casualties in most years of the civil war she said. Even some members of the 
ruling Alianza Republicana Nacionalista (ARENA party) concede that more 
needs to be done to build up civil society and reduce poverty.

 GUATEMALA: THE RIGHT SURFACES: AS GUERRILLAS DROP TAX

 The hardliners opposed to any peace deal with the guerrilla Unidad 
Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca have broken cover. A group of 
landowners, the Coordinadora Nacional Agropecuaria has criticised the 
government for not using the army to break up meetings called by the URNG or 
using soldiers to evict peasants from land they are squatting on.

 Conagro tried to derail the peace agreement last year by protesting against 
concessions offered by the government. Conagro claimed that they were 
unconstitutional but the constitutional court overruled this. 

 The government is pressing on with its programme to get a peace deal in 
place. Officials say that the URNG's commitment not to charge business the 
so-called 'war tax' seems to be holding. Gustavo Porras, president of the 
Comision de Paz, says that the people who seem to be levying the tax appear 
not to be guerrillas, but just common criminals. 

 Army: President Alvaro Arzu said that peace and a smaller army would not 
necessarily mean that the government could cut the military budget and spend 
the money on something else. He said that more mobile armed forces, needed 
to combat drug traffickers and protect forests, were more expensive. He 
noted that although Guatemala's armed forces had fallen from 47,000 to 
32,000, little money had been saved. 

 Strikes: The government is pushing on with its plans to reform the labour 
code which will end the right to strike for people employed in  essential 
public services. 

 Tax: The government reckons that the Impuesto de Solidaridad Extraordinario 
y Temporal should raise US Dollars 21.6m. This is a sort of supertax on 
companies and individuals with earnings of more than US Dollars 8,000 in 
1994/95. The tax is set at 1% for this year and will rise to 1.5% in 1997. 
People who make six monthly payments will get a 10% discount.

 CHILE: CODELCO AND THE COPPER MARKET: LINKS BETWEEN DAVILA AND HAMANAKA

 The Corporacion del Cobre, Chile's state-owned copper mining company, is 
likely to be badly affected by the fall in copper prices following the 
discovery that Yasuo Hamanaka had run up US Dollars 1.8bn in loss-making, 
unauthorised trades over the past 10 years. Codelco  traded heavily with 
Sumitomo, which was one of the few Japanese trading houses not to develop 
mines of its own. Instead it relied on the London Metal Exchange to buy 
stocks of copper to meet its clients needs. Japan, despite being a 
negligible copper producer, has the world's second biggest copper smelting 
industry. Codelco is the world's biggest copper producer. 

 Codelco had reckoned that the copper price would average between US Dollars 
1.15 and US Dollars 1.16 a pound this year. In the week of 24 June the 
copper price slid to just 81 cents a pound before recovering slightly. The 
fear in the copper market is that Sumitomo, which had built up huge stocks 
of copper which it used to try and squeeze the market, will now have be a 
forced seller as its management tries to adjust its position. 

 The fall in copper prices has been dramatic. Last year the price averaged 
US Dollars 1.33 a pound, despite the prospect of new mines coming into 
production this year and weak demand from the industrialised countries. 
Indeed until the second week of June (one week after Sumitomo started its 
investigation into Hamanaka's trading) the average price for the year was US 
Dollars 1.17.

 The Comision Chilena del Cobre reckons that each one cent move in the 
average price of copper costs the country US Dollars 20m a year. 

 Complaints. Juan Villarzu, Codelco's president, blames the LME for allowing 
the problem to arise. He said that the market had become too speculative. He 
wants rules to make speculation more difficult.

 Villarzu's complaint seems to be a case of sour grapes. Codelco did not 
understand what its futures trader, Juan Pablo Davila was up to three years 
ago when he managed to cost the company US Dollars 175m by doing loss-making 
deals with brokers. Indeed it was the brokers who first alerted Codelco to 
the problem. 

 The brokers seem to have acted similarly in Hamanaka's case. Once they 
started to get strange requests from Hamanaka about the way trades should be 
recorded, they went to the LME with their worries. The LME called in 
Sumitomo which did nothing. 

 The LME has also tried to smooth the copper market by increasing the margin 
requirement from its usual US Dollars 200 a tonne to US Dollars 600; given 
the market's recent volatility such an increase seems warranted. It is 
expected that once the current bout of volatility is over the margin will 
fall back to more normal levels.

 That is right. All markets need a mixture of users and speculators. Without 
the strange combination of two hedge funds (Quantum and Tiger) and a 
Montreal scrap dealer, who all started to short copper on 6 June, a day 
after Sumitomo started its investigation into Hamanaka's trading, the false 
market that had developed in copper would not have been revealed. The 
speculators' action increased the pressure on Sumitomo and Hamanaka as their 
losses increased. When they came clean, the speculators appeared to take 
their profits and leave the market to find its own level. 

 Hedging. Unlike gold mining companies which have used gold loans and other 
techniques to hedge their future production, Codelco seems to have spurned 
the idea of hedging. This may be a legacy of Juan Pablo Davila's activities.

 The company was already feeling the effects of the drop in copper prices in 
its first quarter. Despite a 10% increase in production the company's net 
profits fell by 9% to US Dollars 433m. Its operating profits fell even more 
dramatically, from US Dollars 491m to US Dollars 305m.

 CHILE: CORPORATE PROFILE/IANSA & PATHFINDER: QUITE A SUCCESS STORY: 
Developing from sugar into agribusiness

 The Pathfinder group in Chile, whose shareholders were among the pioneers 
of debt equity swaps in the 1980s, has now carved out a reputation as a 
specialist in turning around ailing Chilean companies has turned its 
attention to Iansa, a troubled fruit company. 

 So successful has Iansa become that Forbes, a US business magazine picked 
it as one of the five best run companies in the country. Pathfinder is 
running Iansa as part of Campos Chilenos. It took over Iansa four years ago.

 Failed first privatisation. The company was founded in 1952 by the state 
holding company Corfo. Its core business was producing sugar from sugar 
beet. As sugar prices were controlled by the state and Corfo's objective was 
to increase agricultural production rather than make money, Iansa wracked up 
losses rather than profits. 

 Once the privatisation bug bit the government in Chile, Iansa was clearly a 
prime candidate for divestiture. Instead of selling the whole of the company 
as a going concern, the government decided to sell three of its five sugar 
plants to two companies. Crav bought two and Compania Industrial one. 

 The sales coincided with a surge in the international sugar price: this 
prompted Crav to start speculating on the futures market just as the sugar 
market turned down. Crav went bust in 1981. Compania Industrial soon 
followed suit. 

 This led the Banco de Estado, which had been the major creditor to the two 
companies, to reassemble the group as it had been before the sales with five 
sugar plants.

 Second shot. The government had another go at selling the company between 
1986 and 1988. This time it sold the company partly through the stockmarket 
and in part directly to other companies. The new owners included: Campos 
Chilenos (which was then owned by famers who supplied Iansa with its raw 
materials and the company's employees); Continental Bank from Chicago; 
Sucden, a French commodity trading company; and Soquimich, a Chilean mining 
company.

 The current general manager of the firm, Ernesto Sahr, told the Chilean 
news magazine Que Pasa, that contrary to what people thought, the second 
privatisation did little to improve the viability of the firm. He said that 
conflicts between shareholders unhinged Iansa's management, marketing and 
financial system. 

 Pathfinder's chance. Pathfinder saw its chance and took it at the end of 
1991 by buying Campos Chilenos, Iansa's controlling shareholder. Sahr said 
that immediately the company's fortune's started to improve. Pathfinder 
built up its stake and now controls 43% of Iansa's shares.

 More importantly, Pathfinder also got the company to change its business. 
The company had originally been set up to help national agriculture, in 
particular sugar producers. Under Pathfinder's management, it had two tasks: 
the first was to dominate the local sugar market. The second was to 
diversify away from relying just on sugar for its money. 

 Challenge. Unlike some managers, who might have decided to move the company 
away from sugar almost immediately, Pathfinder decided that Iansa should try 
to dominate the local sugar market before diversifying.

 Dominating the sugar market was more easily said than done. Unlike most 
developing (and developed) countries, Chile does not protect its domestic 
sugar market with high tariffs.

 This meant that Iansa had to grow by becoming more efficient and 
competitive. First it cut costs, streamlined its management and invested in 
new technology to increase productivity. 

 So successful was Iansa that the low price for sugar in Chile has kept 
other companies out of the market. A kilo of sugar in Chile retails at 
around US Dollars 0.50. In the US, by contrast, a kilo of sugar costs US 
Dollars 1.20. 

 The bottom line. Iansa's strategy has not just delivered low-priced sugar 
to Chilean consumers: it has also delivered a spectacular financial 
performance. 

 In 1993, Iansa's profits increased by 425% (to US Dollars 11.5m) compared 
with 1992. But this was almost nothing compared to what happened in 1995 
when the company's profits shot up to US Dollars 48.5m.

 The main reason for the surge in profits in 1994 and 1995 was record sugar 
production in 1994/95. The company produced 550,000t of sugar: this was 20% 
more than it had produced in the previous season.

 Overall, Iansa has increased sales by an average of 18% a year since it was 
taken over by Pathfinder. 

 Diversification. Pathfinder's plan for Iansa is that it should cease to be 
a one product company but evolve into a diversified agro-industrial company. 
Sahr said that the company realised it was dangerous to depend on sugar, 
whose price can vary dramatically on the international market.

 Iansa first dabbled in agricultural supplies before moving into the tomato 
products market, fruit concentrates and animal feed.

 So successful has the diversification strategy been that Iansa has changed 
its corporate structure. Iansa has now become a parent company with five 
subsidiaries: 

 Iansa still runs the sugar side of the business. This consists of the 
original five plants and the sugar business still accounts for 64% of the 
group's sales. Iansa Peru and Insafrut run the fruit and fruit drink side; 
Iansagro looks after the supply of agricultural services and supplies and 
Biomaster deals with animal feed. Each company has a five year plan that 
calls for the whole group to invest US Dollars 230m. 

 Capital. Such a heavy investment programme has prompted the company to try 
and increase its capital. Originally the company announced that it would 
launch an ADR issue at the end of 1995. This issue has been delayed several 
times. 

 The company says it wants to raise about US Dollars 50m. Its international 
advisers have told it to hold off, despite the fact that the market for ADRs 
is buoyant. Instead the company is now planning a US Dollars 80m debt issue 
in the US.

 The company needs the money partly because of its capital expenditure plans 
and partly because it has international ambitions.

 Iansa is planning to add to its five Chilean plants (Curico, Linares, 
Chillan, Los Angeles and La Union) by buying Argentina's third largest sugar 
company (Ingenio San Martin del Tabacal). It is also interested in buying a 
sugar producer in Peru. 

 These acquisitions are in addition to its plans to build a maize syrup 
plant at Curico. Maize syrup is increasingly replacing sugar as the 
sweetener in soft drinks.

 Iansagro. Iansagro, which accounts for 16% of the group's total sales is 
expanding its business which currently revolves around providing 
agricultural services, especially technology, to beet sugar producers. 

 It is beefing up its operations by opening the first supermarket for 
agricultural products in the country. The fist supermarket will cost US 
Dollars 44m and the company expects to eventually roll out the concept 
throughout the country, if the first pilot store proves successful.

 Biomaster. The group's animal feed subsidiary also has ambitious plans. Its 
main business is providing food for sheep, pets and fish under the brands, 
Doko, Dokat, Cosetan, Melazan and Trucha.

 It is investing in a new US Dollars 10m plant to produce sheep food. It is 
also licensing technology from McCauley Bros from the US.

 Inasafrut & Iansa Peru. This part of the group plans to spend US Dollars 
25m this year on expanding its four plants. It also wants to move into the 
frozen food market and investigate the prospects for selling (and producing 
its) products in Brazil, Argentina and Peru.

 Still on track. According to Que Pasa, the company's business is still 
doing well. It pointed out that in the first quarter of the year profits 
increased by 23%.

 REGION: INFLATION

 As we warned last month the financial markets seem to have overreacted to 
some astute new management by the Mexican authorities. The markets paid the 
penalty for this in June when interest rates stopped falling and even backed 
up slightly, and the stockmarket and exchange rate had one of their rockiest 
periods this year. The markets were also rather annoyed that the inflation 
rate for May (at 1.8%, ostensibly a marked improvement on April), was at the 
top end of expectations. The big worry is food prices, which are beginning 
to rise as the effects of the drought start to hit supplies. Even the OECD 
is now reckoning that inflation this year will be 33%. Over the first five 
months of the year the CPI has risen by 13.5%. 

 Venezuela's inflation rate in May was even higher than April's. The 
government, though, does not seem too concerned, reckoning that the rate 
will subside sharply in the second half of the year. The accumulated rate 
for the first five months of the year is 52%. 

 Ecuador's inflation rate dropped into minus territory after hitting almost 
3% in April. In both Argentina and Brazil, inflation seems well under 
control. Argentina's rate for the first five months of the year is actually 
a fall of 0.7%. Brazil's is a modest 5.25%.

 REGION: INTEREST RATES

 After their sharp falls in April and May, cetes yields trod water for most 
of June, hovering around the 28% mark. This means that Mexican interest 
rates are barely positive. As we keep on saying, interest rates are close to 
being negative on independent forecasts (such as the OECD's) for inflation. 
The government is still reckoning on 22% for the year. 

 In Brazil interest rates started to fall quite sharply in June as inflation 
fears were dispelled and the government took a more relaxed view of the 
currency.

 REGION: EXCHANGE RATES

 The Mexican peso had a much rockier month. The currency which had actually 
appreciated against the dollar fell from 7.4 to 7.6 as investors began to 
fret that the US Federal Reserve Board might start to nudge short term 
interest rates higher. The US economy is clearly growing lustily and there 
is some evidence of tightness in some markets. If US short rates start to 
rise, foreign investors are likely to pull money out of riskier emerging 
markets and keep it closer to home where the yields are almost as good. Only 
when US yields are skimpy do they take a punt on emerging markets.

 PERU: PRIVATISATION: OIL SALES START: AND RESIDUAL TELEFONICA SHARES ON 
sale

 The government was delighted when Refinadores del Peru, a consortium headed 
by Spain's biggest oil company, Repsol, along with Yacimientos Petroliferos 
Fiscales from Argentina and Mobil from the US, won the auction for La 
Pampilla, the country's main oil refinery. This was the first substantial 
sale in the controversial privatisation of the assets of the state-owned oil 
company Petroperu.

 Repsol has a 45% stake in Refinadores. The consortium paid US Dollars 181m, 
well above the underbidder's offer (from Marven of Venezuela) of US Dollars 
166m. The minimum price fixed by the state for its 60% stake had been set at 
US Dollars 108m (of which US Dollars 38m could come in the form of debt 
paper). Besides paying the purchase price, Repsol has committed itself to 
investing a further US Dollars 50m and maintaining production at 102,000bpd. 
The company will take control of the refinery in August. 
 According to a former member of the board of Petroperu, Carlos Repetto, La 
Pampilla's accumulated debt at the end of 1995 was US Dollars 450m and this 
is likely to rise to US Dollars 600m by the end of this year. 

 Public sale. Daniel Hokama, the energy and mining minister, hinted that the 
government might sell its residual 40% stake in the La Pampilla refinery to 
the public through the stockmarket. 

 Hokama said that the world price for a refinery of La Pampilla's size was 
US Dollars 300m and the government had got US Dollars 180 for a 60% stake in 
it.  

 Oilfields. Simultaneous with the sale of La Pampilla was the sale of two 
concessions (blocs 8/8X near Talara and bloc 10 in the Amazonian jungle) 
owned by Petroperu. The 8/8X blocs hold 43m barrels of oil and the 
government set a minimum price of US Dollars 75m with a commitment to invest 
a further US Dollars 25m.

 The field was awarded to a consortium headed by Plus Petrol from Argentina 
with smaller stakes held by two Korean companies, Daewoo and Padco and a 
Canadian company, Yukon. The consortium paid US Dollars 142m for the field.  

 The first phase of Petroperu's privatisation occurred in 1992 when 78 of 
its petrol stations were sold and the company was broken up into bits that 
could be sold more easily.

 The parts that remain to be sold are Petrolube, the two main refiners are 
La Pampilla and Talara as well as the other two at Conchan and Iquitos and 
the oil pipeline. The oil pipeline, like the refinery at Iquitos, will be 
offered as a 20-year concession rather than completely sold.

 Telefonica. On 10 June the government then launched its international share 
offering for its residual stake in the telephone company, Telefonica del 
Peru. In February 1994, Telefonica de Espana bought 35% in each of the two 
state telephone companies (Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones and the 
Compania Peruana de Telefonos) for a total of US Dollars 2bn.

 The government's residual offering is designed to raise US Dollars 1.2bn. 
The government hopes to sell 50% of the shares in the US, 35% in Europe and 
the balance in Asia and Latin America.

 The government holds a residual stake of 28.6%, but it only wants to sell 
23% of its shares. It is also embarking on an ambitious programme to boost 
local shareholdings in the company.

 Tell Sid. In the first week of June, before the international marketing 
effort started, 20,000 individual Peruvians placed orders for shares. The 
government had hoped to interest a total of between 60,000 and 80,000 
Peruvians and raise US Dollars 200m. It looks as though these targets will 
be beaten.

 On 10 June, the government started its marketing programme to institutional 
investors in Peru. These investors range from the pension funds to insurance 
companies and  corporate and individual investors who place orders of at 
least 20,000 soles (US Dollars 8,300). The government has pencilled in 
takings of US Dollars 50m from institutional investors.

 The government has high hopes of building on the initial success of the 
telephone sale to promote shareholding to retail investors. Prime minister 
Alberto Pandolfi said he hoped there would be 400,000 individual 
sharehodlers in privatised companies by 1998.

 Proceeds: The Peruvian government said that it had received US Dollars 
4.6bn from privatisation between 1993 until the sale of La Pampilla. In 
addition, the new owners of companies had promised to invest a further US 
Dollars 5bn. The government reckons that it will raise a further US Dollars 
4.6bn from sales this year and next. 

 Fishmeal: Pescaperu, the state-owned fishing company, is selling six 
fishmeal factories and three fishoil refineries for at least US Dollars 40m. 
The company began issuing prospectuses at the end of May. Potential 
purchasers will have to put 40% down but can pay the rest in quarterly 
payments for two and half years plus an interest rate of 2% over six-month 
Libor. 

 Gold: The government says that it will sell the Quicay gold deposit, 
belonging to the state-owned Centromin, in mid-July. The minimum price is US 
Dollars 5m. The deposit holds a minimum of 3m ounces of ore with an average 
gold content of 0.3g a tonne. 

 Shougang: The government is holding talks with the Chinese company which 
bought HierroPeru about investment plans. Shougang has failed to meet the 
terms of the agreement it signed when it bought  HierroPeru in 1993. 
Shougang had promised to invest US Dollars 150m in two years, but did not do 
so by the end of 1995. The government said that it cannot take action 
against Shougang because the contract did not allow for it. Shougang has 
apprently offered to invest US Dollars 300m in a new pellets factory, which 
will also be able to handle copper.

 BRAZIL: CVRD: SOLD AS ONE: SAYS BNDES PRESIDENT

 Luis Carlos Mendoza de Barros, president of the Banco Nacional de 
Desenvolvimento Economico, said the country's biggest mining company, 
Companhia Vale Do Rio Doce, would not be broken up before it was privatised. 
The company, which is currently composed of 40 subsidiaries, is likely to 
fetch around US Dollars 12bn. 

 Mendoza de Barros said the government had now dropped the idea of selling 
the company in parts because so many of its subsidiaries had complementary 
activities.

 He also told the senate committee, before whom he was testifying, that the 
government would ensure CVRD's main rivals and customers in the iron ore 
business would be barred from bidding. CVRD is the world's biggest producer 
of iron ore and Latin America's biggest gold producer. 

 Although mining is its main activity, the company also controls transport 
systems, especially railways, roads and shipping, power stations and is 
involved in the lumbering industry. 

 Cellular: The communications minister, Sergio Motta, announced that the 
state-owned companies offering cellular services would start to be 
privatised from 1997. He said that the companies which used Band A would be 
lumped into between seven and 10 regional groupings and then sold. 

 The minister said that companies bidding for Band B wavelengths in specific 
areas would also have to bid for the local Band A company. 

 He also said the state-owned telecoms company would be privatised by the 
end of President Cardoso's mandate. This ends on 31 December 1998. 

 Maracana: The state government in Rio de Janeiro has put the famous 
Maracana soccer stadium up for sale. It is offering the stadium, which costs 
US Dollars 10m a year to run, on a 30-year concession. It has advertising 
receipts of around US Dollars 7m a year and collects US Dollars 120,000 in 
ticket sales from the derbies between Flemingo and Fluminense. The stadium 
is built to take 180,000 spectators but its capacity has recently been 
limited to 120,000. The state government reckons that the new management 
will have to spend between US Dollars 60m and US Dollars 70m on remodelling 
the stadium which was built in 1950. 

 Light: A consortium headed by Electricite de France in partnership with AES 
and Houston Power Industries bought control of Light, the electricity 
distribution company for the state of Rio de Janeiro. The government sold 
60% of the shares for US Dollars 2.2bn, the minimum set by the government. 
The consortium bought a 34% stake while 20% was bought by Brazilian groups 
and 6% was left unsold. 

 The government must be relieved to have sold Light. It had tried to sell it 
three times previously, but had been thwarted by potential investors' 
worries about litigation over the way the company adjusted bills in the era 
of hyper-inflation. 

 Initially the company was valued at US Dollars 3.7bn. Even at the new 
price, potential bidders, notably Chilectra, thought the price was too high 
for 60% of the shares in the company. 

 Telecoms: The Americas Telecom 96 trade fair in Rio de Janeiro has drawn 
360 equipment manufacturers. This is a substantial increase on the numbers 
attending the two previous fairs in 1988 and 1992, and organisers say this 
reflects the increased international interest in the industry in the region.

 Brazil's telecoms market, which becomes properly free in 1998, is worth 
around US Dollars 30bn a year. Thanks to a constitutional amendment passed 
last year, foreign companies will now be allowed to supply services such as 
cellular phones. Previously the state had a monopoly.

 According to the Union Internacional de Telecomunicaciones, which organises 
the trade fair, Brazil will go from having 14m conventional telephones and 
2m cellular phones in 1995 to 40m conventional telephones and 17m cellular 
phones by 2003. 

 In Argentina, where the privatisation of telecommunications is virtually 
concluded, the country has 20 lines per 100 people. In Brazil the figure is 
12.

 Venezuela: Elia Ynati, president of the Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana, 
said that the aluminium industry would be put up for sale in November. He 
said that three companies had already expressed an interest in buying the 
companies in which the CVG is the principal shareholder. The state-owned 
aluminium companies have debts of US Dollars 1.3bn, of which about half is 
owed to foreign banks.

 El Salvador: Morgan Stanley and Citibank have won the contract to advise 
the government on the sale of the telecoms company, Administracion Nacional 
de Telecomunicaciones (Antel). The government has agreed a fee of 0.74% with 
the two banks, which will design and market the privatisation. The sale is 
controversial since the company is profitable and its 6,000 workers say 
their jobs are at risk if the company is privatised.

 Mexico: The government has been forced to delay its sale of the 
petrochemical plants. The delay has been caused by a range of factors: legal 
conflicts, pressure from the opposition and from oilworkers. The government 
had hoped to raise US Dollars 2bn from the sale of the petrochemicals 
industry.

 Privatisation under the current administration has been slow: only the four 
port terminals have been sold for US Dollars 165m. 

 The government is now trying to drum up interest in the railways. There are 
32 foreign companies interested in buying bits of the system which loses 
around US Dollars 140m a year.

 Paraguay: The IMF's managing director met trade unionists who said that he 
believed privatisation should be more flexible. Unions had held a general 
strike to protest against the sale of the steel company, Acepar. The 
government, which has sold only two state companies to date, is currently 
trying to sell the Flota Mercante Paraguaya.

 MEXICO: DEBT PAGE:PREPAYING THE US: US DOLLARS 4.7BN

 Mexico has prepaid almost half the money it borrowed from the US ahead of 
schedule. On 19 June the government announced that it had prepaid US Dollars 
4.7bn the previous day. 

 The Mexican government borrowed a total of US Dollars 12.5bn from the US. 
The US had offered a credit line of up to US Dollars 20bn.

 The Mexican government said that it had borrowed some of the money it used 
to repay the US from a syndicate of international banks headed by JP Morgan 
and Swiss Bank Corporation. The Mexican government said that the new loan 
was significantly cheaper than the money provided by the US and also had a 
longer maturity: 10 years instead of three and a half. Mexican officials 
reckoned that refinancing the loans from the US Treasury will save the 
country around US Dollars 50m a year in interest payments. 

 Over the first five months of the year Mexico has been a heavy borrower 
from the international capital markets. It has borrowed a total of US 
Dollars 7.4bn, bankers say.

 Mexico's total debt at the end of the first quarter was US Dollars 172bn. 
On some calculations Mexico's foreign  debt service burden this year is the 
equivalent of 14.5% of GDP. In 1995 it was 9.5% and in 1994 6%. 

 Eugenia Correa, a researcher at the economics faculty at the Universidad 
Autonoma de Mexico, reckons that the equivalent of 24% of GDP is being spent 
on sorting out the country's debt problems. This takes into account bank 
debts, domestic debt, and foreign debt. In dollar terms, she claims that 
this figure is US Dollars 73bn.

 Oil security. The new money does apparently have a hidden cost. Just as the 
US loan was secured against Mexican oil receipts so is (reportedly) the JP 
Morgan/Swiss Bank Corporation deal. Until the US-led rescue package last 
year, Mexico had refused to pledge its oil receipts. 

 The Mexican government though claims that there is no pledge over oil 
receipts and that the loan in fact gives Mexico greater freedom to use its 
oil revenues. 

 Cuba: The Cuban government is the latest in the region to admit that it 
needs to do something about its foreign debt. It owes US Dollars 9bn. Unlike 
other countries in the region Cuba is not a member of the IDB, the IMF or 
the World Bank and therefore does not have access to cheap credit to help to 
set up a debt reduction deal. 

 According to figures issued by the Banco Nacional de Cuba, the country's 
foreign debt at the end of 1995 stood at US Dollars 9.1bn, or US Dollars 
500m more than at the end of 1994. 

 Although European countries  account for the bulk of the country's debt, 
Argentina is also a major creditor, owed US Dollars 1.3bn. According to 
central bank officials, the US Dollars 9bn figure does not include the 
country's debts to the former Soviet Union and other Comecon countries. 
These debts are said to be large and unquantifiable. 

 Cuba stopped paying its foreign dent in 1986 as part of a campaign led by 
Fidel Castro to protest against the high cost of servicing foreign debts. 

 Cuba is now trying to build bridges with its creditors. It has held talks 
with banks and banking authorities in Japan, Spain, France and Britain. 
Bankers say that the talks have been wide ranging, including ideas such as 
debtswaps. 

 Cuba's inability to tap the international capital markets means that it has 
been forced into short term loans to finance its sugar crop. It is said to 
have borrowed US Dollars 300m to finance the 1995/96 crop which has barely 
hit the production target of 4.5m t. The danger of missing the target is 
that Cuba will be unable to sell as much sugar as it hoped on the 
international market. It has swaps with China and Russia to satisfy first. 

 Honduras: Eduardo Villanueva, fiscal for cultural affairs, claims that 
according to some optimistic researchers, the San Roque galleon which sank 
off Honduras in 1606 has enough gold and silver on it to clear the country's 
foreign debt. He said that the country should take special care of these 
rich shipwrecks. The San Roque was the flagship of a treasure fleet and 
apparently held 180 boxes of gold and silver coins; 250 silver bars and 100 
gold bars. The government says that it has located the site of the wreck. 
The site is believed to be close to the Bay Islands. 

 IDB: The IDB has made its first ever loan to the private sector to help 
finance a 2,180 metre tunnel through the El Corvocado mountain in Rio de 
Janeiro. The borrower is OAS, which has won the concession for a 15km 
Amarelo underground line.

 HONDURAS: THE GRAINS PROBLEM: FROM EXPORTER TO IMPORTER

 The President, Roberto Reina, has approved an emergency plan to deal with 
the scarcity of staple grains. The core of the plan involves setting up a 
committee, headed by Guatama Fonsea, a member of congress for the ruling 
Partido Liberal.  

 The country has had problems with growing its own staple foods for the past 
couple of years, following  changes introduced by the previous government of 
Rafael Callejas which its opponents say encouraged local producers to export 
rather than sell in the local market. Last year the harvest increased by 
1.9% but demand grew by 3.5%, the government said. The grains tend to go to 
neighbouring countries (El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua) where local 
prices are higher than those in the Honduran market. 

 Already the government has had to import 1,500t of beans (at a cost of US 
Dollars 1m) from Canada. The government has set aside US Dollars 5m to buy 
staples (beans, maize and wheat) from international markets. 

 Maquila. The government and the textile industry is beefing up its campaign 
to stop the US penalising goods made in Honduras because of the bleak labour 
conditions at textile factories in Honduras. Last month it sent a mission to 
testify to the US Senate headed by the economy minister, Fernando Garcia and 
Cecilio Zavala, the labour minister.

 Honduran industrialists say that Charles Keraghan, head of the human rights 
committee of the National Labor Commission is behind the lurid, usually 
televised, 'investigative' programmes about textile maquilas in Honduras and 
the rest of Central America. Textile producers in the region claim that the 
US textile industry, which just wants to use maquilas for bits of the 
clothes-making process, is behind the campaign. They say that the US 
industry wants to prevent a textile industry, using non-US raw materials, 
developing in Central America. 

 The industry is important. It employs between 60,000 and 70,000 people, 
mostly in Korean and Taiwanese factories around San Pedro Sula in the north 
of the country. Textile exports were worth US Dollars 186m to Honduras last 
year and are likely to grow to US Dollars 220m this year.

 NICARAGUA: INFLATION PICKS UP: BUT ECONOMY ON COURSE, ACCORDING TO CENTRAL 
bank

 The president of the central bank, Evenor Taboada, said that although 
inflation picked up in May, the economy was doing rather well. He said that 
the government had more than met the targets it set itself of increasing 
reserves, increasing public sector deposits at the central bank and getting 
the private banks to finance this year's crop. 

 Taboada blamed the increase in inflation on an increase in the price of 
perishables. This pressure would ebb, he said, in the second half of the 
year.

 The pressure here will come from the politicians as the country gears up 
for the presidential elections scheduled for 20 October. It now seems likely 
that all 22 candidates will be ruled eligible by the Consejo Supremo 
Electoral: there had been allegations of unfitness made against five of 
them, including three of the key candidates, Arnoldo Aleman, the former 
mayor of Managua, Daniel Ortega, the former Sandinista president and Antonio 
Lacayo, the current President's son-in-law. Opinion polls suggest Aleman is 
currently leading.

 PANAMA: GROWTH STEADY: BUT SHRIMPS IMPROVE

 The economy grew by 3% in the first quarter of this year, but most 
independent economists expect the rate to fall back to between 1% and 2% for 
the year, because of the complicated political situation. 

 Economic statistics in the country are easily distorted: bananas account 
for half of the country's total agricultural output. Exports for the first 
four months of the year were 11.6m boxes, up 2.7% on the same period of 
1995. Meat production is just holding its own: in the first three months of 
the year 70,126 head of cattle were slaughtered. This was virtually the same 
number as in the first quarter of 1995. Shrimp production on the other hand 
is doing well. In the first two months of the year it was 13% up on the same 
period of 1995. 

 Although the consumption of electricity in the first quarter at 956m KW 
hours was 9% above the level for the same period of 1995, the industrial 
consumption index, at 128, was only two points above the level of the 
previous year. Construction, though, seems to be doing well. The issuance of 
licences was worth US Dollars 77m in the first quarter: that is 10% more 
than for the first quarter of 1995. 

 Canal traffic was also healthy in the first quarter. It was 57.8m t or 5.3% 
more than for the same period of 1995. The free-zone in Colon though is 
seeing lower volumes of re-exports. 

 What is depressing, though, is retail sales. At US Dollars 212m for the 
first two months of the year, these were 13% below 1995's figures. Tourism 
on the other hand was up by 50% at 72,000.

 The government is running a growing deficit. Spending in February was 26% 
up on the comparable month of 1995 at US Dollars 267m. Revenues were 2% up 
at US Dollars 210m.

 Although unemployment remains comparatively high at 14% (for February) this 
actually represents an improvement on the figure for the comparable months 
of 1995.

 PARAGUAY: DEFICIT PROBLEM: WARNS IMF

 The IMF says that the government must take action to lower the fiscal 
deficit if the country's economic prospects are to improve. The Fund says 
that it fears a renewed upsurge in inflation in Paraguay if the public 
sector deficit is not brought under cotrol swiftly.

 The Fund reckons that dealing with the problem should not be too difficult. 
It says that the increase in public spending this year is largely due to 
higher personnel costs. According to the fund, the public sector's personnel 
costs have doubled over the past six years and amounted to 8.5% of GDP in 
1995.

 The Fund also notes that some of the increase in public spending has been 
due to sorting out the financial system. It reckons that the bulk of the 
money has now been spent and that the recently approved banking law should 
start to settle things down again.

 TRINIDAD & TOBAGO: WRITING OFF: MOST OF THE LOANS TO GUYANA

 The government has decided, to the fury of the opposition, to write off 
most of the US Dollars 536m debt Guyana has run up with Trinidad & Tobago. 
The government has decided to write off US Dollars 357m and reschedule 
repayment of the remaining US Dollars 179m over 23 years. 

 Keith Rowley, from the opposition People's National Movement says that the 
write off is unnecessary: he would have preferred the debt to have been 
swapped for some of Guyana's forestry, rice fields or gold mining 
concessions.

 The government said that it was bound by the terms of the Paris Club 
meeting which it attended (and where it found itself to be Guyana's biggest 
creditor, above the US, Britain, Holland, Germany, France, Norway and 
Denmark). Trinidad started to lend large amounts to Guyana in the late 1970s 
and early 1980s when it was flush with oil revenues. 

 Neal & Massy. The stockmarket was surprised at the end of May at the 
decision by Neal and Massy's management to take provisions of T&T Dollars 
100m against a restructuring of the conglomerate. The company is closing or 
selling most of its lossmaking divisions to raise money to reduce 
borrowings.

 The company which is a major conglomerate operating in both Trinidad and 
Jamaica, has been under pressure for the past three years since it bought T. 
Geddes Grant. Stockbrokers say that it failed to integrate this company 
(which had companies in several of Neal and Massy's businesses) and allowed 
debt to balloon to nearly T&T Dollars 800m.

 URUGUAY: CONSTRUCTION PLANS: AND SCANDALS

 The president of the Camara de la Construcccion de Uruguay, Ignacio Otegui, 
has asked the government to take measures to reduce the red-tape which he 
says is preventing the industry from recovering. The construction industry, 
traditionally one of the engines of the economy, has been in recession for 
the past 18 months or so. 

 In 1995 the construction industry contracted by 15% as Argentine investment 
in Uruguay dried up. Since the end of the year the industry has continued to 
decline, throwing around 1,500 people out of work a month. 

 Otegui wants the government just to get on with the projects that have been 
already authorised. He said that announcing new projects or increased 
investment would not be as helpful as simply signing contracts and getting 
authorised projects moving.

 Otegui said that currently the industry reckons that it takes between eight 
and 12 months for prices, tendering systems and subcontracting arrangements 
to be agreed on projects for the public sector. 

 Inflation: In May prices rose by 2.1%, bringing the figure for the first 
five months of the year to 10.8%. More encouraging is the wholesale price 
index. It rose by just 1% in May and is currently registering 26% for the 
past 12 months. Although farm food prices fell by almost 2% as meat and wool 
prices dropped, processed food prices actually rose. This reflects the 
increase in grain and oilseeds prices. 

 Opinion polls: Support for President Julio Maria Sanguinetti hit a new low 
in May, according to a poll for the daily El Observador. It found that only 
18% of Uruguayans thought he was doing well, while 50% thought he was doing 
a poor job. The main criticism of his policies was economic: respondents 
complained of not being able to find jobs and of the sharp increases in 
prices. 

 Scandal: Ramifications from the Focoex scandal seem to be spreading. At the 
heart of the scandal are allegations that members of the former Lacalle 
government misused a US Dollars 200m line of credit from Spain to pay 
extortionate prices for basic goods. A congressional committee has already 
been set up to investigate the accusations which are being led by Leonardo 
Nicolini from the left wing opposition, the Frente Amplio. He has already 
suffered counter-suits for libel and damages from those he has accused of 
corruption.

 The allegations of corruption started nine months ago. The latest people to 
be tarred by the allegations are a former presidential secretary, Pablo 
Garcia Pintos, a former president of Obras Sanitarias del Estado, Villanueva 
Saravia, a former transport minister (who is currently a member of congress) 
Juan Carlos Raffo, and a former economy minister and central bank president, 
Enrique Braga. Braga has already disproved allegations that there were 
irregularities in the way a bank was sold during his time in office.

 BRAZIL: COFFEE: WHY THE DROP IN EXPORTS MAY BE STRUCTURAL: RATHER THAN JUST 
temporary

 The world's biggest coffee producer, Brazil, reports that its coffee 
exports in the first four months of the year were the lowest for five years 
at 2.27m bags. This was 37.5% down on the comparable period of 1995.

 Most analysts attribute the fall to the problems caused by the frosts in 
the winter of 1994. These cut the crop in 1994/1995 to 12.5m bags and the 
1995/1996 crop to 14m bags. The expectation though is for a much bigger crop 
in 1996/97, which is currently on the trees. 

 The official forecast is for a crop of 28m bags. Independent analysts go 
for 25m bags. 

 Important though the frost damage is, it could be masking a structural 
change in the Brazilian coffee industry. As Oswaldo Aranha, president of the 
Federacao Brasileira dos Exportadores do Cafe, said, another reason for the 
fall in Brazilian exports has been that domestic prices for coffee are now 
higher than the international price. This has led, he said, to a shift from 
exports to the domestic market. 

 Indeed the domestic market is recovering strongly. In 1995, thanks to the 
real plan which helped restore Brazilians' purchasing power, domestic 
consumption of coffee increased by 9%. This bucked the world trend of lower 
coffee consumption. 

 In 1995 world demand for coffee dropped from 96.6m (60kg) bags to 93.2m. In 
the US, the world's biggest consumer, coffee consumption dropped by 6%.

 Interestingly, the increase in Brazilian consumption is not a one-off. 
Consumption has been growing steadily since it fell to 2.3kg a head in 1980. 
A decade earlier it had been 4.6kg. In 1995 consumption was just under 3kg a 
head. US consumption is 4kg a head. 

 If the current trend continues in Brazil, the domestic coffee market could 
be using about 15m bags a year by the end of century, up from its current 
consumption of 10m bags. Even now coffee traders say that Brazil might have 
to import more coffee to meet domestic demand since the 14m bag (1995/96) 
crop plus the 7m bags in store will not be enough to both meet export 
commitments and keep the domestic market supplied. 

 The Asociacao Brasileira de la Industria do Cafe reckons that if domestic 
consumption does increase to 15m bags a year, the country's coffee crop will 
have to be 35m bags. 

 Exports. The dismal figure for exports in April, (512,468 bags) meant that 
Brazil's exports have now been below 1m bags for seven months in a row.

 The country has exported only half of its quota granted by the Association 
of Coffee Producing Countries. The quota is supposed to compel countries to 
hold back 20% of their production from the market in an effort to drive up 
international prices.

 The fall in export volumes (and the weak international price) has 
diminished export revenues. In April, revenues were a mere US Dollars 82m 
compared with US Dollars 185m in April 1995. In the first four months of the 
year export revenues were US Dollars 331m, compared with US Dollars 641m in 
the same period of 1995. 

 Colombia: The Colombian coffee crop has been badly damaged by heavy rains. 
The Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros now says that the country expects a 
crop of 10.6m bags for the year starting in June 1996. Originally Colombia 
had forecast a crop of 12.5m bags.

 In 1995, the country exported 9.8m bags, 17% less than in 1994. Revenues 
were US Dollars 1.9bn. 

 Mexico: The country now expects a crop of 4.7m bags. It says that it will 
export 3.8m to North America.

 Honduras: Although the Instituto Hondureno del Cafe expects the 1995/96 
crop to have increased from 2.5m (40kg) bags to 3.2m it does not expect 
revenues to follow suit. In fact it expects them to fall from last year's US 
Dollars 320m to around US Dollars 300m. 

 Nicaragua: Alvaro Velazquez, from the Comision Nicarag***uense del Cafe 
says that the country should be able to sell all of its exportable coffee 
from the next (1996/97) crop. He expects the country to harvest 792,000 
(60kg) bags and to be able to export 707,100 (60kg) bags. He says that the 
quota given by the ACPC was equal to total production. At current prices 
that volume of exports would produce US Dollars 110m in revenues. 

 Dominican Republic: The country expects to export 574,752 (40kg) bags in 
1995/96. This will earn around US Dollars 56m according to Jose Antonio 
Martinez from the Comision Nacional del Cafe at the agriculture ministry.

 Quotas: Brazil has been awarded a quota of 15m bags by the ACPC for the 
year starting in July 1996. Colombia has a quota of 10.65m bags. The ACPC is 
trying to get both Mexico and Guatemala to sign up. On 15 June, Central 
America, Ecuador and Colombia asked for their quotas to be modified. They 
want to move 254,000 bags from the first to the second half of the year. 
Colombia wants to move 100,000 bags from the final quarter of this year to 
the first of next year in order to match its production to its quota.

 Ecuador: The country's coffee revenues more than halved in the first four 
months of 1996, compared with the same period of 1995. They dropped from US 
Dollars 46m to US Dollars 22m. The fall in coffee revenues was paralleled by 
falls in revenues from oil, wood and shrimps. Yet overall the country's 
export revenues rose in the first four months of the year to US Dollars 
1.46bn from US Dollars 1.44bn in the same period of 1995. The main increase 
was in manufactures, which rose from US Dollars 267m in the first third of 
1995 to US Dollars 309m in the same period of 1996.

 ARGENTINA: AGRICULTURE: ON THE UP: LAND PRICES JUMP BY 30%

 Falling grain production in the US and a drop in supplies from the EU 
coupled with increased demand from Asia has led to a jump in land prices in 
Argentina. Land agents say that the price of arable land has jumped by 
between 30% and 50% over the past eight months.

 According to land agents the price of land suitable for wheat in the 
province of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, Santa Fe and Cordoba) has jumped from 
between US Dollars 1,000 and US Dollars 1,500 a hectare eight months ago to 
US Dollars 2,500 and US Dollars 3,500 now. Rents have also increased: they 
have gone up from US Dollars 100 a month in the Pampas to US Dollars 150. 

 The increase in prices follows the surge in wheat prices: these have gone 
from US Dollars 150 a tonne in May 1995 to just under US Dollars 200. 
Meanwhile maize prices have jumped from US Dollars 100 to US Dollars 172 a 
tonne. Soya has also jumped from an average of US Dollars 190 a tonne to US 
Dollars 275. 

 Raquel Camino, from the Centro de la Industria Aceitera de Argentina says 
that the increase in land prices reflects the effect of the Uruguay round 
which has cut the export subsidies farmers in the US and the EU used to 
enjoy. Coupled with poor weather (notably drought in the US), prices have 
risen sharply. 

 Even the beef crisis in Europe has helped to increase grain prices. Poultry 
and pigs eat more maize and soya than cows.

 Argentine officials expect the country to harvest 60m t of grain this year 
and export revenues to top US Dollars 7.5bn. Of these US Dollars 5bn will 
come from the export of oilseeds (principally soya and sunflowers).

 Some investors have already done well. George Soros, the man who forced 
sterling out of the EMS and whose aggressive shorting of the copper market 
may have prompted Sumitomo to crystallise a US Dollars 1.8bn loss, bought 
350,000 hectares of Argentine land 18 months ago. 

 The government says that the strong grain prices have led to increased 
demand for fertilisers and agricultural machinery.

 Downside. The downside to the delight of arable farmers is the grim 
position of stock farmers. They have been hit by the worldwide fall in 
demand for beef following the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) scare 
in Europe.  

 This problem with BSE has offset the benefits Argentina has won by being 
declared free of foot-and-mouth disease, which had limited its exports. 

 Humberto Volando, president of the Federacion Agraria Argentina, the forum 
for small farmers, said that lots of small farmers were getting rid of their 
animals and switching to growing crops. 

 Wool: Sheep farmers in the south of Argentina say that the country's wool 
production will drop by 30% because of the effect of a drought. 

 Bananas: Banana revenues in the first four months of the year increased to 
US Dollars 317m from US Dollars 308m in the same period if 1995. Export 
volumes fell by 6% (compared with April 1995) to 349,160t. Revenues in April 
though were up from US Dollars 79m to US Dollars 84m.   

 Fishing: The Chilean government has reaffirmed its support for the New York 
Agreement on deep sea rights. Chile has the world's fourth biggest fishing 
industry and the sector's exports last year were worth US Dollars 1.7bn. Of 
that 88% was generated by fishmeal. The agreement will give Chile the right 
to vet deep sea fishing vessels which catch fish that generally come inside 
Chile's 200 mile limit. 

 Fishing industry executives are less keen on the agreement because in 
return for the right to vet vessels outside the 200 mile zone, Chile will 
lose exclusive rights over its own zone. It will also come under pressure to 
allow foreign vessels to use its ports. 

 Chile has already taken a strong line on factory ships fishing for horse 
mackerel and hake. The number of such ships has been cut from 120 in 1991 to 
just 18 now, thanks to its licensing system. 

 Sugar: The Cuban sugar crop is still creeping towards the official target 
of 4.5m t. At the end of May production stood at 4.4m t. The government said 
that it was happy to have increased production by a third and has set a 
target of 5m t for 1996/97. Officials say financing for this crop has 
already been arranged: this will allow increased imports of fertilisers and 
other inputs. President Fidel Castro said that the country had borrowed US 
Dollars 300m for the last harvest and had to pay an interest  bill of US 
Dollars 50m for the privilege.

 MEXICO: OIL: PRODUCTION UP BY 7% IN FIRST THIRD: EXPORT PRICES INCREASED

 The state oil company, Pemex, reported that its production in the first 
four months of the year was 6.5% higher than for the same period of 1995. 
The company said that it produced an average of 2.79m bpd of oil. 

 The company said that its average production of heavy oil was 1.34m bpd 
while production of light Isthmus oil ran at 922,000bpd and extra light 
Olmeca at 582,000bpd.

 The country's main oilfield remains the Campeche Basin. It accounted for 
2.06m bpd of the total production. The southern production area (Tabasco and 
Chiapas) generated 634,000bpd while the northern production area produced 
96,000bpd. 

 Exports. The company said that its exports averaged 1.5m bpd. average daily 
exports were 837,400bpd of heavy Maya crude; 185,800bpd of Isthmus and 
480,300bpd of Olmeca. 

 At the beginning of June, the company increased the price of its oil sold 
in the US and Europe but reduced the price of its heavy crude exported to 
the Far East. 

 One constraint on exports, according to Cristian Javelly, the deputy 
manager for international marketing at Pemex, is the company's shortage of 
storage capacity. He said that the company would build two natural gas 
storage facilities in the south of the country.

 Gas. Pemex's gas production in the first third of the year was 4.247bn 
cubic feet a day. This was 17% up on the same period of 1995. The bulk of 
the gas production was in the southern production area which produced 2bn 
cubic feet a day. The Sonda de Campeche produced 1.5bn cubic feet a day 
while the northern zone produced 609m cubic feet a day.

 Politics. The clericalist opposition party, the Partido Accion Nacional, is 
putting pressure on the government to take a tough line on offshore oil 
reserves in the north of the Gulf of Mexico. The PAN wants the government to 
declare that its territorial waters extend for 200 miles. 

 The issue has suddenly become important because Shell, Amoco, Mobil and 
Texaco have all started to drill exploratory wells in an area that could be 
claimed by Mexico. The foreign ministry is playing down the issue saying 
that the wells appear to lie beyond Mexican territorial waters, though they 
could be tapping Mexican oilfields.

 The issue of territorial waters has been left on the back burner since 
1976, when the US Senate refused to recognise Mexico's decision to increase 
its territorial waters to 200 miles. This issue has now become tricky 
because studies by Shell and the other oil companies reckon that the dispute 
area could hold between 5bn and 22bn barrels of oil and 45 trillion cubic 
feet of natural gas.

 A PAN senator, Angel Conchelo, said that Mexico could be entitled to 75% of 
this oil. The fact that the oil companies are drilling to depths of 7,625ft, 
suggests that they may well be tapping into fields which lie predominantly 
in Mexican territory. 

 Tabasco: The government has said that only 9% of the left-wing opposition 
Partido de la Revolucion Democratica's claims of environmental damage done 
by the oil industry in Tabasco are true. The PRD had lodged 19,766 protests. 

 The protests had led to the blockading of 20 oil wells in January and 
February. In order to end the unrest both the government and the PRD agreed 
to abide by the judgment of a committee composed of officials from the 
energy, environment, agriculture, agricultural reform and communications 
ministries and the Comision Nacional del Agua and the Procuraduria Federal 
de Proteccion al Ambiente y los Asuntos Agarios.

 The government has yet to say what action it will take over the protests it 
considers to be justified.

 PERU: GAS: CAMISEA: BACK ON

 The government says that it has reached an agreement with Shell and Mobil 
to develop the Camisea gas deposit. This was discovered by Shell in 1983, 
but its development has been in abeyance since then because of its 
remoteness and the previous government's hostility to foreign investment. 

 Some points of the deal remain unclear. The foreign companies will invest 
between US Dollars 2.7bn and US Dollars 2.8bn to develop the deposit. Their 
concession will last for 40 years.

 What is still not clear is what will happen to the gas. The Peruvian 
government says that the country will now become a net hydrocarbons 
exporter. Yet Shell is not absolutely committed to building a gas pipeline, 
either to Lima or to Bolivia to connect to the Bolivian-Brazilian natural 
gas pipeline. Indeed the Shell-Mobil consortium is only committed to 
spending US Dollars 200m over the next two years to drill three exploratory 
wells. The development phase of the project only starts in 1998 and is 
budgeted at US Dollars 2.5bn. Yet without a pipeline, it is hard to see the 
foreign companies investing such amounts.  

 Camisea contains, according to official figures, 12.2bn cubic feet of 
natural gas and 610m barrels of gas liquids. This is worth, oilmen say, 
about US Dollars 70bn. 

 Camisea's oil reserves are equivalent to 2.2bn barrels, or seven times 
Peru's current reserves.
Output. The country's oil output in May, at 3.7m barrels (119,345bpd), was 
6% below the figure for May 1995. Overall in the first five months of the 
year production was 5% down on the same period of 1995 at 17.9m (or 
117,763bpd). Occidental is the biggest single oil producer in Peru 
contributing 1.66m barrels. It is followed by the recently sold bloc 8 which 
pumped 776,841 barrels. 

 Gas production is also down in the first five months at 3,758m cubic feet. 
This is 7.4% down on the same period of 1995.

 ECUADOR: OIL: HOLDING STEADY: BUT NO EFFECT FROM HIGHER PRICES

 Ecuador has not benefitted from the higher-than-expected oil prices in the 
first half of the year. In the first four months of the year, its oil export 
revenues actually fell, though by only US Dollars 2m to US Dollars 464m. 

 This was despite a 4% increase in oil production in the first quarter of 
the year to 35.4m barrels (389,000bpd). Petroecuador, the state oil company, 
produces 81% of the country's oil. Around 60% of Ecuador's oil production is 
exported. 

 The only month which seemed to have benefitted from the higher price was 
March where revenues reached US Dollars 124m, the highest since October 
1995. 

 The government announced that it would invest US Dollars 418m in the 
modernisation of the oil industry. Of this US Dollars 100m will go on 
increasing the capacity of the main TransEcuadorean pipeline from 350,000bpd 
to 380,000bpd. 

 The expansion of the Esmeraldas oil refinery (from 90,000bpd to 110,000bpd) 
will cost US Dollars 180m. Of that US Dollars 77m will be spent in the 
current year.

 The government is also spending US Dollars 2m on producing unleaded fuel. 
It reckons that this investment should be enough to meet the entire domestic 
demand. 

 The government is also embarking upon a US Dollars 72m project to increase 
gas production from the Amazon fields. The government has also agreed a deal 
with Energy Development Corporation for the exploration and production of 
gas in the Gulf of Guayaquil. The country has been trying to do such a deal 
to develop the gas resources in the Gulf for 25 years. 

 EDC is committed to spend US Dollars 45m over four years to explore for 
gas. The government offered a concession to a consortium in 1968 but this 
was suspended in 1972. Northwest Energy was awarded a concession in 1974 but 
this lapsed after five years when the government reckoned that Northwest had 
not met the terms of the contract. BHP King Ranch thought it had won a 
concession in 1995, but this was struck out by the Consejo para la 
Evaluacion de Licitaciones.  

 Court case: The Frente de la Defensa de la Amazonia has warned President 
Sixto Duran-Ballen to stay out of the court case it has started in New York 
against Texaco. The Frente is suing Texaco for the environmental damage it 
is alleged to have done to the Amazon during the period it produced oil 
there. 

 Texaco has told the court that the Ecuadorean government does not believe 
that it damaged the environment. The judge has asked the Ecuadorean 
government whether this is so: it has yet to reply, but if it supports 
Texaco, the judge says that he would be minded to throw out the case. 

 Last year Texaco promised the government that it would clean up the Amazon 
areas in which it had been operating. The Frente (and other independent 
organisations such as Greenpeace) say that the work Texaco has promised to 
do will not make-up for the environmental damage it has wrought.  

 The Frente initially sought US Dollars 1.5bn in damages, but it has now 
dropped this to US Dollars 800m. 

 Bolivia: Hydrocarbon production increased by 12% in the first quarter to 
30,131bpd, according to the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica. The INE said 
that the country's total production in 1995 was 2.43m barrels (which was 
enough to meet domestic demand). This year it is forecasting that production 
will increase to 2.74m barrels.

 The INE also noted that production from fields operated by the state oil 
company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos, fell by 9% to an 
average of 18,570bpd. The Vibora field in the north of the country is the 
YPFB's most productive field, producing 5,321bpd. 

 The good news is that private contractors increased their output by 77% in 
the first quarter to 11,561bpd. The biggest oilfield in the country, Surubi, 
which is operated by Maxus, a subsidiary of Argentina's YPF. This field 
produced 9,335bpd.   

 Venezuela: Congress has approved the contracts won by the successful 
bidders in the January auction for deep fields of light and medium crudes. 
The winning groups (LAEB 03 96 p24) had paid US Dollars 245m in bonds at the 
time of the auction. The contracts, which will be on a joint-venture basis, 
signal the end of 20 years of state control of the oil industry. The new 
fields are reckoned to hold 17bn barrels of crude. 
  The Ministerio de Energia y Minas said that the average price for its oil 
exports was US Dollars 16.7 a barrel in the first five months of the year. 
The average price in the first half of June was down to US Dollars 16.3 a 
barrel. Officials expects quite a sharp decline (to an average of US Dollars 
14 a barrel) over the next three months as the embargo on Iraqi exports 
ends. 

 Paraguay: A US oil company, Phillips Petroleum, has ended its search for 
oil in the country. It drilled two dry holes and spent US Dollars 15m. Over 
the last 50 years fifty oil wells have been drilled in the country without 
finding significant amounts of oil.

 REGION: COPPER: PRICE PROBLEMS: TURMOIL ON THE LME

 The wild gyrations of the copper price on the London Metal Exchange are 
likely to have major effects on Latin America's two biggest copper 
producers, Chile and Peru. Over the past month the price of copper has 
dropped from US Dollars 2,800 a tonne (US Dollars 1.27 a pound) to US 
Dollars 1,900 a tonne (or US Dollars 0.86 a pound) before recovering to US 
Dollars 2,300 a tonne (or US Dollars 1.04 a pound). 

 We have been bears of copper for the past 18 months, though we did not 
expect the collapse in the market to be so sudden. We had expected a gentle 
glide down from last year's peaks to around US Dollars 1.10 a pound by the 
end of the year. 

 No-one seems entirely sure why the copper market has tumbled so far so 
fast. The two main reasons advanced by traders and analysts are (1) that 
China has held off from the market and (2) that Sumitomo Corporation from 
Japan, a major copper holder, might be about to change its policy.

 China is both a major producer and consumer of copper. Traders had been 
expecting it to start buying copper in order to meet the demand caused by 
its fast economic growth rate and heavy investment in infrastructure. Some 
analysts also expect it to want to build up its stocks of both refined 
copper and concentrates so that it has sufficient stocks to see it through 
any problems following the (long-anticipated) death of Deng Xiaoping. So far 
this buying has not come through, so analysts are beginning to wonder if 
China now reckons that it has sufficient reserves of copper.

 In the first half of June the copper market was riddled with rumours that 
Sumitomo's chief copper trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, had either resigned or been 
sacked. Finally. Sumitomo made an announcement on 13 June in which the 
company revealed that Hamanaka had been responsible for US Dollars 1.8bn 
worth of unauthorised trading over the past decade. The big fear in the 
copper market is that Sumitomo, which had a reputation for building up 
stocks which it then used to squeeze traders who were short of copper might 
now be holding more of the metal than it needs. This could mean that it 
would become a seller of copper, driving prices down further. 

 This fear drove the copper price down to US Dollars 1,850 a tonne on the 
day that Hamanaka's unauthorised trading was revealed. Although the price 
recovered to close at just over US Dollars 2,000 a tonne, we would expect 
the price to remain weak.

 So. What is clear from the tables and charts on this page is that weaker 
copper prices pose a big threat to both Chile's and Peru's prospects for a 
trade surplus this year. If copper prices were to average US Dollars 0.90 
for the year, Chile's copper revenues would fall by a quarter, even assuming 
a 10% rise in export volumes. The same would happen in Peru's case, though 
the consequences could be more dramatic since the trade account is already a 
problem. 

 In 1995, copper provided 21% of Peru's export revenues, and 41% of Chile's. 

 So far comment from both Chile and Peru on the prospects for the copper 
market have been muted; Juan Villarzu, president of the state-owned 
Corporacion del Cobre, the world's biggest copper producer, has said that 
the London Metal Exchange, the world's main copper market, must do more to 
ensure a more stable market.

 Eduardo Aninat, the Chilean finance minister, has said that the budget 
could be affected by the fall in copper prices. Last year Codelco alone 
provided the government with US Dollars 1.3bn: this was more than the rest 
of the corporate sector put together provided. Chile's total tax revenues in 
1995 were US Dollars 10bn.

 PERU: LOOKING FOR A BOOM: AS NEW INVESTMENT FLOODS IN

 The Peruvian mining industry expects to be exporting US Dollars 4bn worth 
of metals by 2005. In 1995, the industry exported metals worth US Dollars 
2.6bn.

 The president of the Sociedad Nacional de Mineria y Petroleo, Walter 
Sologuren, said that the growth of the industry would be led by new 
discoveries, privatisation and the renewed interest multinational mining 
companies were now showing in the industry. He said that this made a change: 
he claimed that the country had been spurned by investors since 1970.

 Sologuren said that he expected total investment in the mining industry to 
be US Dollars 13bn between 1995 and 2005. Of that, he expected foreign 
mining companies to stump up 60%.   

 Sologuren said that the country would be producing around 2m t of refined 
metals by the year 2004. He claimed that the biggest increase would probably 
come in gold production. He expected that Peru would be the biggest gold 
producer in Latin America by the end of the century, producing around 100t. 
In 1995 the country produced 56t which produced export revenues of US 
Dollars 460m. 

 Copper. Copper production has increased, especially at Toquepala, Cuajone, 
Cerro Verde and Tintaya. The big boost has come at Cerro Verde and Tintaya, 
which were privatised. In 1995, copper exports were US Dollars 1.2bn, up 
from US Dollars 824m in 1994. 

 The total revenues from mining exports were US Dollars 2.60bn in 1995, up 
from US Dollars 1.96bn in 1994.

 Gold. The fastest growing export, though, was gold. Export revenues 
increased by 37% as export volumes rose by 35%. Peruvian goldminers talk 
optimistically about the world developing a shortage of gold. Jaime Uranga, 
president of the Comite Aurifero de la Sociedad Nacional de Mineria y 
Petroleo, said that the world's current gold production of about 2,268t a 
year was about 1,000t short of demand, which he estimated to be 3,550t. So 
far, he said, the shortfall had been covered by loans or sales from stocks 
held either by central banks or investors.

 The whole question of gold supply and demand is complicated by the fact 
that one source of demand is from mining companies which borrow gold to 
develop new gold mines. They pay back the loans with their new production. 
Frequently the goldmines also hedge their production forward to lock in 
prices when they believe that prices might fall. 

 The core of the demand argument which suggests that prices are unlikely to 
fall is that production from the world's largest gold producer, South 
Africa, is falling at an annual rate of between 15% and 20%. South Africa's 
deep mines are some of the most expensive to operate in the world.

 Peru's main goldmine is Yanacocha which is owned by the big US mining 
company, Newmont. Yanacocha recently discovered another gold deposit, Sipan, 
which holds 16.8m t of ore with an average gold content of 1.73g per t and 
an average silver content of 4.1g per tonne. This mine is likely to come on 
stream in 1998. 

 Yanacocha is scheduled to produce 620,000 ounces (19.2t) this year, up from 
552,000 ounces in 1995. 

 Silver: Peru's export revenues rose by 13% even though the international 
price of silver fell by 13%. 

 New law: The government has promulgated a new law which tidies up some of 
the outstanding questions of ownership rights. The new law, which has been 
approved by congress, cleans up the register of claims, throwing out 11,000 
claims and forcing another 9,000 to lapse. The new law also stipulates that 
the coordinates of new (and all existing) concessions must be surveyed and 
marked on a single geographical map.

 SURINAME: BAUXITE: DEMAND: BY UNION

 The Paranam Workers' Union has pulled back from a confrontation with the 
management at Suralco. The union had issued an ultimatum, which expired on 9 
June, demanding a salary increase of 185%.

 The management had offered 30%, saying it could not afford higher 
increases. 

 The union points out that the official figure for inflation was 238% in 
1995, so even a 185% rise would represent a fall in real wages. 

 Despite the rejection of its ultimatum the union has resumed talks with the 
management. The union says that it will not do anything to damage the 
company, though it points out that the company's income is US Dollars 140 
per day per worker, yet the average daily wage is only US Dollars 4. 

 Gold: Uruguay's first gold mine is scheduled to come into production in 
1998. Owned and operated by the American Resource Corporation, the Mina San 
Gregorio will cost about US Dollars 50m to develop. It reckons to produce 
75,000 ounces (2.3t) of gold a year from processing 1m t of ore. The mine is 
based in the north of the country at Minas de Corrales, close to the border 
with Brazil. American Resource made its first venture into Uruguay in 1993 
when it extracted US Dollars 8m worth of gold from a mine that was thought 
to be exhausted at San Jose, 90km from Montevideo.

 Copper: Chile's Codelco and the Australian Mutual Provident Society have 
revealed more about their joint venture, Los Andes. In the initial stages 
the company will concentrate on developing Maria Delia, Sierra Jardin, 
Exploradora and Sierra de Moreno. These are all copper mines. Codelco will 
provide US Dollars 12m while AMP will supply US Dollars 6m. Los Andes' 
president will be Edgardo Boeninger, a former minister and senior official 
at the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council.

 CUBA: FOCUS ON CUBA'S BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY: TRYING TO BOOST EXPORTS

 Cuba has been trying to build up its biotechnology industry for at least 
the past two decades. It has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in 
government-run research institutes such as the Centro de Ingenieria Genetica 
y Biotecnologia, the most famous of the 30 or so biotech institutes in Cuba. 

 The government has long nursed ambitions of becoming a major exporter of 
biotechnology. Indeed, before the collapse of Comecon in 1989, Cuba claimed 
to be exporting US Dollars 500m worth of medicines a year. This figure has 
since dwindled, along with exports of other Cuban products, to US Dollars 
100m.

 Cuba's most successful products are anti-meningitis and hepatitis vaccines 
and some diagnostic kits. Last year the country recently used its own anti-
leprosy vaccine to fight an outbreak of that disease in Holguin, it 
inoculated 120,000 people against the disease. The country also has high 
hopes of a product that deals with Tresteza, a disease that can wipe out 
citrus crops.

 Generally, however, the performance of Cuban products in export markets has 
been disappointing.

 Cuba claims to have 5,000 scientists and technicians working in its 
mediacal research industry. The quality of the scientists must be open to 
question: Jamaica recently ended its agreement to recognise Cuban medical 
qualifications after some poor experiences with Cuban trained doctors. 

 The most success the Cubans had was in selling biotech goods to other Latin 
American countries. Brazil and Colombia especially had been (reasonably) 
enthusiastic buyers of Cuban made medicines. Last year Colombia signed a US 
Dollars 10m deal to buy Cuban-made hepatitis and antimeningococcal 
meningitis Group B vaccine. Other Latin American countries have also bought 
a cholesterol-reducing drug PPG. 

 Cuba had also managed to sell interferons (which are used for a variety of 
tasks from diagnosing pregnancy to dealing with AIDS infections) to China.  

 York deal. The government has now changed tack and started to use 
established companies to break into new markets. It recently signed a deal 
with a Canadian firm, York Medical, to develop and sell Cuban biotech 
products in Canada and Europe. 

 The government awarded York a licence to test and market human and 
veterinary pharmaceuticals made by the biotech industry. Under this deal, 
York Medical will transfer technology and test products in Canadian biotech 
facilities. Cubans will also be trained to develop and market products. 

 York says that it will not only market Cuban biotech products in developed 
markets, such as Canada and Europe, but it will also assist in financing new 
products and getting them through the regulatory and quality controls which 
keep them from new markets. 

 Immediate plans. For the moment, York will concentrate on marketing 15 
Cuban biotech products (such as Heberquinasa (which eliminates blood clots); 
an epidermal growth factor which detects tumours; the antibiotics testing 
system; Diramic; Udertan (a product generated from red mangroves to 
disinfect cow udders); and Dermofural (an antibacterial and anti-fungal 
cream made from sugar cane extract.

 Neither York nor the Cubans expect any trouble from the Helms-Burton Act. 
They say that no US assets are used by the biotech industry and the 
intellectual property on which the industry is based dates from the early 
1980s, well after the 1959 revolution. 

 Non-human strengths. The strongest parts of the Cuban biotech industry 
appear to be in products that do not have medical applications. At a 
conference last year attended by 250 US, European and Latin American 
scientists, there was considerable interest in a vaccine that protects 
cattle against ticks, genetically engineered crops that repel insects and 
industrial enzymes. One of these enzymes dissolves dextran, a gummy 
substance that bogs down the sugar refining process. Cuban sugar producers 
say that the use of the enzyme has cut the sugar mills' energy consumption 
by nearly half.

 Maquila. One idea that has been canvassed by international drug producers 
is to use Cuba as a cheap manufacturing base. This will only happen if the 
country improves its regulatory and control standards: drug companies have 
been scared by what happened to Fisons, a British drug company which is now 
part of the Rorer Group which failed to meet US Food and Drug Administration 
standards at an inspection. The company was forced to stop production until 
it improved its systems. 

 Cuban scientists would certainly like access to hard currencies: at present 
most of them earn less than taxi drivers and barmen. The CIGB is trying to 
improve the scientists' lot by paying some of their salaries in dollars.

 MEXICO: ZAPATISTAS AND GOVERNMENT AGREE ON FURTHER NEGOTIATING SESSION

 Two days of discussions between representatives of the government and the 
Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional (EZLN) ended on 17 July with some 
progress. The two sides reached preliminary  agreement on the second item on 
the agenda of peace negotiations. The talks have been going on since April 
1995 in the Chiapas town of San Andres Larrainzar. A full negotiating 
session on 'democracy and justice' is due to take place on 6 August, but the 
two sides appear to be as far apart as ever on the fundamental issues.

 The talks reflected the EZLN's determination to project itself as a 
national organisation, going far beyond issues affecting Chiapas. It set out 
its twin aims for the next round of negotiations as: 'Promotion of a regime 
of social coexistence fully covered by the rule of law and the construction 
of a democratic development that permits a peaceful political life and 
intense citizen participation.'

 'Comandante Tacho' of the EZLN was dismissive of the government's proposals 
on these issues: 'Democracy is much more than honest elections, extending to 
citizens' participation in all spheres of social, productive, political and 
cultural life.'

 This projection was further seen in a subsequent meeting in the Lacandona 
jungle on 22 July between EZLN representatives and members of the bank 
debtors' organisation known as El Barzon, which claims 1m members, and sees 
much in common with the Zapatistas in its struggle for more favourable 
treatment from the federal government. The two groups signed a mutual 
defence pact, and agreed to form a front of civic organisations to press for 
changes in the Mexican economic model.

 In Guerrero, the new guerrilla group known as the Ejercito Popular 
Revolucionario (EPR) confirmed its insurgent credentials on 19 July when it 
issued a communique, signed by 'Comandante Antonio,'  claiming 
responsibility for an attack on a military patrol three days earlier near 
Chilapa.

 LOPEZ OBRADOR WINS

 Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, 43, was formally proclaimed the new leader of 
the Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD) on 17 July. He received 
264,565 votes, 73.9% of the total, in internal elections.

 Lopez Obrador, former PRD candidate for governor of Tabasco, is regarded as 
on the radical wing of the PRD. He replaces Porfirio Munoz Ledo on 3 August.

 ARGENTINA: POLITICS: CAMILION QUITS OVER ARMS SCANDAL: MENEM FINDS A JOB 
FOR DEFEATED BUENOS AIRES MAYOR

 When he announced the appointment of the outgoing mayor of Buenos Aires, 
Jorge Dominguez, as defence minister on 21 July, President Carlos Menem 
insisted that the departure of Oscar Camilion, who resigned five days 
earlier, had nothing to do with the scandal concerning arms sales to Ecuador 
in which the minister had become implicated.

 Two in one week. For the second time in a week Menem had to let a long-
serving minister go, amid protestations that the departure had no particular 
motive (see Page 334/96). Camilion, like Rodolfo Barra, had apparently come 
to the end of his time, nothing more.

 But everybody knew that Camilion had been hanging on by his finger-nails 
for months, as the judicial inquiry into the arms sales drew closer and the 
clamour from the opposition benches grew louder (see Page 238/96). The final 
straw came when federal judge Jorge Urso decided there was enough evidence 
of a cover-up to request the lifting of Camilion's ministerial immunity.

 Menem took five days, during which he was on a visit to the United States, 
to mull over the resignation. He finally decided Camilion must go, but took 
care to make clear that the government was no more involved in the scandal 
than the minister: 'Argentina sold the arms that ended up in Ecuador to 
private entities,' he claimed.

 But Urso based his application to interrogate Camilion on the testimony of 
the air force commander, Brigadier Juan Paulik, who said he had warned the 
defence minister that the planes supposedly bound for Venezuela were 
stopping off in Guayaquil. The ministry took no action.

 The only suspects to be arrested so far are Luis Sarlenga, former president 
of the company that made the weapons, Fabricaciones Militares (owned by the 
defence ministry), and two other senior officials of the company.

 The departure of Camilion will help to mend fences with Peru, where 
indignation was widespread that an old ally should lend itself to supplying 
arms to an enemy in a time of conflict.

 Dominguez has fallen on his feet, after suffering a humiliating defeat in 
the mayoral elections on 30 June at the hands of the Radical candidate, 
Fernando de la Rua. Despite finishing third, behind the Frepaso candidate, 
Dominguez was told by Menem that he was 'the best mayor Buenos Aires has 
had.'

 AMIA BOMB SUSPECTS HELD

 Prosecutors investigating the bombing of the Amia Jewish community centre 
in July 1994 suspect two Buenos Aires policemen of Arab origin of supplying 
the pick-up truck loaded with explosives that was used in the attack, in 
which 86 people died.

 One of the two, who have not been arrested, is thought to be close to a 
'prominent member of the Lebanese community' who was connected in some way 
with the owner of the vehicle, Carlos Telleldin, the only suspect charged 
with involvement in the incident.

 Following Telleldin's evidence, judge Juan Jose Galeano has linked the 
vehicle with an extortion racket run by 14 Buenos Aires provincial 
policemen, arrested earlier this month.

 ARGENTINA: ECONOMY: STRIKE THREAT OVER SPENDING CUTS: MENEM BACKS CAVALLO 
(AGAIN) AFTER ROW WITH UNIONS AND PJ

 While economy minister Domingo Cavallo threatened to resign unless his 
latest economic adjustment measures were implemented by congress, President 
Menem took responsibility for whipping dissident members of the ruling 
Partido Justicialista (PJ) back into line.

 Menem imposed order in the party after ratifying yet again his faith in 
Cavallo. The latter's attempts to make amends for failing to meet fiscal 
targets set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were bitterly 
criticised within the PJ (see Page 316/96).

 'The adjustment measures are mine, not Cavallo's,' Menem said on 19 July. 
Some 2.4m workers stand to suffer from a reduction in state aid for 
dependent families, and from the taxation of food subsidies paid to some 
1.2m employees by companies as part of their total wage. The government is 
also considering the abolition of transport subsidies and imposing value 
added tax (IVA) on bus, metro and train fares -all wildly unpopular measures 
with the unions.

 The Confederacion General del Trabajo (CGT) has called a general strike on 
8 August, 10 days before negotiations begin with the IMF to secure a waiver 
on the agreed fiscal targets. The unions have also threatened to seek a 
court ruling overturning the presidential decrees implementing the 
adjustment measures.

 Opposition economists expect the result to be a big fall in consumption 
rather than an increase in tax revenues. The government expects the measures 
to save up to US Dollars 1bn a year. The main employers' organisation, Union 
Industrial Argentina (UIA), has given its support, regarding the measures as 
preferable to tax increases.

 The fiscal deficit of US Dollars 2.508bn for the first six months of 1996 
was US Dollars 8m higher than the figure agreed with the IMF for the whole 
year.

 AUTONOMOUS BUENOS AIRES

 The first autonomous government of Buenos Aires will take office on 6 
August, in accordance with the first decision taken by the assembly drawing 
up the capital's political statutes, the 60-member Convencion de 
Representantes.

 Senador Graciela Fernandez Meijide, of Frepaso, was elected president of 
the convention on 19 July. Frepaso has 25 seats in the assembly, against 19 
for the Union Civica Radical (UCR), 11 for the PJ and five for Nueva 
Dirigencia.

 CUBA/UNITED STATES: DIPLOMACY: CLINTON FUDGE FAILS TO SATISFY ALLIES: 
HELMS-BURTON CONFLICTS POSTPONED, NOT PREVENTED

 The option chosen by President Clinton on implementation of the Helms-
Burton Act (see Page 325/96) was a skilful fudge: the law would be applied, 
but not yet. It was not lost on Latin American countries that the diplomatic 
clout of the European Union (EU) had caused Washington to postpone taking 
action under the most controversial section of the law.

 Six-month moratorium. The President's statement on 16 July maintained the 
right of US citizens to sue foreign 'traffickers' in confiscated properties 
in Cuba under Title III of the Helms-Burton Act, but took to make sure that 
no cases would come to court for at least six months -that is, until 
February 1997.

 Clinton's calculation is that he will have done enough to avoid alienating 
the Florida Cuba lobby without driving the US into open conflict with the EU 
or its partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).

 The first reaction of Senator Jesse Helms, joint sponsor of the law, was 
not promising, however: his spokesman said the President's decision was a 
'capitulation' to Castro and his EU allies.

 Clinton's best hope is that he wins the presidential elections in November, 
and can then extend the moratorium or, better still, quietly let Title III 
drop. But that will depend on the correlation of forces in the new Congress.

 Pressure for change. In the meantime, the US proposes to continue efforts 
over the next six months to persuade its allies to bring greater pressure to 
bear on the Castro government to introduce democratic freedoms in the 
island. If they do not do so, Title III could then be brought into action.

 In other words, Washington still insists on the 'extra-territorial' 
application of its national legislation -a point underlined a few days later 
when proposals were put forward in Washington to prosecute foreign companies 
trading or maintaining economic contacts with Libya or Iran.

 This position could be storing up trouble for the future, as it is 
precisely this point that has most enraged EU, Nafta and other Latin 
American countries. The EU has said it proposes to continue with 
preparations for retaliatory measures, and EU Commission president Jacques 
Santer has said Clinton's moratorium, while welcome, is not enough.

 The Spanish-based Sol-Melia hotel group, with extensive interests in Cuba, 
was among the first EU companies to begin its own campaign, on 22 July, to 
ensure that Titles III and IV are never applied. Sol-Melia is one of the 
foreign companies already notified that it is liable to sanctions under the 
Helms-Burton legislation.

 Title IV refers to the denial of visas to executives of companies dealing 
with Cuba, and is a mere pinprick compared with Title III. But pinpricks are 
annoying, and much has already been made by commentators in EU countries and 
Canada about the absurdity of refusing to allow children of, say, Sherritt 
International executives to visit Disneyland for their holidays.

 President Fidel Castro is making the most of the divisions among the 
Western allies. He emphasised in a briefing to Spanish journalists on 19 
July that the Helms-Burton Act was a 'sword of Damocles' hanging over the 
sovereignty of all nations and sets a precedent with dire implications for 
international trading relations in general.

 'AVIONETAS' AT UN

 Attempts by Washington to secure a resolution from the United Nations 
Security Council condemning Cuba for the shooting-down of two light aircraft 
in February seem to have come unstuck. US ambassador Madeleine Albright said 
on 22 July that she was satisfied there was a consensus in the Council 
against military attacks on civilian aircraft, but she was prepared to tone 
down a draft resolution prepared by the US.

 A report by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) criticised 
the incident and appeared to back the US position that it took place in 
international airspace (see RC-96-06). But the ICAO board did not 
specifically condemn the Cuban government, and US allies on the Security 
Council see Washington's campaign for sanctions against Cuba over the 
incident as part of its policy of isolating the Castro regime, and are 
reluctant to go along.

 SOUTHERN CONE: BRIEFS

 Chile's exports will rise to US Dollars 18bn in 1997, 13% higher than the 
US Dollars 16bn forecast for this year, according to the finance ministry. 
Last year services accounted for US Dollars 3.1bn of exports, the third 
largest figure in the region after Brazil and Mexico.

 Consumer prices are expected to have risen by 0.2-0.3% in July, compared 
with 0.8% for the same month of 1995, bringing inflation in Chile to 7.7% 
for the last 12 months, the finance ministry has announced.

 The state copper company, Codelco, has forecast a US Dollars 500m fall in 
income to US Dollars 1.2bn for this year, as a result of the Sumitomo 
scandal causing copper prices on the international markets to plummet.

 Forestry exports fell 20% in value to US Dollars 769m, and 11.3% in volume, 
in the first five months of the year, compared with the same period of 1995.

 Atilio Fernandez, the former integration minister, has been appointed head 
of Paraguay's Privatisations Council, his explicit brief being to speed up 
the sell-off process begun by President Wasmosy in 1993.

 Uruguay's public payroll has been cut back by 16,754 posts over the past 18 
months, to 239,146 officials.

 Uruguay's state electricity company, UTE, is to link up with the joint 
venture between the Uruguayan oil company ANCAP and the government of 
Argentina's Entre Rios province to build a gas pipeline on both sides of the 
river Uruguay, which divides the two countries. UTE is to invest US Dollars 
120m in a 350MW natural gas station to form part of the infrastructure.

 A new law will end the state monopoly on the financing of the construction 
of new homes, leaving the Banco Hipotecario, the current credit provider, to 
adapt to a new and competitive market.

 BRAZIL: ECONOMY: SETBACK IN JUNE TRADE FIGURES: BUT TELECOMS LEGISLATION IS 
THROUGH CONGRESS AT LAST

 External account figures released in mid-July were not as good as expected, 
causing the government to promise a thorough revision of its projections for 
this year. But, on the positive side, real progress was made with 
legislation on opening up the economy.

 Trade back in deficit. The May trade deficit of US Dollars 268m was 
followed by a disappointing US Dollars 327m deficit in June, with exports 
6.77% down on the previous month. The shortfall for the first half-year was 
US Dollars 296m -which makes the official prediction of a US Dollars 500m 
trade surplus for the year seem unlikely. The government concedes that the 
current account deficit will exceed US Dollars 2bn for the whole of 1996.

 The government, naturally, has been putting a favourable gloss on the 
results. The finance ministry's economic policy secretary, Jose Roberto 
Mendonca de Barros, pointed out that the growth in imports in June was 
largely accounted for by a 15.2% jump in machinery and equipment purchases. 
'The pick-up in investments is much more important than the import figures,' 
he said, adding that a reviving economy was bound to suck in imports.

 Mendonca de Barros noted that direct investments were pouring in, most of 
them related to Mercosur projects, making the accumulated reserves of US 
Dollars 60bn an advantage rather than a problem.

 A record total of foreign investments of US Dollars 1.1bn was recorded in 
June, bringing the total for the first six months up to US Dollars 4.37bn, 
according to central bank figures released on 19 July.

 Mexican spectre. Not everybody agrees with the government's upbeat 
assessment. The June trade figures suggest to some economists -those of what 
might be called the Dornbusch persuasion- that the spectre of a Mexican-
style crisis has still not been dispelled (see Page 268/96), and the 
deterioration of the external accounts should set the alarm bells ringing.

 Non-government projections of the current account deficit this year are in 
the range of US Dollars 4bn-US Dollars 5.6bn. And critics also point out 
that much of the foreign capital is coming to Brazil because of what are 
still among the highest real interest rates in the world.

 Cellular telephones law. The most impressive legislative advance was the 
approval on 18 July by the senate, by 55 votes to six, of the law regulating 
private participation in cellular telephony, satellite broadcasting and data 
transmission. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed the bill into law 
on the following day.

 Cellular telephony is expected to attract foreign investments totalling US 
Dollars 5bn over the next five years, opening the floodgates of investment 
in telecoms. The compromise that enabled the law to complete its passage 
through congress means that companies taking part must have at least 51% 
Brazilian capital for the first three years. The former state monopoly 
company, Telebras, is authorised to set up subisidiares to compete for 
concesisons.

 Nineteen consortia. The communications minister, Sergio Motta, said the 
first bids for cellular telephony services would be called in the next few 
weeks, and the country would be divided into 10 regions for the purpose. 
About 19 consortia, already in existence or in formation, are expected to 
participate.

 Cardoso said at the signing ceremony that the government was in no hurry to 
complete its reform programme, but wanted to be sure that they were the 
right ones for the country. He nevertheless did not neglect the opportunity 
to appeal to congress to speed up approval of the big constitutional reforms 
that are still bogged down there, notably the social security amendments.

 A much watered-down version of this reform was given a second reading and 
approved by the lower house of congress by 318 votes to 136 on 17 July. The 
concept of 'years of contributions' rather than 'length of service' as 
qualification for a retirement pension is preserved, but in other respects 
the lower house badly mauled the government's original draft (see RB-96-04). 
Civil servants and teachers keep their privileges, including the right to 
retire on full pension after 35 years' service, and no minimum qualifying 
age is laid down for civil servants.

 Worst of all, from the government's point of view, it failed to carry the 
proposal to reduce the  state's contribution to financing the pension funds 
of publicly-owned companies.

[TEX] MALUF'S STAR RISES 

 Mayor Paulo Maluf of Sao Paulo, with a 52% approval rating in the latest 
opinion polls, looks increasingly likely to carry his unknown protege Celso 
Pitta into office on his coat-tails. While the mayoral campaign of former 
planning minister Jose Serra appears to be flagging, Pitta's is prospering.

 Pitta, born in Rio de Janeiro, is a former executive in the Maluf family 
business, and is clearly Maluf's man. He also has the undeniable electoral 
disadvantage of being black. But Maluf's vote-winning 'Projeto Cingapura', a 
low-cost housing and favela improvements scheme, financed with a US Dollars 
150m loan from the Inter-American Development Bank, could make all the 
difference to his chances -as well as keeping Maluf in the public eye and 
serving as a springboard for his undoubted presidential ambitions.

 Cardoso's PSDB party regards the election of Serra as vitally important 
both to the government's prospects in 1997 and to the chances of Cardoso's 
standing for re-election. If Serra were to lose, the government would settle 
for a victory for the Partido dos Trabalhadores' candidate, Luiza Erundina, 
who is still ahead in the polls.

 BOLIVIA: POLITICS & SOCIETY: UPROAR OVER PENSIONS REFORM: DECISION ON NEW 
SYSTEM PUT OFF AFTER MASS PROTESTS

 President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's determination to complete his 
programme of basic reforms before electoral politics take over completely -
the presidential polls are only a year away- suffered a setback with the 
decision to postpone discussion of the draft pensions law until August. 
Popular opposition to this measure shows no sign of abating.

 Political moratorium. Sanchez de Lozada, whose inability to delegate is 
notorious, has tried to put politics on hold while he completes his grand 
design. But the moratorium has proved no easier to impose on the streets 
than on his party, the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR).

 The pensions bill presented to a special session of congress on 10 July was 
met with a general strike, followed by mass demonstrations. Workers objected 
to the whole idea of individual policies replacing a fully state-financed 
scheme, particularly if the new private pension fund companies (AFPs) were 
to be based on Chilean models, and perhaps controlled by Chilean interests.

 The latter possibility was immediately struck out of the draft legislation. 
The President promised an international competition, and said the 
concessions would be awarded in November.

 A feature that provoked intense opposition was Sanchez de Lozada's 
insistence on fixing retirement age for the new system at 65. In the face of 
massive resistance, he conceded that workers could choose their own 
retirement age from 55 onwards, but if they wanted to draw their full 
pension, they would have to carry on working to 65.

 As the well-informed La Paz newsletter Siglo XXI points out, only 14% of 
Bolivia's 120,000 pensioners are 65 or over -and only 3.6% of Bolivians can 
hope to reach that age. It suggested that the next draft should lay down a 
minimum contributions level to qualify for a full pension -along Brazilian 
lines- rather than a qualifying age.

 One important concession has already been made: the old state pensions 
system will remain in existence even after the AFPs begin to operate. 
Sanchez de Lozada's main argument in favour of a new system is that it will 
extend coverage to all 3.5m adult Bolivians, rather than the tiny number 
covered by the present system.

 Everybody, wage-earner or not, is to receive a minimum of about US Dollars 
200 a year for life out of the proceeds of the capitalisation programme.

 Opposition to the capitalisation programme, however, remains widespread -as 
reflected in the decision to renegotiate terms for the gas pipeline with the 
US company Enron and postpone the capitalisation of the state energy 
company, YPFB, until September.

 The Chilean factor is also present in political opposition to the 
capitalisation of the state railways, which have passed into the hands of 
the Chilean Cruz Blanca group. Plans for mass lay-offs of the feather-bedded 
workforce caused immediate uproar.

 Similar lay-off proposals provoked strike threats from the workforce of the 
national airline, Lloyd Aereo Boliviano (LAB), now controlled by the 
Brazilian Vasp group.

 Political reform. Another difficult issue postponed until the second 
extraordinary session of congress, opening on 22 July, was the 
redistribution of congressional seats, to introduce a single-candidate 
system in place of lists for half the country's constituencies.

 This long-overdue reform set off a battle royal between departments, and no 
political party was prepared to concede any seats, for fear of losing out in 
next year's elections.

 The proximity of the elections has caused some edginess in the MNR, despite 
the President's attempts to keep the lid firmly down. The president of the 
senate, Juan Carlos Duran, has made no secret of his ambitions, and he has a 
national reputation. His lower house equivalent, Guillermo Bedregal, has 
also begun manoeuvring, with the aim of leading an MNR backlash against 
Sanchez de Lozada's preference for non-party independents in his cabinet.

 The minister with the best prospects appears to be Carlos Sanchez Berzain 
(interior), while an interesting outsider could be former planning minister 
Enrique Garcia. But he has just been re-elected president of the Caracas-
based Corporacion Andina de Fomento (CAF), and presumably has other things 
on his mind.

 BRAZIL: BRIEFS

 Banco de Credito Nacional, Brazil's fifth largest private bank, is to buy 
Banco Itamaraty as part of the central bank's programme to strengthen the 
fragile banking system, in which 100 out of 246 banks are expected to be 
'absorbed' or closed down. The two banks' combined assets will exceed US 
Dollars 11bn.

 Two investment banks, Cindam and Fonte, are also to merge, with combined 
assets totalling US Dollars 1.7bn.

 The Brazilian government has extended its alcohol fuel programme, due to 
end this December, for a further three years due to its environmental 
advantages. Subsidies cost Petrobras US Dollars 400m in the first quarter of 
1996 alone.

 Petrobras announced expected record production levels of 845,000bpd in 
1996, 18% up on last year. The increase was due to productivity gains, and 
the discovery of new reserves in Argentina, Ecuador, and the Bahia de Campos 
field, off the coast near Rio de Janeiro.

 Brazil's tax receipts totalled US Dollars 46.9bn for the first half of 
1996. The low figure, well below the government's expectations, is due to 
the slow-down in economic activity.

 The number of credit card transactions reached a record 188m and were worth 
US Dollars 11.8bn in the first half of 1996, a 24% rise on the same period 
of last year. One in 10 of the population has access to 'plastic' money.

 Brazil and Japan are to resume negotiations  regarding the former's 70% 
import tariff on foreign vehicles. The measure, introduced last year, cut 
Japanese car sales in Brazil by 95%.

 A government study suggests the country will receive US Dollars 220.5bn in 
private investment up to the year 2000, including US Dollars 10-12bn from 
privatisation.

 REGION: TRENDS: RESENTMENT GROWS TOWARDS WASHINGTON: THE REGION FEELS THE 
BIG STICK IS BEING BRANDISHED AGAIN

 Any lingering illusions about the end of the Cold War and the triumph of 
free-market capitalism making the world a simpler and safer place -the 'end 
of history' theory- must have been dispelled by the recent succession of 
issues concerning perceived national interests that have brought the United 
States into conflict with its allies and trading partners. The consequences 
for Latin America and the Caribbean include a growing feeling that Uncle 
Sam's big stick has been brought back out of the cupboard.

 The Helms-Burton Act, which has succeeded in lining up the European Union, 
Canada and the whole of Latin America against Washington, is seen by the EU 
as both an ideological aberration and a threat to its commercial interests. 
But in the US, zealots regard it as much as part of a crusade against the 
last remnant of Marxist totalitarianism in the Western hemisphere as a 
defence of citizens' property.

 In Latin America and the Caribbean, and particularly in Mexico, the Act is 
seen as part of a wider US attempt to stop the region developing independent 
economic relations. Such a perception may boost Mercosur, for example, at 
the expense of the US-sponsored Free Trade Area of the Americas. It 
certainly drove Chile away from Nafta and into the arms of Mercosur.

 These differing views reflect the extent to which US foreign policy in 
recent years has become a mish-mash of sometimes conflicting aims. These are 
highlighted by confrontations over two other issues: drugs and bananas.

 1. Drugs. As far as Washington is concerned, its pressure on Colombia in 
general and President Ernesto Samper in particular are acts of legitimate 
self-defence: drugs are a threat to its society, and countries that allow 
them to flow into the US become liable to sanctions.

 The uneasy reaction of Latin America is summed up in the words of Simon 
Consalvi, a former senior Venezuelan diplomat. He described the withdrawal 
of Samper's US visa as 'part of an escalation that could lead anywhere.' 
Samper himself saw it as an 'imperialist' act, a unilateral assault on the 
'South' -a view shared by the Non-Aligned Movement, of which he is chairman.

 Samper's US-born wife, Jacquin Strouss, singled out US envoy Myles 
Frechette as an exponent of an outmoded interventionist style of diplomacy. 
She warned that pressure on Colombia was stirring up an anti-American mood 
that she had never seen before.

 This feeling that US ambassadors are striking proconsular attitudes is not 
confined to Colombia: in Argentina, for example, the outspoken interventions 
of envoy James Cheek have been widely resented. Viewed from the south, 
officials in Washington and their representatives on the ground do not even 
pretend to have much respect for the institutions of the countries with 
which they deal.

 2. Bananas. The small Caribbean producers, particularly the Windward 
Islands, which are almost totally dependent on exports of the fruit for 
their foreign exchange earnings, have been lobbying Washington frantically 
in an attempt to persuade it to drop its objections to the EU's market 
regime. But the US has proved impervious to pleading, insisting that the 
regime is unfair to US marketing companies and should be subjected to a 
World Trade Organisation disputes panel.

 The argument that this narrow view of US interests could rebound on 
Washington if island economies collapsed and sent a flood of drugs and 
migrants northwards has failed to make much impact.

 The Caribbean's experience is similar to that of countries exporting to the 
US, which have found non-tariff barriers mysteriously appearing even as the 
free-trade rhetoric flows from Washington: reformulated gasoline exports 
from Venezuela and Brazil, which became the first issue to be resolved by 
the WTO's disputes panel, are a case in point.

 If Latin America and the Caribbean are coming to regard US policy towards 
them as a mixture of bullying and blinkered hypocrisy, that is a worrying 
trend indeed.

 REGION: DEBT&LENDING ROUND-UP

 ARGENTINA/ Debt grows. The foreign debt has grown by almost 57% over the 
past four years, according to an economy ministry report released on 18 
July. The total for both public and private sectors reached US Dollars 
91.47bn in March this year, compared with US Dollars 58.41bn at the end of 
1991 -a 56.59% increase.

 The public sector debt increased during the first quarter of 1996 by US 
Dollars 2.59bn.

 During the same period, Argentina's foreign exchange reserves increased by 
109.36%, from US Dollars 8.97bn to US Dollars 18.78bn.

 BRAZIL/ IDB road loan. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and 
Germany's Dresdner Bank group have agreed to lend US Dollars 25m for the 
construction of a 15km, six-lane toll road in Rio de Janeiro.

 Total cost of the project will be US Dollars 173.5m, of which  Rio 
municipal government will contribute US Dollars 112m.

 COSTA RICA/ Unused credits. The government is proposing to cancel US 
Dollars 450m worth of undisbursed loans from the IDB, including a US Dollars 
400m credit to the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE). The 
country is paying US Dollars 4m a year to keep the loans open.

 ECUADOR/ Judicial reform. The World Bank is lending US Dollars 10.7m to 
help finance modernisation and strengthening of the judicial system. The 
government is to provide an additional US Dollars 3.6m.

 Spanish credit. Formal signing of a US Dollars 110m credit from the Spanish 
government for the extension of the new trolleybus system in Quito was 
completed on 18 July.

 PERU/ Paris Club deal. President Fujimori announced in Lima on 20 July that 
a restructuring deal had been reached with the country's Paris Club 
creditors, along the lines achieved by Russia in May.

 Payments are to be made over 20 years, with a maximum of US Dollars 450m-US 
Dollars 600m for the first three years. The total to be paid will be US 
Dollars 7bn, a reduction from the US Dollars 9bn owed to Paris Club 
countries. Peru's outstanding commercial debt totals some US Dollars 10bn.

 REGION/ World Bank appointment. Guillermo Perry Rubio, former finance 
minister of Colombia, has been appointed the World Bank's chief economist 
for Latin America and the Caribbean from 1 August.

 Before serving in the Samper government, Perry was a Liberal member of 
congress and of the 1991 constitutional assembly. He was minister of energy 
and mines 1986-88.

 World Bank lending back to normal. Latin American and Caribbean countries 
borrowed a total of US Dollars 4.44bn from the World Bank in the 12 months 
to 30 June 1996. The total for the previous year was US Dollars 6.06bn. The 
fall, the Bank says, reflects Mexico's recovery from the financial crisis at 
the end of 1994.

 Assistance to the financial sector fell from US Dollars 1.4bn to US Dollars 
11.9m, and lending for public sector management from US Dollars 1.06bn to US 
Dollars 666m.

 Most WB lending to the region was in International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (IBRD) loans at favourable market rates: US Dollars 4.05bn, 
down from US Dollars 5.71bn in the previous year. But lending at 
concessional rates, from the International Development Association, was up 
from US Dollars 345.2m to US Dollars 390.3m.

 Argentina was the bank's fourth-largest borrower, with US Dollars 1.51bn, 
Brazil sixth (US Dollars 875m) and Mexico eighth (US Dollars 526.5m).

 TRINIDAD & TOBAGO/ Help for poor. The IDB is to lend US Dollars 28m to 
finance community infrastructure and social services aimed at the poor. 
Projects include child care, education and conservation schemes.

 GUATEMALA: ECONOMY: RESOURCE LIMITS THREATEN PEACE DEAL: QUESTIONMARK HANGS 
OVER ECONOMIC PROSPECTS

 With the country now looking forward to the signing of the final peace 
accords between the government and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional 
Guatemalteca (URNG) guerrillas, (see Page 308/96) most likely to be 
initialed in September, attention is now being turned towards the economy, 
and the cost of peace.

 Questionmark over resources. A major step in the peace process was the 
socio-economic and agrarian accords agreed in May, from which the URNG 
negotiators had withdrawn their most radical demands, in particular the 
reference to the 'social function of land', and in return accepted somewhat 
loose promises of social reform. But the cost of implementing these accords 
is estimated to be between US Dollars 600m and US Dollars 900m, and the 
government's planning secretariat calculates that about US Dollars 2.3bn 
will be needed to pay for the rehabilitation of those areas affected by the 
conflict. Though some international aid is certain to be forthcoming, a 
questionmark hangs over the economy's ability to deliver the necessary 
resources.

 Economic indicators for 1995 were encouraging. Overall GDP growth 
accelerated to 4.5% from the previous year's 4%. The fastest growing sectors 
were mining (11%); banking & real estate (8%); construction (7.9%) and 
electricity, gas & water (7%). Agricultural growth was sluggish at 2.9%. 
Official figures for urban unemployment showed a fall from to 4.3% from 5.2% 
in 1994. Forecasts for 1996 place GDP growth at 5%.

 Export revenues increased 28.5% to US Dollars 2.2bn in 1995, mainly as a 
result of high coffee and sugar prices. Oil exports also performed well, 
rising in value by 38%. Exports to other Central American countries grew by 
23%, thanks to an agreement to consult on tariff changes in April 1995. The 
trade deficit, however, widened by 4.3% over the previous year as the import 
bill rose to  Dollars 3.3bn. Imports of raw materials and capital goods 
outstripped consumer goods for the first time in nearly a decade.

 Coffee, sugar and bananas account for 42% of export revenues and the recent 
dip in world prices has highlighted the need to widen the range of products 
the country sells abroad. While Guatemala succeeded in raising the value of 
non-traditional agro-exports from US Dollars 50m in 1986 to US Dollars 141m 
in 1989, progress since has been disappointing. (See table)

 The manufacturing sector suffered with the decline of the Central American 
Common Market in the 1980s and has responded inadequately to the lifting of 
tariff barriers in the 1990s. The country is an important exporter of 
chemicals, cosmetics, paper and processed foods, but manufacturing as a 
percentage of GDP fell from 16.7% in 1980 to 14.3% in 1994.

 Last year's trade deficit of US Dollars 1.1bn could widen if world prices 
continue to fall, but the current account will be helped by remittances from 
Guatemalans abroad as the government allows commercial banks to open dollar 
accounts. The peace dividend may well include an increase in the number of 
tourists, whose numbers rose from 537,374 in 1994 to 563, 478 last year.  
However the murder of one Briton and a US citizen in January has reawakened 
safety fears. 

 Domestically, President Alvaro Arzu is likely to continue the tight fiscal 
policy of his predecessor, who brought the fiscal deficit down from 1.4% of 
GDP to 0.7%, the lowest lower in Central America. Keeping inflation during 
the year to 8.6% was a considerable achievement.

 Though the three percentage point increase in VAT in January this year and 
the temptation to loosen monetary policy to spur growth may fuel inflation 
pressures, Arzu is unlikely to let prices get out of control.

 Privatisation on the cards. Despite strong trade union opposition the Arzu 
government has expressed its commitment to a privatisation programme. Least 
controversial are the loss-making rail network Fegua, the milk producer 
Prolac, and some municipal services. Electricity privatisation is going to 
be tricky, as the Guatemalan Electric Company, EESGA, the distributor, is 
refusing to pay its debts to the National Electricity Institute, Inde, the 
generator. However, in 1995 the Venezuelan government granted a US Dollars 
35 million loan to help modernise the country's electricity network.

 The state telecommunications company Guatel is the most lucrative concern 
on the list to be sold off. It is estimated to be worth US Dollars 1bn with 
annual profits of US Dollars 150m. But the government may be reluctant to 
lose such a valuable source of revenue and delay its privatisation. Last 
September Guatel, together with Northern Telecom of the US, inaugurated a 
modernisation project worth US Dollars 42m. An advanced switching system 
will be set up and a network of 40,000 telephone lines, 36,000 toll trunks 
and an international gateway exchange based on the latest technology will 
update Guatel's services. Meanwhile the US subsidiary Comcel, which operates 
a local cellular telephone monopoly, has given Motorola's Pan American 
Wireless Infrastructure Division a contract worth US Dollars 20m to 
introduce high-tech switching equipment. 

 Investment in infrastructure is vital, but with government spending at only 
6.3% of GDP in 1994, low even by Central American standards, there is little 
alternative but to rely on external financing. The Inter-American 
Development Bank recently approved a US Dollars 150m loan for road building, 
US Dollars 38.6m for healthcare improvements and US Dollars 4.3m to improve 
tax collection. The Japanese government has also pledged US Dollars 30m to 
modernise provincial infrastructure, and the Canadian government has 
promised to increase its contribution to the Fund for Democratic Development 
of Guatemala by US Dollars 3m.

 Foreign debt servicing soaks up about 4.8% of export earnings, well below 
the 10% figure regarded as 'manageable' by Eclac and better than the Latin 
American average of 16.4%.

 The May peace accords included a proposal to raise the tax to GDP ratio by 
50%, currently at 7.8%, one of the lowest rates in Latin America. But 
weighty political lobbying from the rich will render it a difficult task. 
According to the latest World Bank Report, 51% of the total population is 
outside the wage economy, and 37% of the urban population is in the informal 
sector, beyond the reach of tax collectors. In rural areas, the percentage 
of non-wage workers rises to 65%.

 Despite GDP growth, average living standards remain low and income 
distribution highly skewed. The country has achieved a sound base, including 
macro-economic and competitive exchange rate, for export-led growth, but 
without some levelling of income, through the broadening of the tax base, 
some social conflict could threaten progress after the URNG-government 
negotiaitions draw to a close.

 GUATEMALA: SOCIETY & POLITICS: DEATH SENTENCES PROVOKE PROTESTS: ARZU 
REFUSES TO PARDON MURDERERS OF FOUR-YEAR-OLD

 President Alvaro Arzu's determination to use the death penalty as a weapon 
against the crime wave that has swept Guatemala, in common with the rest of 
Central America, has provoked a wave of protests that threaten to overshadow 
the final achievement of a peace accord with the left-wing guerrillas -now 
scheduled for 15 September.

 Clemency refused. Two campesinos were still waiting in the death cell as we 
went to press, after a last-minute stay of execution. They had been due to 
face the firing squad in Escuintla on 23 July, after being found guilty of 
raping and murdering a four-year-old girl in April 1993. President Arzu 
refused to exercise his power of clemency, but the constitutional court 
accepted a motion from two lawyers that the judge who passed sentence had 
committed procedural errors.

 Guatemala is the only Central American country that still has the death 
penalty on its statute book. The executions of Pedro Castillo and Gustavo 
Giron would be the first to be carried out since 1983.

 Opposition to capital punishment has come internally from the Catholic 
hierarchy and human rights bodies such as the Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo (GAM), an 
organisation of relatives of disappeared people, and also from Amnesty 
International.

 GAM described the sentence as 'judicial terrorism,' and called on the 
government to attack the causes of violence in Guatemalan society, not the 
symptoms.

 Amnesty likened the death penalty to other human rights violations common 
in Guatemala, such as torture and disappearances. The organisation said four 
other death sentences had been passed in Guatemala, though appeals were 
still under way.

 Chief government negotiator Gustavo Porras announced a new round of talks 
with representatives of the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca 
(URNG) before the end of the month. Their purpose, he said, would be to 
'clarify' some points about the strengthening of civil power and the role of 
the army in a democratic society.

 RIOS MONTT RE-ELECTED

 Retired General Efrain Rios Montt, prevented from standing for President 
again last year, showed his determination to remain in the political frame 
by being re-elected as general secretary of the opposition Frente 
Republicano Guatemalteco (FRG) on 21 July.

 Rios Montt made a show of accepting the accolade with reluctance. He bowed, 
he said, to the will of the party assembly. Losing presidential candidate 
Alfonso Portillo was chosen as one of the four assistant general 
secretaries, along with his former running mate, Harris Whitbeck.

 Rios Montt is now assured of control of the FRG for the next two years. The 
next presidential elections are in the year 2000, and in the meantime the 
General has the job of consolidating the FRG as the country's main 
opposition force.

 MEXICO: BRIEFS

 Mexico's stock exchange index fell 93 points to 2,916 in one day's trading 
on 15 July, wiping out all gains made this year. The 3.10% fall was seen as 
a knock-on effect from the Dow Jones fall on the same day's trading in New 
York.

 New capitalisation rules for financial intermediaries will come into force 
in September, including the allocation of greater resources to guarantee 
savers' funds against possible risks. The Mexican government also hopes that 
improved supervision of the banking sector will remove any remaining 
anomalies and provide a platform for investment-led economic reactivation.

 The Bank of Mexico has predicted a 33.9% rise in manufactured exports this 
year, driven by high investment in the sector.

 Only 0.9% of companies, the largest, generate 62% of the country's wealth, 
while the smallest 91.6% account for only 9.1% of the total, according to a 
report on the polarisation of Mexican industry.

 Sony is to invest US Dollars 9m in a factory in Tijuana which from next 
year will produce video recorders for distribution throughout the Americas.

 The steel maker Altos Hornos de Mexico announced net earnings of US Dollars 
318m in the first half of this year, three times higher than in the same 
period of 1995. This followed rises of 300% in exports and 30% in sales.

 Mexico's external trade surplus stood at US Dollars 3.93bn for the first 
half of the year, with a US Dollars 45.47m increase in exports, 18.4% up on 
the same period in 1995.

 Unemployment rose to 5.6% in June, a slight increase on the 5.4% figure for 
May.

 COLOMBIA: DRUGS & DIPLOMACY: SAMPER ANNOUNCES TOUGH LEGISLATION: BUT RETURN 
OF VICE-PRESIDENT COULD BRING CRISIS TO A HEAD

 By announcing a package of tough anti-drugs measures on 20 July, President 
Ernesto Samper both served notice that he would be unflinching in his 
determination to confront the traffickers who have all but wrecked his 
presidency and fulfilled one of Washington's most insistent demands. And by 
letting it be known that congress would be invited to modify the legislation 
that currently makes it impossible to extradite traffickers, he made another 
important conciliatory gesture to the United States.

 De la Calle returns. It could all be too late. Vice-President Humberto de 
la Calle, after conspicuously failing to give Samper his unreserved support 
against US pressures (see Page 326/96), finally resigned his post as 
ambassador in Madrid on 16 July and returned to Bogota to join in the 
political fray, or 'to collaborate more closely in the various and serious 
problems that afflict Colombia,' as he put it.

 He has been the focal point of innumerable scenarios and salidas for many 
months now -the latest came from former President Alfonso Lopez Michelsen on 
21 July- and could again become the central figure in a negotiated accord 
that would enable Samper to step down gracefully. One option being discussed 
is that he, too, would step down from the line of succession, to enable a 
third party to serve out the remainder of Samper's term, which ends in 
August 1998.

 Names that have been mentioned include defence minister Juan Carlos 
Esguerra and former justice minister Nestor Humberto Martinez, both of whom 
are respected in Washington. But it seems highly unlikely that De la Calle 
would agree to such a procedure.

 The influential Liberal newspaper El Tiempo, after carefully sitting on the 
fence long after most politically-aware Colombians had taken sides, finally 
called upon Samper to resign, for the good of the country. 'This government 
is no longer viable,' said respected columnist Hernando Gomez on 16 June.

 And the industrialists' association, Andi, confirmed its support on 16 July 
for the strongly anti-Samper line taken by its president, Luis Carlos 
Villegas Echeverri.

 Since he took office in March, Villegas has been one of the loudest voices 
against the President within the Consejo Gremial Nacional -which feels that 
his remaining in power is doing serious damage to Colombia's economic 
prospects, particularly exports.

 Communications minister Juan Manuel Turbay, the most unconditional 
samperista of them all, has followed foreign minister Rodrigo Pardo out of 
the government. That leaves only the combative interior minister, Horacio 
Serpa Uribe, of the three ministers interrogated and acquitted by the 
supreme court, still standing by the President.

 Court cases continue. The supreme court has made clear that it will 
continue with its investigation of the 111 members of the lower house of 
congress who voted to clear Samper in April. Chief public prosecutor Alfonso 
Valdivieso said at the time that the representatives had failed to consider 
much of the concrete evidence against the President in their deliberations, 
and a complaint to that effect by a number of pressure groups has ensured 
that the matter will not be allowed to drop.

 The anti-drug measures are broadly speaking those promised by Samper in his 
speech after being cleared by congress (see Page 260/96), and can be seen as 
a survival strategy by the President. They followed the first steps to 
confiscate property belonging to imprisoned leaders of the Cali cartel, and 
declarations from Samper that he would press for the heaviest penalties for 
convicted traffickers.

 The proposal to debate the extradition of Colombian nationals -a marked 
change of tone from the defiance that characterised Samper's initial 
reactions to Washington's demand and to the withdrawal of his visa- was made 
conditional on the international community taking concerted action against 
drug-trafficking. This is a long-standing demand of Colombia and other South 
American countries, and serves to defuse the confrontation with the US by 
internationalising the issue.

 The departing foreign minister, Rodrigo Pardo, made a remark on 17 July 
very reminiscent of Valdivieso's comment that extradition could be a 'useful 
tool' for tackling the drug-trafficking problem.

 Successful pressure? This was a far cry from Samper's denunciation on 15 
July of Washington's 'unfriendly act' in withdrawing his visa, and its 'lack 
of respect for Colombia's democratic institutions.' The Clinton 
administration might be forgiven for concluding that its policy of incessant 
pressure on the Samper government is producing results, whatever the bluster 
from Bogota and the expressions of solidarity from around the world.

 The promised diplomatic offensive began on 23 July, when new foreign 
minister Maria Emma Mejia was dispatched to Washington. Samper himself said 
he would tour Latin America before addressing the United Nations general 
assembly in New York in September.

 MIRAFLORES EMERGENCY

 The government declared a special emergency zone in the department of 
Guaviare after Miraflores, San Jose del Guaviare and nearby towns were 
occupied by thousands of angry coca-growers, protesting at the government's 
eradication campaign, which uses aerial spraying of the herbicide 
glyphosate.

 This is the second such action in the region in the past year, and reflects 
both the effectiveness of the spraying operations, carried out by police 
helicopters, and the government's failure to offer small farmers any viable 
alternative way of making a living. The government blames Fuerzas Armadas 
Revolucionarias de Colombia (Farc) guerrillas for organising the protests.

 ECUADOR: POLITICS: INDIAN CONFLICTS COMING TO A HEAD: ISSUES MAY PROVIDE 
EARLY TEST OF BUCARAM'S POLITICAL SKILLS

 The issue of the role that Indian organisations will have in the Bucaram 
government (see RA-96-06) looks like coming to a head sooner than expected. 
While jungle Indians are determined to resist plans for the further 
development of oil reserves in their territory -a declared priority of the 
incoming administration- highland communities are threatening an 'uprising' 
if the government fails to respond to their demands for assistance.

 The outgoing government of President Sixto Duran-Ballen has had to face a 
number of these levantamientos populares, generally organised by the 
Confederacion de Nacionalidades Indigenas del Ecuador (Conaie) in connection 
with national issues, such as the privatisation of public utilities.

 Earthquake victims. But the latest threat has much more grass-roots 
origins: 80,000 campesinos from Cotopaxi province who lost everything in an 
earthquake in March claim the central government has given them no help with 
rebuilding their lives, despite lavish promises.

 Bucaram has fiercely attacked the 'racism' of previous governments, and 
promised a big say for Indian groups such as Conaie in his government -
including the creation of a full ministry of Indian affairs. Simmering 
Indian discontent, including roadblocks along the Pan-American highway, 
would be highly embarrassing for a leader anxious to establish his 
credentials both as a popular benefactor and as a man with whom foreign 
bankers and entrepreneurs can do business.

 The President-elect continued his efforts to reassure potential investors 
by confirming the president of the central bank, Augusto de la Torre, in his 
post on 19 July.

 De la Torre is regarded as a safe pair of hands by the private sector, and 
the best guarantee that the orthodox monetary policies of the present 
government will be continued under Bucaram. The latter has already been 
briefed by De la Torre on how to approach business leaders when he visits 
New York just before his 10 August inauguration.

 Oil development plans. Another of Bucaram's choices, Alfredo Adoum, as 
minister of energy, foreshadows an early conflict with jungle Indian 
organisations. Adoum, a Guayaquil businessman and old Bucaram ally, has 
already said he will 'open the doors wide' to foreign investment in the oil 
industry, particularly exploration. He is also committed to constructing new 
pipelines from the jungle to the coast.

 Such projects imply direct conflict with groups such as the Huaorani, only 
about 1,300 strong, who have been pressing the government to expel thousands 
of settlers who have moved into their territory in the Oriente jungles in 
the wake of the oil companies.

 The Huaorani have a legally-recognised 600,000-hectare reserve in Napo 
province, which has become a centre of oil production, involving foreign 
companies such as Oryx, Arco, Agip, Elf and Petrobras.

 The warlike Huaorani have threatened to seal off their territory and expel 
the oil companies and colonos themselves unless the government takes a hand. 
The Organizacion de Nacionalidades Huaoranis de la Amazonia Ecuatoriana 
(Onhae) has been claiming for some time that the companies have encroached 
on their territory without permission and have set one group of Indians 
against another with selective offers of economic aid and social services.

 A new, highly-recommended book* describes in detail the struggles of the 
Huaorani to come to terms with the encroachment of the outside world into 
their previosuly cloistered lives.

 Joe Kane, Savages, Macmillan, London, 1996, GBP 16.99/Knopf, New York, US 
Dollars 25.

 CAPITALISATION PLEDGE

 Alvaro Noboa, economic adviser to Bucaram and one of the triumvirate of 
bankers who will run the economy (see Page 329/96), has promised to halt the 
privatisation programme initiated by the Duran-Ballen government and replace 
it with 'capitalisation' of state-owned companies, along the lines adopted 
by the Sanchez de Lozada government in Bolivia.

 TAX PROTESTS

 Thousands of small traders marched through the streets of the main cities 
on 17 July in protest against attempts by the government to extend the 
taxation system to the 'informal' sector of the economy. Invoices are now 
supposed to be issued for all sales above 10,000 sucres (about US Dollars 3) 
in value.

 The Guayas small traders' association threatened an all-out strike unless 
Bucaram reversed the measure by 20 August.

 ANDEAN REGION: BRIEFS

 The Colombian government announced a US Dollars 37.6m credit line to help 
investment for developing industry and business in frontier regions.

 Ecopetrol, Colombia's state oil company, announced a US Dollars 512m trade 
surplus for the first five months of the year.

 While Ecuador's petroleum exports fell by US Dollars 19m to US Dollars 
581.9m in the first five months of 1996, banana exports rose by the same 
amount to  Dollars 402.4m.

 Peru's tax revenue reached US Dollars 4bn in the first half of the year, 
50% more than expected.

 The Iscaycruz mining complex, with zinc and lead reserves worth US Dollars 
280m, has become Peru's first private zinc producer, under Swiss-Peruvian 
ownership.

 Meanwhile, the Canadian consortium, Inmet-Rio Algom, has bought the 
Antamina copper deposit for US Dollars 20m, and 13 foreign companies have 
put in offers to buy the Quicay gold deposit.

 Foreign investment on the Lima stock exchange rose to US Dollars 2,045m in 
June, 14.3% up on May's total.

 The government's sale of its remaining US Dollars 877m worth of Telefonica 
del Peru shares has ended.

 Venezuela's state petrochemical company, PDVSA, is to offer the 
reactivation of disused oil fields to private investors. The company, which 
predicts net profits of US Dollars 4bn for 1996, is also interested in 
buying refineries in the US and Ecuador, and developing wells in the Orinoco 
basin with Exxon.

 Car sales totalled 22,756 in the first half of 1996, 40% down on the same 
period of last year.

 REGION: POSTSCRIPT

 ANTIGUA/ Nevis dispute. Prime Minister Lester Bird has brought in a former 
Commonwealth secretary-general and a university vice-chancellor to help find 
a solution to the political impasse between the Premier of Nevis, Vance 
Amory, and the St Kitts & Nevis Prime Minister, Dr Denzil Douglas. Amory has 
denounced the creation of an Office for Nevis Affairs on the smaller island 
by the Douglas administration, and has threatened to secede from St Kitts.

 BRAZIL/ Portuguese speakers. Portuguese, the third most widely spoken 
Western language, enjoyed linguistic communion on July 17, when Brazilian 
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso flew to Lisbon to co-found the Community 
of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP). The founding act was attended by 5 
African countries as well as Brazil and Portugal, with the CPLP touted as a 
'model of north-south co-operation' between equals, despite the obvious 
population disparities: there are 160m Brazilians, but only 120,000 
inhabitants of Sao Tome-Principe.

 CHILE/ Miners' strike. The 1800 workers from the Lota coal mine, on strike 
since 17 May, have rejected for the fourth time an agreement reached between 
union leaders and the government. The strikers are demanding better benefits 
for the 450 who are to lose their jobs as part of a rationalisation 
programme. Meanwhile, development minister Felipe Sandoval hinted that the 
state coal company Enacar is to be partially privatised.

 COLOMBIA/ Bad weather. Some 600,000 people have been affected by the worst 
winter for five years. Torrential rainfall, already at nearly the yearly 
average of 3000mm after only six months, has destroyed 20,000 homes and 
100,000 hectares of crops, and claimed the lives of some 100 people. The 
Metereological Institute fears that the first rainy season, normally between 
mid-March and mid-June, is going to run into the second wet weather period, 
due to  begin in September.

 EL SALVADOR / Leftist meeting. Delegates from left wing parties from 
throughout the region were due to meet at the end of July in San Salvador 
for the 6th Congress of the Sao Paulo Forum, to be hosted by the FMLN. The 
Forum, founded in 1990 to promote political alternatives to neoliberalism, 
has also invited communist party members from China, Libya and Cuba, 
triggering heightened fears of subversion among El Salvador's security 
forces.

 To make matters a little more uneasy, only the previous week the 'Military 
Youth' organisation threatened to 'take control of the state' unless the 
government of President Armando Calderon Sol did not 'restore order', tackle 
social unrest, and investigating corruption charges against, amongst others, 
former president Alfredo Cristiani.

 GUYANA/ Floods. President Cheddi Jagan declared a State of National 
Emergency in mid-July after several months of some of the heaviest rainfall 
ever recorded in the country caused widespread flooding in coastal and 
riverside regions. All major rivers have burst their banks, affecting 30,000 
people and destroying swathes of rice crops, livestock and the Indian 
groups' staple, cassava. Army and police are supporting flood relief workers 
distributing food and medicine donated by the government and the 
international community.

 PERU/ Ratings slip. Public approval of President Alberto Fujimori's 
government fell to 56.3% in July, 3.5% less than in the previous month, 
according to an opinion poll by Analistas y Consultores. The number of those 
who disapprove of his record rose to 36%, six percentage points up on June.

 The ratings slip, however, came at the same time as Peru climbed two places 
on the UN's Human Development scale to 91st position, while UNICEF announced 
an US Dollars 8m health, education and nutrition programme for children.

 VENEZUELA/ Neighbour dispute. A new offensive in the war of words between 
Colombia and Venezuela over guerrilla activities in their common border 
region was launched in Caracas when the press reported a speech by President 
Ernesto Samper accusing corrupt elements of the Venezuelan army of selling 
arms to Colombian insurgents and drug-traffickers. The comments in fact came 
from a non-official report, according to Samper, who also released a veiled 
apology. But the duel has already soured Colombia's new foreign minister, 
Maria Mejia's imminent trip to Caracas to arrange a bilateral summit, the 
first since 1994.

 Minister sacked. President Rafael Caldera dismissed the justice minister, 
Enrique Meier, on 17 July, for his outspoken criticism of his predecessor, 
Rubens Creixems. Meier had only held the post since mid-March.

 REGION/ Oil Pact. Haiti and Panama are to rejoin the nine other Central 
American and Caribbean member states of the Venezuelan and Mexican Energy 
Co-operation Programme later this month. Under the scheme, quotas of oil and 
its derivatives are sold to the beneficiary nations with 20% of the cost 
returned as super-soft loans for development projects. Haiti and Panama had 
been suspended for overdue credit repayments.

Aeromexico to Cut Costs

     Aerovias de Mexico (Aeromexico) has launched a cost reduction
program as well as a program to expand its charter flight services
in the United States and Canada.

     The program will be fully implemented by the end of the third
quarter.  The target is a reduction of 4 percent of the airline's
monthly expenses, resulting in savings of about US$3 million a
month.  Measures include reducing the costs of:  fuel consumption
by 1.5 percent through preferred fuel loadings and rationalization
of reserve fuel loadings; leases by 4 percent by extending and
refinancing leases and reducing the amounts of the credit letters
(a project that started six months ago); workforce by 12 percent;
ramp services by 3 percent via a joint venture with ASA and
MEXICANA solely to provide these services; and, maintenance per
hour by 17 percent through the reduction of the number of full-time
employees and better scheduling of maintenance services.

     This winter Aeromexico will begin service to Toronto, Vancouver,
Winnipeg and elsewhere in Canada, and in the northern U.S., to
Seattle, Portland and other destinations.

Border Toxics Case:  Keelco Anodes

     Two brothers, Donald and Ed Huseman of Palos Verdes, California,
have been arrested for the alleged illegal disposal, storage and
transportation of hazardous lead wastes in Southern California and
Mexico.  Felony charges against the two were brought as a result of
a combined investigation by the California state  Department of
Toxic Substances Control and the Los Angeles County District
Attorney.

     The Husemans own and operate Keelco Anodes Inc. of Wilmington,
California.  A third individual named in the complaint, Jose Kahn,
owner and operator of New Frontier Trading Corp of San Diego was
reported planning to surrender to authorities.

     Keelco manufactures lead keels for boats and lead anodes used in
refining copper from ore.  Keelco and the Husemans are charged with
unlawfully disposing of lead waste on the ground at the Wilmington
site and at Quay Street, adjacent to the business.  Keelco
employees were unnecessarily exposed to friable waste lead
grindings and that the waste was stored on site illegally for more
than 90 days at a time.

     New Frontier Trading Corp. is a metals brokerage that purchases
waste lead from Keelco and other entities and arranges for its
transportation to Metales y Derivados, a smelter in Tijuana.

An Overview:  Part I

The NAFTA negotiations have been completed and a draft of the
Agreement released.  With this issue MTLR begins a series of
articles providing a broad overview of the content and terms of the
NAFTA.  In the coming months, MTRL will also publish in-depth
analysis of the individual NAFTA chapters.


     A North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will create a free
trade area of 360 million people comprising a market of over US$6
trillion.  Mexico will benefit through substantially increased
economic growth and opportunities; Canada and the U.S. will benefit
economically, as well as politically from a more stable Mexico as
neighbor.

                Objectives

     The opening provisions of the NAFTA formally establish a free
trade area between Canada, Mexico and the United States, consistent
with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  They set
out the basic rules and principles that will govern the Agreement
and the objectives that will serve as the basis for interpreting
its provisions.

     The objectives of NAFTA are to eliminate barriers to trade,
promote conditions of fair competition, increase investment
opportunities, provide adequate protection for intellectual
property rights, establish effective procedures for the
implementation and application of NAFTA and for the resolution of
disputes and to further trilateral, regional and multilateral
cooperation.  The NAFTA countries will meet these objectives by
observing the principles and rules of the Agreement, such as
national treatment, most-favored-nation treatment and procedural
"transparency."

     Each country affirms its respective rights and obligations under
the GATT and other international agreements.  For purposes of
interpretation, the Agreement establishes that the NAFTA takes
priority over other agreements to the extent there is any conflict,
but provides for exceptions to this general rule.  For example, the
trade provisions of certain environmental agreements take
precedence over NAFTA, subject to a requirement to minimize incon-
sistencies with the Agreement.

     The opening provisions also set out a general rule regarding the
application of the Agreement to subfederal levels of government in
the three countries.  In addition, this section defines terms that
apply to the whole Agreement, to ensure uniform and consistent
usage.

                Rules of Origin

     NAFTA eliminates all tariffs on goods originating in Canada,
Mexico and the United States over a "transition period."  Rules of
origin are necessary to define which goods are eligible for this
preferential tariff treatment.

     This section of the Agreement is designed to:

*    ensure that NAFTA benefits are accorded only to goods produced
     in the North American region -- not goods made wholly or in
     large part in other countries;

*    provide clear rules and predictable results; and

*    minimize administrative burdens for exporters, importers and
     producers trading under NAFTA.

     The rules of origin specify that goods originate in North
America if they are wholly North American.  Goods containing non-
regional materials are also considered to be North American if the
non-regional materials are sufficiently transformed in the NAFTA
region so as to undergo a specified change in tariff
classification.  In some cases, goods must include a specified
percentage of North American content in addition to meeting the
tariff classification requirement.  The rules of origin section
also contains a provision similar to one in the Canada-United
States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that allows goods to be treated
as originating when the finished good is specifically named in the
same tariff subheading as its parts and it meets the required value
content test.

     Regional value content may be calculated using either the
"transaction-value" or the "net-cost" method.  The transaction-
value method is based on the price paid or payable for a good; this
avoids the need for a complex cost accounting system.  The net-cost
method is based on the total cost of the good less the costs of
royalties, sales promotion, and packaging and shipping.
Additionally, the net-cost method sets a limitation on allowable
interest.  Although producers generally have the option to use
either method, the net-cost method must be used where the
transaction value is not acceptable under the GATT Customs
Valuation Code, and must also be used for certain products, such as
automotive goods.

     In order to qualify for preferential tariff treatment,
automotive goods must contain a specified percentage of North
American content (rising to 62.5 percent for passenger automobiles
and light trucks as well as engines and transmissions for such
vehicles, and to 60 percent for other vehicles and automotive
parts) based on the net-cost formula.  In calculating the content
level of automotive goods, the value of automotive parts from
outside the NAFTA region will be traced through the production
chain to improve the accuracy of the content calculation.  Regional
content averaging provisions afford administrative flexibility for
automotive parts producers and assemblers.

     A de minimis rule prevents goods from losing eligibility for
preference solely because they contain minimal amounts of "non-
originating" material.  Under this rule, a good that would
otherwise fail to meet a specific rule of origin will nonetheless
be considered to be North American if the value of non-NAFTA
materials comprises no more than seven percent of the price or
total cost of the good.

                Customs Administration

     In order to ensure that only goods satisfying the rules of
origin standards are accorded preferential tariff treatment under
the Agreement, and to provide certainty to and streamlined
procedures for importers, exporters and producers in the three
countries, the NAFTA includes a number of provisions on customs
administration.  Specifically, this section provides for:


*    uniform regulations to ensure consistent interpretation,
     application and administration of the rules of origin;

*    a uniform Certificate of Origin as well as certification
     requirements and procedures for importers and exporters that
     claim preferential tariff treatment;

*    common record-keeping requirements in the three countries for
     such goods;

*    rules for both traders and customs authorities with respect to
     verifying the origin of such goods;

*    importers, exporters and producers to obtain advance rulings on
     the origin of goods from the customs authority of the country
     into which the goods are to be imported;

*    the importing country to give exporters and producers in other
     NAFTA countries substantially the same rights of review and
     appeal of its origin determinations and advance rulings as it
     provides to importers in its territory;

*    a trilateral working group to address future modifications of
     the rules of origin and the uniform regulations; and

*    specific time periods to ensure the expeditious resolution of
     disputes regarding the rules of origin between NAFTA partners.

                Trade in Goods

     The NAFTA incorporates the fundamental national treatment
obligation of the GATT.  Once goods have been imported into one
NAFTA country from another NAFTA country, they must not be the
object of discrimination.  This commitment extends to provincial
and state measures.

Market Access

     These provisions establish rules governing trade in goods with
respect to customs duties and other charges, quantitative
restrictions, such as quotas, licenses and permits, and import and
export price requirements.  They improve and make more secure the
access for goods produced and traded within North America.

Elimination of Tariffs.  The NAFTA provides for the progressive
elimination of all tariffs on goods qualifying as North American
under its rules of origin.  For most goods, existing customs duties
will either be eliminated immediately or phased out in five or ten
equal annual stages.  For certain sensitive items, tariffs will be
phased out over a period of up to fifteen years.  Tariffs will be
phased out from the applied rates in effect on July 1, 1991,
including the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the
Canadian General Preferential Tariff (GPT) rates.  Tariff phase-
outs under the Canada-U.S. FTA will continue as scheduled under
that agreement.  The NAFTA provides that the three countries may
consult and agree on a more rapid phase-out of tariffs.

Import and Export Restrictions.  All three countries will eliminate
prohibitions and quantitative restrictions applied at the border,
such as quotas and import licenses.  However, each NAFTA country
maintains the right to impose border restrictions in limited
circumstances, for example, to protect human, animal or plant life
or health, or the environment.  Special rules apply to trade in
agriculture, autos, energy and textiles.

Drawback.  NAFTA establishes rules on the use of "drawback" or
similar programs that provide for the refund or waiver of customs
duties on materials used in the production of goods subsequently
exported to another NAFTA country.

     Existing drawback programs will terminate by January 1, 2001,
for Mexico-U.S. and Canada-Mexico trade; the Agreement will extend
for two years the deadline established in the Canada-U.S. FTA for
the elimination of drawback programs.  At the time these programs
are eliminated, each NAFTA country will adopt a procedure for goods
still subject to duties in the free trade area to avoid the "double
taxation" effects of the payment of duties in two countries.

     Under these procedures, the amount of customs duties that a
country may waive or refund under such programs will not exceed the
lesser of:


*    duties owed or paid on imported, non-North American materials
     used in the production of a good subsequently exported to
     another NAFTA country; or

*    duties paid to that NAFTA country on the importation of such
     good.

Customs User Fees.  The three countries have agreed not to impose
new customs user fees similar to the U.S. merchandise processing
fee or the Mexican customs processing fee (derechos de tramite
aduanero).  Mexico will eliminate by June 30, 1999, its existing
customs processing fee on North American goods.  The United States
will eliminate its current merchandise processing fee on goods
originating in Mexico by the same date.  For goods originating in
Canada, the United States currently is phasing down and will
eliminate this fee by January 1, 1994, as provided for in the
Canada-U.S. FTA.

Waiver of Customs Duties.  The NAFTA prohibits any new performance-
based customs duty waiver or duty remission programs.  Existing
programs in Mexico will be eliminated by January 1, 2001.
Consistent with the obligations of the Canada-U.S. FTA, Canada will
end its existing duty remission programs by January 1, 1998.

Export Taxes.  The NAFTA prohibits all three countries from
applying export taxes unless such taxes are also applied on goods
to be consumed domestically.  Limited exceptions allow Mexico to
impose export taxes in order to relieve critical shortages of
foodstuffs and basic goods.

Other Export Measures.  When a NAFTA country imposes an export
restriction on a product, it must not reduce the proportion of
total supply of that product made available to the other NAFTA
countries below the level of the preceding three years or other
agreed period; impose a higher price on exports to another NAFTA
country than the domestic price; or require the disruption of
normal supply channels.  Based on a reservation that Mexico has
taken, these obligations do not apply as between Mexico and the
other NAFTA countries.

Duty-Free Temporary Admission of Goods.  The Agreement allows
business persons covered by NAFTA's "temporary entry" provisions to
bring into a NAFTA country professional equipment and "tools of the
trade" on a duty-free, temporary basis.  These rules also cover the
importation of commercial samples, certain types of advertising
films, and goods imported for sports purposes or for display and
demonstration.  Other rules provide that by 1998 all goods that are
returned after repair or alteration in another NAFTA country will
re-enter duty-free.  The United States undertakes to clarify what
ship repairs done in other NAFTA countries on U.S.-flagged vessels
qualify for preferential duty treatment.

Country-of-Origin Marking.  This section also provides principles
and rules governing country-of-origin marking.  These provisions
are designed to minimize unnecessary costs and facilitate the flow
of trade within the region, while ensuring that accurate infor-
mation about the country of origin remains available to purchasers.

Alcoholic Beverages -- Distinctive Products.  The three countries
have agreed to recognize Canadian Whiskey, Tequila, Mexcal, Bourbon
Whiskey and Tennessee Whiskey as "distinctive products" and to
prohibit the sale of products under these names unless they meet
the requirements of their country of origin.

                Textiles and Apparel

     This section of the NAFTA provides special rules for trade in
fibers, yarns, textiles and clothing in the North American market.
The NAFTA textiles and apparel provisions take precedence over
those of the Multifiber Arrangement and other agreements between
NAFTA countries applicable to textile products.

Elimination of Tariff and Non-Tariff Barriers

     The three countries will eliminate immediately or phase out over
a maximum period of ten years their customs duties on textile and
apparel goods manufactured in North America that meet the NAFTA
rules of origin.  In addition, the United States will immediately
remove import quotas on such goods produced in Mexico, and will
gradually phase out import quotas on Mexican textile and apparel
goods that do not meet such rules.  No NAFTA country may impose any
new quota, except in accordance with specified "safeguard"
provisions.

Safeguards

     If textile or apparel producers face serious damage as a result
of increased imports from another NAFTA country, the importing
country may, during the "transition period," either increase
tariffs or, with the exception of Canada-U.S. trade, impose quotas
on the imports to provide temporary relief to that industry,
subject to specific disciplines.  In the case of goods that meet
NAFTA's rules of origin, the importing country may take safeguard
actions only in the form of tariff increases.

Rules of Origin

     Specific rules of origin in the NAFTA define when imported
textile or apparel goods qualify for preferential treatment.  For
most products, the rule of origin is "yarn forward," which means
that textile and apparel goods must be produced from yarn made in
a NAFTA country in order to benefit from such treatment.  A "fiber
forward" rule is provided for certain products such as cotton and
man-made fiber yarns.  Fiber forward means that goods must be
produced from fiber made in a NAFTA country.  In other cases,
apparel cut and sewn from certain imported fabrics that the NAFTA
countries agree are in short supply, such as silk, linen and
certain shirting fabrics, can qualify for preferential treatment.

     Additional provisions, responsive to the needs of North American
industry, include "tariff rate quotas" (TRQs), under which yarns,
fabrics and apparel that are made in North America, but that do not
meet the rules of origin, can still qualify for preferential duty
treatment up to specified import levels.  The TRQs for Canada that
were included in the Canada-U.S. FTA have been increased and
provide for an annual growth rate for at least the first five
years.

     The NAFTA countries will undertake a general review of the
textile and apparel rules of origin prior to January 1, 1998.  In
the interim, they will consult on request on whether specific goods
should be made subject to different rules of origin, taking into
account the availability of supply within the free trade area.  In
addition, the three countries have established a process to permit
annual adjustments to TRQ levels.

Labelling Requirements

     A joint government and private sector Committee on Labelling for
Textile Products will recommend ways to eliminate unnecessary
obstacles to textile trade resulting from different labelling
requirements in the three countries through a work program to
develop uniform labelling requirements, for example regarding
pictograms and symbols, care instructions, fiber content
information and methods for attachment of labels.

                Automotive Goods

     The NAFTA will eliminate barriers to trade in North American
automobiles, trucks, buses and parts (automotive goods) within the
free trade area, and eliminate investment restrictions in this
sector, over a ten-year transition period.

Tariff Elimination

     Each NAFTA country will phase out all duties on its imports of
North American automotive goods during the transition period.  Most
trade in automotive goods between Canada and the United States is
conducted on a duty-free basis under the terms of either the
Canada-U.S. FTA or the Canada-U.S. "Autopact."

Vehicles.  Canada and the United States eliminated tariffs on their
trade in vehicles under the Canada-U.S. FTA.  Under the NAFTA, for
its imports from Mexico, the United States will:


*    eliminate immediately its tariffs on passenger automobiles;

*    reduce immediately to ten percent its tariffs on light trucks
     and phase out the remaining tariffs over five years; and

*    phase out its tariffs on other vehicles over ten years.

     For imports from Canada and the United States, Mexico will:


*    reduce immediately by 50 percent its tariffs on passenger
     automobiles and phase out the remaining tariffs over 10 years;

*    reduce immediately by 50 percent its tariffs on light trucks and
     phase out the remaining tariffs over five years; and

*    phase out its tariffs on all other vehicles over ten years.

     Canada will eliminate its tariffs on vehicles imported from
Mexico on the same schedule as Mexico will follow for imports from
Canada and the United States.

Parts.  Each country will eliminate its remaining tariffs on
certain automotive parts immediately and phase out duties on other
parts over five years and a small portion over ten years.

Rules of Origin

     The NAFTA rules of origin section provides that in order to
qualify for preferential tariff treatment, automotive goods must
contain a specified percentage of North American content (rising to
62.5 percent for passenger automobiles and light trucks as well as
engines and transmissions for such vehicles, and to 60 percent for
other vehicles and automotive parts) based on the net-cost formula.
In calculating the content level of automotive goods, the value of
imports of automotive parts from outside the NAFTA region will be
traced through the production chain to improve the accuracy of the
content calculation.

Mexican Auto Decree

     The Mexican Auto Decree will terminate at the end of the
transition period.  Over this period, the restrictions under the
Auto Decree will be modified by:


*    eliminating immediately the limitation on imports of vehicles
     based on sales in the Mexican market;

*    amending its "trade balancing" requirements immediately to
     permit assemblers to reduce gradually the level of exports of
     vehicles and parts required to import such goods, and
     eliminating, at the end of the transition period, the
     requirement that only assemblers in Mexico may import vehicles;

*    changing its "national value-added" rules by reducing gradually
     the percentage of parts required to be purchased from Mexican
     parts producers; by counting purchases from certain in-bond
     production facilities (maquiladoras) toward this percentage; by
     ensuring that Canadian, Mexican and U.S. parts manufacturers may
     participate in the growing Mexican market on a competitive
     basis, while requiring assemblers in Mexico during the
     transition period to continue to purchase parts from Mexican
     parts producers; and by eliminating at the end of the transition
     period the national value-added requirement.

Mexican Auto-Transportation Decree

     The Mexican Auto-Transportation Decree covering trucks (other
than light trucks) and buses will be eliminated immediately, and
replaced with a transitional system of quotas in effect for five
years.

Imports of Used Vehicles

     Canada's remaining restrictions on the import of used motor
vehicles from the United States will be eliminated on January 1,
1994, in accordance with the Canada-U.S. FTA.  Beginning 15 years
after the NAFTA goes into effect, Canada will phase out over ten
years its prohibition on imports of Mexican used motor vehicles.
Mexico will phase out its prohibition on imports of North American
used vehicles over the same period.

Investment Restrictions

     In accordance with the NAFTA's investment provisions, Mexico
will immediately permit "NAFTA investors" to make investments of up
to 100 percent in Mexican "national suppliers" of parts, and up to
49 percent in other automotive parts enterprises, increasing to 100
percent after five years.  Mexico's thresholds for the screening of
takeovers in the automotive sector will be governed by NAFTA's
investment provisions.

Corporate Average Fuel Economy Fleet Content

     Under the NAFTA, the United States will modify the fleet content
definition found in its Corporate Average-Fuel Economy (CAFE)
rules, so that vehicle manufacturers may choose to have those
Mexican-produced parts and vehicles they export to the United
States classified as domestic.  After ten years, Mexican production
exported to the United States will receive the same treatment as
U.S. or Canadian production for purposes of CAFE.  Canadian-
produced automobiles currently may be classified as domestic for
CAFE purposes.  The NAFTA does not change the minimum fuel economy
standards for vehicles sold in the United States.

Automotive Standards

     The NAFTA creates a special intergovernmental group to review
and make recommendations on federal automotive standards in the
three countries, including recommendations to achieve greater
compatibility in such standards.

                Energy and Basic Petrochemicals

     This section sets out the rights and obligations of the three
countries regarding crude oil, gas, refined products, basic
petrochemicals, coal, electricity and nuclear energy.

     In the NAFTA, the countries confirm their full respect for their
constitutions.  They also recognize the desirability of
strengthening the important role that trade in energy and basic
petrochemical goods plays in the North American region and of
enhancing this role through sustained and gradual liberalization.

     The NAFTA's energy provisions incorporate and build on GATT
disciplines regarding quantitative restrictions on imports and
exports as they apply to energy and basic petrochemical trade.  The
NAFTA provides that under these disciplines a country may not
impose minimum or maximum import or export price requirements,
subject to the same exceptions that apply to quantitative
restrictions.  The NAFTA also makes clear that each country may
administer export and import licensing systems, provided that they
are operated in a manner consistent with the provisions of the
Agreement.  In addition, no country may impose a tax, duty or
charge on the export of energy or basic petrochemical goods unless
the same tax, duty or charge is applied to such goods when consumed
domestically.

     This section also provides that import and export restrictions
on energy trade will be limited to certain specific circumstances,
such as to conserve exhaustible natural resources, deal with a
short-supply situation or implement a price stabilization plan.

     Further, when a NAFTA country imposes any such restriction, it
must not reduce the proportion of total supply made available to
the other NAFTA countries below the level of the preceding three
years or other agreed period, impose a higher price on exports to
another NAFTA country than the domestic price or require the
disruption of normal supply channels.  Based on a reservation that
Mexico has taken, these obligations do not apply as between Mexico
and the other NAFTA countries.

     This section also limits the grounds on which a NAFTA country
may restrict exports or imports of energy or basic petrochemical
goods for reasons of national security.  However, based on a
reservation that Mexico has taken, energy trade between Mexico and
the other NAFTA countries will not be subject to this discipline,
but will instead be governed by the Agreement's general national
security provision, described in the "Exceptions" section.

     The NAFTA confirms that energy regulatory measures are subject
to the Agreement's general rules regarding national treatment,
import and export restrictions and export taxes.  The three
countries also agree that the implementation of regulatory measures
should be undertaken in a manner that recognizes the importance of
a stable regulatory environment.

     In the NAFTA, Mexico reserves to the Mexican State goods,
activities and investments in Mexico in the oil, gas, refining,
basic petrochemicals, nuclear and electricity sectors.

     The NAFTA energy provisions recognize new private investment
opportunities in Mexico in non-basic petrochemical goods and in
electricity generating facilities for "own use," cogeneration and
independent power production by allowing NAFTA investors to
acquire, establish and operate facilities in these activities.
Investment in non-basic petrochemical goods is governed by the
general provisions of the Agreement.

     To promote cross-border trade in natural gas and basic
petrochemicals, NAFTA provides that state enterprises, end users
and suppliers have the right to negotiate supply contracts.  In
addition, independent power producers, CFE (Mexico's state-owned
electricity firm) and electric utilities in other NAFTA countries
also have the right to negotiate power purchase and sale contracts.

     Each country will also allow its state enterprises to negotiate
performance clauses in their service contracts.

     Certain specific commitments relating to special aspects of
Canada-U.S. energy trade, set out in the Energy Chapter of the
Canada-U.S. FTA, will continue to apply between the two countries.

                Agriculture

     The NAFTA sets out separate bilateral undertakings on cross-
border trade in agricultural products, one between Canada and
Mexico, and the other between Mexico and the United States.  Both
include a special transitional safeguard mechanism.  As a general
matter, the rules of the Canada-U.S. FTA on tariff and nontariff
barriers will continue to apply to agricultural trade between
Canada and the United States.  Trilateral provisions in the NAFTA
address domestic support for agricultural goods and agricultural
export subsidies.

Tariffs and Nontariff Barriers

Trade between Mexico and the United States.  When the Agreement
goes into effect, Mexico and the United States will eliminate
immediately all nontariff barriers to their agricultural trade,
generally through their conversion to either "tariff-rate quotas"
(TRQs) or ordinary tariffs.

     The TRQs will facilitate the transition for producers of import-
sensitive products in each country.  No tariffs will be imposed on
imports within the quota amount.  The quantity eligible to enter
duty-free under the TRQ will be based on recent average trade
levels and will grow generally at three percent per year.  The
over-quota duty -- initially established at a level designed to
equal the existing tariff value of each non-tariff barrier -- will
progressively decline to zero during either a ten- or fifteen-year
period, depending on the product.

     Under the NAFTA, Mexico and the United States will eliminate
immediately tariffs on a broad range of agricultural products.
This means that roughly one-half of U.S.-Mexico bilateral
agricultural trade will be duty-free when the Agreement goes into
effect.  All tariff barriers between Mexico and the United States
will be eliminated no later than ten years after the Agreement
takes effect, with the exception of duties on certain highly
sensitive products -- including corn and dry beans for Mexico, and
orange juice and sugar for the United States.  Tariff phase-outs on
these few remaining products will be completed after five more
years.

     Mexico and the United States will gradually liberalize bilateral
trade in sugar.  Both countries will apply TRQs of equivalent
effect on third country sugar by the sixth year after the Agreement
goes into effect.  All restrictions on trade in sugar between the
two countries will be eliminated by the end of the fifteen-year
transition period, except that sugar exported under the U.S. Sugar
Re-Export Program will remain subject to most-favored-nation (MFN)
tariff rates.

Trade between Canada and Mexico.  Canada and Mexico will eliminate
all tariff and nontariff barriers on their agricultural trade, with
the exception of those in the dairy, poultry, egg and sugar
sectors.

     Canada will immediately exempt Mexico from import restrictions
covering wheat, barley and their products, beef and veal, and
margarine.  Canada and Mexico will eliminate immediately or phase
out within five years tariffs on many fruit and vegetable products,
while tariffs on remaining fruit and vegetable products will be
phased out over ten years.  A small number of these products will
be subject to the special transitional safeguard described below.

     Other than in the dairy, poultry and egg sectors, Mexico will
replace its import licenses with tariffs, for example on wheat, or
TRQs, for example respecting corn and barley.  These tariffs will
generally be phased out over a ten-year period.

Special Safeguard Provision

     During the first ten years the Agreement is in effect, the NAFTA
provides a special safeguard provision that applies to certain
products within the scope of the bilateral undertakings described
above.  A NAFTA country may invoke the mechanism where imports of
such products from the other country reach "trigger" levels set out
in the Agreement.  In such circumstances, the importing country may
apply the tariff rate in effect at the time the Agreement went into
effect or the then-current MFN rate, whichever is lower.  This
tariff rate may be applied for the remainder of the season or the
calendar year, depending on the product.  The trigger levels will
increase over this ten-year period.

Domestic Support

     Recognizing both the importance of domestic support measures to
their respective agricultural sectors and the potential effect of
such measures on trade, each of the NAFTA countries will endeavor
to move toward domestic support policies that are not trade-
distorting.  In addition, the three countries recognize that a
country may change its domestic support mechanisms so long as such
change is in compliance with applicable GATT obligations.

Export Subsidies

     Recognizing that the use of export subsidies within the free
trade area is inappropriate except to counter subsidized imports
from a non-NAFTA country, the Agreement provides that:

*    a NAFTA exporting country must give three-days' notice of its
     intent to introduce a subsidy on agricultural exports to another
     NAFTA country;

*    when an exporting NAFTA country believes that another NAFTA
     country is importing non-NAFTA agricultural goods that benefit
     from export subsidies, it may request consultations on measures
     the importing country could take against such subsidized
     imports; and

*    if the importing country adopts mutually agreed upon measures to
     counter that subsidy, the NAFTA exporting country will not
     introduce its own export subsidy.

     Building on the bilateral discipline on export subsidies in the
Canada-U.S. FTA, the three countries will work toward the
elimination of export subsidies in North American agricultural
trade in pursuit of their objective of eliminating such subsidies
worldwide.

Agricultural Marketing Standards

     The NAFTA provides that when either Mexico or the United States
applies a measure regarding the classification, grading or
marketing of a domestic agricultural product, it will provide no
less favorable treatment to like products imported from the other
country for processing.

Resolution of Commercial Disputes

     The three countries will work toward development of a mechanism
for resolving private cross-border commercial disputes involving
agricultural products.

Committee on Agricultural Trade

     A trilateral committee on agricultural trade will monitor the
implementation and administration of this section.  In addition, a
Mexico-U.S. working group and a Canada-Mexico working group will be
established under the committee to review the operation of grade
and quality standards.

three signatory countries.

Structural Implications of NAFTA

by Ewell E. Murphy, Jr., Esq.

     If the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) succeeds, it
will change the economic geography of our hemisphere, creating a
new North America in which goods and investment will move among
Mexico, Canada and the United States with unprecedented ease.  How
will that affect the structuring of Mexican business operations in
the United States?

                Are joint ventures passe?

     Transnationally, "joint ventures" blossomed in the disruptive
1970s.  They were born of protectionist legal systems that
prevented the foreign investor from controlling the corporation in
which he invested -- such systems as Malaysian Bumiputra, African
"Nigerianization" and Mexico's Echeverrian Investment Law, which in
most industrial sectors limited foreigners to 49 percent of the
equity.

     To sugarcoat such forced marriages, they were named joint
ventures, a label intrinsically false.  The dictionary tells us
that "joint" means sharing or acting in common, and "common" means
belonging equally to, or shared alike by all in question, but a
joint venture neither equally belongs nor is shared alike.
Corporate shares that, held by foreigners, are forever incapable of
being joined with other shares to achieve a wholly-owned subsid-
iary, or even 51 percent control, are in fact second-class shares.
All participants in a joint venture are equal, but some (the
favored local citizens) are more equal than others.

     When structured in a close ownership percentage such as 51/49,
a "joint venture" is inherently difficult to manage over any
considerable period, especially when its investors are from dif-
ferent legal and cultural systems.  Absent legislative coercion
like the Echeverrian Investment Law, there is little compelling
reason for foreign investment to be structured that way,
either in Mexico or in the United States.  Each investment, of
course, must be designed to meet its unique business objectives,
but I suspect that, as a general proposition and over appreciable
time, both sides of the Rio Grande will see fewer such joint
ventures during the NAFTA years.

                Owned or Supervised Distribution

     Another traditional structure that NAFTA will probably make less
typical is Mexican export F.O.B. the border.  All too frequently
that structure has characterized Mexican sales for the U.S. market.
Under it, the Mexican manufacturer sells for export and is paid in
dollars, but leaves actual foreign market penetration to the
purchaser.  After getting the product into the hands of a customs
broker in, say, Nuevo Laredo, the Mexican manufacturer calls it a
day, draws down his dollars, and goes home.

     That structure allocates to the purchaser the risks and
responsibilities of the U.S. market, to be sure, but it also
allocates to him the corresponding value-added.  Consequently the
Mexican manufacturer is an exporter in name only, both as to risks
and as to return.

     One can only speculate why the structure of sales F.O.B. the
border is so prevalent in Mexico.  One reason, perhaps, is that
historically Mexican exports have tended to be raw, semifinished or
fungible products -- metals, ores, cotton, hydrocarbons and the
like -- whose producers had no name~recognition by export
consumers.  Another reason, probably, is the cost and complexity of
financing intermediate distribution.  The legal and practical
aspects of conducting business in the U.S. were no doubt a factor
as well.

     In recent years Mexican manufacturers have begun to overcome
there doubts and concerns, and are penetrating the U.S. export
market more effectively.  A typical new structure is the wholly-
owned distribution subsidiary, which receives the product from its
Mexican manufacturing parent at the Mexican plant or the border and
handles directly all subsequent warehousing and sales to
distributors, dealers or consumers in the United States.  Another
new structure is supervised distribution, under which the Mexican
manufacturer sells to an unrelated U.S. importer at the plant or
border, but also maintains in the United States its own U.S.
subsidiary to check on the importer's efforts and to keep the
Mexican manufacturer directly informed of the U.S. market.  Under
NAFTA, such structures of owned or supervised distribution will
likely become more customary and will bring more value-added back
to Mexico.

                Strategic Alliances

     A more sophisticated prototype for Mexican investment structures
in the new North America is the strategic alliance.  This ingenious
arrangement is designed to coordinate the efforts of two or more
companies in correlative markets.

     Imagine, for example, a U.S. company that is in the top echelon
of its industry in the United States, is fairly competitive but by
no means dominant in Europe, and in Japan is technically able to
perform but feels ostracized by business practices that favor
Japanese companies.  Imagine, in the same industry, a German
company that is well recognized in Europe, somewhat competitive in
the United States, but similarly defensive in Japan.  Add a
Japanese company that leads the industry in Japan but is a newcomer
to Europe and the United States.  How can those three companies
grow in each other's home markets?  One way is to bash ahead
unilaterally, each the best it can.  Another way is through
aggressive attempts at hostile take-over.  A third is by strategic
alliance.

     Strategic alliance structures are infinitely variable, but in
our example each of the three companies might acquire small
minority interests -- say, 10 percent or 20 percent -- in each
other.  At the same time they probably would cross-license certain
technology.  They might also agree to cooperate in bids on projects
of certain types, especially where each can make a unique contribu-
tion, and perhaps arrange to coordinate procurement and training.
If they are manufacturers, they probably would add reciprocal
supply contracts.

     Strategic alliances are not easy to plan or document.  They
require careful legal thinking, especially in antitrust and
intellectual property law.  If successful, however, they offer an
imaginative means for companies to grow, not at the expense or by
the destruction of each other, but by pooling complementary
strengths.

     Strategic alliances between Mexican and U.S. enterprises have
already begun, and it seems likely that a NAFTA will encourage
more.  Such arrangements offer more market scope than simple
wholly-owned subsidiaries and allow more effective management than
is afforded by "joint ventures" with close ownership percentages.
For leading companies that seek coordinated expansion in both the
Mexican and the U.S. markets, strategic alliances may be the
cutting edge of the NAFTA future.

Legal Considerations for Mexican Businesses in the United States

by Ewell E. Murphy, Jr., Esq.


     If the North American Free Trade Agreement is achieved it will
allow a Mexican business, if it is so minded, to go up, beyond the
river, and carry there all the goods and investment capital that it
can find.  And NAFTA will, in time, prohibit any toll, tribute or
custom upon the movement of those goods or capital.

     For Mexican exporters the Hispanic segment of the new NAFTA
market will be especially inviting.  The six states of the United
States over which the flag of Mexico once waved have a combined
population of some 55 million and an aggregate gross product of
nearly US$1 trillion -- equivalent to 60 percent of Mexico's
present population and more than five times its gross domestic
product. note 1  By race, second language, tradition, and proximity
these states are enthusiastically attuned to Mexican culture and
products.  They offer the Mexican exporter his first and easiest
success in the new North America.

     The market that NAFTA will create is, of course, much larger
than those former Mexican lands.  It will be all of North America,
which one projection places at 370 million human beings with a com-
bined gross domestic product of US$6 trillion, larger than the
present European Community. note 2   Some Mexican companies al-
ready, in advance of NAFTA, have made their mark in that larger
market.  Particularly notable are the Modelo breweries, whose
exports of Corona and other brands account for 11.7 percent of all
imported beers sold in the United States, second only to Heineken;
note 3 and Vitro, S.A., which in the acquisition of Anchor Glass
accomplished the first hostile Mexican takeover of a major U.S.
corporation, and with joint ventures with Corning, Inc., Whirlpool,
World Tableware International, and others, is well on its way to
becoming a full-fledged multinational corporation. note 4  Those
attainments in export and investment are persuasive prototypes of
success for Mexican industry in the new North America.

     To achieve that success, however, Mexican business must heed the
advice of Thomas Wolfe, who reminded us that "you can't go home
again."  The home we return to is never the same as the home we
left.  When Mexican business returns to its home beyond the river,
it will enter a world that is radically different, not only from
the world those six states knew under the Mexican flag, but also
from the present world below the Rio Grande.

     Of all the differences the Rio Grande delineates, none is more
striking than the contrasting legal systems of Mexico and the
United States.  Superficially that difference can be catalogued as
the distinction between the civil law and the common law, which
creates the dissimilarities that separate, say, Italy from Britain;
but the incongruities across the Rio Grande are much more profound.
Mexico not only inherited the civil law from Spain, but was
nurtured in a Castilian colonialism that regarded juridical and
economic order as something ordained from above, a commandment from
the ruler to the ruled.  The United States not only learned the
common law from England, but was molded by the rugged individualism
of the frontier into the world's most uncompromising advocate of
democratic initiative and free-market capitalism.

     Consequently, law occupies different dimensions of life above,
than it does below, the Rio Grande.  In Mexico, law is essentially
a vertical force that moves downward from government to people.
When Mexicans have problems with each other they may resort to law,
but usually they resolve their conflicts by other means.  They view
legal duties, fundamentally, not as obligations between individuals
but as exactions of the government.  If the government does not
effectively enforce a particular law, the peoples' response, in the
famous Mexican phrase, is acatar pero no obedecer (respecting but
not complying). note 5

     In sharp contrast, above the Rio Grande law occupies both the
horizontal and the vertical dimensions of life, and vertically it
moves up as well as down.  When people have problems with each
other their first impulse is civil suit.  ("I'll take you to
court!").  If that remedy seems insufficient, they invoke the
government against each other by means of criminal prosecution.
("I'll get the law on you!").  If neither recourse suffices, they
insist that their elected legislators create a new legal remedy.
("There ought to be a law!").  Most significantly, in the United
States the factual application of any law is subject to the concur-
rence of randomly chosen representatives of the local citizenry:
horizontally by civil juries and vertically by the grand juries and
trial juries of criminal prosecution. note 6

                Cultural Shocks

     Those legal differences between Mexico and the United States
create many unpleasant surprises for a Mexican business first
entering the market beyond the river.  In particular, there are
three abrupt cultural shocks:  litigiousness, states' rights, and
compelled competition.

Litigiousness

       The first shock, litigiousness, is the most devastating.  This
characteristic of U.S. society has grown, in two centuries, from a
quaint rambunctiousness to an enormous problem.  With 90 percent of
all civil jury cases in the world tried in the United States,
Americans have been spending US$30 billion a year just suing each
other; between 1975 and 1985, U.S. liability awards in general rose
401 percent, and the number of product liability cases before U.S.
federal courts increased by 1,000 percent. note 7  The resulting
burden on industry is staggering.  The liability insurance costs of
U.S. manufacturers has increased 500 percent over ten years,
constituting, for example, 15 percent of the price of U.S.-made
machine tools and nearly 70 percent of the price of U.S.-made
tetanus vaccine, and demolishing entire product lines, such as
Cessna's single-engine airplanes. note 8

     In Mexico things are different; civil actions do not go to
juries, liability awards are typically for modest sums, and major
public issues are resolved, not by lawsuits, but by political
pressure and economic clout.  Consequently, Mexican entrepreneurs
are unprepared for the hair-trigger litigation and crippling jury
awards they may encounter in the United States.

     Anticipating and defending against Yankee litigiousness is a
principal objective of the investment structure -- the interrelated
framework of corporations and contracts -- by which a Mexican
enterprise achieves a business presence in the U.S. market.  Essen-
tially the structure's strategy is to wall off the main Mexican
enterprise from involvement in the United States.  In an export
structure, for example, the manufacturing source of the product and
its facilities for distribution within Mexico function in -- and
only in -- Mexico.  Distribution in the United States is restricted
to a separate subsidiary corporation whose objective is to limit
the liability of the manufacturing parent to the resources the
parent invests in that subsidiary.  The parent and the subsidiary
are related only by share ownership and by contracts consistent
with their roles.  In such a structure, for example, the parent
contracts to supply the subsidiary, in Mexico, with products; the
subsidiary exports the products from Mexico, imports them into the
United States, warehouses them as needed in the United States, and
resells them to subdistributors, dealers or consumers.  For
additional insulation a special-purpose Mexican export subsidiary
may be placed between the manufacturing parent in Mexico and the
distribution subsidiary in the United States.

     Among the basic risks to consider in planning such an export
structure are the jurisdictional laws of the states in which the
distribution subsidiary will resell.  An example is the Texas Long-
Arm Statute, note 9 which subjects to suit in Texas any corporation
that (1) "contracts by mail or otherwise with a Texas resident and
either party is to perform the contract in whole or in part in
[Texas]," (2) "commits a tort in whole or in part in [Texas]," or
(3) "recruits Texas residents, directly or through an intermediary
located in [Texas], for employment inside or outside [Texas]."

     As construed by the Texas Supreme Court, the Texas Long Arm
Statute is even more grasping than its terms, and will reach as far
as the U.S. Constitution permits.  By that rule, a Mexican
corporation can be sued in Texas if three conditions are met.
First, the corporation purposefully did some act or consummated
some transaction in Texas.  Second, either (a) the cause of action
arose from or was connected with that act or transaction or (b) the
corporation's contacts with Texas were continuing and systematic.
Third, the exercise of jurisdiction does not offend traditional
notions of fair play and substantial justice. note 10  Under that
reasoning, recent decisions reflect considerable willingness to
sustain Texas jurisdiction over corporations that make sales into
Texas, regardless of whether they conduct actual sales activities
within the state. note 11

     In the sober aftermath of the Bhopal disaster we realize, of
course, that some liabilities will pierce the most meticulously
crafted corporate and contractual veils.  The most ruthless
penetrator is product liability.  There the principal guidelines
are two decisions of the United States Supreme Court.  World-Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson note 12 permits product liability
jurisdiction to be asserted over any foreign exporter that delivers
its products into the "stream of commerce" with awareness that they
will be purchased by consumers in the forum state.  Asahi Metal
Industry Co., Ltd. v. Superior Court of California note 13 shields
from that rule certain component manufacturers who sell only to
primary manufacturers abroad.  For direct exporters to the United
States, however, the only reliable precaution is product liability
insurance covering the Mexican manufacturing parent and its entire
corporate group.

     If a Mexican corporation can jurisdictionally be reached for
suit in Texas, it can be sued in Texas on claims for wrongful death
or personal injury arising anywhere in the world.  That was the
startling result of the 1990 decision of the Texas Supreme Court in
Dow Chemical Co. v. Castro Alfaro, note 14 which held that, for
purposes of such claims, the doctrine of forum non conveniens,
under which courts may decline jurisdiction of foreign causes
because of injustice or inconvenience of trial, has been abolished
by statute in Texas.  That decision has made Texas a forum of great
attraction for foreign plaintiffs, and is a strong additional
reason for cautious structuring of Mexican business operations that
cross the Rio Grande.

     There are two helpful resources for contractually defining the
legal boundaries between a Mexican manufacturing parent and its
U.S. distribution subsidiary and between the subsidiary and its
purchasers.  The first is the United Nations Convention on Con-
tracts for the International Sale of Goods, to which Mexico and the
United States have both adhered.  The second is Incoterms, the
International Chamber of Commerce's standard published definitions
of basic trade terms.  A structure whose legal basis is the
Convention and whose points of sale are expressed in Incoterms can
be established by internationally comprehensible contracts that are
explicit but succinct.

     Although disputes with U.S. purchasers cannot be avoided, they
can be diverted to modes of confrontation less problematical than
litigation.  This is another area in which there is a helpful
treaty relationship between Mexico and the United States.  Both
nations adhere to the United Nations Arbitration Convention, and
are thus reciprocally obligated to enforce agreements to arbitrate
and to recognize arbitration awards.  This permits the distribution
subsidiary to ensure, by carefully drawn arbitration clauses, that
disputes arising under its sales contracts will be resolved by
arbitration at acceptable venues under acceptable law.
States' Rights

     The second shock the Mexican exporter encounters beyond the
river is that of states' rights of U.S. federalism.

     To the jaundiced eyes of U.S. lawyers, the Interstate Commerce
Clause and a permissive federal judiciary have well nigh
emasculated the Tenth Amendment, making the United States, for
business purposes, virtually a unitary nation.  But to the Mexican
entrepreneur the opposite seems true.  He planned to introduce his
product into one foreign nation, but to his astonishment he finds
that he confronts fifty-one of them:  fifty corporation laws; fifty
certificate of authority statutes; fifty state tax systems; fifty
state legislatures, judiciaries and executives; and, to make it
even more forbidding, a fifty-first umbrella of federal taxes, laws
and government over-arching all the rest.

     Mexico, by contrast, is a highly centralized nation.  Its
constitution is labeled "federal" but there the federalism ends.
It has one corporation law, one law for the establishment of
foreign enterprise, central control of most taxes, and a tradition
of national domination of the nominally separate states.  Small
wonder that Mexicans are stunned by the balkanized and discordant
system of state authority they encounter north of the Rio Grande.

     The Mexican entrepreneur can deal most effectively with U.S.
states' rights by visualizing the United States as fifty separate
markets, planning carefully in advance, in terms of compliance with
key state requirements, which of the fifty his product will enter.
Aside from product-specific regulations, those key state
requirements are, essentially, certificate of authority laws,
franchise taxes, and taxes generally.

     The Texas Certificate of Authority law, note 15 for example,
allows an uncertificated Mexican corporation to maintain local bank
accounts; to sell in Texas through "independent contractors;" to
create, secure and collect debts; to transact business in
interstate commerce; and to conduct "isolated transactions;" but
requires the corporation to obtain a Certificate of Authority to
"transact business" in Texas otherwise.  Cases have held that no
Certificate of Authority is required to sell into Texas by
interstate shipment on the basis of purchase orders obtained in
Texas but accepted outside. note 16  Consignment sales in Texas by
out-of-state consignors are similarly exempt. note 17

     Previously, the Texas franchise tax system was almost that
indulgent.  The statute note 18 simply said that franchise tax must
be paid by any foreign corporation that has a Texas Certificate of
Authority or "does business" in Texas, and administrative decisions
held that interstate commerce sales into Texas did not constitute
doing business provided they were not obtained by consignment or
regular solicitation within the state. note 19  Recently, however,
administrative rules note 20 of the Comptroller General began to
limit those immunities.  Those rules said that "[p]erformance of a
contract in Texas" or "[h]aving employees, independent contractors,
agents or other representatives in Texas" who "provide or induce
sales of the foreign corporation's goods or services" was "doing
business" for franchise tax purposes.

     Most sweeping of all was the rule of "constitutional nexus,"
which became effective in 1986.  It asserted that "A corporation is
doing business in Texas, for purposes of [franchise tax], when it
has constitutional nexus with Texas for the purpose of franchise
taxation."

     Finally, effective January 1, 1992 those encroaching rules were
replaced with an amendment of the statute itself, which now
provides that Texas franchise tax extends "to the limits of the
United States Constitution and federal law adopted under it." note
21

     For the movement of goods, those Constitutional limits were
drawn by the U.S. Supreme Court's "original package" cases (Brown
v. Maryland note 22 and Low v. Austin note 23) as refined by
Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, note 24 and Japan Line, Ltd. v.
County of Los Angeles. note 25  Those decisions exempt from state
taxation a vehicle or instrumentality of foreign commerce, but
allow a state to impose a nondiscriminatory tax on any goods --
imported or domestic -- that have come to rest in a warehouse
within the state.  In Texas the chief tax thus enabled is an annual
levy by counties and local tax authorities on the value of property
within the jurisdiction. note 26

     Another principal source of state and local revenues in Texas is
a sales tax note 27 analogous to, but simpler than, Mexican
Impuesto de Valor Agregado (IVA).

Compelled Competition

     The third shock of U.S. law to Mexican business is the ghost of
Adam Smith.  A fundamental stage direction of the U.S. legal drama
is the rule that its commercial actors must behave like freely-
competing characters from The Wealth of Nations.

     That rule is enforced chiefly by the federal antitrust laws,
which apply to export movements into the U.S. market as well as to
activities within it.  Exports to the United States are covered,
directly or indirectly, by the basic provisions of the Sherman Act
regarding combinations, note 28 the Federal Trade Commission Act
regarding unfair competition, note 29 and the Clayton Act regarding
acquisitions. note 30  Exporters to the United States are
explicitly addressed in the Wilson Tariff Act regarding price-
fixing in imported goods, note 31 and the Robinson-Patman
amendments to the Clayton Act regarding price discrimination and
exclusive dealing. note 32  Once Mexican products have reached the
United States they are subject, like all domestic products, to
general antitrust rules affecting exclusive distributorships, tying
clauses, resale price maintenance, and territorial and customer
restrictions.

     Similarly, when Mexican business engages in a merger,
acquisition or joint venture in the United States, it is subject to
the rules of U.S. antitrust laws against unlawful combinations.
For substantial transactions, that includes the premerger
notification rules of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, note 33 which
require participants in the proposed transaction to give advance
notice to the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of
Justice, allowing those agencies a specified period to determine
whether, in their view, the transaction would violate antitrust law
and if so to seek an injunction against it.

     Antitrust Guide for International Operations, a statement of
enforcement policy issued by the Department of Justice in 1988, is
a helpful guide to the transnational application of U.S. antitrust
laws.  In April 1992, however, the Department announced a partial
reversion to pre-1988 policy, in that combinations abroad that
limit the access of U.S. exports to foreign markets will be
prosecuted regardless of their effect on U.S. consumers. note 34

     The ghost of Adam Smith is also invoked, in the name of "fair
trade," to justify two U.S. penalties on inbound goods, although
most observers classify those penalties as market distortions
themselves.

     One is antidumping, a form of protectionism pioneered by the
United States note 35 and under which the U.S. has imposed more
penalties than any country in the world. note 36  By it, the United
States levies on the Mexican product an additional import duty
equal to the amount by which its value in the foreign market
exceeds its U.S. market price. note 37  The technicalities of that
determination are complicated, and the administrative procedures
for assessing and collecting the resulting duties are elaborate.
The only saving grace is that, to impose antidumping duties,
"material injury" to a U.S. industry must be shown.

     Another fair trade protectionism is countervailing duties. note
38  Here the law assesses penalty duties, not to offset lower
prices, but to compensate for government subsidies from which the
product benefited in its country of origin.  The United States has
the dubious distinction of having imposed more countervailing
duties than the rest of the world combined note 39 and, in fact, to
be the only nation to have used them extensively. note 40
Fortunately for Mexican exporters, a 1985 agreement between Mexico
and the United States note 41 placed Mexican products temporarily
within the protected category in which U.S. countervailing duties
may not be assessed unless the claimant proves material injury to
a U.S. industry.  Mexico's access to that category was confirmed in
1986 by Mexico's decision to join the GATT and accept its Subsidies
Code. note 42

     Any one of those three weapons -- antitrust, antidumping, or
countervailing duties -- is sufficient to bankrupt a business that
depends on the market distortions it forbids.  Against that risk
the only practical strategy of the Mexican entrepreneur is to
analyze -- candidly, carefully and in advance -- the extent to
which a project will involve such distortions.  If the project is
likely to be successfully challenged under antitrust law, it is
better never initiated.  If the project is vulnerable to
antidumping or countervailing duties, those duties and the ensuing
cost of fighting a challenge must be factored into the budget.

                Familiar Foes

     Not all of the legal problems of the U.S. market are cultural
shocks to the Mexican entrepreneur.  There are four familiar ones.

Federal Income Tax

     One is federal income taxation.  On this subject the legal
systems of Mexico and the United States are conceptually similar
and converging in corporate rates, with income in top corporate
brackets now being taxed at 35 percent in Mexico and 34 percent in
the United States.

     For Mexican investors, the most significant recent change in the
U.S. fiscal system was the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which not only
reduced U.S. rates dramatically but, by adding a "dividend
equivalent tax," note 43 reversed the structural rule-of-thumb for
Mexican investment in the United States.  Previously, because the
United States had a 30 percent tax on dividends paid abroad but no
corresponding tax on the remittance of branch profits, the best
corporate structure for investors (like Mexicans) unprotected by a
general tax treaty with the United States was usually the U.S.
branch of a corporation incorporated outside the United States.
Given the dividend equivalent tax of the 1986 Act, for investors
without treaty protection there is now a 30 percent tax not only on
dividends paid abroad but also on annually remittable branch
profits.  Consequently, the typical tax structure for Mexican
investment in the United States has become a subsidiary corporation
incorporated in the United States.

     The liveliest current tax issue between Mexico and the United
States is their negotiation of a general income tax treaty.
Presently their only tax treaty relationships cover shipping and
aircraft earnings note 44 and the exchange of information. note 45
As compared with competitors from nations that have full tax
treaties with the United States, that leaves Mexican investors
disadvantaged by the tax of 30 percent on dividends, interest,
royalties and rent paid abroad, which for treaty-protected
recipients is reduced to rates as low as 15 percent or zero.

Trademarks

     The second element of the U.S. legal landscape familiar to the
Mexican entrepreneur is trademarks.  Unfortunately they are so
familiar that sometimes they are ignored.  A surprising number of
Mexican investment projects have been disadvantaged by failure to
establish, in advance, proprietary name-identification of their
products in the United States.

Customs

     For Mexican exporters, the third familiar element of U.S. law is
that traditional hobgoblin of transnational traders, la aduana.  As
a checkpoint and duty-exacter, U.S. Customs functions much as
tariff-collectors do in other countries.  To cope with it, the
exporter's best technique is to shadow-box his entries in advance
with an experienced customs broker, making mock-ups of intended
shipping documents and thus avoiding unpleasant surprises.  Besides
import duties, U.S. Customs also enforces a myriad of federal laws,
from country-of-origin markings to the massive remedies of Section
337 note 46 against "unfair practices" in trade.  If achieved, a
North American Free Trade Agreement will eventually eliminate U.S.
import duties, and perhaps some Customs-enforced penalties, on
Mexican products.

Foreign Investment Restrictions

     The fourth foe for Mexican business in the United States is
restrictions on foreign investment.  Here the paradox is that in
recent years, while Mexican foreign investment rules were moving
from protectionism to permissiveness, U.S. foreign investment rules
were changing in the opposite direction.

     Mexico's present foreign investment restrictions began with the
piecemeal ownership restrictions of a 1944 executive decree of
President Avila Camacho.  They crested in President Echeverria's
protectionist 1973 Investment Law and were significantly liberal-
ized by the 1989 Regulations of President Salinas.  If rumors can
be trusted, that liberalization may soon be institutionalized by
formal amendment of the 1973 Law.

     The United States, by contrast, has traditionally welcomed
foreign investment.  There are specific statutes that favor U.S.
suppliers for government procurement and restrict foreign
management or ownership in such sensitive areas as banking, trans-
portation, communication, energy and fisheries, but until recently
the only really pervasive U.S. foreign investment statutes were
aimed not at restriction but merely at disclosure.  Those statutes
were the International Investment Survey Act of 1976 note 47 and
periodic "benchmark" legislation, under which significant foreign
acquisitions and related transactions must be reported
confidentially to the Department of Commerce, and the Agricultural
Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978, note 48 which requires
detailed public disclosure to the Department of Agriculture of
foreign acquisitions of farm land.

     More recently, however, fear of foreign takeovers has eroded the
permissiveness of the United States toward foreign investment.
Scrutiny of the economic position of foreign investors prompted the
1980 Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, note 49 and the
1986 dividend equivalent tax, note 50 each of which eliminated
federal income tax advantages for foreign investors.  In 1988 came
the Exon-Florio provision, note 51 which authorizes the President
to suspend or prohibit any merger, acquisition or takeover by a
foreign person if, in the President's judgment, that foreign person
"might take action that threatens to impair the national security."
The relevant procedures are now enshrined in Treasury regulations
note 52 that provide a voluntary notice and 30-day review period --
in effect, an advisory ruling mechanism -- for concerned foreign
investors.  The President's nullification power has been sparingly
used, but it is largely discretionary and constitutes a hurdle
Mexican investors must not ignore.

     The same restrictive trend is seen in the Foreign Bank
Supervision Enhancement Act of 1991, note 53 which subjects any
U.S. branch or office of a foreign bank to prior approval by the
Federal Reserve Board as well as the Comptroller of the Currency
and any state regulatory body, and reduces to five percent the
level of foreign investment in a U.S. bank that is subject to
Federal Reserve approval.

                Structural Guidelines

     Mindful of the cultural shocks and familiar foes of the U.S.
market, what guidelines does a Mexican business follow in
structuring an investment beyond the river?

Limiting Liability

     The investing corporation shields its Mexican assets against the
litigiousness of the U.S. market, as best it can, by creating a
firewall of corporate and contractual insulation between the parent
group in Mexico and the subsidiary that manufactures, distributes
or otherwise operates in the United States.  Then it adds the
further safeguard of product liability insurance adequate to the
costly jury verdicts of the United States.

Tax Planning

     The second guideline is tax planning.  When a Mexican business
crosses the Rio Grande it anticipates all the taxes it will face on
each side of the border and minimizes them by correlating those
taxes as aggregates and offsetting them against each other, as much
as possible, by foreign tax credits.  The impending negotiation of
a general Mexico-U.S. income tax treaty is encouraging, but until
such a treaty is firmly in place its possibility only increases the
variables.  Meticulous advance tax planning is essential to the
success of any Mexican investment in the United States.

State Strategy

     Legally, the United States is divided into fifty parts, the
states; and the market of each must be won by a strategy of
separate compliance with its distinctive laws.  The U.S. market is
conquered state by state.

Discerning Differences

     The last guideline is that of discerning differences.  The
Mexican investor must be continually alert to the unique demands of
the U.S. legal environment.  Some of those demands -- antitrust,
for example -- have little analogue in Mexico; they must be learned
and respected as new creatures.  Others, such as trademarks and
customs duties, must not be ignored just because their names and
functions are similiar to those of Mexico.

     Applying those four guidelines, the typical Mexican investment
in the United States will be structured as a separate, locally
incorporated subsidiary.  Its contractual relations with its
Mexican parent will be designed to insulate the parent from
commercial presence in the United States and to coordinate their
respective profit centers in a manner to credit and reduce taxes.
The subsidiary will confirm its trademark registrations and customs
classifications prudently in advance and will plan its U.S. market
expansion state by state.  Proposed acquisitions will be checked
against foreign investment restrictions, cleared under Hart-Scott-
Rodino and Exon-Florio if relevant, and reported to the Department
of Commerce and the Department of Agriculture as applicable.  After
that, full speed ahead.

NAFTA May Bring New Opportunities

by Douglas Karmin


     One of the main goals of the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) is to expand trade among the member nations.  NAFTA is
intended to reduce the tariffs on goods and services traded among
the three members (Canada, Mexico, and the United States).  The
financial services sector has received a great deal of attention
during the NAFTA negotiations in part because it has historically
been one of the most protected and regulated industries in North
America.  This articles examines how the NAFTA would liberalize the
financial services sector in Mexico and the potential impact this
would have on U.S. banks, insurance companies, and securities
firms.  Throughout the article, the potential beneficiaries of
Mexico's liberalization will be referred to as firms and investors
in Canada and the United States.  In the agreement, this is defined
as firms established in either country, even if they are owned by
non-North American investors.

     This article focuses solely on the expansion of American
financial services into Mexico.  The reason for this is that Canada
already liberalized its financial services market under the 1988
Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA).  This article also does not
address the contentious issues involved in liberalizing the United
States' financial services.  Canada and Mexico want to be exempt
from the Glass-Steagall and McFadden Acts which restrict a bank's
ability to own stock in other financial institutions and to conduct
interstate banking.  These restrictions are largely independent
from the issues involved in liberalizing Mexico's industries, and
therefore will not be analyzed here.

     Before examining the potential changes the NAFTA would bring to
U.S. financial services in Mexico, a distinction should be made
between business growth and employment.  Financial services
industries are known for employing relatively small numbers of
workers for a given amount of capital invested.  The U.S.
International Trade Commission reported that, with the exception of
marketing and sales positions, employment figures are declining in
many of the financial services. note 1  This is due in part to the
high degree of automation that is used in these industries.  When
expanded opportunities in Mexico for U.S. financial service
industries are discussed here, it should be kept in mind that the
corresponding increases in U.S. employment would not be nearly as
large as those in the manufacturing or other sectors.

                U.S. Investment and Operations in Mexico

     International trade in services usually requires the exporter to
invest in the foreign nation since the services are usually
provided directly to foreign customers.  Therefore, the investment
climate in a foreign country is crucial to foreign service
providers who want to enter the market.  And the investment climate
in Mexico was not very attractive during the 1980s because Mexico's
large foreign debt, poor infrastructure and communications system,
and high rate of inflation served as deterrents to foreign invest-
ment.

     The recent reforms under President Salinas as well as the
anticipation of a NAFTA have give a boost to investors' confidence.
The Journal of Commerce reported in June 1992 that U.S. investors
held approximately US$27 billion of the US$130 billion capitaliza-
tion in the Mexican equity market. note 2  Financial services,
while still heavily protected and regulated, have been a part of
this increase in foreign investment.  By the end of 1991, there
were 190 foreign financial institutions either represented by
individual banks or sharing banking offices in Mexico. note 3

     In acquiescing to the U.S. and Canadian demands to liberalize
its financial sector under the NAFTA, Mexico is also pursuing its
own economic interests.  Foreign competition in banking, insurance,
and securities will provide some of the resources needed for Mexico
to expand economically.  Foreign firms might also force Mexican
financial services to become more efficient in order to compete.
But at the same time, Mexico is very concerned that foreign firms,
due to their higher level of efficiency and capital reserves, will
drive Mexican firms out of business.  This could jeopardize
Mexico's financial sovereignty, particularly in the banking sector.
Mexico's Commerce Secretary and chief trade representative, Jaime
Serra Puche, summed up his nations' concerns when addressing the
Mexican Senate: "The negotiation of financial services has been
guided by two central objectives.  First, to maintain predominant
Mexican control of the financial system.  Second, to design an
opening that reinforces the economy's competitiveness." note 4

                Banking

     The Mexican banking industry has undergone many structural
changes in the last decade.  In 1982, responding to the foreign
debt crisis, President Lopez Portillo nationalized Mexico's
eighteen banks.  But under the leadership of President Salinas,
Mexico has successfully reversed that action.  All eighteen banks
had ben sold to Mexican investors by July 1992.  Foreign investors
were ineligible to participate in the sealed bid auctions.

     Part of the reason for the privatization movement was the
inefficiency of Mexico's state-run banks.  Lack of foreign
competition also hampered the industry's progress since Citibank is
the only foreign bank allowed to have commercial operations in
Mexico.  Citibank established operations in Mexico in 1929, before
most of the regulations barring foreign banks were created. note 5

Past Restrictions

     In December 1989, Mexico issued new banking regulations that
permitted foreign investors to own 34 percent of the equity in
Mexican banks, but foreign involvement was restricted to nonvoting
participation. note 6  A second wave of banking reforms was
implemented in July 1990.

     Under this new system, 51 percent of Mexican bank equity was
labeled as "A" shares and auctioned off to Mexican financial
institutions like the state development banks and the development
trust funds.  The remaining "B" shares were auctioned off to
institutional investors and Mexican companies as well as the
financial institutions eligible for the "A" shares.  "A" and "B"
shareholders could in turn sell some of their shares to virtually
any investor, including foreigners, as long as these "C" shares
were limited to 30 percent of the bank's total equity. note 7

     Another restriction limited individual investors and single
companies, both foreign and Mexican, to owning only five percent of
any bank.  This limit could be raised to ten percent with special
authorization. note 8

     The "C" shares that were permitted under the 1990 reform gave
foreign investors for the first time a voting stake in bank
operations.  Still, foreign investors did not flood the Mexican
market, in part because they were not interested in operating such
a small fraction of the controlling interest in Mexican banks.

     An even greater obstacle to foreign investment, this one
concerning foreign banks operating in Mexico, was the regulation
that prohibited foreign bank subsidiaries from offering services to
Mexican citizens.  They were only permitted to provide "offshore"
banking services. note 9

Proposed Liberalization Under NAFTA

     In late June 1992, it was reported that Mexico, the United
States, and Canada had reached a compromise on the financial
services sector of the NAFTA that would dramatically liberalize
Mexico's banking industry.  The agreement would allow U.S. and
Canadian investors to own 100 percent of Mexican banks, subject to
the restriction that no more than eight percent of the entire
Mexican banking industry is owned by foreigners within the first
year after a NAFTA is signed.  This eight-percent limit would be
raised one percent per year, each year for seven years, at which
time the limit would be completely removed. note 10  For the first
four years after the limit is removed, Mexico would reserve the
right to freeze U.S. and Canadian investment if it reached 25
percent of the Mexican banking industry.  This 25-percent freeze
could only last three years. note 11  Any further restrictions
beyond this transition period would require the approval of U.S.
and Canadian officials.

     The compromise limits individual investors to only 1.5 percent
of the market during the transition period.  After the transition
period has ended, individual investors would still be limited to
four percent of the market share if the four percent was achieved
by acquiring Mexican banks. note 12  This stipulation was designed
to protect Mexico's largest banks from foreign takeover.
Individual investors from Canada and the United States could expand
beyond this four percent limit, but only through internal
growth. note 13

     The NAFTA also addresses the issue of what kinds of banking
services U.S. firms could provide.  Under the agreement, U.S. and
Canadian subsidiaries in Mexico would receive national treatment
and therefore be allowed to provide all the services that Mexican
banks provide.  U.S. and Canadian banks operating outside Mexico
would still be restricted to providing "offshore" services only.

Prospects for U.S. Industry after Liberalization

     A fall in Mexican interest rates, coupled with the boost in
economic confidence that the NAFTA should provide, is expected to
spur borrowing in Mexico.  This possibility has led many to
speculate that the financial services agreement under the NAFTA
could give a strong boost to the U.S. banking industry.  But the
international position of U.S. banks must be taken into account
when analyzing the potential impact of the NAFTA.  A 1991 U.S.
International Trade Commission (ITC) report concluded:

     If U.S. banks are allowed to offer a full range of financial
     services and products directly in the Mexican market, there
     could be a moderately positive impact on U.S. banking services
     exports to Mexico in the long term.  However, U.S. banks are
     currently consolidating their international operations in
     response to large outstanding loans and higher capital
     requirements which will weaken their ability to enter the
     Mexican market. note 14

     Analysts have also cautioned that the relative size of the
Mexican market, even with rapid growth, is such that the short-run
impact on the revenues of U.S. banks is likely to be small.  A
recent study by Gary Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott shows that in 1989
sixteen of Mexico's banks collectively had assets worth
approximately US$58 billion, one-fourth the size of Citicorp's
assets for the same year. note 15  In the long-run, however,
proponents of the NAFTA argue that the prospects for U.S. banks
look more promising.  Not only is Mexico's economy likely to grow
under the NAFTA and thus provide greater demand for banking
services, but it is possible that U.S. banking operations in Mexico
could be used as a way of expanding services throughout Latin
America.

     In regards to the type of banking operations most likely to be
undertaken, the ITC speculated in its report that commercial
banking would be the focus of U.S. investment rather than retail
banking. note 16  This is because retail banks must reach
individual consumers and therefore require larger capital
investments.

                Insurance

     Despite the fact that there are forty-three Mexican insurance
companies, this sector is widely considered the weakest of Mexico's
financial services. note 17  And unlike banking, the Mexican
insurance industry has a fairly large foreign presence.  Twelve of
the world's twenty-five largest insurance firms, including American
CIGNA and AIG, provide reinsurance and consulting services in
Mexico. note 18  These foreign firms make up approximately 15
percent of the Mexican market share.

Past Restrictions

     Similar to the banking industry, Mexico took steps even before
the NAFTA negotiations to liberalize its restrictions on foreign
involvement in the insurance industry.  Most significantly, in 1990
Mexico lifted its ban on new foreign investment in the insurance
sector and raised the limit of foreign ownership from 15 percent to
49 percent of Mexican insurance companies. note 20

     Despite these changes in regulations on ownership, there still
exist many insurance services that are reserved solely for Mexican
firms.  For example, only national firms are allowed to sell
policies to individuals living in Mexico at the time when the
contract is signed.  National firms also have a legal monopoly on
auto insurance for cars that are owned by Mexican citizens or have
Mexican license plates.  Another examples is the insurance of
imported and exported goods, which is restricted to Mexican firms
if a Mexican resident is liable for the risk.  Credit insurance and
civil liability policies have similar restrictions. note 21

Proposed Liberalization under NAFTA

     The financial services agreement reached in June 1992 would call
for major changes in Mexico's insurance industry.  U.S. and
Canadian insurance companies that are already in Mexico would see
their limitations on ownership in Mexican companies raised from 49
percent to 100 percent by 1996. note 22  The authors conclude that
this is indicative of an industry that is maintaining high
profitability in a protected market despite poor efficiency.
Liberalization of the insurance sector would therefore seem like a
great opportunity for the much more efficient U.S. companies to
expand their operations.

     Still, the Mexican insurance market has the same relatively
small size (when compared to the U.S. market) as the Mexican
banking market.  Insurance premiums represent only one percent of
GDP in Mexico, compared to 9.1 percent in the United
States. note 26  It is unclear whether the small size of the
Mexican market is due to lack of demand or supply or both, but if
it is lack of supply, then it is likely that U.S. insurance
companies could enjoy profitable growth opportunities in Mexico.

                Securities

     The securities and brokerage industry is considered by many to
be Mexico's strongest financial service sector.  Mexico has twenty-
five brokerage houses that provide its investment services.  These
brokerage houses have four main areas of operation, with by far the
largest one being securities agents and traders on the secondary
market.  Two other areas are brokering and mutual fund
administration.  There also exists investment banking divisions in
some of the brokerage houses. note 27  But the size of these
brokerage firms should not be overstated.  The Hufbauer and Schott
study examined seventeen of these firms in 1989 and found that they
had a collective net worth of approximately US$1 billion.  By
comparison, in that same year Merrill Lynch alone had a net worth
over US$3 billion. note 28

Past Restrictions

     The brokerage houses have probably the strictest regulations on
foreign ownership among the financial services.  Foreign investors
in brokerage houses must receive permission from Mexico, and the
total amount of foreign ownership in any one firm is limited to 30
percent.  In addition, no individual foreign investor may hold more
than ten percent of a Mexican brokerage house. note 29

Proposed Liberalization under NAFTA

     The financial services compromise would allow U.S. and Canadian
securities firms to control 10 percent of the Mexican market as
soon as the NAFTA goes into effect.  This limit would be raised to
twenty percent during the first six years of the agreement.  If,
after this six-year transition period, the U.S. and Canadian market
share reaches 30 percent, Mexico can put a freeze on further
foreign investment during a second transition period.  This 30-
percent freeze could only be started during years seven through ten
of the NAFTA and could last at most, three years once Mexico
decides to implement it. note 30

     Individual foreign-owned securities firms would be restricted to
four percent of the market during both stages of the transition
period, which would be a maximum of thirteen years if Mexico
invoked the three-year freeze in the tenth  year of the agreement.
At the end of both transition periods, the limit on individual
market share would be lifted, as would the aggregate limit of 30
percent. note 31

Prospects for U.S. Industry after Liberalization

     Since the securities industry in Mexico is the most regulated of
the financial services, some argue that the U.S. securities
industry has the most to gain from the NAFTA.  U.S. securities
firms have competed successfully in other unregulated markets due
in part to their relative size, sophistication, and reputation.
The industry was quite pleased with the compromise of late June.
In addition to the liberalized Mexican market that this compromise
would create, industry representatives are also fairly optimistic
about the prospects of expanding operations beyond Mexico and into
Latin America, though such an expansions would not be as easy as
spreading throughout the European Community.

     There are, however, a couple of reasons why a liberalization of
Mexico's securities regulations might not have a major impact on
U.S. firms.  First, the relative poverty of the average Mexican
citizen and the small level of capital funds of Mexican companies
may limit the demand for services from U.S. securities firms.
Industry representatives hope that the NAFTA will boost Mexican
wealth in the long run and thus improve the opportunities for these
U.S. firms.  Second, some financial services that fall under the
rubric of the securities industry do not require foreign direct
investment.  For example, most of the transborder business that
U.S. investment banks conduct with Mexico entails Mexican clients
coming to the United States for services.  Under these
circumstances, liberalizing Mexican market access is not going to
significantly improve the business opportunities of U.S. investment
banks.  There are, however, other types of securities services
(e.g., financial advisors, brokerage firms) which are more
dependent on foreign direct investment and therefore would stand to
gain from Mexican liberalization.

                Conclusion

     Despite the transition periods that Mexico has insisted upon
before completely liberalizing its financial service sectors, the
recent NAFTA negotiations appear to be a major victory for U.S.
financial service firms.  For the first time Mexico is permitting
majority ownership by foreign companies in these sectors, as well
as allowing U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries to provide services that
previously had been restricted to Mexican firms.

     On the whole, U.S. banks, insurance companies, and securities
firms are expected to compete very effectively in a liberalized
Mexican market.  The combination of experience, resource size,
reputation, and technical expertise gives U.S. financial service
firms a distinct advantage over their North American competitors.
However, U.S. firms could face stiff competition from Japanese and
European firms that are already established in North America and
therefore eligible for preferential treatment from Mexico.  Since
most major Japanese and European financial service firms are
established in North America, this sector could become the most
open and competitive market addressed in the agreement.

     It appears that the main obstacle to the expansion of U.S.
financial services in a liberalized Mexican market is the size and
income level of Mexico's businesses and citizens.  This obstacle
could be diminished by accelerated Mexican growth once the NAFTA is
implemented.  As is the case with many industries, the United
States might export more financial services to Mexico as it expands
economically.

Ringing Up Credit Cards Sales

     In July 1992, there were 9.6 million credit card accounts in
Mexico.  The credit card market is a rapidly expanding part of the
financial services sector in Mexico and is expected to continue its
growth in the near future.  Two banks, Banamex and Bancomer, along
with a consortium of thirteen banks called CARNET, control
virtually the entire market.  American Express plays an important
role in the service card market.

                Laws and Oversight

     The credit card industry falls under the Ley de Instituciones de
Credito (Credit Institutions Law) of 1990.  The industry is
regulated by the Bank of Mexico and the Comision Nacional de Bancos
(the National Banking Commission).  Only diversified banks may
issue credit cards.  This excludes credit unions and specialized
banks such as Mexico's agricultural and development banks.

                Card Issuers

     Through July 1992, Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, was the
leading issuer of credit cards, with approximately four million
accounts out of a total of 9.6 million in Mexico.  The consortium
CARNET, whose largest member is Banca Serfin, was second with three
million accounts.  Bancomer was the third largest issuer with 2.6
million accounts.

     As in the U.S., American Express issues service, not credit
cards, and usually requires its cardholders to pay off their entire
balance each month; thus American Express is exempted from the
restriction on card issuance by non-banks.  As of August 1992,
American Express had approximately 400,000 cardholders in Mexico.
Diner's Club and several department stores issue their own cards,
but they represent a small part if the market.

     Bancomer issues Visa cards and CARNET and Banamex issue both
Visa cards and Mastercards.  Banks pay the U.S.-based Visa and
Mastercard organizations a licensing fee to issue cards in Mexico.

                Card Billings and Market Strategies

     A total of US$12.3 billion was charged on bank credit cards in
1991.  During the first seven months of 1992, US$8.6 billion was
charged.  In spite of Banamex's lead in charge accounts, each of
the group's share of annual credit card charges is roughly the
same.  Through July 1992, Banamex and Bancomer each controlled
slightly over a third of Mexico's credit card charges and CARNET
just under a third.

     In addition to bank credit card billings, American Express
billed about US$1.0 billion in the first seven months of the year
and projects its billings will reach US$1.7 billion for the entire
year.  American Express's Mexican customers charge an average of
US$5,000 a year on the standard green card, double the amount of
their U.S. counterparts.

     Banamex aims at the mass market, trying to get its cards into
the hands of as many people as possible.  Bancomer, by offering
more services and by charging more for its cards, aims for a
clientele that has greater economic resources.  CARNET, because it
is a consortium of banks, does not have a set strategy; rather,
each bank sets its own market goals.  American Express gears its
card toward the highest income groups.  According to the head of
the Mexican subsidiary, American Express aims solely at the upscale
card market.  In the beginning of 1992, in fact, American Express
canceled 40,000 accounts, about ten percent of outstanding accounts
at the time, because of credit problems and because these
cardholders no longer met American Express's income requirements.

                Credit Card Loan Portfolios

     Credit card loans have become an increasingly important
component of banks' loan portfolios.  Banamex's credit card
portfolio grew in real terms between December 1989 and December
1991 from about US$1.0 billion to US$2.0 billion.  (Real growth is
calculated by factoring out inflation from the peso, then
converting totals into US$ using the peso/dollar exchange rate
prevailing in December 1991.)  At the same time, these loans grew
from eight percent to eleven percent of the bank's total outstand-
ing loans.  Bancomer's credit card loan portfolio more than doubled
in real terms between December 1989 and December 1991, from US$850
million to US$2.0 billion.  During this period, credit card loans
grew from 7.6 percent to 11.3 percent of its total outstanding loan
portfolio.  Bancomer reports that its credit card loans through
December 1991 constituted the most profitable segment of its loan
portfolio.  Figures were unavailable for CARNET.

                Revenue Sources

     Credit card issuers make money from three primary sources:  i)
the annual fee they charge customers for the card; ii) the amount
they charge merchants to process a transaction; and iii) the
interest charged to customers who do not pay off their monthly
balances.  Among banks, card fees range from 45,000 pesos (US$15)
for Bancomer's standard card to 200,000 pesos (US$75) for
Bancomer's high-income gold card.

     Banks charge merchants a fee of up to six percent of the gross
amount of each sale charged to a credit card issued by the bank and
offer discounts to merchants that do a high-volume of credit card
sales.  The day after the transaction, the banks pay the merchant
the entire value of the sale minus the bank's commission.  The
banks do not gain from a float -- i.e., from holding money in an
interest-bearing account and paying the merchants later.  In fact,
banks suffer a "negative float" -- that is, banks pay the merchants
before the banks have received payment from the cardholders for the
items charged and must absorb the cost of money until they are paid
by the cardholders.  Much of this funding cost is offset by the
commission the banks charge the merchants.

     For banks though, the most lucrative feature of issuing credit
cards is the interest they charge cardholders on unpaid balances.
Banks would lose money on their card operations if a significant
number of people did not use the revolving credit feature of the
cards.  In September 1992, banks charged a monthly rate of 3.25
percent interest (39 percent annual rate) on outstanding balances.
The rate charged on unpaid credit card balances is set monthly by
the Bank of Mexico, and is based on the banks' average cost of
raising funds, called the CPP, plus a profit spread for the banks.
In September 1992, the interest rate charged on unpaid balances of
39 percent provided banks a net annualized gain of almost 19
percent over the CPP rate of 20.16 percent.  A balance is outstand-
ing if unpaid 20 days after the billing date.

     Industry-wide, approximately 70 percent of monthly credit card
balances are left unpaid.  One indication of why so much is left
unpaid each month comes from a northern Mexico newspaper (El Norte)
survey which in July 1992 found that 68 percent of cardholders were
oblivious to the interest they were paying on their balances.

     In contrast to banks, American Express derives its credit card
revenues primarily from the fees it charges for its cards and from
what it charges merchants.  The standard green card costs US$66 and
the higher-income gold card costs US$165.

     American Express's charges to merchants depend on the payment
schedule the merchant select and the Mexican short-term treasury
bill interest rate.  For example, in September 1992, a supermarket
would pay American Express a 3.1 percent commission if it wanted to
be paid for purchases made on the American Express card within
seven days and 2.5 percent if it chose the 21-day payment option.
American Express does not offer next-day payment to merchants, but
its fees are generally lower than those of other card companies.
American Express also requires its cardholders to pay off their
balances within 11 days of billing, thus reducing the time the
company must extend credit to its customers.

     American Express does offer credit to its cardholders for
purchases over two million pesos (US$654), but as of September 1992
it charged an annual interest rate of 72.6 percent for this
feature.  Only 12 percent of purchases on the American Express card
are made this way.  As a separate matter, as of early September
1992 American Express charged a punitive annual interest rate of
125.4 percent for all delinquent payments.

                Loan Defaults

     Credit card companies lose money primarily through defaults.
Industry contacts indicate that industry-wide, that part of the
banks' credit card loan portfolios that is past due or
non-performing is about seven percent of outstanding loans.

     In March 1991, the Ministry of Finance adopted new rules for the
establishment of loan loss reserves by Mexican commercial banks.
The rules established five categories, corresponding to the degree
of probability that the loan would be repaid; the riskier the loan,
the higher the reserve.  Under this system, for example, Bancomer
in 1991 placed loan loss reserves of 41.5 percent against its total
past due loan portfolio.  Specific figures for reserves for past
due credit card loans were unavailable.  Banks may write off a loan
only with approval from the National Banking Commission after
demonstrating that they have made sufficient attempts to collect
the loan.

                Applying for and Holding a Credit Card

     Cards available in Mexico range from those only for use within
Mexico to those internationally-acceptable, with corresponding
credit limits and income requirements.

Applying for a Card

     All banks and American Express require proof of local address,
the last two salary statements, and a photo identification.
Banamex requires, in addition, a letter of employment and three
years of employment history.  Bancomer also requires family and
personal references.

     The companies usually do an in-house credit check and, when
necessary, submit the application to Cicsa, Mexico's only credit
bureau.  American Express does most of its credit verification
itself.  All issuers reported that each person's credit history is
verified, usually through phone calls, before they approve
applications.

     American Express rejects approximately 50 percent of its
applicants, mostly for lack of adequate income.  Bancomer rejects
only five percent of its applicants, usually for incomplete or
false data.  Neither Banamex nor CARNET would divulge this
information.

Cards and Cost

     Table I provides a sample of the least and most expensive cards
available and the minimum salary requirements to qualify for one.
American Express's cards are the most expensive, followed by
Bancomer's cards.  American Express also has the highest salary
requirement.

Services and Bill Paying

     Credit card providers in Mexico offer services similar to those
available from providers in the U.S.  These include access to
automatic tellers for cash advances, automatic travel insurance,
and card replacement.  Visa, Mastercard, and American Express
cardholders are connected to the international networks of those
firms.  In addition, Mexican holders of credit cards issued by
banks may use their accounts as savings accounts.  Banks pay a
market interest rate on positive balances.

     Most bank credit card bills are paid in the offices of the banks
that issued the card.  American Express bills are paid in American
Express offices.  Some customers pay their accounts by mail but
because of the unreliability of this method, most choose to pay in
person.  Banamex is beginning a phone payment system in which a
customer can transfer funds from a bank account to pay the bill.

                Market Growth

     The credit card market has grown significantly over the past few
years.  From 1990 to 1991 alone, total charges on bank credit cards
grew over 30 percent in nominal terms.  Charges on the American
Express card were up 27 percent in nominal terms over the same
period.

     Card companies expect the growth to continue through 1992 and
1993, although not as quickly as in the past two years.  Because of
the privatization of the Mexican banks, competition within the
industry is becoming more intense.  Still, CARNET and Banamex plan
for nominal growth of 10 to 20 percent a year in both billings and
card issuance through 1993.  American Express expects 20 percent
nominal annual growth in its card and billing portfolio through
1993.

     This growth is possible both because there are people who meet
the income criteria for cards but do not yet have a credit card and
because increasing incomes for some Mexicans could soon qualify
them for a credit card.  American Express reports that the number
of Mexicans who meet its income criteria is between  1.3  and  1.7
million.   Banamex would not provide an estimate of a target
market, but asserted that the free trade agreement with the U.S.
and Canada and increasing economic modernization in Mexico will
raise personal incomes making more people eligible for credit
cards.

American Express-Banamex Joint Venture

     In March 1992, American Express and Banamex announced a
joint-venture called Banamsa to issue American Express gold cards.
American Express expects to issue 300,000 of these co-branded cards
by 1995, in addition to the 400,000 American Express cards already
issued in Mexico.  American Express's primary aims in this venture
are to gain access to Banamex's six million customers and to its
network of roughly 725 branches.  This will make it easier for
customers to pay bills and for merchants to receive payment.  In
addition, American Express hopes to extend the market for its
corporate card through Banamex's relationship with businesses.
Banamex expects to gain access to American Express's expertise in
the travel industry and to its international financial experience.

                NAFTA

     Under NAFTA, foreign non-bank financial services companies will
be permitted to set up limited-scope financial institutions in
Mexico, including those to provide credit card services.  The total
assets of these companies are limited to three percent of the total
assets of all commercial banks in Mexico plus the total assets of
all limited-scope financial institutions in Mexico.  A change in
Mexican law would be required for non-banks to be able to issue
credit cards in Mexico.  It is expected that this change will occur
as part of the implementing legislation for NAFTA.

Toshiba:Established A China Joint Venture to Manufacture

from MAINICHI PRESS RELEASE SERVICE/ENGLISH SERVICE, September 17, 1996

September,1996

TOKYO -- Toshiba Corporation today announced that it has entered into
agreements with Chinese partners and Nichimen Corp. to establish a
joint venture company to manufacture and market color television sets
(CTVs) in Dalian, China.

Investment in the new facility acounts to approximately US$ 98.1
million. The establishment will assure Toshiba of a solid manufacturing
and marketing base for color television sets to address the strong
growth of demand anticipated in China, and to supply other fast-growing
Asian countries.

Dalian Toshiba Television Co., Ltd. (DTV), the color TV plant, will
have an initial capitalization of US$49.1 million, 52 percent owned by
Toshiba Corp., 13percent by Toshiba (China) Co., Ltd., 5 percent by
Nichimen Corp. and 30 percent by Dalian Daxian Group Corp. The
procedures to establish the IV were completed in last July. DTV's
facilities, including a product design and development center, will be
located on a plot next to Toshiba's Dalian facility for manufacturing
electronic components, Toshiba Dalian Co., Ltd. (TDL).

Construction will start in October 1996 and manufacturing is scheduled
to begin in October I 997. The plant will have a production capacity of
1 million units a year, and a product line-up of 21-inch to 29-inch
CTV. Output will be sold in China and also exported, malnly to other
Asian countries.

Market Gro'wth Expected
The worldwide CTV market reached 109.6 million units last year, and is
expected to enjoy steady growth to 112 million units this year.
Particularly strong growth is expected in the Chinese market, with high
growth rates pushing demand to 15 million units in 1995 and 20 million
in 2000. It is expected to match the U.S. marketinsize by 2000.

Toshiba's Facilities Worldwide
Toshiba is establishing a global network of CTV manufacturhig and
marketing facilities based in key markets including Japan, North and
Latin America, Europe and Asia. In fiscal year 1995, the company's
facilities worldwide sold approximately 6.1 million units.

Toshiba is establishing the new facility in Dalian: (1) to assure a
manufacturing and marketing operation supporting production of products
to meet demand from the Chinese market; (2) and because TDL already
produces key CTV components in Dalian, including TV chassis and tuners,
which provides a basis to create mutual effect for Toshiba Group by
extending overall manufacturing operation and procurement in the region.

Toshiba develops and produces a wide range of products in order to meet
diverse demands in different markets. The company is currently
enhancing all aspects of its global manufacturing operation structure,
from procurement to assembly, with consideration for such factors as
market size, costs and labor availability, etc. The establishment of
the new company fits into this worldwide strategy, and also allows
Toshiba to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation through business.

Toshiba:Uses the Internet to Strengthen Worldwide

from MAINICHI PRESS RELEASE SERVICE/ENGLISH SERVICE, September 17, 1996

September,1996

Tokyo--Toshiba Corporation today announced that it will use the
Internet to bring a new dimension to its worldwide procurement of
components and materials. The company is listing descriptions and
specifications of items it wants to purchase, and inviting suppliers
to e-mail details of price, availability and other information.

This new approach is part of Toshiba's reinforcement of global
purchasing. The company wants to procure from companies competitive in
price, delivery, quality and service, thus assuring its own
competitiveness across its wide range of business, from semiconductors
to power plant. Procurement from outside Japan amounted to 341.6
billion yen last fiscal year, and is expected to rise to 500 billion
yen by fiscal 1998, ending March 1999.

Use of the Internet will support Toshiba in finding and contacting new
suppliers, procuring from the most competitive sources, establishing
clear, speedy and effective communications, and developing and
maintaining mutually beneficial relations with suppliers.

Commenting on the on-line system, Mr. Hideo Shimizu, General Manager
of the Procurement Division, was very positive: "1 see the Internet as
having a very positive influence on our procurement. It gives us a
powerful means for finding and working closely with potential
suppliers, and 1 think it will also assure fairness, openness and our
accessibility to suppliers."

In other moves to strengthen worldwide procurement, Toshiba is also
enlarging its network of International Procurement Offices. Two new
offices will open this coming October, in Vienna, Austria and Dallas,
Texas, bringing to 11 the number of offices located in strategic
locations around the world.

November 16, 1996

All-out collaboration: Australia and Malaysia edge towards a more
integrated partnership

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 59

MALAYSIA AND Australia are strengthening their ties in the fields of
business, education, science, the arts and sports. That was the message
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer delivered in his
recent visit to Malaysia.
  The minister also said that the tide of economic, technological and
social change which is transforming Australia has created further
opportunities for cooperation and partnership between the two countries.
  In a written reply to questions from Malaysian Business, Downer spells
out the framework for trade and economic relations between the two
countries, and what possibly lies in the future.  
How do you see future growth in trade between Australia and Malaysia?
  Clearly, we would like our trade with Malaysia to increase strongly
every year. Over the past five years, total two-way trade has grown at
just on 19 per cent - a trend I would like to see continue.
  However, as we form more integrated partnerships with Malaysia and
Malaysians, it is likely that we will invest and establish more commercial
operations in each other's markets. This may mean that there will be a
shift in the way business is undertaken in future. There might be a
stronger growth in the bilateral investment statistics at first, hopefully
leading to a steady and balanced growth in trade statistics. Greater
investment should in turn engender healthier trade flows too.  
Would you be able to specify the amount of foreign direct investment
flowing from Australia into Malaysia?
  It is very difficult to specify the exact amount of Australian
investment going into Malaysia. Official figures do not take into account
funds sourced outside the investing country, re-investment of profits,
appreciation of assets and a number of other factors. So the figures are
generally underestimates - sometimes by a long shot. Nevertheless,
Australian official data puts the level of Australian direct investment in
Malaysia at around A$2.1 billion (RM4.24 billion), as at June 1994.
  However, I think this is an underestimate of the true stock of
Australian investment in Malaysia. Malaysia and Australia are both long
standing investors in each other's economies, and the total stock of
investment in each direction probably amounts to several billion dollars.
  Over the last few years, the pace of Malaysian investment in Australia
has also accelerated significantly. Some of your bigger and more
successful groups are here. Apart from the earlier, and successful,
Malaysian investors such as IGB Bhd and Malaysia Mining Corporation, we
are now seeing newer players like the Berjaya Group entering the market in
fields such as medical services and technology.  
What are the major Malaysian sectors in which Australian companies are
involved?
  Australian companies are involved in commercial operations and projects
right across the Malaysian economy. Australian investment has largely been
concentrated in the textile and textile products, non-metallic mineral
products, rubber, electrical and electronic and fabricated products
industries. Already some 200 Australian companies have offices in
Malaysia.
  Significant new Australian investments are expected to be approved in
the food processing, building products and paper manufacturing industries.
The information technology, computing and multimedia fields are also very
exciting.  
Given Malaysia's current push for technology intensive industries, there
must be plenty of opportunities for Australians. Please comment.
  This is one of the most exciting areas. We really want to help build
partnerships in technology, and Malaysia's focus on `Smart Partnerships'
in the technology sector will put the onus on businesses to be creative,
innovative and highly cooperative in their approach, and to include a
practical focus on training and human resource development.  
How does Malaysia compare with other countries in the Asia Pacific
region in terms of investment incentives?
  I am really no expert on the comparative investment incentive schemes
around the East Asian region. It is obviously a very competitive
environment. But my overall assessment is that more important than
specific incentives schemes for this or that industry or specific tax
breaks, is the need to get the overall economic and investment environment
right.
  That means setting a long term strategic vision and sticking with it,
getting the long term macro economic settings right and of course,
underlying all of this, stable and clear sighted political leadership. In
this environment, businesses can invest long term, build their assets and
expand their markets. I think that Malaysia has achieved its standing as a
very attractive investment destination because it has got these
fundamentals right. Vision 2020 sets a clear goal. Macro economic settings
have been carefully set and prudently managed and the country is
politically stable.
  So I think it is the fundamentals which are the source of success. Of
course, there are a number of other East and Southeast Asian countries
which have also advanced by attending carefully to these fundamentals -
but I think Malaysia stands out in the first rank of these.  
What investment opportunities are there in Australia for Malaysian
businesses?
  As I said before, we would like to encourage more Malaysian businesses
to invest in the productive, export and job-generating sectors of the
Australian economy - and I think we see good signs that this is already
starting to happen.
  Traditionally, we have had a good flow of investment into property
development and into mining. But now we are seeing interest in investment
in shipbuilding, medical services and technology, solar heating, building
products and aircraft engineering and technology.
  We want to see more of this kind of investment. Australian firms are
very innovative - having developed or adapted technologies to make them
suitable for Australian conditions. Now many of them are looking to go off
shore. They want to expand their markets. Foreign equity participation can
provide the finance and market openings to make this happen. And in
return, there will be technology transfer benefits for the foreign partner
and its affiliates.  
Are there going to be any changes in Government policy which will either
make it easier or more difficult for Malaysians to invest in Australia?
  My view is that government works best when it supports people and
business rather than tying them down in regulation and bureaucracy. The
best contribution the government can make is to lay down sound macro and
micro economic policies which create conditions for business to thrive. In
that context, the government's agenda is to free up the Australian economy
and create a strong climate, conducive to investor confidence.
  We want to make it easier for both local and foreign companies to invest
in this country's future. On the macroeconomic front, our first priority
has been to get the budget in order. We have cut A$3.9 billion (RM7.87
billion) from the underlying public sector deficit in this financial year
and we will cut A$7.2 billion (RM14.54 billion) by 1997-1998, bringing the
budget into underlying surplus in 1998-1999. This will reduce pressure on
the markets, reduce the cost of finance and encourage private investment.  
How would you describe Malaysia-Australia relations, particularly
economic ties?
  The bilateral relationship is very good and getting better -
particularly in the economic and commercial field and at the political
level which is very important. The priority this government has put into
the relationship is attested to by the energy with which we have sought to
establish relationships with our Malaysian counterparts. The bilateral
relationship is underpinned by very strong people-to-people links -
alumni, business people - and it is my job to ensure we do not take these
linkages for granted, that we build on them pro-actively to advance our
shared interests.
  The Australian government greatly appreciated Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad's first meeting with the Australian Prime Minister John Howard.
This was a tremendous basis upon which to establish relations between the
two governments.
  We have had an impressive flow of ministerial visits in both directions.
I have been to Malaysia myself twice since this government came to office
and many of my colleagues have also visited Malaysia. Deputy Prime
Minister and Trade Minister, Tim Fischer has met with  Datuk Seri Rafidah
Aziz on five occasions since March this year. So we are achieving a good
close working relationship in areas of central importance. We want to
build friendship and trust.  
Are there any areas in which you hope to expand further?
  Definitely. We would clearly like to see more expansion of people-to-
people ties at all levels from science and technology collaboration to
sport, in small business development and in new areas of existing
cooperation such as in education and training.
  My perception is that business and commercial opportunities in this
region usually follow the informal paths, the networks of friendship
established directly between people. So we need to build on those.
  Now, more than ever before, the growth of cheaper international
telecommunications, the Internet, expanded frequency and lower cost of air
travel are making the formation and maintenance of these kinds of networks
all the more easy.  
There have been reports that Australia's new government is rather cool
on the issue of integration with Asia as compared with the previous
government. Please comment.
  The government is strongly committed to building relations with Asia as
our highest foreign priority. For that reason, I and my ministerial
colleague the Minister of Trade, Tim Fischer, have travelled extensively
and frequently in Asia since we took office. The Prime Minister, Howard,
made his first major bilateral visits to Indonesia and Japan. The focus of
our diplomatic activity, our commitment and our travel continues to be
within our region. To put it simply, Australia's commitment to the region
is unshakeable. There can be no questioning of our commitment or interest
in building our Asian relationships. Our relationships with Asia embody
our key national interests as a country both now and in the future. We are
committed to the active pursuit of those interests.

No basis to rumours: Executive director Khaw Chay Tee sets the record
straight

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 10

DATUK LIM Thian Kiat, or better known as T K Lim, has a reputation for
being reclusive and press-shy. Thus, it came as no surprise when the
taipan of Multi-Purpose Holdings, Kamunting, Magnum and a host of other
listed companies turned down a request for a Malaysian Business interview.
  However, he directed his lieutenant, MPHB executive director and lawyer
Khaw Chay Tee, to reply to a set of questions on his behalf. Below, we
reprint the replies:
  It was reported some time back that you will be teaming up with Hong
Leong in a Philippine lottery venture. What is the status of this venture?
Have you mended fences with Quek Leng Chan of Hong Leong?
  There is no proposal for the Kamunting-Multi-Purpose Group to team up
with the  Hong Leong Group in any Philippine lottery venture. As for our
relationship with the Hong Leong Group, it has always been and is a
cordial and friendly one.
  It was rumoured that Multi-Purpose Capital (M Capital) will be making a
reverse takeover of a second board company. Or is this an attempt to list
Multi-Purpose Bank?
  There is no proposal for M Capital to undertake a reverse takeover of
any listed company.
  There are also currently no firm plans to list Multi-Purpose Bank as the
management is concentrating its efforts on achieving Tier-1 status for the
bank under the two-tier regulatory system as soon as possible.
  Are you planning any more gaming ventures in China?
  The Kamunting-Multi-Purpose Group has no plans for any more gaming
ventures in China.
  It is felt that Bandar Raya Development's prospects are bleak as its
landbank is being depleted. Will you be buying up more land?
  Bandar Raya Developments has over the last few years recorded average
profit growth exceeding 25 per cent per annum and the management of Bandar
Raya is confident of being in the position to maintain this trend. It
currently has an existing landbank exceeding 1,100 acres, the bulk of
which is located strategically in the Klang Valley and Johor, which is
more than sufficient to sustain Bandar Raya's requirements for the next
few years. Bandar Raya has, of course, identified existing as well as what
it believes will be new growth areas for property development and shall be
replenishing its landbank when the opportunity arises.
  There is speculation that MPHB will divest its stake in Sarawak
Enterprise Corporation Bhd. Is this true?
  MPHB has no intention of doing so as we believe Sarawak Enterprise as
well as the state of Sarawak hold tremendous potential.
  Four years ago, you told Malaysian Business you would be concentrating
on property and gaming, leisure and finance. Now, with the addition of
Sarawak Enterprise, you are also into power generation and various other
Sarawak-linked activities. What are the divisions that you will be
concentrating on from now on?
  Since 1991, the MPHB Group has had three core businesses, namely
financial services, property and gaming. The group has over the last four
years developed and grown this into the profitable and stable businesses
which you see today. The MPHB Group was therefore in the position, at the
end of 1995, to take on the challenge of an additional core business in
the form of electricity generation, transmission and distribution through
Sarawak Enterprise. The group intends to devote a similar amount of time
and effort to its new core business as it does to its existing core
businesses.
  Kamunting Corporation Bhd's (KCB) Kepong toll concession has been the
subject of controversy. How stable would earnings be if the concession is
withdrawn?
  Kamunting does not view its toll concession as controversial. The Kepong
toll concession was legally extended by the government for an additional
seven years, that is, from 8 Jan 1996 to 7 Jan 2003. The legality of the
extension has been publicly reconfirmed on a number of occasions by both
the Minister for Works as well as by the Deputy Minister for Works. As
Kamunting has at all times complied with and fulfilled its obligations
under the Kepong toll concession, there are really no grounds for any
controversy.

Bug-busting its way to the top: Fumakilla Malaysia Bhd isn't content with
being just the market leader i

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 24

IT MAY SOUND odd, but Fumakilla Malaysia Bhd is one company which is happy
about what is a bane of most households - blood-thirsty mosquitoes and
bothersome insects. And little wonder, for the revenue of this soon-to-be-
listed company is derived from our strong aversion to the buzz and bites,
disease and destruction of these pesky winged creatures.
  Fumakilla manufactures mosquito coils, insecticide vapourising mats and
insecticide aerosol sprays. But the manufacture and sale of mosquito
coils, which make up 80 per cent of Fumakilla's sales turnover is clearly
its speciality. The remaining 20 per cent of sales comes from Fumakilla's
vape mats (10 per cent) and aerosol sprays (10 per cent).
  The company's mosquito coils enjoy a market share of 65 per cent in
Malaysia, and its total sales have grown from RM28 million in 1990 to RM78
million in 1995. The Fumakilla plant at the Prai Industrial Park, Penang,
churns out over 800,000 cartons of 1,000 coils and 100,000 cartons of
1,000 units of vape mats and aerosol sprays a year.
  Fumakilla's president and executive chairman, Datuk Fumihiko Konishi,
says Fumakilla intends to increase the Prai plant's production capacity to
1.6 million cartons a year in five years' time.
  Konishi elaborates, `It does not involve expanding the premises of the
plant or establishing a new one. It is an attempt to reduce the workforce
by using technology.' This automation programme, says Konishi, is a
gradual one which is going to take five years and a significant amount of
investment. Upon completion, it will reduce Fumakilla's staff by half.
  Currently, 25 per cent of Fumakilla's workforce are Bangladeshis. The
company aims to reduce their numbers by not renewing their permits. The
reason? `To reduce cost - we seem to spend more because we have to provide
them with accommodation and transportation plus an annual paid trip back
home as well as uniforms and recreational facilities,' says Konishi.
`Also, if for some reason Bangladeshis have to return to their country,
then our company will be paralysed.
  `Besides, the acute labour shortage in Malaysia will persist. Population
growth cannot catch up with the growth of the industries of this country.
The only way is to introduce automation.' Automation will utilise the same
space as the existing premises. Says Konishi, `Our 7.2 acres will not be
increased. And if we fully automate, then we should be able to double our
capacity.'
  Konishi isn't content with Fumakilla being the market leader in
Malaysia. He has set his eyes on making the company one of Southeast
Asia's insecticide giants. `In 10 years time, I will be talking not about
Fumakilla's Malaysian market share but about its Asean market share. The
total population of the Asean market will reach 500 million by the year
2000. It represents an enormous market,' says a confident Kohishi.
  According to the Fumakilla president, the stage has been set for the
penetration of this regional market. Over 20 per cent of the 800 million
mosquito coils churned out by Fumakilla's Prai plant is exported, mostly
to Asean-member countries. He explains,' `The exports go to Thailand,
where we have captured a 15 per cent market share. I forecast this to
increase to 20 per cent by 1997. Other export destinations are South Korea
where Fumakilla has a 20 per cent market share, and Hong Kong and
Singapore, with smaller market shares.'
  Outside Malaysia, Vietnam is Fumakilla's biggest market, having captured
30 per cent of its market. So much so that Fumakilla set up a
manufacturing facility in the Dong Nai province of Vietnam at a cost of
RM8 million. Production began in December 1995 with a capacity of 200,000
cartons of mosquito coils per year. The capacity is to be doubled by the
end of the year, and this will involve an investment of about RM2.1
million.
  The next step, says Konishi, is to set up a manufacturing facility in
Myanmar next year. `Although we have begun to supply our mosquito coils to
Myanmar from our Penang plant this year, there has been a serious
logistical problem - their ports are congested. Hence, a better way to
penetrate the Myanmar market is to manufacture the coils in the country.
Furthermore, there is an abundant and cheap supply of labour there,' says
Konishi.
  Konishi says Fumakilla's mosquito coils, marketed under the brand names
Fumakilla, Goldfish and Jumbo, have an edge over competitors because they
have a higher content of an active ingredient called d-allethrin. Both
insecticide mats and coils when heated release the d-allethrin chemical
which destroys insects such as mosquitoes. Claims Konishi, `Our product is
50 per cent more effective than the other brands.' He explains why. `We
use 0.3 per cent of this ingredient in every coil while the common
practice among players in the industry is to use only 0.2 per cent.'
  Since d-allethrin costs RM500 per kilogramme, a higher concentration of
the ingredient drives costs up. As a result, Fumakilla's mosquito coils
are priced 20 per cent higher than other brands in the market. But this
does not worry the company. `We reckon our customers will be loyal, and
this is also why we project our sales to grow,' says Konishi. He expects
Fumakilla's market for mosquito coils in Malaysia to increase annually by
four per cent or less in the future.
  Konishi also says Fumakilla takes its research and development
seriously. Its analytical and biological laboratory which focuses on
research into insecticide is the only one of its kind in Asia outside
Japan.
  `In terms of product development, our laboratory comes up with products
that are more effective than our competitors. We have so far invested RM5
million in our R&D facility. In 10 years, we hope to invest at least five
per cent of our sales turnover into R&D,' says Konishi.
  Surprisingly, Fumakilla in Malaysia was not set up to manufacture
mosquito coils, but to import insecticide mats. Established in 1976, the
company started by supplying vape mats made by Fumakilla Japan Ltd - the
inventors of the electronic insecticide device.
  Konishi, a trained chemist from Japan, did not begin his career with
Fumakilla. He spent four years with a Singaporean trading company, leaving
his post as head of its chemical department in 1973 to venture into Penang
to establish Texchem (M) Trading Sdn Bhd (now known as Texchem Resources
Bhd). Among other things, Texchem trades in chemical products. Konishi
also set up a manufacturing company, Texchem (M) Sdn Bhd, which began
production of industrial chemicals in 1976.
  That same year, Konishi decided to get into the insecticide business
with Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed Fumakilla Ltd whose majority
shareholders, the Oshimo family, were family friends. With the assistance
of the Oshimos, Fumihiko incorporated Fumakilla (M) Sdn Bhd in Malaysia on
Dec 29, 1976 to manufacture vape mats. It was converted into a public
company on April 1983.
  However, Konishi says he had a hard time convincing the public to buy an
insecticide which did not produce smoke. `It takes a long time before
people will be comfortable using vape mats which do not produce any smoke
but which are just as effective as mosquito coils. Even in Japan, where
mosquito coils and insecticide mats originated, it took 30 years for the
sale of the mats to rival that of coils,' he says.
  Konishi feels the mosquito coil market is not about to shrink. `Even in
the year 2005, which will be 30 years after the introduction of vape mats
here, I don't think the usage of vape mats would be equivalent to the use
of mosquito coils. This is because of factors such as our lifestyle and
the structure of houses and rooms,' says Konishi.
  Fumakilla's listing exercise on the second board of the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange involves an offer for sale of six million shares at RM3.20
each. Fumakilla has a paid-up capital of RM39.99 million and is
forecasting a pre-tax profit of RM10.943 million on a turnover of RM87.38
million for the year ending Dec 31, 1996. This will give Fumakilla a gross
earnings per share of around 27 sen.
  Thus, at its offer price of RM3.20, its shares are being offered at a
prospective gross price earnings (PE) multiple of 11.8 times. According to
analysts, the consumer products sectoral PE multiple is 21.6 times. Based
on this PE, Fumakilla would probably trade at above RM5.80.

Choices in education: The stage is being set for greater interaction with
Australian edu

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 62

IN THE FIELD of higher education, Australia rates among one of the premier
destinations for Malaysian students wanting to study overseas. Last year,
of the 60,980 local students who went abroad for their tertiary education,
21 per cent chose Australia.
  Australian ties to Malaysia in the field of education date back to the
1950s when `The Lucky Country' was a key participant in the Colombo Plan
which provided education to developing nations of the British
Commonwealth.
  More than half of the average 12,000 Malaysian students admitted into
Australian institutions annually study business-and-economics-related
subjects, while almost a quarter study science and technology-related
subjects, including engineering.
  They study at the more than 300 schools, Technical and Further Education
(Tafe) colleges, specialist colleges and universities spread over
Australia's vast continent.
  But things may change in the near future, and the number of Malaysian
students abroad may fall.
  The reason? About RM2.5 billion leaves Malaysia annually as a result of
Malaysians studying abroad, contributing to the country's large services
deficit. Government authorities are keen to see Malaysia becoming a
regional centre of excellence in education by the year 2020. To help the
Malaysian higher education sector expand, legislation has been tabled to
allow private universities to be established, including the setting up of
branch campuses of foreign universities.
  Interviewed by Malaysian Business, Senator Amanda Vanstone, Australia's
Minister for Employment, Education Training and Youth Affairs, says such a
move is welcomed by Australia as it is in line with Australia's plans for
its education sector.
  Malaysia and Australia, she says, are at the start of a new phase of a
three-stage relationship in education. Says Vanstone, `The first phase
started with the Colombo Plan which saw a small but growing number of
Malaysian and other Commonwealth students going to Australia for their
studies. The second phase was one where there was a big push, with
industry and other private sector interests driving large numbers of
Malaysian students to come to Australia. We think both these phases have
been beneficial to us and, we hope, for Malaysia as well.
  `We are now starting on the third phase, where rather than a one way
flow of students from Malaysia to us, we want to step up the interaction
quite dramatically with things like twinning arrangements, where the
institutions, the academics and researchers will work much more closely
together. This two-way flow of students is a much more dynamic and
exciting relationship than the other two and we wish to emphasise that we
are very keen on building this third phase and pushing it as far as we
can.'
  Vanstone says it won't be long before the number of Australians coming
to Malaysia to study increases, but `perhaps not for full degrees in the
beginning ... just doing semesters up here with twinned institutions'.
  In all likelihood, there will be a drop in the number of Malaysians
wanting to study in Australia. `Things change,' says Vanstone. `I was here
about eight years ago but now, I hardly recognise Kuala Lumpur. The world
is never going to stop changing and we have to learn to move with it. We
are grateful for the opportunities we have had in having a lot of
Malaysian students. Now, we want to work with you on the next phase of
what you want and what we want.'
  In a related development, the Australian government recently announced
its intention of making some substantial savings from the higher education
sector. Vanstone says that as a result of this, Australian universities
will face only a very small reduction in their operating grant. The
reduction is against a growth estimate, adding that the universities will
have more operating grants next year than they had this year, but it will
be a little less than expected. `The big savings we are making does not
come from cutting grants to universities but from increasing the
contributions from Australian university students,' she says.
  Australia has a system of contribution called the Higher Education
Contribution scheme (HECS), introduced by the previous Labour government.
Under this scheme, students can go to university irrespective of the
wealth of their family but the moment they begin to earn wages, they have
to make contributions. However, Vanstone says the present government
intends to make this system of contribution more equitable.
  She explains, `The previous HECS system was one where irrespective of
whether you were a teacher, a doctor or a veterinary science student, the
contribution you were required to make was the same. We think that is
unfair and we are shifting to three levels of contribution where doctors,
veterinary science graduates and lawyers will be in the highest level;
engineering, general science and commerce students in the middle level and
nursing and art students as well as teachers in the lowest level.'
  In relation to the cut in operating grants for universities, Vanstone
says that universities will be allowed to `drop load', that is, to drop
student numbers in the post-graduate course work area. `We want to
increase the numbers in the undergraduate area. We plan to fund 5,000 more
students nationally for undergraduate courses but they are at universities
that will be allowed to drop post-graduate course work-loads such as MBAs.
This means that the total government funding per student will remain
pretty much the same,' Vanstone says.
  Recently however, Australia's reputation as a welcoming country took a
hard knock, no thanks to Australian independent Member of Parliament,
Pauline Hanson. In her maiden speech in Parliament, Hanson blamed Asians
and Aborigines for economic and social problems in the country and linked
Asian citizens to crime and drug problems. As a result, prospective
students are uneasy over their future in Australia. Vanstone took the
opportunity to address the issue, describing Hanson as a renegade and
`maverick' member of parliament and also describing as unfortunate, the
attention given Hanson by the media.
  She says, `It is important to note that when the (Australian) Prime
Minister first heard Hanson's remarks, his instructions were that she
could not stand for Parliament as a Liberal, that those remarks were
inconsistent with Liberal philosophy and hence it was simply not possible
for her to stand under the Liberal banner. She, therefore, stood for
parliament as an Independent and has expressed views which are repugnant
to the government, that are not the government's views.
  `They are certainly not my views. Australia has been a very welcoming
country and it still is. Our door is always open. We feel we have got
enormous benefits from the international students who have come. We look
forward to that continuing and increasing and at the same time, working on
a two-way development with Malaysia and increasing the strength of our
relationship,' she says.

Contractual benefits: Students gain in several ways from the twinning of
the Sepang Institute

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 68

THERE IS ONE simple reason why the Sepang Institute Of Technology (SIT)
chooses to have a twinning programme with the University Of Adelaide (UOA)
- the high standard and reputation of Australia's third oldest university
which ranks among that country's top six.
  SIT chief executive officer Dr Paul Chan says UOA became the obvious
choice as a twinning partner because it is considered as the Oxbridge of
Australia and is highly regarded internationally. `This university has
Noble prize winners (3) and very brilliant staff, Rhodes Scholars among
them. It is not a very huge university but it definitely has won many
awards - recently, Professor Allen Kerr was the winner of the inaugural
Australia Prize and Professor Paul Davis was awarded the Templeton Prize,
previously won by Alexander Solzhenistsyn and Mother Teresa.
  `Students there are well rounded and the entrance requirement is
befitting that of a good university. It is also very proud of its
tradition. The alumni of UOA comprise some of the top people in Singapore
and Malaysia,' says Chan.
  UOA first came to Malaysia in 1994 when SIT was run by the Hong Leong
Group. Director of the SIT-UOA twinning programme and visiting professor
Dr Thomas Kurucsev says, `When the Lion Group bought over the Institute,
we became their twinning partner. Our first intake was early this year,
and 250 students are enrolled in the twinning programme. We hope to
increase the number of students to between 400 and 450 for the second
year. In three to four years, we want to have at least 650 to 700 students
in the twinning pro-gramme.'
  Kurucsev adds, `SIT's scholastic year for the Australian programme is
synchronised with UOA and students sit for the examinations at the same
time as undergraduates in Adelaide.'
  UOA offers SIT students various engineering courses leading to a honours
degree. The other courses offered at SIT are Bachelor of Economics,
Bachelor of Commerce, Bachelor of Computer Science and Bachelor of Science
(Maths and Computer Science). The engineering courses run for four years,
which means students will have to be at SIT for two years before going to
UOA for another two years. The same applies for the other four-year
courses. For the three year courses, students are required to be at SIT
for one year and another two at UOA.
  SIT is the only college in Malaysia with the largest number of
academicians holding PhDs (20) and masters degrees (20), many from
prestigious universities like Harvard, Oxford, London, Toronto, Illinois,
Australian National and Adelaide.
  Kurucsev says SIT-UOA has a strict quality control on courses and this
is achieved several ways, including having a full-time academic director
for the project. SIT has provided a considerable budget which allows
Australian lecturers to come at regular intervals for each subject. The
duration for each subject is between a week and 10 days.
  Apparently, by coming over to Malaysia, the Australians get an
opportunity to give tutorials where they can meet and talk to students
about their courses. `For each semester, there should be two visits per
subject. There should be 20 visits per semester from lecturers from UOA
and that is an absolute minimum,' says Kurucsev.
  According to him, under the agreement, SIT is not allowed to have
another twinning programme with any other Australian university and the
same applies to UOA which cannot have a similar programme with another
local institute.
  Established in 1874, UOA has over 13,000 students, including more than
1,000 international students. The first official ranking of Australian
Universities by the Australian government's Committee for Quality
Assurance in Higher Education in 1995 has confirmed again that UOA is one
of the universities in the top band of institutions in Australia.

Crest and trenergy to tie up?

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 4

SOMETHING seems to be brewing between second boarders Crest Petroleum Sdn
Bhd and Trenergy (M) Bhd.
  Earwitness understands that Crest (formerly T H Loy) is negotiating to
acquire a stake in Trenergy for an undisclosed sum. It is, however, not
likely to be a controlling stake.
  Industry sources say a tie-up between both companies will not come as a
surprise as both are involved in the oil and gas industry.
  Recently, Trenergy director Chee Peck Kiat was reported to have disposed
of his 20 per cent stake in the company. It was not known who the buyer
was.
  Crest, which has a paid-up capital of RM75.78 million, is a member of
the Renong Group. It jointly owns substantial oil reserves, estimated at
110 million barrels, in Sumatra, Indonesia with Petramina and Petronusa.
  Trenergy is headed by Salehuddin Hashim, believed to be a close friend
of Renong chieftain Tan Sri Halim Saad.
  The sources also do not discount the possibility of Crest and Trenergy
collaborating in a technical tie-up.

Crystal clear directions: Construction company Crystal Realty is quite sure
it is ready to take on

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 30

KUCHING-BASED construction firm Crystal Realty Group Bhd may be
comparatively young but within seven years it has garnered enough jobs to
put it well within the top league in its field in rapidly growing Sarawak.
  Formed by two Foochow brothers, Ting Kie Hung, 36, and Ting Bing Cheong,
34, `CR', as the company is known, started in 1989. Among its first jobs
was the RM2.4 million sub-contract to build the Sarawak United People's
Party (SUPP) headquarters in Jalan Tan Sri Ong Kee Hui, Kuching.
  The project was completed well on schedule. Recalls Bing Cheong, a civil
and structural engineer by training, `I literally worked and lived at the
work-site for the duration of the contract period.' He says that for a
year, the oversized container office was his office and living quarters.
  That project was perhaps the most important break the brothers received
after branching off on their own - they had previously worked for their
father Ting Ong Hua who owned Sibu-based Soon Hup Construction Company -
to enter the Kuching market. `We've been kept very busy ever since,' says
Bing Cheong, the group's managing director.
  CR's executive director Huon Chek Khing, 29, shows a list of completed
projects todate valued at about RM133 million and another list of projects
in progress valued at about RM360 million. `We specialise in building
construction, more so now in high-rise buildings,' he says. `The high-rise
buildings under construction include the Tun Jugah Centre, Wisma Bersatul,
Wisma Crystal and Rumah Dayak - all in Kuching.'
  Huon adds that while general and building construction remains the
group's core business, CR has diversified into property development,
property management, mechanical and engineering services, building-related
materials manufacturing, trading and specialised foundation jobs.
  `We're the first Sarawak-based construction group to venture into bore
foundation works. Examples are the Custodev's Twin Tower Block in Rock
Road, the Tun Jugah Centre in Padungan and the MBf building in Jalan
Satok. But that's not all CR is into. It is also the first Kuching-based
company to manufacture non-baked bricks, besides reinforced pre-cast
concrete or ready-mix concrete, under Crystal Concrete Sdn Bhd.
  `Our aim is to be a self-sufficient construction firm by becoming
involved in manufacturing, trading and marketing. All of them complement
our core business. In other words, we want to grow and expand.'
  This interview took place at what Bing Cheong describes as CR's
temporary office on the third floor of Crystal Cineplex Complex in Taman
Satria Jaya, Kuching, pending the completion next year of CR's RM20
million 13-storey corporate headquarters at Jalan Rambutan/Jalan Nanas.
  The group's logo `CR' is in two colours - `C' which is red is usually
associated with prosperity in the Chinese culture, while `R' is blue,
symbolising the sky that is unlimited, like its slogan `Together, We
Build'. A corporate image is strictly maintained - everyone from boss down
to the office boy wears a blue uniform at work. The group also allocates
funds for staff training.
  Not only is the company young but the people managing and working in it
are mostly in their early thirties. With so many projects on hand, the
workforce has increased as well. `Our total staff today is 280, including
50  engineers and managers,' says Bing Cheong.
  CR feels it has marshalled enough experience, expertise and know-how to
attempt bigger things, especially major infra-structural works. It is
undaunted by the competition from the `big boys'.
  With a growing turnover (refer to chart), CR will definitely play a big
role in Sarawak's construction sector in the years to come. According to
Bing Cheong, turnover for 1996 is estimated at about RM75 million, nearly
double that of 1995, which itself is twice that of the previous year.
  `We've got a lot of opportunities here with the Bakun HEP, foreign
investments, mega projects, etc, that will entail a total development
expenditure of some RM75 billion within the next 10 years. There is a
provision of RM1.8 billion alone for infra-structural development for
Sarawak under the Seventh Malaysia Plan. So I think we can share a bit of
the cake,' says Bing Cheong.
  The managing director believes that CR has been in the market
sufficiently long enough to prove its capacity and capability. Its edge
over many others, he claims, lies in having the latest technology in
construction `like the bore piling' and RM25 million worth of construction
equipment ranging from excavators to  cranes and bore piling machines.
  In a competitive environment, every company has to have some kind of an
edge. And the way to achieve that is to synergise people and resources and
keep costs down. Diversifying from its present core business into the
various related activities is part of the long-term strategy.
  Bing Cheong says CR is studying the possibility of getting listed on the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's second board. Like many other Sarawak
contractors, CR sees listing as perhaps the best way to raise the
necessary capital and take advantage of opportunities from the billion-
ringgit projects in Sarawak in the next 10 years.

where D Bhd rebounded strongly after registering a RSI reading of below
30. At the current level of RM1.44, the downside is limited to RM1.40 with
stronger support at RM1.25. Technically it should recover to RM1.85.

Detecting deceit: Some of the ways employees can cheat a company

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 77

MUCH OF OUR work derives from negative events such as stock differences,
indications of fraud or theft, or the leaking of business information. The
tip-off usually comes from someone inside or outside the company, but
often the management hesitates to act on it.
  Denying the problem is no solution. No matter how unpleasant, the
question as to whether something is wrong or not must be answered as the
uncertainty in the long run can be extremely undermining. An investigation
brings clarity, certainty and an end to anxiety and problems.
  Outlined below are some cases where the management has heeded the
signals that demanded action.THE HARD WORKER
  Doubts and suspicions are difficult to work with. That is why a client
wanted us to carry out an investigation into rumours that an employee was
changing car tyres free of charge.
  The rumours did not seem plausible because the employee had been with
the firm for 10 years and, moreover, was a hard worker. But still,
certainty is always better, especially if an innocent person is being
falsely accused.
  The employee was a one-man business inside the firm. He was responsible
for the guarantee work. If there were problems with the tyres delivered,
he assessed the complaint, wrote out the guarantee ticket, fetched new
tyres from the stores and fitted them. No one checked his work. He was a
hard worker who would even work during break times to help a client.
  In reality, he made good use of the fact that everyone else was in the
canteen so that he could arrange his little deals with the clients, who
did not arrive at break time by chance. Our investigation revealed that he
had a number of other little deals which had nothing to do with the firm
but which he conducted during working hours.
  The firm is now an employee the poorer but financially the richer.
  A proper separation of functions plus extra attention to clients who
always ask for the same employee, especially at the beginning or end of
the working day or at break times, is a good step towards fraud
prevention.A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT WITH BITE
  A client had strong suspicions that an employee of his dental laboratory
was carrying out work for a competitor on his own account.
  Our investigation confirmed that he had indeed a lot of contact with the
competition and was carrying out work for the other laboratory, and that
he also carried out work for his employer's customers which he did not put
through the books.
  We also discovered that a second employee was involved with him. The two
of them had built up a strong private working relationship with each
other.
  Both employees had been with the laboratory for about 20 years, but they
had never signed a contract of employment so there were no written rules
about contact with competitors nor anything else. However, we were able to
prove that in carrying out work on their own account for the competitor
and others the two had used the materials, time and apparatus belonging to
their employer.
  Our client has now introduced a contract of employment which makes clear
what is required and what is not allowed and the consequences of breaching
that contract.AGGRESSIVE ADVERTISEMENT CANVASSING
  This `tip' is published at the request of a lawyer in the Dutch city of
Maastricht. Not only this Maastricht lawyer but also various colleagues
inside and outside the Maastricht County Court District are frequently
approached by telephone canvassers who, in an extremely cheeky, cunning
and aggressive manner, try to obtain orders for the placing of
advertisements.
  Often it goes like this.
  The subject is telephoned by a canvasser with the claim that some time
ago an agreement was made by telephone that an advertisement would be
placed, that the proof is ready and will be faxed to the subject, and that
this must be signed as approved and returned.
  Subsequently, a discussion ensues when the subject disputes the supposed
telephone agreement and the canvasser persists with his stand and says
that costs have already accrued for the proof which must be paid for in
any case.
  Cases are known where the telephone argument ends with the canvasser
saying, `We will talk to each other again in front of the judge,' after
which nothing more is heard. It has also happened that in the absence of
the lawyer, the secretary or office manager is approached (in the
foregoing manner) and that under pressure or through misunderstanding,
advertisements have been placed for which an order was never given.
  Our comment: Businesses too are approached in this way. It happens
especially during holiday periods when it is hoped that whoever is filling
in will think that a colleague has ordered the advertisement. Some
canvassers use a well known courier service to deliver the confirmation
and return with the signature. And if their account is not paid, then some
will even call in collection agencies.
  We would advise our readers that those of you who do business in the
Netherlands, if subjected to this kind of approach, could contact the
Stichting Eerlijk Zakendoen (Honest Business Foundation) who, in co-
operation with the Chambers of Commerce, are undertaking action against
these canvassers. The address of the foundation is Werkhovenstraat 94,
9546 VJ The Hague. Tel: 070 3299591, Fax: 070 3299751.DONE DIFFERENTLY
  It was strange that the head of the administration department had needed
to speak to the same driver twice about his failure to hand over the money
for paid invoices. Each time he had a different excuse: his house was
being rebuilt and in the chaos he had lost the money; he thought that he
had paid the money over and wondered if someone in the administration
department had made a mistake.
  Because the driver still enjoyed the management's full confidence it was
thought that he had not done anything dishonest, and when spoken to he had
eventually paid the money over.
  When he failed for the third time to hand over a sum of money, the
directors decided that they had had enough. Perhaps external investigators
would tackle it differently.
  When our investigators were interviewing the driver they quickly
realised that he was not very particular about telling the truth. He told
them that on the morning in question he had not been at work because he
had had to do a vocational test at the labour office. He told our
investigators the room number where he had done the test and gave them the
name and description of the examiner.
  What he did not expect was that they would check what he had told them.
The room number he had given did not exist and the examiner he had named
was on holiday. When confronted with this he admitted that he had not been
to the labour office, he simply wanted a free morning. And what about the
money that he had kept back? If no one had asked about it he would have
kept it.
  At the end of the interview he said, `You go about things differently
than they do here!'TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE
  Two employees left a client company at the same time. Both of them were
experts in their speciality. Although both of them said that they were not
about to undertake competitive employment, the directors had their doubts.
We were asked to carry out an investigation as to whether or not the two
were in breach of the conditions of their former contract of employment.
  During preliminary inquiries, it became apparent that the two were
indeed employed in the same sector as their previous employer. It was
decided to contact them to ascertain how far their activities had
advanced. The first man contacted suggested a meeting in a motel.
  As usual, our investigators arrived long before the appointed time. They
saw the man they had come to meet enter accompanied by a second man. They
took their places at a table close to where our investigators were sitting
and conversed in voices which were easy to overhear. From what they were
saying, one of the men appeared to trust no one.
  When the appointed interview time arrived, our investigators introduced
themselves. The second man who had arrived introduced himself as the other
departed employee. Our investigators had intended to arrange interviews
with the men one at a time but a second interview was now unnecessary. The
conversation provided sufficient information for our investigators to be
satisfied that both men were in breach of their former contract of
employment.  OWN BOSS? YES, BUT ON OWN ACCOUNT TOO!
  A client was tired of the frequent absences of one of his employees. She
claimed to be sick but he was told that she had advertised in a local
newspaper that she gave beauty treatments at home.
  Our investigation revealed that during her periods of absence she had
undertaken various training courses in beauty care. In fact, she had
passed examinations with flying colours. Subsequently, our female
investigators made appointments with her and had facial treatments.
  She is now free to devote all her time and energy to making a success of
her beauty salon - but on her own account and not at her employer's
expense and not at the inconvenience of her colleagues who so frequently
had to do her work.A LITTLE HUMOUR GOES A LONG WAY
  In an previous article, we wrote about a managing director who, in order
to prevent further misuse of the alcoholic contents of the directors'
refrigerator, had stuck a note on the door that said: `God sees
everything'.
  One of our readers thought it a good idea and did the same. Some days
later he found a note stuck underneath his that read: `But He doesn't go
on about it'.
  The message had got across. As one of the directors said to us, `If they
know that I know, it makes a difference. A little bit of prevention.'

Fast and comfortable: Nissan's competitively priced Cefiro offers power
and safety

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 86

AS GIMMICKS GO, not many would venture so far as the engineers at Nissan.
They fitted their latest 24-valve DOHC V6 engine to power the jet
propellor of a two-seater light aircraft to prove a point.
  The point of the exercise - to prove that should anyone be so inclined,
the new Nissan Cefiro 3-litre, for which the engine was developed, can
fly. In a test drive conducted by Malaysian Business, fly it literally did
- the car, as did the E-Racer light aircraft whose successful flight one
might assume will give Nissan ideas far above their `station.'
  That may be for the future. For now, all that `fit-to-fly' technical
excellence is neatly packaged under the hood of Nissan's first foray into
the 3000cc class, which up till now has been the sole preserve of well-
established European makes in this country. The first Cefiro which was
introduced in 1988 was a hit in its home shores. But while sales were
brisk enough, it received rather lukewarm response elsewhere. Almost a
decade on, changes were made, designed to make various dimensions of the
new hybrid higher, wider and longer. In the words of Tan Hoe Pin, deputy
managing director of Edaran Tan Chong Motor Sdn Bhd, Nissan's goal was to
improve on the basic concept of the car particularly in terms of its
performance, styling, technology as well as active and passive safety
standards. The result is the creation of a sports sedan that is wide-
bodied with a high degree of luxury and comfort.
  The heartbeat of the new Cefiro V6 is its 3.0 Litre 24-Valve Double
Overhead Camshaft (DOHC) Engine Concentrated Control System (ECCS) engine
which is a proven high performance power plant that generates plenty of
power and brisk responsiveness. Despite that, it is subjected to less
vibration and, Nissan claims, is therefore less noisy. Engine roar was
detectable but not to the point of distraction. Ride comfort is extremely
smooth and fuel consumption is miserly for a 3-litre. (On a full tank, MB
clocked up 254km on the odometer before the fuel indicator began to nudge
the `fuel warning' level).
  Its extremely compact engine given the code VQ30DE with its all-
aluminium block is packed with performance enhancing technologies. For
this Nissan redesigned its original V6 engine that is 20 per cent lighter,
uses 10 per cent fewer parts and takes 40 per cent less time to put
together. The twin intake/exhaust valve configuration and narrow valve
angle combine to produce more powerful combustion, resulting in higher
output.
  Extensive friction-reducing technologies (molybdenum-coated pistons and
a microfinished crankshaft) and the use of lightweight engine components
contribute to excellent throttle response and fuel economy. The new engine
is in fact 29kg lighter, yet has 1000 cc more displacement. There is also
improved cooling with each engine block and cylinder head having separate
cooling, allowing for the use of small sized water pumps.
  Where the previous 2-litre Cefiro engine was a twin-cam six cylinder
producing 130 brake horsepower (bhp), this new engine winds up to 193bhp
peaking at 6,400 rpm with 26kg metres of torque at 4,000 rpm. Its power
and reliability was put to the test on the E-Racer aircraft. Shod with the
Cefiro engine, it took off and flew at a speed of 299 mph with a payload
of 800lbs.
  Translated to actual driving performance, what does it all mean? Sheer
power one must say. During the test drive down the Kuala Lumpur-Seremban
Highway towards the Kajang exit, it was a chore keeping the frisky beast
from bolting in defiance of the road traffic ordinance. Power appeared
readily on tap, an ever so gentle tap on the accelerator and the engine
purrs along uncomplainingly pushing the speedometer dial round the dial
face. It was only when the coast was clear (we shall not reveal the time
and place in deference of the law) that we dared push the new Cefiro to
its limits and tasted the engine's true potential.
  All the time one was on the road, there was a great feeling of comfort
and safety. With good reason too as the new Cefiro has been designed with
a comprehensive range of active and passive safety features, the most
distinctive of which are the four-channel Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) and
the Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) for the driver. To enhance
structural integrity and help create a safer vehicle, the new Cefiro
features extra door padding, additional ribs in the front side member,
reinforced front and side pillars and extra bracing in the door sill.
  Additionally, front side structural members are designed to crush
progressively to help minimise intrusion into the passenger cabin. All
door panels are also reinforced with internal side door beams for added
resistance to side impact. Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR) seatbelts
with vertically adjustable anchors for the front seats help maximise
safety for passengers.
  The cabin interior gives the Cefiro an air of efficient functionality.
Indeed smoothly unfussy. All the key controls are within easy reach. The
central dividing panel housing the controls of the sound system and air-
conditioning is well laid out. The air-conditioning level is digitally
controlled with the occupants needing simply to key in the required
temperature level and adjusting the position of the air vents at the push
of a button.
  A twin sprung cup holder rests on the central divider forward of a deep
cushion-covered tray to stash away an assortment of knick knacks away from
prying eyes. The passenger side sun flap has a thoughtful touch - - when
pulled towards the occupant, a rectangular flap can be flicked open to
reveal a decent-sized vanity mirror with two tiny light bulbs on either
side.
  Nissan calls the new Cefiro a luxury sedan. In the ride comfort
department, this tag is well-deserved. Its rear multi-link beam suspension
takes care of all the bumps and ruts any neglected road long overdue for a
VIP visitor can offer. The rear wheels are mounted on a torsion beam to
maximise tyre grip, eliminating scuff changes and variation in vehicle
attitude when taking corners which tends to induce fatigue all round.
  In straight-line driving, the suspension minimises body sway and
maintains a steady stance for directional stability. The ride is quiet and
comfortable with little vibration and noise. When negotiating corners, the
load is optimally distributed over the four tyres to increase stability.
  There is a little idiosyncratic touch too - all the car doors lock
automatically within a few seconds of the driver side door being closed
without it being locked itself! The sound system takes some getting used
to as a number of stations appear to be transmitting programmes from some
huge cavern, complete with echo.
  One surprisingly contentious issue which surfaced when the car was first
introduced to the motoring journalism fraternity was Edaran TCM's pricing
strategy. A few seasoned campaigners who found that at RM138,000, (on-the-
road with metallic paint) they could now afford 3-litre luxury on their
pay package, insisted something was amiss. `Where's the luxury and
exclusivity if humble `ol me can afford one?' opined a highly distressed
and venerable editor of a equally venerable automobile monthly. His
colleague chipped in to support albeit with self-deprecating candour,
`It's too affordable. I'll buy it and that is sure to kill any designs of
turning the car into a really serious status symbol.'
  The last word must go to Tan. He says, `The new Cefiro is not cheap.
Just competitively priced. We received 100 bookings even before the
launch.'Specifications: Nissan Cefiro V6 3.0L Automatic

Fired by hypermarkets: Metrojaya brings style and ambience to its Cosmart
hypermarkets

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 49

LATER THIS MONTH, leading retailer Metrojaya Bhd will open the doors of
its newest venture, a 85,000 sq ft hypermarket in the Pandan Capitol
shopping mall in Pandan Indah, Kuala Lumpur. It hopes to draw not only
hordes of the 100,000 residents of the township but also shoppers from
further afield such as Ampang and Cheras.
  Metrojaya reckons that purchases at this hypermarket would add another
RM65 million annually to company coffers - a boost which the public-listed
company could do with. For the past three financial years (1994 to 1996)
group turnover has grown only marginally from RM221 million to RM238
million. The main reason, according to Lee Cheng Toh, general manager of
Metrojaya Departmental Stores, is that Metrojaya has not set up any major
departmental store (except for the smaller specialty stores) since its
last one at Menara Bakti in Petaling Jaya's Section 14 back in 1992. `In
an over-retail market, much incremental growth cannot be expected from
existing stores. It has to be fired by new big stores,' she says.
  However, with its hypermarket venture, turnover is set to perk up. After
all early birds Carrefour and Giant have demonstrated that hypermarkets -
a vast, no frills, self-service, warehouse kind of shopping environment
where the draw is cheaper prices - are making a big hit with shoppers
looking for bargains all year round.
  Now other retailers want to get into the act. Take Metrojaya, which has
traditionally positioned its departmental stores and specialty shops (with
the exception of Reject Shop) in the higher end of the market, now opting
to sprinkle its `Metro Magic' nearer the other end too. As Lee admits,
`The main core of the market is still the mass market, the below middle
income group. While Metrojaya has done exceedingly well in its mid-to-
upper market niche, we are missing out on this large segment.'
  To carve out a share of the mass market, Cosmart Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Metrojaya, was incorporated to start a chain of Cosmart
hypermarkets offering general merchandise and supermarket goods (from
foodstuffs to electrical to clothing) at very competitive rates. Besides
its maiden outlet at Pandan Indah, Cosmart will operate a second
hypermarket in the Bukit Jambul Complex up north in Penang by April 1997.
Down south, in Seremban, another Cosmart hypermarket is slated to be the
anchor tenant of a new shopping complex to be jointly developed by
subsidiaries of Metrojaya and PhileoLand Bhd. It should be operational by
the end of 1998.
  But even before this Seremban outlet, Cosmart is scouting hard for
another site within the Klang Valley or in Johor Bahru, unperturbed that
the sites might become a hot bed of competition. Says Chai Chin Cheok,
assistant general manager of Cosmart, `As a retailer, we cannot be afraid
of competition.'
  However, competition is dogging its heels. One of the country's biggest
retailers, Parkson Corporation Sdn Bhd, which reportedly raked in over RM1
billion in sales this year, will launch its first hypermarket (the Xtra
Supercentre chain) at the UE Shopping Mall in Cheras in December, right
after Metrojaya's Pandan Indah's opening. On a straight-line projection,
the two hypermarkets will be about 5 km apart. Furthermore, Parkson is
also expected to have five hypermarkets in major towns such as Johor Bahru
and Ipoh, and in Penang by the end of next year.
  Giant TMC Bhd, one of the early birds in the hypermarket scene with its
very successful Giant Cash & Carry in Subang Jaya, has announced that it
will sink in at least RM50 million to set up three more hypermarkets in
Cheras (again), Ipoh and Johor Bahru within the next three years and has
bought, or is in the process of buying, the land for the marts. Last
month, it opened its second Giant hypermarket in Ulu Klang. It is also
eyeing Penang and Kota Bahru as possible hypermarket locations in its
future expansion plans.
  Being neither the first nor the last to set up hypermarkets, what edge
has Metrojaya got over the rest of the pack?
  Ambience, for one, says Lee. `In terms of design and physical setup, we
have  tried to be more interesting, more organised, more colourful, to
have more signages so that customers will be able to locate their
purchases easily from day one, and to essentially turn the normally drab
look of hypermarkets into a more pleasing shopping ambience. For instance,
in our clothing section, we don't just have rows of blouses and rows of
skirts, but we also have coordinated displays of tops and bottoms.'
  Another is merchandising. Cosmart hypermarkets do not follow the rule of
thumb about stocking the shelves with whatever is cheap. `Metrojaya's
buying culture that quality is better than price is also being adopted in
Cosmart. Our buyers are trained not to compromise too much on quality just
for price's sake,' says Lee. `Hence, we are not out to declare that we are
the cheapest, but that we are competitively priced and we give value for
money.'
  Chai is quick to assert that this does not mean Cosmart is not striving
for low prices. `In sourcing for our goods, we cut out a lot of the
middlemen. For instance, with vegetables we go direct to the farmers.'
  Cosmart will have to cough up RM15 million in terms of set-up and
inventory costs for the Pandan Indah outlet and RM20 million each for the
Penang and Seremban hypermarkets. With an authorised and paid-up capital
of only RM3 million and RM1 million respectively (though these will be
increased to RM10 million and RM5 million), the funding will come from
parent Metrojaya. Metrojaya recently got the greenlight for a one-for-two
bonus issue and a three-for-one rights issue at RM3 a share. The rights
exercise will raise RM252 million next year, part of which will go to
finance the Cosmart operations.
  Metrojaya plans to have six Cosmart hypermarkets in the country by the
year 2000. By then Cosmart should be contributing as much as 30 per cent
to group turnover, same as Metrojaya's specialty stores, with the
remainder coming from the departmental store operations.

A new way to fly: Heli Asia is a platform for helicopter manufacturing
sub-contracting

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 53

HELICOPTER manufacturers sub-contracting parts of the aircraft in
Malaysia.
  Alexander Shephard, managing director of a UK-based aviation magazine
publisher, the Shephard Press, says this trend is already apparent in
several Asian countries such as China, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
  Shephard, who is also chairman of Shephard Conference, says for example,
there was a joint venture with a 39 per cent work share package between
China and Singapore companies in the manufacturing of the European Union's
Eurocopter 120. Besides this, the South Korean Daewoo Group is
collaborating with a Russian  company in the production of the MK-30
helicopter, while an Australian company, Hawk Pacific, is venturing into
the manufacturing of components for the McDonnell Douglas Corp's Explorer.
  Shephard says, `Of late, the American helicopter manufacturers have
become more aware that they will not be able to sell their aircrafts
without an offset programme such as in the manufacturing of components.'
He believes there is a growing demand for helicopter services among the
local companies and organisations such as in oil and gas exploration, the
police force and even an air ambulance service.
  `Just think of the hassles of going through a traffic jam. With the
availability of helicopter landing platforms in most of the high-rise
buildings in Kuala Lumpur, I do not think it impossible that more
companies will resort to using such aircrafts as a means of
transportation,' he adds. Shephard was in Kuala Lumpur for the inaugural
Heli Asia Conference and Exhibition held from Nov 5-7 at the Shangri-La
Hotel. The event, organised by Shephard Conference, was held to provide an
insight into the helicopter industry as well as business opportunities in
producing the aircraft components, and to address the civil and defence
helicopter operations within the expanding Asian market.
  Among the topics discussed at the conference were the areas of support
helicopters, naval helicopters, tactical doctrine, battlefield survival,
training, attack helicopters and operational experience. `Heli Asia is the
region's first event devoted entirely to the helicopter industry,'
Shephard says.
  The three-day conference and exhibition, covering both civil and
military rotary-wing aviation, attracted some 4,000 trade visitors. A
total of 120 exhibitors from over 26 countries participated. The United
States had the biggest representation with well-known helicopter
manufacturers like Boeing Helicopters, Sikorsky and Bell Helicopter Asia.
Other exhibitors included Eurocopter SA, Westland Helicopter, Teledyne Inc
and Turbomeca of France.
  Franco-German helicopter manufacturer, Eurocopter, a subsidiary of Aero-
spatiale of France, announced that they had sealed a deal for the purchase
of their newest lightweight helicopter, the EC135, to the Tengku Mahkota
of Pahang, Tengku Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah. Tengku Abdullah will be the
first Asian to take delivery of the EC135 when it arrives here early next
year. Launched in 1994, the EC135, the lightest in the light-twin engine
class, is a seven/eight-seater which can be utilised as an emergency
evacuation vehicle.
  Asked why the organiser chose Kuala Lumpur as the first venue for the
event, Shephard explains it is mainly due to the growing number of
helicopter users among Malaysian companies and organisations. Malaysia is
an ideal location for bringing people in. `It is a big opportunity for the
Western world to influence decision makers in Asia,' Stephenson says,
adding that it will serve as the key venue for these regions as well as
open the door to this huge and largely untapped market. Promotions on Heli
Asia were held during the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace
(Lima) '95 exhibition.
  Shephard says Heli Asia has presented opportunities for new partnerships
and joint ventures in these areas as Asia is now a source of financing for
new technology projects. `We believe Heli Asia is a success,' he says.
  Shephard confirms that Kuala Lumpur will re-host the second Heli Asia in
1998 in light of the favourable response to the inaugural event and
because of its strategic location. He adds that there is the possibility
of more static and flying demonstrations in 1998 at the Sultan Abdul Aziz
Shah International Airport in Subang when it is turned into an aviation
exhibition centre after the KL  International Airport in Sepang becomes
operational.
  `We will eventually turn the event into the largest rotary-wing
exhibition in the region in years to come,' Shephard adds.
  Malaysia Airlines chairman Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli feels that helicopters,
commonly used for military and security operations, are making their
presence felt in commercial aviation. He says helicopters are known to be
the most effective form of transport and workhorse for the offshore oil
industry, transporting medical supplies to the remote interior, search and
rescue, and in recent years, extracting timber from remote jungles.
  `Tourism will especially be boosted with more helicopter charter
operations to the many resort islands and tourist spots. That's why we
need more heliports in cities,' Tajudin says.
  During the exhibition, US helicopter giant Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation
concluded two Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Malaysian Helicopter
Services Bhd (MHS) and Airod Sdn Bhd to pave the way for the setting up of
Asia's second service centre for the S-76C helicopters after Tokyo. The
MOUs were part of the offset programme following Malaysia's order for two
US-made Sikorsky S-70A Black Hawk helicopters for VIP transport.
  Sikorsky's managing director (Malaysia) John J Carson says his company
has signed a service centre agreement to allow both parties to evaluate it
before a final decision on the matter can be reached. MHS operates six S-
76Cs and four Eurocopter Super Pumas for offshore operations. Of the Black
Hawks, Carson says both are expected to be delivered by March 1998. One
helicopter will fly with four additional fuel tanks giving it extended
range.
  The Black Hawks boast high-tech avionics, including the Honeywell
Electronic Flight Information System, and is based on the basic UH-60A
Black Hawk airframe.
  Another US giant, Boeing Helicopters, is negotiating with the Malaysian
government to sell six CH-47 Chinooks, heavy-lift helicopters, to the
RMAF. Boeing representative Jack Satterfield says the talks are in the
preliminary stages. The CH-47 Chinook is currently in service with most
air forces in the world, including Singapore and Thailand. Kawasaki Heavy
Industries assembles the Chinook under licence locally where Japan is the
largest operator of the helicopter outside the United States.

Shopping in a green world: Britain's first environmentally friendly
supermarket opens its doors

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 51

IT HAD TO come: a chain of supermarkets with an environmental conscience.
Out of This World is heralded by its originators as `a one-stop shopping
ethical experience that enables people to shop in the high street and
invest in a better world at the same time'.
  `Rather than the customer having to go to several outlets in search of
environmentally friendly products, we provide everything under the same
roof,' says Andy Houghton, manager of the branch in Bristol, west of
England.
  `It has been estimated that around five per cent of the population are
ethically aware but only one per cent actually do anything about it,' he
adds. Houghton's branch is the second to open out of a chain of 200 shops
planned.
  Described by a leading newspaper as `the most radical experiment in
British retailing for 1ystem centuries', Out of This World is the brainchild
of Richard Adams, someone with impeccable credentials for starting such a
venture.
  In 1972, Adams set up an agricultural imports company, working with
horticultural groups in developing countries that lead to the founding of
Teacraft, the craft-marketing arm of the major UK relief and development
charity, the TEAR fund.
  Furthermore, in 1979, Adams established the independent company,
Traidcraft, that become a public company in 1984 offering the first
`alternative' public share issue in the United Kingdom. Todate, Traidcraft
has marketed over STG30 million of craft, food and clothing products from
the Third World, and its linked charity, Traidcraft Exchange, has engaged
in large-scale community business development projects in several
developing countries.
  `For 25 years I've been involved in many organisations which help people
to shop or invest for a better world. Out of This World is doing just
that, right on the local high street,' says Adams.
  Out of This World is the official trading name for the Creative Consumer
Cooperative. Anyone can join. Membership costs STG5 for life,
automatically making customers into shareholders who, consequently, can be
extremely influential on all aspects of the shops.
  Shareholders become eligible for in-store promotions and they receive
regular updates on the progress of the society and eventually a dividend
on purchases. As Adams says, `This is a business with a difference - owned
and run by a community of people seeking to increase their commitment to a
more sustainable lifestyle and a safer world.'
  It would be hard to imagine a more environmentally correct chain of
shops than Out of This World. The whole nature of the shops is as `green'
as could be: the coolants in the freezer cabinets have been replaced by
the non-hazardous refrigerant, CARE 50, that neither depletes the ozone
layer nor contributes to global warming.
  The counter tops are made out of recycled plastic bottles and the
shelving is processed from pine thinnings from managed plantations. It
almost goes without saying that the paints, finishes and stains are all
solvent-free and that the labelling and promotions use recycled card and
board.
  Bristol manager Houghton adds, `We cover the globe. We have about 80
suppliers who source hundreds of products from Asia, Africa, South America
and countries across the developing world.'
  A long-term aim is to have computer data instantly available on every
product, specifying its `green' credentials and its provenance. At the
moment, only 10 per cent of the stock is on the system. But as Houghton
declares, `We're got to be transparent. It is crucial we justify
everything we do and stock.'
  There is a strong emphasis on organic produce including vegetables,
dairy products, herbs, spices, cereals, wines, beer, bread, fruit and
meat. The choice of products is extremely wide, and apart from the
predictable pulses, there are Indian, Mexican, Japanese and kosher
foodstuffs as well as numerous types of oils, including walnut, almond,
grapeseed, sesame, olive and hazelnut.
  The honey section is equally extensive, including clear types from Chile
and delicious Tabora honey from Tanzania produced by a bee-keepers'
cooperative. Everything on sale has been screened for additives - even the
tomato ketchup.
  An attractive aspect of the stores is that in addition to the main
stock, each shop will also have a selection of products and crafts sourced
locally. For instance, the Bristol branch sells handicraft baskets made
from willows grown in the Somerset levels. `We buy locally whenever we
can,' says Houghton.
  This admirable policy saves Out of This World from being another chain
of identical-looking shops and gives each store a regional character all
of its own. Also available are books, including cookery, yoga and
children's titles, cosmetics and aromatherapy items and clothes made of
cotton.
  New customers are often cautious. `Yes, it can look a bit exotic,'
admits Houghton. `But there are plenty of satisfied customers who say
things like, "I haven't tasted bacon like this since I was a child".' -

Getting a grip: The proposed listing of Multi-Purpose Capital Holdings may
just give the

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 6

MYRIAD AND multifarious. That perhaps best describes the sprawling
Kamunting-Multi-Purpose Group today - the growing empire of tycoon Datuk
Lim Thian Kiat.
  At age 36, the reclusive tycoon controls at least six listed companies -
Kamunting Corporation Bhd, Multi-Purpose Holdings Bhd (MPHB), Magnum
Corporation Bhd, Bandar Raya Developments Bhd, Leisure Management Bhd and
Malaysian Plantations Bhd. Most of them seem to be interlinked via
complicated crossholdings. Lim also holds the second largest stake in
Sarawak Enterprise Corporation Bhd (formerly Dunlop Estates Bhd).
  The sheer number of listed companies in his stable means that Lim has
his fingers in a great many pies. For example, gaming is carried out via
Magnum and Leisure Management, finance and banking via Multi-Purpose
Holdings, property development via Bandar Raya Developments, stockbroking
via Malaysian Plantations which owns JB Securities, and toll collection
via Kamunting Corporation Bhd which holds the Jalan Kuching toll
concession. He is also involved in electricity via Sarawak Enterprise
Corporation.
  Although the last couple of years may have been relatively quiet for the
Kamunting-MPHB Group, the board has nevertheless kept busy. Significant
events include the acquisition of stockbroker JB Securities, relinguishing
control of Dunlop Estates (now Sarawak Enterprise Corporation), the
completion of its multi-million ringgit headquarters in Kuala Lumpur and
the controversy which erupted over its Kepong toll concession. There has
also been the much talked about proposed listing of Multi-Purpose Capital
Holdings Bhd (M Capital). MPHB minority shareholders are hoping for a
windfall in the form of a restricted offer for sale.
  Unfortunately, with MPHB being involved in such a complex and diverse
web of activities, it causes difficulties for analysts and investors alike
to get a grip on the Lim colossus.
  Says an analyst, `We don't follow MPHB because it's too complex. And we
don't know his direction. Investors and shareholders like to know what is
in store.' The tycoon's low profile is of no help either.
  This is particularly true of Lim's flagship company, MPHB. Currently,
very few analysts track the counter, citing complexity and opacity.
However, an analyst from a major retail stockbroking house says it's
probably about time to start studying the counter, `Maybe in a month's
time.' The relatively stagnant share price is also a deterrent. MPHB has
been drifting in the region of between RM3.30 and RM4.30 the past year.
Says a stockbroker tongue-in-cheek, `That's because it's a main board
company.'
  But it cannot be denied that MPHB is one of the heavyweights of the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). As at Nov 2, its market capitalisation
was RM3.214 billion, ranking it at number 41. Even heavier was Magnum at
RM6.555 billion, placing it at 16th place.
  The torpor in the trading of MPHB shares can also be attributed to the
lack of fresh major corporate developments. Says an analyst, `There's only
one million-dollar question at MPHB - when will M Capital be listed?' M
Capital is the holding company for the group's commercial banking arm,
Multi-Purpose Bank Bhd (formerly known as Malaysian-French Bank Bhd).
  M Capital holds 70 per cent in the bank while the remainder is held by
Banque Indosuez of Paris. The group's finance company, Multi-Purpose
Finance Bhd, its general insurance company Multi-Purpose Insurance Bhd,
and Multi-Purpose Credit Holdings Sdn Bhd all also come under the umbrella
of M Capital.
  But there has been some speculation that Multi-Purpose Bank itself may
be listed separately. However, MPHB executive director Khaw Chay Tee
dismisses such talk. `There are currently no firm plans to list Multi-
Purpose Bank. The management is concentrating its efforts on achieving
Tier-1 Status for the bank under the two-tier regulatory system, as soon
as possible.'
  Even so, some analysts speculate that Lim is still desirous of floating
his financial arm. If this is so, then he is probably undaunted by the
fact that the proposed listing of M Capital had already been turned down
once before. In 1994, the proposed flotation of M Capital was thrown out
by the Securities Commission.
  The reason? Non-compliance with the chain-listing requirements. The
rules state that the subsidiary to be listed must not contribute to more
than 35 per cent of its parent's pre-tax profit. Also, the proposed
listing could have hit another snag - Magnum Corp and Leisure Management,
both of whom are gaming-based, hold shares in Multi-Purpose Finance.
  Now, though, it's a different story. The group undertook a restructuring
exercise which delineated its activities into clear-cut areas like finance
and gaming. With the restructuring, analysts estimate that M Capital
contributes about 25 per cent to MPHB's group profits. Thus, the chain-
listing issue does not arise anymore.
  The gaming-finance conflict has also been resolved by putting Magnum and
M Capital at arms' length. Recently, MPHB made a voluntary general offer
for all the shares in subsidiary M Capital that it does not own. This will
relieve Magnum of its stake in M Capital and enable the former to comply
with a Bank Negara directive to divest its entire interests in Multi-
Purpose Finance.
  MPHB currently holds 168 million shares, or 76.36 per cent, in M
Capital. The rest belongs to Magnum, Leisure Management and Kamunting. The
offer price for the shares would be RM2.60 per share, thus involving a
total cash payout of RM135.2 million.
  Whether this price consideration for the minority shareholders of
Magnum, Leisure Management and Kamunting truly reflects the fair value of
M Capital cannot be ascertained. Says a research head, `With the recent
reorganisation of the group, M Capital's likelihood of getting listed is
bright.'
  Indeed, market rumours continue to be rife as to which second board
counter will be the target of a reverse takeover by M Capital. Even Red-
Box was at one time the hot favourite. But Khaw dispels the reverse
takeover talk (see sidebar).
  But the fact remains that Multi-Purpose Bank is the jewel in M Capital.
The bank had shareholders' funds of RM315.5 million in 1995. It needs to
increase this to RM500 million to make it to Tier-1. At end-1995, its
total assets stood at RM8.5 billion, total deposits at RM3.9 billion and
total loans at RM3.2 billion.
  With the reengineering, there was also a clearer direction for the MPHB
Group. However, most analysts are still vague about what that is. Asks
one, `Do they have a focus?'
  Explains Khaw, `Since 1991, the MPHB Group has had three core
businesses, namely financial services, property and gaming. The group was
therefore in a position, at the end of 1995, to take on the challenge of
an additional core business in the form of electricity generation,
transmission and distribution through Sarawak Enterprise.'
  For the year ended Dec 31, 1995, MPHB achieved a pre-tax profit of
RM525.85 million, a 17 per cent increase over the previous year's profit
of RM449.87 million. Turnover increased from RM2.6 billion to RM2.87
billion. Of this amount, the banking and financial services division
chalked up profits of RM116.7 million. The property division recorded
profits of RM150.31 million while the gaming division proved to be the
cash cow with profits of RM384.04 million.
  However, profits and turnover are expected to take a drastic dive in
FY1996 because of the transformation of former subsidiaries, Sarawak
Enterprise Corporation and Magnum Corporation, into associate companies
via the restructuring exercise.
  At end-1994, MPHB had three listed subsidiaries - 51.04 per cent of
Magnum, 51 per cent of Sarawak Enterprise and 36.9 per cent of Bandar
Raya. But the stakes in Sarawak Enterprise and Magnum have since been
trimmed to less than 30 per cent.
  For the half-year ended June 30, 1996, MPHB's profit dropped by 31 per
cent to RM157.84 million from RM227.43 million the previous corresponding
period. The lower profit was recorded on the back of a much-reduced group
turnover of RM415.882 million against RM1.305 billion in the first half of
1995.
  Apart from lower contributions from Magnum and Sarawak Enterprise,
analysts expect MPHB to suffer a massive hit of about RM47 million in
interest charges on its RM600 million revolving credit facility. Announced
in January 1996, this loan is to finance its purchase of 262.86 million
Magnum shares on the basis of nine Magnum shares for every 10 Dunlop (now
Sarawak Enterprise) shares held as at Dec 27, 1995. It is believed this
exercise will demarcate Magnum and Sarawak Enterprise into wholly separate
entities with MPHB as the holding company.
  However, analysts say the high interest charges will be dissipated with
the proposed rights issue of a five-year, three per cent irredeemable
convertible unsecured loan stocks (ICULs) on the basis of one ICUL for one
share. There will also be a special Bumiputera issue of 15.022 million
shares at RM3.80 each.
  Taking into account the new Bumiputera issue and the full conversion of
warrants and employee share options, MPHB's paid-up capital would balloon
from an estimated RM751.1 million to over RM1 billion. However, the
dilution in earnings per share, given the inflated share capital, should
be neutralised by contributions from new associate Sarawak Enterprise.
  Reckons an analyst, `The diversification into electricity generation
will power earnings in the medium term. Its investment in Sarawak
Enterprise will enable the group to become a power generator and
distributor in Sarawak.'
  For the year ending Dec 31, 1996, analysts forecast a pre-tax profit of
RM350 million on a turnover of RM943.3 million, a sharp drop compared with
1995's profits of RM525.85 million and turnover of RM2.87 billion.
  This would put FY1996 net earnings per share (EPS) at 21.1 sen. Given a
current market price of around RM4.40, the shares are trading at
prospective price earnings (PE) multiple of 21 times.
  For FY1997, analysts estimate improved pre-tax profits of RM420 million
on a turnover base of RM1.132 billion. Based on a net EPS of 25.4 sen, the
shares will trade at a prospective PE multiple of 17.3 times.

Editorial: Heed Auditor-General's report

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 1

IF THE Auditor-General feels frustrated at times, he has good reason to.
Every year, he highlights irregular accounting practices, mismanagement of
funds and dereliction of duty in state agencies. And every year these
agencies continue to ignore his advice and recommendations.
  But each time the Auditor-General's report is released, there is the
usual excitement and publicity in the media followed by comments from
various quarters. Initially, there will a chorus call to rectify the
situation. But after sometime, the excitement fizzles out.
  Take the example of Penang's state secretariat which failed to submit
records on revenue for 18 out of 42 housing schemes. `This failure has
been highlighted several times in the past, but to date, it has not been
rectified,' laments Datuk Mohd Khalil Mohd Noor in his 1994 report.
  We can understand his frustration. But the nagging question remains -
why are some government servants, politicians included, so defiant?
  Is it a case of a shortage of staff, plain ignorance or simply, a
lackadaisical attitude?
  Widespread discrepancies in the accounts of government agencies are not
something to be taken lightly. It can give rise to all kinds of
allegations, including corrupt practices. Menteri besars and chief
ministers should ensure that all government agencies attempt to put things
right as soon as possible.
  Earlier this month, it was announced that a government committee will be
established to see if action needs to be taken against two states for
irregular accounting practices. It is a laudable move.
  But more needs to be done. For a start, every state should set up a
special panel to address shortcomings highlighted in the Auditor-General's
report.
  Each of these panels should be compelled to give a detailed report to
the finance minister as to what course of action has been taken to address
the discrepancies. Disciplinary action should be taken against states
which remain defiant.
  Civil servants are entrusted with public funds. That trust must not be
betrayed. It boils down to a question of accountability to the rakyat.
After all, is it not the taxpayers who pay their salaries and bonuses?

Expanding horizons: With Samsung Malaysia's expansion programme in its
Seremban complex in i

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 18

WHEN making glass, pure sand is a prerequisite. Says Samsung Malaysia
president and managing director Kim Jin Ki, `We used to use Australian
sand to make glass (monitors and funnels at Samsung Corning Malaysia Sdn
Bhd). Now we use Johor sand, which is cheaper to transport.'
  Of course, using Johor sand as a core ingredient is not merely a means
to trim costs. The gesture can also be interpreted as a measure of Samsung
Malaysia's commitment towards localising operations. Says Kim, `Our local
component ratio, including the sand, is 81 per cent. Some components are
still made in Korea.'
  Nevertheless, Samsung Malaysia's search for local component
manufacturers is still going strong. Says Kim, `Our target next year is to
have between 81-85 per cent local content.'
  Samsung Malaysia's desire for local content is not confined to
production alone. The workforce is also being Malaysianised. Currently,
this Korean chaebol employs more than 7,500 staff in its ten Malaysian
companies (refer to table and pie chart). Departments are now mostly
headed by Malaysians with the aim of employing locals for top positions.
There are about a hundred Korean expatriates, including Kim himself.
  Says Kim, `Our target is to bring this down to 50 or 60 Koreans in two
or three years, or fewer than one per cent Korean.' Technicians and
engineers are continually sent to Samsung facilities in Korea for
training. From 1991 to 1996, 782 employees were sent to Korea for six
months' training, says Kim.
  Despite Samsung Malaysia's attempts to promote localisation, a wholly-
Malaysian workforce is not an attainable goal if locals simply don't want
to join them. Given the country's zero unemployment situation, it's very
hard to find workers, says Kim. To fill vacancies, Samsung Malaysia has
resorted to hiring foreigners. Says Kim, `They get the same pay as locals.
Actually, we pay them more because we cover their transportation and
lodging costs.' (Refer to boxed story.) Right now, there are 900
Indonesians working at Samsung, `with the permission of the state
government'.
  If localisation is a priority in Samsung Malaysia's manufacturing
activities, the reverse is true of the company's sales. Like other
multinationals, Samsung Malaysia's markets span the globe. Says Kim, `Of
the manufacturing activities, 99.5 per cent of the products manufactured
in the four factories are exported.'
  Penetrating international markets is necessary for Samsung Malaysia,
since it is impossible for the local market to provide much depth. For
instance, Samsung Malaysia expects 1996 total sales from three of its four
factories - Samsung Electron Devices (M) Sdn Bhd, Samsung Corning (M) Sdn
Bhd and Samsung Electronics Display (M) Sdn Bhd, which are housed at the
Samsung Electronics Seremban Complex - to touch RM2.3 billion. The very
next year, sales are projected at RM3.3 billion, or a walloping 50 per
cent jump. Currently, picture tubes make up 50 per cent of sales while
monitors contribute another 30-35 per cent.
  Such massive growth is due to Samsung Malaysia's expansion programme at
the Seremban Complex. Says Kim, `We are now in the final stage of the
expansion programme, so we will have more capacity next year. This year,
we produced seven million picture tubes. Next year, it will be 11
million.' Likewise, Samsung Malaysia is increasing the production of its
14-inch and 15-inch monitors. Currently, it produces 20 million electron
guns, of which 99 per cent are exported.
  A substantial percentage of Samsung Malaysia's output ends up in other
companies' products. For example, a Samsung Malaysia electron gun might be
incorporated in rival brands' TV sets.
  Says Kim, `We have around 20 per cent of the picture tube market. In
most TVs, one out of five picture tubes are supplied by Samsung. Many
Japanese companies in Malaysia and Singapore are using our picture tubes.'
The story is similar in the personal computer industry where PC makers are
likely to use Samsung monitors.
  Says Kim, `Our main clients for monitors are American buyers. Legally we
cannot reveal who is buying our products but they're private brands. The
top PC makers are using Samsung monitors; all the top, from number one to
number 10. Almost all PC makers take our monitors and we have more than 25
per cent of the market share.'
  Since monitors make up a huge chunk of Samsung Malaysia's sales, will
the American inventory overhang in personal computers and the projected
slowdown in the American demand for PCs affect the 1997 sales projection
of RM3.3 billion? No, says Kim, adding, `There won't be much impact.
Samsung monitors are rated the highest in the world. Quality-wise, cost-
wise, we are very competitive, and we have a very good location.'
  The `location' is the Seremban Complex, which encompasses 52 hectares on
the outskirts of Seremban, in the burgeoning township of Taman Tuanku
Jaafar. Says Kim, `So far, Samsung Malaysia has invested almost RM2
billion in this complex.
  But Samsung's investment won't halt here. More money will be pumped into
the Seremban Complex in future, says Kim. For instance, an internal
broadcasting system is being set up at the complex. `This is the first of
its kind in Malaysia and the first system to be implemented in Samsung
outside of Korea,' says Kim.
  Costing US$ 2 million (RM5 million), the broadcasting system will serve
as an inhouse communications tool as well as an avenue for entertainment.
Broadcasts will cover company policies, education and training, safety
procedures, production status reports, notices and documentary programmes
like National Geographic. About 175 TV monitors will be set up around the
Seremban Complex. Again, there's a localisation factor. Says Kim, `The
broadcasting system will be run by local Samsung employees currently
undergoing training in Korea.'SAMSUNG COMPANIES IN MALAYSIA: ESTIMATED TURNOVER (1996)

The uptrend remains intact: The Composite Index gets a boost from Tenaga

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 73

THE KUALA LUMPUR Stock Exchange's Composite Index peaked at 1,180.79
points on Budget day on Oct 25. There was nothing negative about the
Budget except that there was no reduction in corporate tax. The longer
term impact is positive as it liberalises the market by widening the scope
of financial services that stockbroking firms can offer. So the sell-off
after the Budget was due to the usual market phenomenon of `sell on fact'
as profit taking quickly moved in, causing the KLSE CI to drift to a low
1,156.92.
  But the KLSE CI refused to dip any lower than 1,156.92. Suddenly it
rebounded vibrantly upwards, retesting the 1,180 resistance. It was Tenaga
Nasional Bhd that came to the rescue. There was a re-rating on Tenaga. Its
share price took a sharp upturn from a low RM8.55 to close at RM11 on Nov
6. As Tenaga constitutes some nine per cent of the market, the KLSE CI
could be said to have been driven by the counter.
  It appears that the near term performance of the Malaysian stockmarket
is not affected by the US presidential election on Nov 5. There were some
market talks that our market might drift downwards after the US election.
As at Nov 6 the KLSE CI just ignored the US election as it continued to
nudge higher, retesting 1,180. The underlying strength of the KLSE CI is
due to Tenaga. Technically, Tenaga could go as high as RM11.70. Roughly, a
10 sen move in Tenaga translates to one index point on the KLSE CI. Tenaga
at RM11 will contribute another seven index points if the upside target of
RM11.70 materialises.
  Technically, the longer term uptrend remains intact as long as the
support at 1,158 is not breached. But the near-term outlook points to a
possible technical pullback to around the 1,160 area before resuming its
upward push to 1,194. The KLSE CI should maintain its current uptrend for
the rest of 1996. The first quarter of 1997 may be technically negative
for the market.
  On the weekly equivolume chart the CI is exhibiting signs of profit
taking. The equivolume chart combines volume with price to create an
equivolume box. The height of the box is the price range and the width,
the volume. The theory holds that the price  range should expand as volume
increases, whilst failure to expand on high volume is a sign of profit
taking.
  A squarish box appeared on the Budget week high of 1,180.79. One would
expect the price range to expand as the market drifted higher. Instead the
price range narrowed, suggesting some selling pressure. The following
week, the market drifted lower to 1,156.92 but closed at a high. The price
range was longer suggesting that buyers were willing to chase the market
upwards or, simply stated, the market was facilitating trades with the
buyers. This longer price range from the low of 1,156.92 also suggests
strong buying support, and technically the support at 1,158 makes some
sense as it is within this area.
  In summary the CI is expected to be riding on the current uptrend
towards the end of 1996 as long as the 1,158 support remains intact. If it
breaks the 1,194 resistance, then the next target will be 1,213. An upkick
above 1,213 will move the market to 1,248.

Landbank edge: With a landbank worth RM1 billion, Johor Land Bhd will be
busy in south

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 29

NEXT TIME a new township sprouts up in south Johor, chances are that Johor
Land Berhad (JLB) has had a hand in building it. Besides developing low-
and medium-cost housing (RM80,000 to RM100,000 range) in south Johor's
satellite towns such as Tampoi, Tebrau, Larkin and Senai, the property
development arm of Johor Corporation (JCorp) is snapping up more land
outside Johor Baru and building fast.
  The nation-wide demand for houses will certainly keep JLB busy for a
long time. Says JLB managing director A F M (Abul Fareed Mohd) Shafiqul
Hafiz, `Malaysia has not met 50 to 60 per cent of its housing needs,
compared to almost 95 per cent in Singapore. There is a huge gap. Even in
bad times, you need to eat, you need a roof to live under'.
  JLB, Shafiqul says, builds and sells houses at what he terms `efficient
price' (lower price achieved through savings in labour and material
costs). Having completed 17,000 residential and commercial units worth
RM629 million, JLB has plans for more. They include bungalows and terrace
houses, properties that are not really cheap but demand for which is
outstripping supply. Shafiqul says `JLB isn't building only luxury homes,
but quality ones.'
  Over the next five years, the JLB Group (comprising three wholly-owned
subsidiaries and an associate company) will build over 7,000 units worth
RM600 million. The units range from commercial property, low/medium cost
flats to terrace houses and bungalows.
  JLB's strength is its almost unlimited access to land in south Johor,
one of the most economically vibrant regions in the country. Being part of
the Singapore-Johor-Riau-Indonesia growth triangle, the region draws a lot
of foreign investments.
  Considering JCorp's large holdings - about 80,000 hectares in south
Johor and Pahang - none of the developers in Johor can match JLB's
landbank. Bandaraya Developments Bhd, United Malayan Land Bhd and Kuok
Brothers Sdn Bhd come close but they are still not in the same league as
JLB.
  With a landbank worth over RM1 billion, excluding the recently acquired
Ulu Tiram land, JLB has plenty to work on. Prime among its recent
acquisitions is Ulu Tiram's 1,323 acres of oil palm land purchased from
Kulim Bhd.
  Despite such massive building activity in south Johor, analysts see
little possibility of a glut. Though rental rates and condominium prices
are on the downside, Johor Baru's real estate agents say that landed
property, particularly those stretching from Senai airport to the Pasir
Gudang industrial area commands a strong market. For example, a one-acre
bungalow in Advanced Development Sdn Bhd's Green Plains project in Ulu
Tiram which was selling at about RM400,000 each is now worth RM1 million,
says a broker.
  According to an analyst based in Kuala Lumpur, prices are picking up in
Johor Baru. `The recent credit restriction in Singapore which put a
squeeze on property speculation in the island may have attributed to some
of that. And there is improved accessibility - even before the second link
(in Gelang Patah) is completed they are proposing a third link at Pasir
Gudang,' he says.
  JLB has also planned several residential projects in Muar, Batu Pahat
and Malacca. Its target are new home owners, those upgrading their homes
(for example, from single-storey terrace to double-storey or bungalow) and
investors.
  Singaporean investors are keen to buy property in Malaysia despite the
RM100,000 levy for foreigners. According to news reports, a terrace house
costs as much as S$1.7 million (RM3.1 million) in Singapore, about 10
times more expensive than a terrace house in Petaling Jaya's Bandar Utama.
In addition, the recent capital gains revision in Singapore in May makes
Johor's property market much more attractive.
  Local demand for land is not lacking either as Johor is Malaysia's
fastest growing area outside the Klang Valley and Penang. The analyst
predicts more local demand because the income level in Johor is four to
five times higher than the national average. Johor Baru's population is
also forecast to grow from the present 500,000 to 700,000 by the year
2010. Johor's neighbour Malacca is also in need of more houses.
  JLB will get a further boost with its proposed listing on the main board
of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange by the end of this year. Proceeds will
be used to finance the purchase of property developer Advanced Development
Sdn Bhd from JCorp member Kulim Bhd, thus bringing the property companies
under one roof. Plantation-based Kulim Bhd owns 6,000 acres in Ulu Tiram
and now holds a 68 per cent stake in JLB. After the proposed listing,
Kulim Bhd's stake in JLB will be reduced to 51 per cent.
  Shafiqul sees scope for improvement in the property sector. He says,
`The local industry is nowhere near those you see overseas. I would like
to see more labour saved, for one.'
  In its efforts to reduce labour cost, JLB uses pre-cast concrete
supplied by its plants in Tampoi and Pasir Gudang. It also uses pre-cast
wall panelling in its buildings instead of bricks. The lighter concrete
blocks require only one worker to handle them instead of several men
needed in the conventional method.
  JLB's wholly-owned subsidiary Johor Land Manufacturing Sdn Bhd makes
about 30,000 pieces of metal door frames a year. Compared with
conventional wooden ones, metal door frames are handier and cheaper by
about 20 to 25 per cent. `They save costs and conserve timber,' says
Shafiqul.
  Another subsidiary, Pembinaan Prefabricated Sdn Bhd (PPSB), makes clay
tiles which are more durable than concrete tiles and are developers'
preferred roofing material.
  All these are a far cry from the early 70s when JCorp built wooden
quarters for army personnel in Johor Baru. The wooden houses are still in
pretty good shape today. The secret of the company's success? Shafiqul
says, `We have more buffer compared to other developers.' That buffer may
well see Johor Land beyond another 20 years.

In the corporate lane: Datuk Lee Kim Sai says he now lives a healthier and
more peaceful

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 34

SHOULD ANYONE marvel at the ease with which former Health Minister Datuk
Lee Kim Sai made the transition from politics to that of corporate
citizen, just turn the clock back to pre-independence Malaya of the 1950s.
  It's still early dawn and Kuala Lumpur's main market (now an upmarket
bazaar called Central Market) is a hive of activity. Amongst brazen
butchers and fiesty fishmongers trading  curses, a bleary-eyed 10-year-old
schoolboy carefully picks up the day's fresh produce for the family's
wholesale business. That done, he heads for the yeow char koey (deep fried
crullers - a popular breakfast staple among the Chinese) stand. He takes
on a whole basketfull which he will sell off to foodstall operators all
over Jinjang - the neighbourhood where he grew up - but this time for
personal profit.
  This pre-pubescent dabbling in business, while taking much effort and
energy, did not interfere with the boy's education. The young Lee
performed well at school and contributed towards the family finances with
his earnings. A teaching career in adulthood, followed by 30 years
dedicated to politics resulted in the business world being put on the
backburner. So when he decided not to defend his position as MCA deputy
president (a post he held since 1985) in the party's 1996 elections and
therefore gave up the cut and thrust of political life, where would he
head for next but business?
  Lee did not leave things to providence when he said goodbye to
politics.`I planned to retire when I did. I am not one to overstay my
welcome,' he says. So within two weeks of leaving politics, Lee began
corporate life when he walked into the chairman's lair of Uniwide
Corporation Sdn Bhd. Easy enough, as the company was set up by his eldest
son, Ronnie. `He had this office done up in time so that the moment I left
politics, I could walk in to my new job,' says Lee.
  Ronnie's Uniwide Corporation has interests in tower cranes and heavy
machinery. Lee also sits on the board of what he jokingly calls two-
ringgit companies. But one which certainly does not come under this
category is KLSE-listed Metro Kajang Holdings Bhd (Metro Kajang). `They
have been good to me' says Lee.
  A source of great satisfaction for Lee was that he became Metro Kajang's
chairman prior to its listing. He is especially pleased that the listing
was carried out successfully. The offer was natural as the company had
extensive property development projects in Kajang in the Hulu Langat
constituency of which he was once its member of parliament. He religiously
follows the stock price movement of this main board counter on the
Beriteks screen of the 18-inch colour television placed strategically in
his office.
  His position as chairman means he now owns equity in the company. On the
morning of the interview, Metro Kajang shares were trading at RM6.40 each.
Within the next 48 hours they rocketed past RM7.00. When asked what his
shares of Metro Kajang was worth now, Lee flashes a brilliant smile and
says, `They have been good to me.'
  Indeed, by giving up politics, Lee's personal fortunes have changed for
the better. He remembers how as minister, he was offered a bungalow lot in
one property development project near the city but he had to turn it down
because he could not afford its then prevailing market price. He says,
`Menteri tak ada duit (a minister has no money). His role is to serve the
rakyat. It's a sacrifice.'
  Does he feel being used at all, that his services are as much needed now
as they were when he was a member of parliament and a minister, with
handsome financial rewards to boot? Lee says his worth to the companies he
is involved in is based on his intimate knowledge of the ways of the
government. `The experience gained in the various ministries is invaluable
in that I know intimately the procedures involved in property development,
for instance. The knowledge, when applied properly, is a potent advantage
in business,' he says.
  What is it about the business world that he likes? `It's the certainty,
the delivery of something tangible and the subsequent quantifiable reward
for a job well done,' Lee says. Not that he did not enjoy his long sojourn
in politics. `If one enters politics wholly for altruistic reasons, then
one must accept all that political rough and tumble, the ups and downs.
For me, I enjoyed my time in politics. The work was hard but I derived a
great deal of satisfaction from being able to do a service to the nation,'
he says.
  There is an air of peace of mind and tranquility about Lee that is
translated into an excellent state of health. Standing at 5ft 9in tall and
weighing in at a healthy 150lbs, Lee cuts a dashing figure in a dark blue
suit and smooth silk tie. The secret of his health? `I am now able to
sleep right. I dream pleasant dreams. It's all so very relaxing,' he says.
Back in those political days, Lee's sleeping habits were dictated by party
meetings. Some dragged on interminably and there was many a night when he
would crawl into bed only in the wee hours of the morning.
  Then there were other people's problems for him to attend to. When he
was MP for Hulu Langat, he would be on edge every time it rained as his
consituency was flood prone. `There was a constant stream of people
knocking on my door with all manner of complaints. As their MP, I was the
obvious conduit. MPs of course should not complain as that is part of our
job specifications,' he says with the obvious clarity of one who is no
longer encumbered with such burden.
  Lee also believes in eating right. He takes heed of the advice of an old
Chinese sage who said one should eat but only up to the point of becoming
almost sated. `I only eat up to 70 per cent of capacity. I have also cut
down on sugar and salt in my diet. As a result, I feel better. I think I
look better too,' he says with an impish grin.
  If there is one thing that can drive Lee to the greatest heights of
passion,  it has to be golf. The merest mention of the `g' word during the
interview was all the cue needed to set the 16-handicapper off. `My
handicap suffered when I was in politics. One could not be seen spending
too much time on the links when there are other important party and
constituency matters to be addressed. As minister, the workload only
increased,' he says.
  Of his own prowess at the game, Lee believes he is improving. His drive
off the tee may not fly as powerfully as it used to but what he lacks for
brute strength is more than made up by accuracy. A golfing colleague
admires Lee's ability to split the fairway consistently, setting himself
up for a relatively easy second shot to reach the green with his trusty
six iron. His short game has improved and two putts into the pin for par
are often a mere formality.
  Being in business allows Lee to spend even more time on the golf course.
He sits on the board of Rawang Lakes Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Asia Pacific
Land Bhd (AP Land), as chairman. This was at the invitation of AP Land
chairman Tan Sri Low Yow Chuan, also an avid golfer. The pair would often
team up in a four-ball round of golf at the drop of a hat. `On the course
we never talk business. We are serious golfers. But back at the 19th, we
relax, gossip, talk shop and discuss aspects of our work.'
  Lim, above all, is an educationist at heart. With a Chinese education,
he felt he would be handicapped in politics without a facility for English
and Bahasa Malaysia. So he took on extra classes to equip himself in these
two languages. He was highly regarded in the Chinese community for this
fluency in what was then regarded as `foreign' tongues. A former pupil, Dr
Law Heng Neng, now the general manager of Nanyang Siang Pau, remembers an
incident at school.
  `Our female Bahasa Malaysia teacher was having a tough time trying to
explain a particularly abstract concept to our class one day. She tried to
explain what mesyuwarah (consensus) meant to us 15-year-olds without much
success.
  `Nearing the end of her tether, she marched out of the class and headed
for the staffroom. She returned with Lee in tow. Without much effort, Lee
came up with a one-word translation in Mandarin and everyone broke into an
applause,' he says. To this day, Lee firmly believes in the power of
education as a tool for anyone to rise above their station.
  Lee has indeed had an illustrious political career. In government he has
held three Cabinet posts. He became labour minister in 1986, housing and
local government minster three years later and health minister in 1990.
  He has never lost in  general elections stretching back to the first
time he contested the Rawang state seat in 1974. In 1993, Lee made the
announcement that he would not defend his Hulu Langat parliamentary seat
in the 1995 elections. His political fate was earlier sealed when he led
the group which mounted a challenge against Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik
for the party presidency in 1990. Lee pulled out at the 11th hour but
continued to be at loggerheads with Ling.
  Lee's place in the annals of MCA politics is assured. That even those
who once crossed swords with him refuse to condemn him in public at least
is a measure of how much Lee's contribution towards building the party
means to them and the community at large. He may have made the inevitable
enemy or two throughout his political career and the grudge they harbour
may well remain festering.
  `But I don't let that worry me. I can look back at my career with a
clear conscience. I am happy,' says Lee with sanguine finality.
 

Pix: Lee: I can look back at my career with a clear conscience.

Pix: Lee: I planned to retire when I did. I am not one to overstay my
welcome.

A marriage of convenience: A rattan furniture company successfully marries
form and function to giv

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 33

POH MAY Holdings Bhd first exported rattan furniture in the midst of a
recession. `Collection and sales were poor. I hadn't reached a critical
stage yet but I was looking for markets,' recalls managing director
Geoffrey Lee. `But exports was a different game. We knocked on doors, went
from embassy to embassy, taking product shots and filling out formal
applications for our products. It was very hard.'
  As it turned out, the pay-offs were handsome. Today, 80 per cent of the
Penang-based group's furniture are exported to England, Ireland, the
United States and Europe. In these markets, rattan is upmarket, trendy and
very popular. Nearly 60 per cent of Poh May's furniture is rattan-based.
  While small in comparison with the likes of Federal Furniture, Land and
General and other listed timber-based furniture makers, business for Poh
May has snowballed in recent times. From five workers during the mid-80s,
Poh May's six subsidiary companies today employ a total of 800 in two main
factories and six showrooms.
  The two factories are at Parit Buntar, Perak and Klang. More showrooms
are in the pipeline. Lee says, `We emphasize innovation and design rather
than the traditional furniture. It's more interesting.'
  To expand and compete internationally, Poh May is seeking a listing on
the second board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). Poh May's
listing involves a new issue of 4.51 million shares at RM2.90 each. Of
this, 3.27 million shares will be for the Malaysian public. The remaining
1.24 million shares will be reserved for subscription by approved
Bumiputera investors. Says Lee,`If everything goes well, we should list by
early next year.'
  Poh May forecasts a group pre-tax profit of RM7.48 million for its
FY1996 on a group turnover of RM58 million. For FY1997 it forecasts a
profit and turnover of RM13.47 million and RM84.9 million, respectively.
(Refer to Table 1.)
  Poh May is the first local furniture company to apply wood-bending, a
technique by which straight pieces of hardwood are curved in a mechanised
steamer process. The result - elegant and aesthetically pleasing pieces of
furniture. In fact, the Bendwood furniture is the only one of its kind in
Malaysia, although some makers in Taiwan and Europe have the know-how.
  Says Lee,`You can bend cane and metal, but you can't bend wood, least of
all hardwood. But we came out with the technology and the skills. No one
in Southeast Asia has been able to copy that yet,' he smiles.
  The company is adept at combining rattan with wrought iron and metal in
producing new furniture products. Any combination is possible, so long as
the end-product looks good enough. He says, `One new range of furniture is
launched every year to keep up with market demand.'
  Lee, a winner of entrepreneurial awards here and abroad, keeps a close
eye on local talent. Among Poh May's newer products to use indigenous
technology is the Igloo, a refrigeration unit which uses a locally
patented microchip cooling system instead of a generator or compressor,
thus saving energy and reducing noise level. This is incorporated into
furniture for use in the office or bedside. (Refer Table 2 for Poh May
subsidiaries and their main activities.)
  `For a feel of the market, we travel all over to see what other parts of
the world have to offer. We go to Europe and to the United States where
the biggest furniture market is. There we learn something, come back and
try it out. But we don't copy. We get an idea and develop it further,'
says Lee.
  The search for cheaper materials is also important. Poh May plans to set
up a timber-based factory in Cao Danang, an economic processing zone in
southern Vietnam, to take advantage of cheap timber and wood sources.
  The overall demand for rattan and wood furniture remains buoyant.
Malaysia's exports of rattan and wood furniture are expected to increase
to RM3 billion by the year 2000. It is expected to rise to RM2 billion by
next year.
  Lee explains, `Everyone knows the housing industry is booming, people's
incomes are rising... the furniture market is still good. It's a case of
how good you are. I emphasize design and innovation, so rather than talk
about a chair, we talk about a piece of furniture.'
  Lee explains his early move into furniture. `When I was in Form 3, my
father retired from trucking and ventured into cane furniture in a very
small way. He set up a joint venture, a small shop to do cane furniture.
We were poor so I helped out after school. After finishing Form 5, I
studied  one more year in Penang at a private institute for my higher
accounting. Then I worked for a year as an accounts clerk. I was about 21
when I went into this business.
  `At that time I called it Lee Trading. We started in a small way with
little capital. I did very basic cane furniture to supply the Penang
market. Slowly we grew. Our furniture was sent down to Kuala Lumpur and
the East Coast.'
  Then came tough times during the 1985-1986 recession. Lee decided to
look outside Malaysia. It made sense as Lee felt that the local market was
not big enough for his company to expand and enjoy economies of scale in
production.
  But this does not mean he will concentrate on exports alone. `I would
say that the local market has very good potential for growth. I am very
optimistic about the local furniture market. Of course, I cannot deny that
our costs in Malaysia have increased compared to a couple of years back,
but in Europe they are having bigger problems. The margins for us here are
higher.'

A milestone for reinsurer: MNRB plans to go into underwriting risks for
aircraft and satellites

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 14

AS THE COUNTRY'S sole reinsurer, Malaysian National Reinsurance Bhd (MNRB)
enjoys a certain degree of monopoly.
  But unlike other monopolies such as Tenaga Nasional Bhd or Telekom
Malaysia, MNRB has had to strive hard to carve this monopoly into a
meaningful revenue earner. This is because basically, the profits of
reinsurance companies depend on the performance of the insurance companies
ceding part of their premiums to the former. In MNRB's case, its
bottomline is therefore affected by the fate of local insurance companies.
  Until 1984, the local insurance industry was far from orderly and
considered a demerit market by foreign reinsurance companies. `Many
insurance companies indulged in unhealthy competition with each other for
business. There was no control ... of course we had the insurance laws and
a lot of people just looked at the law and got away or tried to get away
with it. As a result, the Malaysian market was severely affected by
underwritng losses and uncontrollable cost,' says MNRB's managing director
Anuar Mohd Hassan.
  Following the disorder that reigned in the industry, market players
through the General Insurance Association of Malaysia (GIAM) came out with
a series of inter-company agreements. MNRB, which was closely linked to
GIAM, also played a key role in ensuring the agreement was adhered to for
the viability of the industry.
  Says Anuar, `With all the efforts by parties concerned, including
insurance companies themselves who wanted to be regulated, the market
improved. Malaysia was no longer considered a demerit market but instead
one where many reinsurers worldwide wanted to be involved with. The
companies started producing underwriting profits and this had a direct
impact on profits of MNRB.'
  In a way therefore, the listing of MNRB on the main board of the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) heralds another step in the long road to
recovery of the Malaysian insurance industry. Incorporated in 1972, MNRB
is offering 19.06 million shares to the public at RM4.30 per share. After
listing, its share capital will increase to RM189.7 million. Thanks to
Malaysia not being subjected to catastrophic perils, the company has
chalked up handsome pre-tax profits the past few years. (See table)
  For the financial year ended March 31, 1996, MNRB recorded a pre-tax
profit of RM61.52 million while the forecast for 1997 is RM77.92 million.
The net tangible asset backing per share is RM1.69 while the earnings per
share based on its forecast net profit of RM54.5 million for 1997 is 29
sen. Given the initial public offer price of RM4.30 per share, MNRB shares
are being offered at a prospective price earnings multiple of 14.8 times
FY97 earnings. Given the average sectoral price earnings multiple of 24
times, MNRB's shares should trade at around RM7.
  MNRB's revenue comprises premium income and investment income. For the
past five years, premiums contributed about 90 per cent of income with the
remaining 10 per cent coming from investment income. Over 80 per cent of
the premium income of MNRB is derived from the voluntary cessions of the
entire Malaysian general insurance market while the balance comes from
facultative and treaty reinsurance.
  The voluntary cessions, structured and implemented on Jan 1, 1973, is a
form of proportional treaty reinsurance between MNRB and local insurance
companies. The agreement entered with local insurance companies require a
share of their business to be ceded to MNRB. In return, MNRB covers
damages in proportion to the premium ceded. Part of the voluntary cessions
is retroceded to the ceding companies with the objective of helping
prevent premium outflow and to help local insurance companies build up
premium volume from a well spread portfolio of risks.
  The amount of business ceded to MNRB ranges from 10 per cent to 15 per
cent. The voluntary cessions agreement provides MNRB with a steady stream
of income, causing several analysts to be optimistic of the steady
earnings the company will get in the future.
  However, an analyst ponders on what is to become of the voluntary
cessions agreement with the liberalisation of world trade and services
through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and World Trade
Organisation (WTO) in the next few years.
  To this, MNRB senior general manager Mustaffa Ahmad explains that he
does not expect MNRB or the agreements with the local insurance companies
to be a subject of contention under GATT and WTO. `As long as it is not a
compulsory arrangement, there should not be any questions. The agreement
was agreed by all parties,' he says.
  Anuar explains that the voluntary cessions agreement was last reviewed
last year and the percentage ceded was supposed to be further reduced in
January this year. `However, with the declining trend of the national
retention ratio, the board of MNRB together with the industry agreed that
there should be no change in the level of voluntary cessions for this
year, he says.
  According to the 1994 Director-General of Insurance Report, the national
retention ratio was 72.3 per cent while the government wants to see the
retention ratio move up to 85 per cent. Anuar says no date has been fixed
for the next review of the voluntary cessions agreement.
  `There is no specific date for the agreement. It has to be agreed upon
by all parties which are the industry, MNRB and Bank Negara. I do not
expect it to be done every year,' he says.
  Another concern among analysts is the rather flat net profits showed by
the company since 1995. This, according to a company official, is because
MNRB has been very prudent in forecasting its claims ratio. `In addition,
the more risk we write, the more we have to set aside as unexpired premium
reserve,' he says.
  With a guaranteed stream of steady income, what is the future of MNRB
with more foreign reinsurance companies given the nod to set up operations
here? At present there are seven other reinsurance companies in Malaysia.
Six of them are incorporated outside Malaysia. The other is the Malaysian
Re International Insurance (MIIL) which is incorporated in Labuan. MNRB
has a 20 per cent equity interest in MIIL. Anuar says MNRB is looking at
writing more offshore business with foreign companies. `We not happy to
sit here and wait for offers to come here through intermediaries,'
stresses Anuar. `We want to be involved in Asean countries where many
reinsurers are interested due to the phenomenal economic boom. We are also
looking at North Africa and the Middle-East countries.
  `There is a great desire from some countries in that region to have
business dealings in Malaysia, not only because our country is on the
world map but because they have heard of MNRB's reputation of assisting
and improving local insurance companies. It is also due to the financial
strength of MNRB and its desire to work with another Muslim company.
Besides that, we are also looking at India,' he says.
  On the local front, Anuar says MNRB will take over the management of the
aviation pool which will have the capacity to underwrite a certain portion
of risks involving aircraft. `We cannot underwrite 100 per cent of MAS
planes but the pool will at least be able to underwrite the smaller
aircraft. A substantial amount of premiums involving such large risks is
going out of the country at the moment,' he says.
  From planes, MNRB plans to move into underwriting risks for satellites.
Anuar says MNRB is discussing with an experienced foreign reinsurance firm
on the matter.

Pricier than the norm: But given its profitability, analysts think that's
a fair IPO price for

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 12

EVERMASTER GROUP Bhd's flotation exercise has drawn keen interest amongst
market players. Reason: the shares are being offered at RM7, the second
highest ever for a second board listing after Penas Corporation Bhd.
  Clearly, the company has taken the cue from the Securities Commission
(SC) urging companies to move from a merit-based environment to one of
full disclosure. This means it is the company and not the authorities who
determine the initial public offer (IPO) price.
  Comments an analyst,`Beginning 1996, the SC left it up to the merchant
bankers to decide on the IPO of a company. In this case, Commerce
International Merchant Bankers Bhd has set the scale based on the market
sentiments. At present, second board sentiments are generally positive so
the pricing of Evermaster shares probably reflects this scenario.
Sometimes, we see shares hitting a opening price of more than RM7 upon
listing.'
  Is the RM7 justified?
  According to estimates, Evermaster's net earnings per share (EPS) pre-
listing is 76.3 sen which will rise to a post-listing 80.2 sen FY1996
earnings. The forecast figures for 1997 include a RM102 million turnover
and a RM14.5 million pre-tax profit.
  Based on the 1996 post-listing EPS, the shares are being offered at a
historical price earnings (PE) multiple of 8.8 times. This is around the
average net PE most IPOs are priced at.
  Managing director Tsai Ching Chi maintains the RM7 is based on the
company's historical and forecast earnings. Is it expected to fetch a huge
premium on opening day like other second board counters? `We do not know
what the premium will be, but we hope it will be similar to others in the
industry,' he says.
  Says one analyst, `It would  seem that given the company's
profitability, the RM7 IPO price is not high at all. In fact, the
shareholders could have opted for a higher paid-up capital of say RM30
million, instead of its RM20 million, which would have given a lower EPS
and thus lower IPO price. After all, you can still go for a listing on the
second board on a paid-up capital of up to RM40 million.'
  Tsai says the prospectus will be issued by mid- November and the listing
is scheduled by the end of the year. Pursuant to the listing, the main
shareholders of Sabah-based Evermaster are making an offer for sale of
five million shares at RM7 each. Of these, two million are for bumiputera
investors, 851,000 shares for Evermaster eligible employees and the
remaining 2.149 million for the public.
  Although Evermaster is in the timber business, it does not own any
timber concessions. But the company maintains this is not a reason for
concern. Its log supplies are sourced under various agreements with
concessionaires and direct purchases from suppliers in the open market. It
even has long term supply agreements with third parties with concession
periods ranging from eight to 10 years.
  Evermaster was set up in 1986 as a company trading primarily in timber
logs by three founder members - managing director Tsai and executive
directors Lim Piak How and Yek Lik Hua. Following the listing, Tsai, Lim
and Yek will each hold a 15.3 per cent stake while chairman Hamzah
Zainudin will own 20 per cent.
  Prior to 1986, Tsai, who is a Taiwanese with permanant residence status
in Sabah, was involved in timber and forestry for more than 30 years. In
the course of work, he met up with his current partners, both Sabahans.
Lim was a surveyor with vast experience in timber extraction, while Yek's
forte is in marketing and shipping timber. `Each of us has vast experience
in specialised areas and it was only logical that we teamed up and used
our expertise in our own operations,' says Tsai.
  Evermaster Wood Products Sdn Bhd was established two years later in 1988
to take advantage of the government's incentives. Evermaster Wood produces
sawn timber and veneer as value added products and has 780 employees.
  Through its two subsidiaries, Evermaster Wood and Evermaster Sdn Bhd
(trading in timber logs), Evermaster derives 95 per cent of its turnover
from overseas markets, mainly Japan, South Korea and China. Major
customers for plywood include the China National Trading Corporation Ltd,
Momura Trading Co Ltd, Mitsubishi Corporation Co Ltd and Northeast
Materials Ltd. Sawn timber is exported to Nisho Iwai International (S)
Ltd, Takahide Corporation and Anrobis Trading Pte Ltd.
  The remaining five per cent of the group's turnover comes from supplying
its products in Sabah itself. Evermaster products are marketed under the
brand label `Green Frog'. Why this name? Tsai explains, `Most of our
products are exported to the Asia-Pacific region, particularly to China
and Taiwan where people prefer the names of animals as brand names.
  `Although Evermaster deals with timber we want people to know that we
are not destroying the environment. So we came up with the Green Frog,
which signifies life and preservation,' he smiles.
  The Evermaster Group operates from its timber complex covering 53 acres
in Keningau, Sabah. The facility has four production lines each for veneer
and plywood, operating on two 10-hour shifts a day. There is one
production line for sawn timber operating on one shift of 10 hours a day.
  According to Tsai, the total investment in fixed assets for the two
subsidiaries to date stands at RM50 million. The total production capacity
for plywood is 78,000 cubic metres per year and 18,000 cubic metres per
year for sawn timber.
  Tsai is emphatic that the demand for timber products will continue to
grow, particularly in Asia-Pacific countries with high growth rates. `The
dominant players in the Asia-Pacific region are China and Japan. If these
economies continue to grow, we believe Evermaster's prospects will be very
good,' he says.
  Evermaster is pegged as one of the top 10 exporters in terms of export
earnings from Sabah, Tsai claims. He does say, however, that no
comparative studies have been conducted.
  What plans does Evermaster have? `We plan to expand into downstream
activities such as finger-jointed wood, laminated boards, profiles and
blackboards as well as kiln drying,' says Tsai. The group is set to invest
RM16 million to construct a new plant adjacent to its existing plant in
Keningau to manufacture new downstream products. Work on the new factory
will begin in January next year.
  Other areas being considered for expansion include manufacturing of
furniture to add value to existing products. Evermaster will also venture
into other markets in Europe and United States.
  The group has been registering a steady increase in turnover and profits
over the last five years (see table).

The profits of peace: Malaysian investors get a head start in southern
Philippines

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 71

THE PHILIPPINE economy is heading for better times. Exports have grown,
domestic consumption is rising and inflation is down to nine per cent. An
added bonus is the signing of the peace treaty on Sept 2 that ended 24
years of war in southern Philippines.
  Though the Philippines is still far from catching up with the economies
of the Asian `dragons', analysts say with political stability and skilled
manpower, the country could outpace its present six to seven per cent
growth in the next few years.
  In keeping with global trend, the Philippines is shifting away from
traditional family-dominated monopolies to a free market system,
emphasising the development of basic infrastructure.
  Last year, private sector investments amounted to 335.3 billion pesos.
Priority is given to build, operate, transfer (BOT) projects.
  The free market shift is also aiding the tourism industry, traditionally
the Philippines' major foreign exchange earner. Intense competition among
four airlines - Air Philippines, Grand Pacific, Cebu Pacific Airlines and
the national flag carrier Philippines Airlines - is bringing down air
fares.
  Services contributed to 43 per cent of the gross domestic product last
year and the government is opening the banking sector to foreign
competition. Under the foreign bank liberalisation law, foreign investors
can buy a controlling stake of up to 60 per cent in a local bank. The
Central Bank's previous ceiling on foreign ownership was 40 per cent.
  A recent report by the Central Bank governor shows that foreign banks'
share of the total resources of the Philippine commercial banking system
increased from 6.95 per cent last year to 8.17 per cent as of March 1996.
With the Central Bank issuing new licences, there are now 42 banks
compared to 24 in 1991.
  Malaysian corporations are among those to take advantage of the
investment opportunities in the Philippines. Four Malaysian joint ventures
are involved in the BOT projects planned for 1996-2000. Renong Bhd is
developing the Manila Cavite Expressway worth 6.5 billion pesos (RM650
million); Philippine Malaysia Water Consortium is undertaking the South
Metro Manila Water Supply project worth 312 million pesos; Malaysian
Philippines Utilities Sdn Bhd is building the Balara Water Treatment
Plant; and Johan Holdings Bhd is involved in a BOT project valued at 4.16
billion pesos.
  According to the Board of Investments, Malaysian-led projects rank
fourth among all BOI-approved investments in the Philippines. Regionally,
they form the biggest investor group. Last year the BOI-regulated
investments from Malaysia was 1.59 billion pesos. The Malaysian companies
went into manufacturing, construction, property development and the
services sectors in the early 90s and are now expanding, mostly into
resource-rich but underdeveloped Mindanao island in southern Philippines.
  Even before the peace pact between the Philippine government and the
Moro National Liberation Front last September, Malaysian, Indonesian and
Hong Kong investors have ventured to Mindanao. They invested in the
banking, telecommunications, steel, tourism, liquified petroleum gas
(LPG), water supply, property, palm oil/rubber, coconut processing,
banking and property sectors.
  Most of these companies gained a foothold in the Philippines during the
1992-1993 period when President Fidel Ramos' government sped up market
reforms initiated by his predecessor Corazon Aquino. The early birds
include Westmont Group's Westmont Bank, Berjaya Group, Hong Leong Group,
Waterfront International, Kuok Group, Johan Holdings, Petronas, Hume
Industries, Rashid Hussein Bhd, TA Securities Bhd, Auto Industries Sdn Bhd
and the Lion Group.
  Proton recently completed a plant in Pengasinan in Luzon which will
start producing cars after the Apec (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation)
meeting in Subic this month. Metroplex Bhd and Genting Bhd are developing
hotels and a casino in Subic. Westmont Bank, reputed to be among the top
10 commercial banks, is the result of a takeover and rescue bid by
Westmont group in 1994. Arab-Malaysian Banking Corp, Bank Bumiputra,
Malayan Banking and Bank Islam are among the latest investors in Mindanao.
  Undoubtedly, the inflow of foreign investments is fuelling the
Philippines' economic recovery. But the real challenge now is to ensure
that the benefits of the recovery trickle down to ordinary Filipinos. An
Asian diplomat based in Manila says, `Normally with economic growth there
is decline in unemployment, but you don't see that so clearly. The
implication is that economic recovery is benefiting only certain sectors.'
  The jobless rate is nine per cent and between 30 and 35 per cent of
Filipinos are underemployed, notes the diplomat. (The underemployed are
those holding part-time jobs). In addition an estimated four million
Filipinos are working overseas, 90 per cent of whom are classified as
`vulnerable'. The vulnerable groups include domestic servants and
unskilled workers who are the hardest to monitor and encounter the most
problems. In recent years, the robust economy has helped to reduce
unemployment but more needs to be done.
  Says Philippines' ambassdor to Malaysia Jose S Brilliantes, `Even if
they are not coming home in droves, there is a perceptible improvement
now'. Undersecretary of the Board of Investment Melito Sison Salazar Jr
notes, `In general job migration is an outward rather than an inward flow.
Though employment opportunities have improved somewhat, this is offset by
the rising cost of living that still drives many Filipinos to seek better
paying jobs overseas.'
  The immigration laws have been tightened and the government is now
sponsoring re-orientation programmes and investment schemes to assist
workers returning to the Philippines.
  As capital-hungry Filipino businesses look to tie up with foreign
partners, there is great potential for technology transfer and the
development of human resources. Wages have increased but they are still
lower than other countries in the region. Wages in the manufacturing
sector increase by about 9.5 per cent annually. However, income at the top
is among the most respectable. A study by Hong Kong's Political and
Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd shows that the salaries of professionals in
managerial and production positions in the Philippines are among the top
in the region.
  Brilliantes says labour is no longer cheap in the Philippines. `One of
the comparative advantages in investing in the Philippines is not in low
wages but in its human resources, the availability of a large pool of
highly trainable, skilled, English-speaking manpower,' he says.

The perks of the trade: Samsung workers enjoy living standards better than
most

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 23

LIKE their brethren across the nation, Seremban factory workers have been
infected by the malady of quitting their employers for higher-paying
offers elsewhere.
  Lately, a number of engineers and technicians from certain Seremban-
based plants have been lured to Samsung Seremban, drawn by higher pay and
better perks. Although the brain-drain has not reached a critical level
yet, the outflow of talent from a particular electronics company has its
management so worried, that a top executive requested Samsung Malaysia
president and managing director Kim Jin Ki not to pay such high salaries.
  Does Samsung pay the most among Seremban industrial facilities? `We are
among the highest,' says Kim. `But whether we are the highest I do not
know.'
  `They pay the best rates. Not that much more, about four to five hundred
more per month,' affirms a senior engineer with the rival electronics
manufacturer. `But they also work you the hardest.'
  At the Samsung Electronics Seremban Complex, 12-hour shifts are the
norm. Where executive engineers are concerned, overtime can only be
claimed after working 20 hours. And, adds the senior engineer, `They like
you to take overtime.'
  However, the long hours are cushioned by a cornucopia of employee
benefits. Workers are entitled to 26 free meals a month, and can choose
from five to seven different menus at the company cafeterias. Reflecting
Samsung's heritage, Korean food - albeit tailored to Malaysian tastebuds -
is available. Judging by the long line at the counter, the Korean dishes
go down well with Samsung workers.
  Free meals are complemented by lodging - gratis also - at the company's
custom-built dormitories. Costing RM17.5 million, the dormitories consist
of four blocks, with another two to be completed in May 1997. Also on the
cards are a swimming pool, gymnasium (offering free recreational classes)
and football field.
  Says K K Lee, self-styled resort director at Samsung Dormitory, `As far
as I know, this is the first (dormitory) of its kind. A test case where
residences are within the industrial area.'
  The concept seems to have found favour with Samsung employees.
Currently, the occupancy rate is 90 per cent, which works out to some
2,000 residents, including 500 Indonesians. Expectedly, males and females
are segregated in their own blocks. Each block has 96 rooms, with four
occupants per room. Facilities are basic, with each room featuring spartan
double-decker bunk beds and wardrobes. Just like a college dormitory,
there are common areas - TV rooms, reading rooms, prayer rooms and laundry
rooms - as well as communal shower areas. The pantry features moulded
plastic seats and tables, just like in fast-food restaurants.
  Thanks to his military background, K K Lee runs the place `barracks-
style', assisted by his wardens. There are strict rules - a curfew of 12
midnight is strictly enforced for employees `who are not out of station'
and smoking is prohibited.
  Despite the regimentation, says K K Lee, `There's a waiting list to get
in.' This is hardly surprising, since staying in the dormitory would
enable a worker to shave his monthly living expenses considerably. Rentals
in Seremban and surrounding areas have been escalating steadily, with a
single-storey terrace house going for RM250 on the average.
  The question is - has Samsung's employee benefits programme actually
boosted its ability to retain staff? Employee turnover is pretty low, says
Kim, about three per cent monthly compared to the national monthly average
of six per cent.  But staff retention comes at a hefty cost. On a micro
level, says Lee, Samsung spends RM100-odd per month on each dormitory
resident. Multiply that figure by 2,000 residents and Samsung's monthly
dormitory bill is a steep RM200,000. But that's not all. Each month, says
Kim, the expense of maintaining the employee benefit programme is `at a
one-to-one ratio' with Samsung's wage bill.

Roads to roam: The Western Australian Education Centre shows you several
ways of gettin

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 64

AUSTRALIA has plenty to offer - excellent weather, a cost of living which
most consider reasonable, is culturally diverse and has an education
system considered among the best Down Under.
  And Perth is the Australian city most students, Malaysians or others,
head for in furtherance of their education. Over 10,000 international
students are currently enrolled in Perth's various educational
institutions, many of whom are from Malaysia.
  A substantial number of them have sought the services of the Western
Australian Education Centre in Kuala Lumpur for assistance in getting
places at the many Perth institutions of higher learning. There are four
universities in the Perth region - Curtin University of Technology, Edith
Cowan University, Murdoch University and the University of Western
Australia.
  All are large government-funded universities which provide a wide range
of degree courses from bachelor to doctorate level. And all are of
international standing and repute, with their degrees enjoying
international recognition.
  Overseas students have the option of pursuing their secondary education
by enrolling in a number of government- or private-sector colleges. They
offer courses from Year 7 to Year 12 (final year). Entry to university is
based on the results of the Tertiary Entrance Examination which are the
Year 12 examinations under the Western Australian Education system.
  But for those who find the method of entry to university rigid, there is
an alternative secondary system provided by Canning College, Tuart
College, Beaufort College, Edwards College and St Marks International
College. These colleges offer the Western Australian Universities
Foundation Programme in association with the four government universities.
This programme has been designed for international students and is an
alternative to Year 12. All universities accept the results of the
Foundation Programme for University entrance.
  In the vocational area there are a number of government and private
colleges which offer courses for international students. The government
provider is Tafe (Technical and Further Education) which is the largest
educational provider in Western Australia with over 100,000 students. Tafe
offers a wide range of courses at vocational and technical level in most
areas of study. Students who complete a Tafe diploma in some of these
areas (notably business and engineering) are eligible for entry to most
Western Australian universities with advanced standing.
  The private providers in the vocational field include Alexander College,
Edwards College, Australian Institute of University Studies (AIUS), Perth
Institute of Business and Technology (PIBT), and Perth Commercial College.
These colleges tend to focus on courses in business, computing, mass
communications, travel and tourism, hospitality studies and secretarial
studies.
  Admission requirements are flexible and some also have a three semester
calender year which means there are three intakes a year for the various
programmes. The system also allows students to complete a programme of
study in a shorter period of time.
  Alexander College, Edwards College, AIUS and PIBT also have arrangements
with the Western Australian universities whereby the former offer courses
equivalent to the first (and in some courses second and third) year of the
degree programmes in business/commerce, computing and mass communications.
  Upon successful completion of these programmes, students are able to
enrol directly into the second year (and where applicable later years) of
the relevant degree programmes of the universities. These courses provide
an excellent alternative for students who are marginally unable to gain
direct entry to the university course of their choice.
  For students and parents keen to learn more about the programmes offered
by the various Perth institutions of higher learning, they can visit the
Western Australian Education Centre in Kuala Lumpur.
  The centre is located at 4th floor, UBN Tower, 10, Jalan P Ramlee, 50250
Kuala Lumpur. They can make an appointment or even seek information from
centre officials by telephone at 03-2321248/9.

Seeking only the best: High calibre multiple partners help IMC maintain
high standards

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 66

WHEN THE International Medical College (IMC) chose the University of
Melbourne Medical School as its 20th partner medical school, it knew it
had made the right decision.
  The reason is simple - the University Of Melbourne Medical School is the
oldest medical school in Australia. It is also widely dubbed as the
Oxbridge of Down Under for its high standard. The Dean of IMC, Professor
John S Beck says, `This is a very good choice and we are immensely proud
to have this university as our partner medical school.'
  The University of Melbourne Medical School only became IMC's partner
medical school last year, three years after it started.
  The reason behind the slight delay in getting an Australian university
as one of its medical partners was because IMC was not familiar with the
standard of Australian universities as well as their curriculum.
  Beck says, `Once we had examined the curriculum and spoken to their
students, we concluded that their standard was high and just as good as
ours. So we went into a partnership with them. The University of Melbourne
has offered six places to students of IMC.'
  The IMC is looking for more Australian partners. `The IMC is also
building ties with other universities in Australia We are very careful in
selecting partner medical schools as we only want the best because here at
IMC, our standards are equally high,' adds Beck.
  Beck says one of the reasons why IMC is looking favourably at
universities Down Under is because Australia has become a natural focus
for sudents in this region. `People here always perceive Australia as
being nearer to home than any other country. Europe and North America are
considered as being too far away.'
  The University of Melbourne Medical School was the first medical school
established in Australia - that was in 1862, 11 years after the university
formally opened.
  The school attracts many of the best students in Australia and overseas.
  Over the last 10 years it has attracted more research funding than any
other medical school in Australia. Its ability to attract a leading share
of Australia's largest pool of government and privately-funded health and
medical research opportunities continues to draw research talent of the
highest calibre.
  The teaching hospital network offers outstanding experience for students
in their clinical years. Associated with the medical school are five major
general teaching hospitals: the Royal Melbourne Hospital, Western
Hospital, St Vincent's Hospital, Geelong Hospital, Austin and Repatriation
Medical Centre.
  Major specialist teaching hospitals are the Royal Children's Hospital,
Royal Women's Hospital, Mercy Hospital for Women, the Royal Victorian Eye
and Ear Hospital, the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, North-West
Hospital and Fairfeild Hospital for Infectious disease.
  Students who join the IMC can complete their MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine
and Bachelor of Surgery) in six years - 2ystem at the college and 3ystem years 
in Melbourne. The tuition fee in Melbourne is A$24,000 per annum.
  The IMC curriculum consists of two parts - Part 1 comprises 2ystem years of
training supervised by the Faculty of the International Medical College in
basic biomedical science and an integrated clinical systems-centred
course.
  The Advanced Diploma in Medical Sciences will be awarded by the college
to students who have successfully completed their programme of study at
the IMC.
  The IMC approach introduces clinical experience from the start of the
curriculum and this helps the student to appreciate the real importance of
the basic science since its application is clearly presented. First year
students will receive clinical exposure at the Seremban General Hospital,
Port Dickson Hospital and various community health clinics in Seremban.
  The college accepts Malaysian and international students who have
completed their Australian Matriculation examinations.
  Todate, the college has some 100 students who have completed various
Australian matriculation programmes such as the South Australian
Matriculation, Victoria Certificate Of Education, the New South Wales
Foundation and Queensland Matriculation. IMC also accepts students with
Monash University Foundation Year qualifications.
  The other 19 partner medical schools of the IMC are University of
Auckland in New Zealand, University College Cork, University College
Dublin, University Galway, the Royal College of Surgeons and Trinity
College in Ireland, University Of Alberta, University Of Calgary,
Daihousie University, McGill University, Memorial University Of
Newfoundland, University Of Western Ontario, and Thomas Jefferson Medical
College In North America, University Of Aberdeen, University Of Dundee,
University Of Glasgow, University Of Liverpool, University Of Newcastle
Upon-Tyne and Queen's University In the United Kingdom.

Stage set for the next century: The 1997 Budget lays a foundation for a
technologically sophisticated

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 40

IN A 90 MINUTE speech at the Dewan Rakyat on Oct 25, Finance Minister
Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim described his Budget as laying the foundation to
establish a `firm bridge' to take Malaysia into the 21st century. What is
in store for 1997?
  Notwithstanding a drop in the electronics industry, the Malaysian
economy is expected to surge ahead at an estimated GDP growth rate of 8.2
per cent for this year. This represents the ninth consecutive year of
robust growth of more than eight per cent per annum for the country.
Consequently, the per capita income has correspondingly increased from
RM10,058 in 1995 to RM11,118 for this year.
  What has confounded sceptics is the fact that the strong economic growth
has been accompanied by low inflation, a proud achievement for the country
indeed. For 1996, for instance, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected
to rise a mere 0.2 per cent to 3.6 per cent from 3.4 per cent last year,
helping to allay fears of an economy overheating.
  Besides stable prices, the other commendable feature of the economic
growth this year is the healthy rise in national savings from 36.5 per
cent in 1995 to 38.8 per cent for 1996. This places the savings rate in
Malaysia higher than Japan and all the other newly industrialising
economies (NIEs), with the exception of Singapore.
  At the same time, the capital market is further boosted by a record
listing of 61 companies from January to September this year, turning the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange into the third largest bourse in the Asia
Pacific region.
  In the manufacturing sector, domestic-oriented industries grew at a
healthy rate of 15.2 per cent for the first seven months this year as
compared to 12.8 per cent over the same period a year ago. Except for the
electronics sector, all other export-oriented industries, especially
textiles, wood and rubber products, posted significant growth.
  In its rush to catch up with the other NIEs, Malaysia has recently been
facing a current account deficit compounded by a persistent and
deteriorating service account. With a breakneck pace of growth in recent
years, the country is also experiencing full employment and capacity
utilisation with a resultant increase in inflationary pressures both in
terms of wages and costs.
  Recognising the need to further strengthen the structure of the economy
as well as address the weaknesses associated with a long period of growth,
the 1997 Budget, with a total expenditure of RM59.98 billion, has been
drawn up to ensure sustained growth in the medium and long term by:
  * Achieving sustainable growth through enhanced productivity;
  * Strengthening the balance of payments position with improvements in
the services sector and higher domestic production; and
  * Strengthening the agenda for social development.
  Presently, more than half (55 per cent) of the growth in output derives
from capital investment making the ratio of investment to GNP a high of
45.1 per cent. While this is laudable, the whole approach to development
would have to undergo a major shift from being capital driven to
productivity driven if Malaysia were to enjoy a higher level of
sustainable growth. The emphasis on productivity growth is clearly
emboldened in the Seventh Malaysia Plan as shown in the table.
  In this regard, appropriate measures have been announced in the Budget
to steer the economy in the right direction. To encourage manufacturing
and agricultural firms to modernise operations, expand capacity and
diversify output, a reinvestment allowance of 100 per cent of statutory
income is granted for productivity boosting investments.
  Underscoring its commitment to upgrade the high level of technology, the
Budget has allocated RM721 million for the Technology Development Plan and
research programmes like the IRPA (Intensification of Research in Priority
Areas). To encourage more research and development work, private
companies, especially the small and medium industries (SMIs), are allowed
to use the IRPA's allocation. Firms are also allowed double deduction for
R&D expenditures. Tax deduction for the acquisition of intangible assets
like patents, designs and trade marks would help the country in scaling up
the technology ladder rapidly.
  Besides enhancing the value chain of the manufacturing process, the new
Industry Inter-Linkage Programme (ILP) also helps to promote cooperation
and transfer of skills and technology from multinational corporations to
local industries. In addition, SMIs participating in the ILP and producing
quality intermediate goods, are given tax exemption for up to 10 years.
  The Budget also has generous incentives to help promote a strategic
shift to knowledge-based and technology intensitive industries. This move
will undoubtedly help to improve efficiency and productivity in all areas.
Of particular mention is the slew of incentives to give the Multi-Media
Super Corridor (MSC) a further boost. Among such incentives are:
  * Pioneer status for 10 years for Investment Tax Allowance of 100 per
cent for a new company;
  * Exemption of taxes on all multi-media equipment;
  * Allowing the recruitment of expatriates according to needs; and
  * Special guidelines for transactions and loans in foreign currency.
  The Budget has also not forgotten the human resource development
necessary to make the upgrading of technology a success. A whopping
allocation of RM13.2 billion or more than 20 per cent of the Budget has
been provided to upgrade and expand local educational and training
institutions and to promote a large pool of technicians and engineers.
  A 50 per cent income tax exemption is also allowed for foreign lecturers
and foreign educational institutions set up in Malaysia, a much needed
boost to the country's effort to establish itself as a regional centre for
education. Besides earning foreign exchange, this move can also help to
save the RM2.5 billion spent annually by Malaysian students overseas.
  Underlying the commitment to upgrade its industries and human resources,
the Finance Minister has also announced that no more new foreign workers
will be allowed into the country. In this regard, a Guideline on Wage
Reform has also been introduced. The guideline proposes a productivity-
linked wage system to increase competitiveness, productivity and
industrial harmony. This is especially pertinent given that the wage
growth of eight per cent for the first seven months of this year has far
outstripped productivity growth of just 3.9 per cent.
  To ensure sustainable growth, the Budget also recognises the need to
maintain a low level of inflation. To this end, RM1.7 billion has been
provided to develop agriculture, fisheries and livestock as well as
increase the effectiveness of the marketing and distribution systems. More
import duties will be abolished or reduced on several items including
paper products, printed paper and cosmetics.
  In tandem with the government's efforts to check inflation, a cabinet
committee has been formed to promote the savings habit among Malaysians
with a long term target for savings rate at 40 per cent. This would
substantially reduce the present savings-investment gap as Malaysia needs
more funds to finance its many development plans.
  The recent implementation of major infrastructural projects has
contributed to a current account deficit, given the substantial imports of
both capital and intermediate goods. This is compounded by a chronic
service account deficit as illustrated in the charts.
  The service deficit seems to be the main culprit in the current account
problem. While the merchandise account can be improved relatively sooner,
the service account will take a little while longer as Malaysia
restructures its economy. Hence, to ensure a smooth transition of the
economy, a string of measures have been announced to give a strong boost
to its financial and other service sectors.
  To develop a dynamic banking and financial sector, some of the measures
announced in the Budget include:
  * Allowing foreign share-holding of local brokerages to be raised from
30 to 49 per cent;
  * More fund management companies will be approved with a concessionary
tax rate of 10 per cent, down from 30 per cent, to be allowed for both
foreign as well as local fund managers;
  * The government will issue zero coupon bonds to provide benchmark yield
curve to boost the private debt securities market. Major institutions like
the EPF, Bank Simpanan Nasional and the Social Security Organisation will
be allowed to invest in such instruments;
  * The banking sector will be further liberalised with Tier-1 commercial
banks allowed to undertake securities and lending business and engage in
equity derivatives.
  Besides the financial sector, the budget also grants incentives to
promote other service sectors. For instance, the export of professional
services has also been encouraged by its exemption from the services tax
and the shipping sector is granted an additional Shipping Fund of RM200
million.
  To attract more international companies to use Malaysia as an
International Procurement Centre (IPC) and thus add more value to the
economy, both the import duties and limits on foreign equity holdings in
IPCs are to be lifted.
  To promote Labuan as an international offshore financial centre, a
generous tax exemption is granted on 65 per cent of income from
professional services by Labuan-based firms. Expatriates in Labuan have to
pay tax only on 50 per cent of income.
  Recognising the tourism sector as a substantial foreign exchange earner,
the Budget allocated RM294.5 million for the construction and upgrading of
hotels, convention centres and other recreational projects to attract 9.5
million foreign visitors in 1997. A five year Pioneer Status for tourism
related infrastructure projects is also granted.
  Besides earning foreign exchange, the tourism sector could also help
prevent the outflow of the ringgit as more Malaysians start visiting the
newly built and upgraded tourist attractions in the country.
  One of the main causes of the current account deficit was the
substantial imports of capital and intermediate goods which resulted in a
high import content of domestic manufacturing activities. Hence, the
import duty on spare parts and consumables used in manufacturing as well
as on components used in the assembly industry will help to curb imports
and increase domestic production of intermediate goods. To boost
entreneurship, RM1 billion is allocated for such programmes as on vendor
development and the Incubator Premises and Factory Nurturing Schemes.
  Unprecendentedly, the Budget also gives a strong emphasis on the social
sector, reinforcing the government's determination to balance economic and
social development.
  The strategy to narrow the gap between the urban and the rural community
is high on Anwar's social agenda. His budget made a generous allocation of
RM7.05 billion for the development of rural areas. A sum of RM2.4 billion
is also set aside to further reduce poverty.
  Anwar also announced the setting up to a RM1 billion National Housing
Company to solve the housing problem of the low-income earners amid rising
property prices.
  As part of the government's effort to promote the social agenda, welfare
institutions are given assistance to the tune of RM280.7 million. Others
like the non-governmental organisations, AIDS Foundation and the Cancer
Society are also not forgotten.
  A sum of RM3.4 billion is budgeted for more hospitals and to enhance the
quality of health services. With the hospital services tax substantially
reduced, it will not only translate into savings for patients but also
help promote Malaysia as a regional medical centre.
  Given that the economy has already reached full employment and capacity
utilisation, Malaysia simply has no choice but to effect a clear shift to
higher technology and productivity to optimise the use of the nation's
capital and human resources. All these bold efforts must at the same time
be delicately balanced with a need to maintain price stability to prevent
inflation from rearing its ugly head.
  Hence, the generous incentives in the Budget for the information and
industrial technology sectors would certainly help to lay a proper
foundation for a knowledge-based and technologically sophisticated
economy.
  The Multimedia Supercorridor would, in time to come, help spin off and
spawn a whole network of IT related companies which would lift Malaysia
confidently into the information age. Together with incentives given to
programmes like the Inter-Industry Linkage Programme, the Vendor
Development and the Incubator Scheme, the day is not far off when Malaysia
will reach a critical mass in its R&D, thus helping it to become a
manufacturing power house.
  By focusing on the services sector, the Budget attacks the root cause of
the current account deficit problem. The host of incentives given to
develop the service sectors, such as the financial and tourism sectors,
would help the country to earn foreign exchange while steming the outflow
of the local currency, thus alleviating the service account deficit in the
long term. Through its offensive to develop its capital markets and
liberalise its banking industry further, Malaysia would one day pose a
challenge to the financial centres in the region.
balance the material progress of the nation with the well being of
society, as reflected by the generous allocation for social development.
In doing so, it gives full recognition to the important role of the family
and the individual in the development of the nation.
  Describing the balance of payments deficit as `birth pangs' of a new
economic era, Anwar said that this is to be expected for a country
undergoing transformation as it enters the 21st century. The Budget will
help to lay a strong foundation for sustaining long term growth.

Shifting prices: Multinationals and tax authorities face off on the issue
of transfer

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 47

MALAYSIA IS IN need of more transparent tax legislation on transfer
pricing as more Malaysian companies globalise their business activities,
states Price Waterhouse executive director SM Thanneermalai.
  He defines a transfer price as the price charged by a multinational
company (MNC) in a cross-border transaction for the supply or acquisition
of goods, services or intangibles and the provision of finance. Prices
charged in associated company transactions are not normally subjected to
full market forces and may otherwise diverge from prices that would be
charged in similar but independent transactions.
  Transfer pricing is possible through three methods. One way is for the
parent company to impose high prices for goods shipped to its subsidiary
in Malaysia. Alternatively, the parent company can direct its Malaysian
subsidiary to sell goods at lower prices to subsidiaries in third
countries. A third method would be for the parent company to charge
exorbitant royalties where the joint venture involves technical
assistance, technology transfer or management expertise, he elaborates.
  Transfer pricing has been identified as a major problem for tax
authorities because of its effect on profit-shifting between countries as
the level set bears directly on the amount of tax that may be raised in
each country. Malaysian companies expanding abroad thus have to understand
the transfer pricing laws of the foreign countries they are investing in
to avoid being hit by transfer pricing adjustments by foreign tax
authorities.
  Thanneermalai cites for example the case of a foreign tax authority
taking the view that excessive royalties have been repatriated back to
Malaysia. In such a circumstance, the Malaysian company would certainly
approach local tax authorities for a corresponding reduction of the taxes
overpaid earlier. `In such a scenario, you can see that even if Malaysia
wants to keep away from the arena of transfer pricing, the actions of the
other foreign tax authorities will not allow this to happen,' he stresses.
  Generally, other countries such as the United States have attacked
transfer pricing to raise tax revenues when faced with large deficits. The
US Internal Revenue Services implemented stiffer statutory transfer
pricing rules in 1986. Japan's National Tax Agency amended its 1986 rules
on transfer pricing in 1991, he adds.
  Malaysia's international trade has increased significantly in recent
years, with exports for 1995 worth RM185 billion compared with RM45
billion in 1987. Last year's imports amounted to RM194 billion compared
with only RM31 billion in 1987. With the increase in trade levels, there
is a greater likelihood of transfer pricing abuses.
  On a macro level, Malaysia's growing current account deficit under
`other services' hit RM4 billion in 1995. According to Thanneermalai, this
could be a factor prompting the government to examine whether transfer
pricing has contributed to this deficit. However, to date, no published
study has been made on the matter.
  At present, Malaysian tax authorities do not carry out specific transfer
pricing audits. Nevertheless, in tax investigations involving companies
with substantial cross border transactions, the issues around transfer
pricing become the main points of contention between the Malaysian tax
authorities and taxpayers, he points out. `By implication therefore,
Malaysian tax authorities are looking at transfer pricing issues such as
the payment for royalties, services, technical fee and merchandise
involving inter-company transactions across Malaysia's borders,' says
Thanneermalai.
  Although currently there are no specific statutory rules on transfer
pricing, two sections of the Malaysian Income Tax Act 1965 (the Act) can
be invoked when there are transfer pricing abuses: Section 141, which
deals with transactions with non-resident connected persons and Section
140, which is the general anti-avoidance provision.
  Section 141(1) of the Act applies to a transaction which produces to a
resident  `either no income or a smaller income than that which might be
expected to arise owing to the close connection between the resident and
non-resident and to the substantial control exercised by the non-resident
over the resident person.' In such a case, the Director-General of Income
Tax (DG) has the power to tax the non-resident in the name of the resident
on `the income which might be expected to arise from the business of the
resident as if the resident was an agent of the non-resident'.
  Section 141(2) of the Act states that if the profits cannot be readily
ascertained, the DG may assess the non-resident `on a fair and reasonable
percentage of the turnover of the business done by the non-resident
through or with the resident'.
  The second section of the Act provides the DG with wider powers. Section
140(1)(a) of the Act empowers the DG to `disregard or vary the transaction
and make such adjustments as he thinks fit where he has reason to believe
that any transaction has the direct or indirect effect of altering the
incidence of tax which is payable'.
  Section 140(6) of the Act allows the DG to deem certain transactions to
fall within Section 140(1) of the Act. These are transactions between
affiliated companies which `have not been made on terms which might fairly
be expected to have been made by an independent person engaged in the same
or similar activities dealing with one another at arm's length'. However,
there are no statutory rules, case laws or administrative rules in
Malaysia on the definition of the term `arm's length'. The lack of
definitions and guidelines of the above term has occasionally created
problems for taxpayers, states Panneermalai.
  Neighbouring countries which include Indonesia, China, Korea, Japan and
the Philippines have already implemented rules and regulations on transfer
pricing. In fact, Singapore is in the midst of collecting data, a step
before introducing rules on transfer pricing, he indicates. Most of the
countries that have adopted transfer pricing rules acknowledge the
guidelines provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD). Malaysian tax authorities are agreeable to most OECD
guidelines although Malaysia is not an OECD member. `Generally, OECD
transaction-based methods such as the comparable uncontrolled price
method, the resale price method and the cost-plus method are acceptable to
Malaysian tax authorities. However, the tax authorities are not in favour
of the profit method unless there is no alternative,' he elaborates.
  Another major setback faced by MNCs in Malaysia is a provision in the
Income Tax statute which gives income tax authorities the right to collect
tax dating back to 12 years. In case of fraud, there are no time
limitations. This is where companies face major problems as they are
unable to retrieve documentation over that length of time due to improper
documentation and storage of the information,' he says.
  `Since we have sufficient legislation to combat any transfer pricing
abuses, Malaysian tax authorities should issue guidelines to determine
whether related party transactions are of arm's-length nature,' he
stresses. Having reasonable and transparent guidelines would definitely
increase the flow of foreign investments into Malaysia. MNCs will know
what the rules are and be able to avoid any future transfer pricing
fiascos.
  Two senior partners of Price Waterhouse, Terry Symons and Michael J
Happell recently gave a talk on global issues of transfer pricing.
Transfer pricing is the current `hot topic' for revenue authorities world-
wide as they get more aggressive in the fight for a share of the MNCs'
world tax revenues, according to Symons. He cites the example of Glaxo
Wellcome where the United Kingdom revenue authorities imposed a whopping
STG200 million (RM804 million) in transfer pricing adjustments.
  Recent tax authority transfer pricing adjustments have had a serious
impact on MNCs world-wide, leaving them open to extra taxation (see
table). In fact, Japan's National Tax Agency (NTA) statistics for the year
ended June 1996 indicate 44 cases with an income adjustment of US$ 450
million earned US$ 275 million in tax and penalties for NTA. NTA
statistics for the nine years since the introduction of transfer pricing
legislation recorded 130 cases involving income adjustments of US$ 1.8
billion, earning NTA a whopping US$ 1.1 billion in tax and penalties.

Stocks to watch: Tenaga Nasional Bhd

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 75

TNB recovered strongly from the recent low of RM8.55 to the current level
of RM10.90. As it constitutes some nine per cent of the KLSE CI, Tenaga
has set the pace for a run-up of the overall market. Technically, it has
formed a double bottom at RM8.55 and the first upside target is at RM11.70
which is close to the current level. Tenaga is expected to consolidate
between RM11.70 and RM10 for the near term.

New shareholders for Tenco?

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 4

TENCO BHD may see new faces on its board soon. Earwitness learns that  a
substantial block of Tenco shares could have changed hands recently at
around RM12 to RM13 apiece. This could probably account for the recent
sharp surge in Tenco's share price from RM12 to RM16 as at press time.
  The new shareholder is believed to be a property developer with strong
connections in northern Peninsular Malaysia. If all goes well, the
property developer may be looking into the possibility of pumping some
sizeable property projects into Tenco.
  Tenco, which was listed on the KLSE second board in Nov 1993, has a
paid-up capital of RM18 million. It is an investment holding company with
four wholly-owned subsidiaries mainly engaged in the manufacture and sale
of industrial adhesives, industrial chemicals, consumer and aerosol
products. It also sells industrial gases, industrial equipment and
building products.
  The range of building products marketed by Tenco includes floormats,
fibreglass wool and boards, polyethylene sheets and tubes.
  The major shareholders of Tenco as at Aug 16, 1996 comprise Wilken Sdn
Bhd (29%), Tan Yik Chin (6.4%), Tan Aik Teck (4.7%) and Tan Lee Ling
(4.4%). Tan Yik Chin is deemed interested in Wilken by virtue of his
shareholding in the company.
  In  May 1995, Tenco announced that the Securities Commission has given
the greenlight to lift the moratorium  of 6.89 million shares held by Tan
Yik Chin, Tan Aik Teck, Tan Lay Lee, Tan Lee Leng @ Tan Lee Fee and
Wilken. With the lifting of the moratorium, the major shareholders were to
have collectively provided a pretax profit guarantee of RM3.42 million for
both the financial years ended Mar 31, 1995 and 1996.
  Since Tenco's pretax profit for the two financial years amounted to
about RM4.45 million each, it looks like the major shareholders have met
the profit forecast.

Theory in practice: As Malaysian and Australian ministers speak of high
tides and pebbles

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 57

THERE IS NO doubt trade ties between Malaysia and Australia mean a lot to
both countries. Barring the occasional hiccup, the relationship between
both countries has generally been warm and cordial.
  Earlier this month, two Malaysian ministers flew to Sydney for a
Malaysia-Australia business dialogue organised by the Asian Strategy and
Leadership Institute. The event, themed `A New Era In Australia-Malaysia
Partnership', drew leading businessmen from both Malaysia (about 40) and
Australia (50).
  In his keynote address, Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Mustapa
Mohamed drew attention to some Malaysian industries to be considered by
Australian companies about to venture abroad. Among them were the
production of intermediate and capital goods, construction and building
materials, information technology and computer software.
  In closing the dialogue, Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak
urged Australian business leaders to help develop Malaysia's Multimedia
Super Corridor (MSC), telling them that they `should not miss this high
tide in our relations'.
  Such high-level salesmanship does not come from Malaysia alone.
  When Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer was in Kuala Lumpur
last month to address the Malaysia-Australia University Alumni convention,
themed `Malaysia-Australia Relations Beyond 2000', he sent a similar
message. `We have moved beyond the time when governments alone were
responsible for promoting national achievements. The building of links at
the people-to-people level is, after all, the lifeblood of any
relationship,' he said.
  Downer said that the tide of economic, technological and social change
that was sweeping and transforming Australia has created opportunities for
co-operation and partnership between Malaysians and Australians,
particularly in the fields of finance, information technology, marketing,
medicine and education. `Further liberalisation of Malaysia's services
sector should, over time, create even more opportunities in these fields,'
he added.
  The day before Downer gave his speech, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr
Mahathir Mohamad said Australia could play a major role in helping
Malaysia become an international centre of excellence in higher education.
`It is our hope that Australia, which has several established universities
and institutions, will encourage them to open branches in Malaysia or twin
with local institutions,' he said.
  These speeches highlight the opportunities available in Malaysia and
Australia which will bolster already healthy trade relations, as suggested
by the statistics. According to Malaysia's Economic Report 1996/97, total
trade with Australia expanded by 9.4 per cent to RM4.8 billion in the
first seven months of this year, with Malaysia continuing to record a
deficit.
  Exports to Australia increased by 3.9 per cent to RM1.7 billion while
imports expanded by 12.6 per cent to RM3.1 billion. In the corresponding
period in 1995, Malaysia's trade deficit with Australia was RM1.2 billion.
  Malaysia's investments in Australia stood at A$1 billion last year,
making it the second largest Asean investor after Singapore. About 60 per
cent of Malaysian money in Australia was in the property sector, followed
by mineral exploration and development.
  Downer tells Malaysian Business, `Based on our figures, over 61 per cent
of Australia's trade is with countries of East Asia, while 2.6 per cent of
our total world trade was with Malaysia in 1995-1996. This is up from 2.4
per cent the previous financial year. Malaysia is now our 11th largest
trading partner overall.' (Also see next story)
  Elaborating, he says, `Trade has grown strongly particularly in the more
elaborately transformed manufactures, in both directions. They now make up
26 per cent of Australia's exports to Malaysia.
  `We anticipate further growth in our trade with Malaysia and we would
like that percentage share to grow. Nevertheless, we recognize that
Malaysia is a very competitive market place. Australian products and
services have to be both high  in quality and competitively priced. As the
Prime Minister John Howard says, we are well aware that merely living in
the Asian region does not ensure us an easy road. He noted there are many
pebbles washing up on the economic shores of Asia. We must work hard to
make ours the most attractive pebbles. We cannot be complacent.
  In an interview published in May, the Australian High Commissioner to
Malaysia, William Farmer, was quoted as saying Malaysia was Australia's
second largest market in Asean for services, especially in education and
tourism. Australian investments as at June 30, 1994 stood at A$2.5
billion.
  Farmer said new Australian investments focused more on capital and
technology-intensive activities. Australian investors were also moving
into the transport and distribution sectors, as well as software and
management systems.

Ahead of the times: Singapore Airlines upgrades fleet and service to stay
ahead of the pack

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 80

IF ONE HAD TO name the world's most successful airline marketing campaign,
chances are Singapore Airlines (SIA) would constantly come to mind. The
clever imagery of the Singapore Girl - attractive and unflappable, smiling
at every situation in every corner of the world - has been a winner for
the airline. So has the reputation for excellence that SIA has created for
itself over the years.
  But it takes more than just advertising and a good reputation to keep an
airline right up front these days. The modern fleet of the last decade may
today translate into planes that are behind the times in seating,
electronics and passenger gadgetry.
  Today's airline management not only has to look ahead at who they have
to beat, but constantly look over their shoulders to see who is catching
up fast. It's a juggling act, but one at which SIA's management is
masterful, doubly to be admired because the small island state really does
not have an overload of tourist attractions.
  And for a population as small as that of Singapore's to have an airline
that is one of the world's leaders is an achievement indeed. It
illustrates the value of lateral thinking and bold, forward planning with
which the name Singapore Airlines has become synonymous.
  Right from the outset, the management has set out to be an industry
pacesetter. In those days this airline had Asia's youngest fleet, and
concentrated on being the first in Asia to bring their passengers such
amenities as inflight faxes and telephones.
  And when it came to designing an airport that was just as innovative,
only the best was good enough for Singapore also. Changi was the world
leader, making headlines everywhere when it opened. The second stage of
Changi has been completed, and this is just as good as the first, with the
only justifiable complaint being that there are just not enough moving
walkways to cover the vast distances involved.
  Nevertheless, when it comes to style and efficiency, I would back Changi
against any large airport in the world. Although SIA does not actually own
Changi airport, the smart, modern facilities there are closely associated
with the airline in the passenger's mindset. The bottom line is that, over
the years, SIA has built an enviable reputation, made bumper profits, has
had the cashflow (and where this was not enough, the confidence of bankers
and the investment public) to purchase the latest new aircraft, resulting
in a very large number of brand-loyal SIA frequent flyers.
  Safety and service are other very important aspects when choosing an
airline, and it is a comfort to any air traveller to know that the airline
they choose has a reliable record. In this regard it's hard to find
another Asian airline as decorated as SIA when nominations come from both
airline industry magazines and passenger and travel organisations. Flight
operations and pilot training have been recognised by the US-based
Professional Pilot magazine with its 1994 Airline of the Year award. The
UK travel trade newspaper, Travel Weekly, gave SIA the Best Airline in
Asia award in its 1994 Travel Industry Globe Awards.
  Not only that, in the last eight years, SIA has been nominated seven
times by the prestigious Conde Nast Traveller Magazine Readers' Choice
award for Best Airline - the last award being in 1995.
  Last year proved to be a good year for SIA when, for the sixth year
running, it was awarded the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) Travel
Award for Best Airline. It also won the top airline of business travellers
award for the second successive year in an Asia Money 1995 Business Travel
Poll.
  Continued efforts to maintain SIA's service excellence both on the
ground and inflight has consistently earned it international travel and
passenger awards. One of the most telling awards of its diligence in this
regard is the `20 Years of Excellence in International Service' award from
Air Transport World in 1994.
  Not content to rest on its laurels, SIA is presently upgrading its
fleet. The Airbus A340-300E, launched worldwide this April, was made
possible when SIA took delivery of two A340's, acknowledged as having the
quietest cabin in the sky. Another 15 A340's are on order as part of the
airline's commitment to operate one of the youngest and most modern fleets
of any major international airline.
  SIA's managing director Dr Cheon Choon Kong explains, `We rate the
aircraft highly in terms of economy, modernity and comfort. It is a star
performer in all categories. Inspired by this, we have decided to name our
A340-300E the "Celestar." We believe this aircraft will truly be a "star
of the skies."'
  The Celestar A340 will offer passengers more non-stop services and
point-to-point connections. Its long range and medium-density routes
include Jakarta, Bangkok, Melbourne and Sydney. Non-stop services to Paris
that began this month will demonstrate the long-range capability of this
new Airbus Industrie star.
  SIA has made the Celestar its own with some custom additions. Its state-
of-the-art inflight entertainment system, KrisWorld, is found in every
class. Passenger response has been enthusiastic, and it's easy to
understand why. There is a choice of 22 video channels in the KrisWorld
system, along with 12 audio channels, 10 Nintendo games and real-time text
news which is updated on an hourly basis, bringing general news, financial
and sports headlines.
  There is also destination information on 176 cities on SIA's route
network together with a personal in-seat telephone and fax service that
allow passengers to place calls or transmit faxes from anywhere in the sky
to virtually anywhere on the ground.
  Reading in an upright or reclined position is easy with the individual
multi-positioning reading lights. Seat pitch for First Class passengers
has been extended to a generous 74in, offering a real sense of space.
  Raffles Class and Economy Class passengers also have adjustable
headrests with foldable `ears' for further support. Electric leg-rests and
deflatable lumbar supports are offered in Raffles Class, while footrests
give Economy Class passengers improved comfort.
  The airline's Megatop 747s have been refitted, refining the already
luxurious `sleeper' seats in First Class and allowing them to attain a
greater recline and increased height of the leg-rest to almost horizontal.
  Raffles Class passengers enjoy an improved seat pitch of 47in in the
Megatop; the backrest drops back an extra 2in, while the forward-mounted
legrest can be operated by remote control.
  Keeping in touch with passengers' requirements is part of the secret
behind SIA's success. The Silver Kris lounge at Changi is renowned as the
largest and most luxuriously appointed airport lounge on the globe. Here,
the seating capacity for 550 offers an unbeatable range of business and
personal amenities for SIA's First and Raffles Class passengers. Other
Silver Kris lounges are gradually being upgraded worldwide to match the
one at Changi.
  Apart from the inflight KrisWorld advantages of phone calls from the
seat, there are many little touches that keep SIA customers coming back.
Ground staff are always on hand to bid farewell to First Class passengers
either at the boarding gate or in the cabin, and on journeys longer than
four hours, local newspapers are offered on arrival at their destinations.
  For SIA's frequent flyers, a Priority Passenger Service (PPS) guarantees
members access to at least an Economy seat on any flight, provided a
minimum of 24 hours' notice is given. Recently, enhancements to PPS
include extra benefits and a second tier of membership - PPS Solitaire -
for loyal members.
  Cuisine has also been a strong point on SIA which offers Asian dishes
and European cuisine, halal on Middle Eastern routes and by request on
others. It's a formula that works well. Wine lists give the passengers a
choice of excellent German, French and Australian wines. Cocktails,
aperitifs, spirits, liqueurs and beers are supplemented by tea, herbal
teas, decaffeinated tea or coffee, and a choice of liqueur coffees such as
Highland Coffee (with Scotch whisky and whipped cream), Cafe Royale (with
XO brandy) and Cafe Mandarin (with Cointreau, essence of squeezed orange
peel and a topping of whipped cream).
  Other SIA initiatives to take the hassle out of travelling include a
return check-in. This allows passengers travelling to regional
destinations and returning within 48 hours to be issued with boarding
passes for both the outbound and inbound sectors.
  Other check-in improvements include a fax check-in, and for passengers
travelling out of Singapore, there is a check-in facility at SIA's
downtown ticket offices. An automated combined ticket and boarding pass
used on the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur shuttle service has further reduced
check-in time.
  Another key to a good airline is to have a schedule that takes the
passenger, especially the business traveller, to the destination he wants,
with a frequency that will suit his itinerary. For this, SIA has built a
very impressive network covering 73 cities in 41 countries. In addition,
SIA's regional subsidiary, SilkAir, serves 20 Asian destinations in eight
countries.
  SIA acknowledges that until the end of this century, the Asia-Pacific
region will be the fastest expanding area for civil aviation. China is
emerging as a big-growth potential market and SIA currently flies to
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hangzhou, and will progressively add more
cities as the need arises.
  Indo-China is also ripe for both tourist and business travel expansion,
and SilkAir and SIA service Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi daily, with
Vietianne and Pnomh Phenh covered by three services weekly.
  Japan, however, remains SIA's most important market with Tokyo, Osaka,
Nagoya, Fukuoka, Sendai and Hiroshima accounting for a total of 58 flights
weekly.
  The problem that SIA has is that the other regional carriers all seem to
make a fetish of aiming to overtake SIA in quality. The naming of Malaysia
Airlines as the region's best First Class service last year sent shock
waves through SIA's corridors. Hasty conferences explored how such a thing
could happen, and efforts were redoubled to win back this position.
  If SIA has a fault, it may be that some passengers feel that they are
being taken a little for granted. Automated telephone answering that makes
passengers talk to machines rather than to human operators irritate many,
and the cutting out of inflight amenity packs in Business Class has also
drawn criticism from passengers I have spoken to.
  But these are minor problems, and it's my bet that they will be quickly
and effectively addressed. SIA has always been a quick learner and is
unlikely to let any glitches arise that will lose it passengers. The
airline has always believed in increasing services rather than
discounting, and has consequently enjoyed the loyalty of the premium
frequent flyer clientele. We cannot imagine any situation which will cause
this to change.

More tools of investment: New measures to turn Malaysia into a complete
capital market

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 45

ONE SIGNIFICANT feature of the 1997 Budget is the government's bid to
further broaden and deepen the financial services sector in the country.
  Like never before, measures have been spelt out to make Malaysia a
sophisticated and complete financial market. At present, investors have
limited options. Most will put their money in the equities or futures
market, while the risk averse investor will probably leave it in fixed
deposits to earn interest.
  But thanks to Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri
Anwar Ibrahim, his latest Budget has paved the way for the setting up of a
string of investments tools. For starters, Anwar proposed the introduction
of the over-the-counter (OTC) market and a series of bonds to provide a
benchmark yield curve.
  The OTC market which is similar to the NASDAQ in the United States, is
generally for the quotation of shares of high-profile technology companies
which do not meet the requirements for listing on the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange's main or second board.
  To further promote the financial services sector, the minister also
allowed foreign broking firms to take equity of up to 49 per cent in
domestic brokerages.
  Local brokers can also undertake fund management and underwriting
activities, issue call warrants, manage listing of companies and undertake
electronic share transactions.
  Several economists interviewed by Malaysian Business feel that besides
adding more investment tools, these measures will set the basis for
Malaysia to be a complete capital market. MBf Securities economist Dr
Ghazali Atan says the measures will bring about more flexibility to the
capital market and more options for fund managers to spread the risk of
their portfolios.
  `The OTC market will basically be the KLSE's third board while the
benchmark for bonds enhances the creation of a liquid bond market. At the
same time it will also provide an index for bonds. At present, we have the
equities and derivatives markets. With the bond and OTC markets, there
will be more tools for investors and those who need to raise finance,' he
adds.
  Subsequent to the Budget announcement, the government announced that
Khazanah Holding, its investment arm, will issue a series of bonds to
serve as a benchmark.
  Arab-Malaysian Securities economist Mustafa Mohd Nor echoes the views of
Ghazali and says the measures will induce the creation of more
sophisticated tools of investment. `Without the proposed instruments,
Malaysia is not complete as a regional financial services centre. We have
to start somewhere to build up more capital market instruments,' he says.
  The importance the government places in expanding the capital market
does not come as a surprise considering that there was a significant
increase in funds raised by both the public and private sector from the
market during the first eight months of the year. According to the 1996/97
Economic Report, total funds raised by the public and private sectors
through the capital market increased significantly by 64.2 per cent to
RM20.4 billion compared to RM12.4 billion mobilised the corresponding
period last year.
  Net funds mobilised through the private debt securities market during
the period was RM10.1 billion, a significant increase compared to RM4.9
billion recorded in the corresponding period of 1995. (See table.)
  With the Budget paving the way for the development of a complete capital
market, the question which lingers on our minds is how and when will these
new instruments take off?
  Consider the fact that the Kuala Lumpur Options & Financal Futures
Exchange (KLOFFE) has yet to significantly take off since commencing
operations on Dec 15, last year. Mustafa feels time will tell whether or
not the new instruments for investments and raising capital will take off.
  `Even the present equities market took off only in the early 1990s.
KLOFFE may be slow but given time, it should take off. The main thing is
that we have a base to create more capital market instruments. The opening
up of local broking firms to foreign brokerages is a supporting factor to
develop the local capital market,' Mustafa says.
  Ghazali says the new tools will also likely to see private investors
depending less on banks as a mean for raising funds. `Companies will be
less bound towards banks. The OTC market will enable companies which need
funds to issue shares. These companies need not depend on banks solely for
finance,' he adds.
  Besides banks and financial institutions, merchant banks and fund
management companies also feel another competition coming their way
following measures introduced in the Budget. Anwar had announced the
expansion of the scope of the local brokerages.
  Currently, brokerages are only involved in the trading of shares. But
the Budget has proposed to allow them to manage the listing of companies,
undertake fund management and underwriting activities. The listings of new
companies and underwriting activities are now carried out by merchant
banks.
  Ghazali says the proposed measures are good as they would provide
merchant banks with competition. However, he dismissed any notion that
merchant banks will be adversely hit. He says with the OTC and private
companies allowed to issue bonds, the scope of the capital market will be
enlarged. `Basically the cake will be bigger and there are more players to
share it' he says.
  Moreover, an investment analyst feels merchant banks will not be
threatened as they (merchant banks) are established and provide supporting
services for companies seeking a listing like financing and underwriting.
`In the short-term, there is not much the brokerages can do. Firstly, it
is difficult to set up a corporate finance department while many of the
merchant banks have their steady base of clients. Also, many of the big
local brokerages come under banks or already have an interest in a
merchant bank,' he says.
  Citing the examples of Arab-Malaysian Securities or Rashid Hussain
Securities, the analyst points out that these brokerages already have an
interest in merchant banking activities.
  `Thus it serves no purpose for them to create unnecessary competition.
It merely provides an opportunity for the smaller brokerages without any
interest in merchant banks. But this will take time,' he says.

Way out of Ampang snarl: Prolintas starts work on twin-deck highway above
Klang River

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 38

`THERE ARE just too many people in Kuala Lumpur. New offices, new cars.
Who knows how many more in two or three years' time,' the cabbie muses.
`More buildings will add more cars to the roads. If only more people used
the bus and taxi ...'
  Public transportation may be one way around Kuala Lumpur's traffic woes.
But the latest attempt to ease the city of traffic congestion comes in the
form of an elevated highway. Called the Kuala Lumpur Elevated Highway
(KLEH) project, it does not come cheap at about RM100 million per km!
  When completed in 1999, the KLEH will give city motorists extra motoring
space over the Klang River. It will be the main artery linking Kuala
Lumpur's eastern corridor (Jalan Jelatek, Jalan Datuk Keramat, Jalan
Ampang, Jalan Ampang Hilir) to the city centre (Jalan Sultan Ismail).
  Project Lintasan Kota Sdn Bhd (Prolintas) is the KLEH concessionaire.
Its general manager Abdullah Hassan says that among the plus points,
state-of-the-art KLEH is an environmentally sound option, emphasising the
importance of aesthetics. `I can't say whether or not the pillars will be
grey, but basically it will take into account its surroundings,' he says
with a chuckle.
  Part of the reason why the KLEH will be the most expensive highway is
the land factor. Construction is atop prime land in the city, most of
which (except for some private land), belongs to the Drainage and
Irrigation Department.
  The interchanges, as well as the beginning and end of the highway, will
be built over main land mass, not river banks. It is understood that not
all the required land has been acquired. Public relations officer Norhanim
Zakaria says, `We're still in the process of acquiring land for the
project.'
  Another costly factor, according to KLEH project manager Mohd Mazlan
Mohd Yusof, is technology. He says, `The bottom of the pillars are
designed in cut-edged shape so that when the water level rises during high
tide or flood, there is minimum resistance against the pillars, minimising
the back water effect. Their width at 14m is almost double the width of
pillars used for the Light Rail Transit (LRT).' Other costs include
relocating squatters and the diversion of water pipes and power cables
lining the length of the river.
  But in the end, the investment could be well worth it. Abdullah says,
`It will absorb traffic from Jalan Ampang, reduce bumper to bumper
bottlenecks and cut down travelling time to the central business district
by more than half.' Work on the KLEH is also said to be less damaging to
the environment.
  At present, 40,000 vehicles use Jalan Ampang daily. Studies show that it
takes 45 minutes to drive to or out of the city centre and even longer
during peak hours. Abdullah says,`If you build a flyover or expand the
road, two lanes have to be closed. The disruption to traffic and
businesses would be enormous.'
  One estimate by Percon, Permodalan Nasional Berhad's construction
subsidiary, is that the traffic volume in Jalan Ampang alone will increase
to 55,000 vehicles by the year 2005. In less than five years, the city's
population will increase from 1.6 million to 2.2 million. The rush is on
to complete the elevated highway.
  Abdullah says piling work has already begun on the RM700 million build,
operate and transfer (BOT) project starting at the 14-lane toll plaza in
Jalan Datuk Keramat. Phase 1 comprises twin decks with seven interchanges
beginning near Wisma Denmark, rising to Jalan Jelatek, then down to Jalan
Ampang. After Jalan Jelatek, the twin decks merge into one single wider
deck on a two-lane dual carriageway. Seven interchanges connect with
existing roads, the latter serving as secondary roads once the KLEH is
ready. The interchanges are at Jalan Sultan Ismail, KLCC, Jalan Tun Razak,
Jalan Jelatek, Jalan Ulu Kelang, Jalan Kerja Air Lama and Jalan Ampang.
  Phase 2 of KLEH comprises a single deck extension from Phase 1 in Jalan
Jelatek to Jalan Ampang, completing the whole twin-deck highway. Abdullah
says, `Work on Phase 2 will commence when traffic reaches 93,600 vehicles
a day or by the year 2013, even if traffic has not reached that volume by
then.'
  Six kilometres of the 7.4 km KLEH will be elevated - at its highest
point reaching up to 12 metres. Noise barriers will be erected near
schools, hospitals and other sensitive areas. Mazlan says the company is
considering see-through perspex buffers instead of using conventional
concrete panelling. The speed limit? Up to 80km/h on the twin deck and
65km/h where the decks merge into one.
  A consortium of three companies comprising main contractor Percon, sub-
contractors MMC Engineering Bhd and Leighton Holdings Bhd will construct
the elevated portion of KLEH.
  Prolintas, the KLEH concession holder, has a paid-up capital of RM10
million. It is 60 per cent owned by Permodalan Nasional Berhad with the
remaining shares held by Percon (formerly known as Pernas Construction).
  The maintenance job and toll concession has been awarded to Prolintas
for 33 years, starting from the time work commences. Abdullah expects the
company to break even in about 10 years after KLEH opens. `By then, we
should be able to repay our commercial creditors,' he adds.
  Another project source says that if about RM3 million in toll was
collected a month, the potential revenue could be RM36 million a year.
  The first highway to be built above a river boasts a few advantages over
conventional highways. Abdullah says, `It minimises disruption to traffic,
businesses and activities at the main road. As it will be built mostly on
government property, it minimises social problems related to land
acquisitions, especially in a heavily populated area as this.'
  Some squatter settlements will be relocated for the highway but the
numbers are small compared with other projects. Norhanim says about 95
affected squatter families in Federal Territory and another 56 in Selangor
will be relocated to longhouses in Kampung Air Lanjut, Setapak and Kampung
Wira Damai and Gombak.
  Says Abdullah, `The Klang river now flows along the central channel in
the middle. The highway's concrete pillars on both sides of the river
banks only affect water flow during flood or high tide. After the pillars
are built, work concentrates on the top, hence disruption to life below is
minimised. `The pillars' foundation will be layed by bored piling, a
screw-in technique which eliminates the hammering thunders of the
conventional method.
  Fears have been raised over the river's eco-system. Experts say that
without ultra violet rays, bacteria in the river would fester and
ultimately destroy its eco-system. But Mazlan assures that it is not a
problem. `The elevated twin decks will be separated 12m edge to edge to
allow direct sunlight to the river below.'
  Mazlan says, `I believe the end result will be pleasant. It is
environmentally sound and we are building an alternative access out of KL.
The project will straighten out meandering parts of the Klang River and
incorporate a masterplan to beautify it.
  `At present, there are bends in the river which are collection points
for rubbish and debris. Once these are straightened out, water flow will
become smoother.' Below KLEH, the Drainage and Irrigation Department will
build walkways with handrails for pedestrians and joggers.
  After 25 years of building roads, bridges and highways, Percon has
established its name as an infrastructure builder. It has completed RM1
billion worth of projects including the Istana Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, the
Seremban-Kuala Lumpur highway improvement project, two packages of the
North-South highway project, drainage and earthworks for Package 5 of the
KLIA at Sepang, the KL-PJ highway and the Gambang-Kuala Lepar Highway
(Kuala Lumpur to Kuantan). Its current projects include the Shah Alam-
Petaling Jaya expressway and the Malaysian Embassy building in Bangkok.
  The KLEH is a substantial investment for the future, for Percon and
motorists who use the highway. Abdullah says, `If this project proves to
be suitable, it will be a launching pad for us to export our expertise
overseas.'

Satellite parts from Zasna

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
16 Nov 1996, page 4

ZASNA Technology Sdn Bhd, a company linked to Nepline Bhd executive
chairman Dr Nik Mohd Zain Omar, will become the first Bumiputera company
to manufacture hardware and components for satellite receiver systems.
  Industry sources tell Earwitness, Zasna will be teaming up with a German
company, Ge-tronic Seislinger Electronic. They also say that the joint-
venture will initially export the products to Ge-tronic in Germany, which
will in turn market the products worldwide.
  Ge-tronic is a well-known company which supplies satellite receiver
multiswitches and cable TV (CATV) amplifiers to original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) customers such as Philips and Nokia.
  The sources say the multi-million ringgit factory will be located in
Pengkalan Chepa, Kelantan. Nik has plans to eventually list Zasna on the
main board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE).
  This is not Nik's first venture in Kelantan in his personal capacity. He
is also teaming up with several entrepreneurs to set up Kelantan's first
private hospital in Kota Bharu.

FOOD COMPANIES WITH A HEART SHOULD LOOK TO SOUTH ASIA

Despite the increased supply of food and an upturn in social
conditions, malnutrition remains a serious problem in South
Asia.
It also presents an opportunity for firms and nonprofit
organizations that want to focus their charitable food-
distribution efforts. The region includes Bhutan, Bangladesh,
India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka-Qwith a
population
of 1.22 billion people.

More than one-half the world's underweight children of
preschool
age are South Asian. With the region's population growing
faster
than its economy, food availability remains relatively low,
and
has not shown much improvement in recent years.

Problems include a lack of education of mothers as well as
poor
distribution systems. Officials say it is clear that
educating
women is one key to improving nutrition in the region. The
chart
above shows the number of girls who are enrolled in primary
school
for every 100 boys in the same age group.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in
the
1980s, the share of underfed in the region fell 6 percent.
South
Asia's per capita food energy supply grew from about 2,070
kilocalories daily in 1975 to almost 2,250 kilocalories in
1990.
But the region's 101 million underweight children are still
nearly
double the number in Sub-Saharan Africa. Malnutrition stunts
the
mental and physical growth of one-third of children in the
region,
says the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

A large proportion of this is caused by deficiencies of
Vitamin A,
iodine, and iron. Nearly one-half the children in the group
aged 6
to 11 in Bangladesh and almost one-third in the tiny
Himalayan
kingdom of Bhutan, are afflicted with goiter caused by iodine
deficiency, which retards brain development.

United Nations officials are puzzled by the persistence of
high
levels of malnutrition in the region.

"We in UNICEF believe there must be something wrong with the
strategies being used," says regional chief Urban Jonsson. He
points out that South Asian governments are the largest
spenders
on nutrition, but with little effect.

There is, however, some good news from nongovernmental,
community-
based programs.

SUCCESS STORIES
In Bangladesh, severe protein malnutrition dropped 14 percent
between 1985 and 1994 in areas covered by locally run
schemes.
Similar initiatives in India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka
have
slashed nutritional deficiencies dramatically. About 20
community-
based projects have been singled out as successful by the
UNICEF
South Asia office, which suggests that governments can learn
from
these success stories.

South Asia can also learn from Thailand, which UNICEF cites
as the
best example of a nation that improved national nutrition
policies
and strategies on the basis of the experience of community
projects.

Political commitment at all levels, a high level of literacy,
especially among women, community organization and
involvement,
and the infrastructure that can deliver basic services were
among
the key factors for the success of nutrition strategies
identified
at a regional meeting.

"Long term nutrition improvements in the region are strongly
associated with female educational levels. Research in
Pakistan
has shown that the likelihood of having an underweight child
in
the household where the mother has no education is three
times
that of the household where the mother has primary
education,"
says a paper presented at a regional meeting on National
Plans of
Action for Nutrition.

The trend of female enrollment at secondary level is upwards,
from
24 percent in 1975 to 35 percent in 1990, but the region's
progress in educating females is still too slow to make a
dent in
malnutrition.

JAPANESE CONTINUE TRADITION OF GIFT GIVING

The high value of the yen is opening up the vast Japanese
gifts
market to foreign suppliers. Japanese people give each other
YEN10
trillion (US$96 billion) in gifts each year. While the
corporate
gifts market has shrunk in this tough business time, personal
gift
giving is thriving and was worth YEN7.7 trillion (US$74
billion)
in 1994.

A report from the Hong Kong Trade Development Council says
that
Japanese consumers' tastes are increasingly diversified, and
their
sales of imported gift products should increase. The greatest
personal gift givers are Japanese women in their 20s and 30s.
They
tend to favor inexpensive, fashionable items such as
handkerchiefs, pouches, well-designed jewelry, and
accessories.

Gift-giving is well ingrained in Japan's culture. Apart from
set
events such as religious ceremonies or weddings, birthdays or
the
birth of a baby, presents are given to neighbors, relatives,
and
acquaintances. Young people give gifts to friends and
coworkers to
express feelings of gratitude, happiness, or sometimes
sadness.

For the business gift, popular items used by companies for
promotions or incentives include electronics (calculators,
watches) small electrical appliances, kitchenware, interior
items
such as CD racks, travel bags, stationery, knitted goods,
flashlights, pocket cameras, and lighters.

ASIAN MEN MAY BE THE NEXT BIG SKIN-CARE MARKET

As Asia's population ages, it is possible to cash in on a
number
of new trends in skin care, according to reports in Asian
Retailer. Postwar baby boomers in Asia are beginning to see
signs
of wear and tear in the mirror. Couple this with greater
affluence, and the breakdown of social taboos that have
prevented
men from buying cosmetic products and new opportunities
emerge.

The magazine reports that high-class cosmetics houses are
riding
high on a boom in antiaging creams and potions, and already
lower-
priced versions of these lines are hitting the supermarket
toiletry departments. It says that the Watson pharmaceutical
store
chain of Hong Kong finds that antiaging merchandise is
becoming
important in its product line.

Among the skin-care buying customers is an increasing number
of
men. While few products are targeted directly to Asian men,
there
are indications that men are buying women's products,
especially
those with little or no fragrance.

Other items that are growing in demand are blood pressure
monitors, anti-cholesterol remedies, vitamins, and health
food
supplements.

TIME PAYMENTS INCREASE BUYING POWER IN HO CHI MINH CITY

Sales of imported goods in Ho Chi Minh City have jumped with
the
reintroduction of time payments, but they are not for
everyone,
according to Vietnam Investment Review. The fortnightly
business
newspaper, which is published in Vietnamese and English,
reports
that more than 100 shops in the commercial capital of
southern
Vietnam now offer credit on everything from a new Honda to
the
latest personal computer equipment. Relatively strict
conditions
apply: some stores provide credit to state employees only,
while
at others the customer must have a certificate from his or
her
employer guaranteeing repayments will be deducted from wages.

With time payments, demand for computers has increased by 150
percent as higher-income Vietnamese use the new payment
schemes.
There is tough competition among about 100 computer stores in
Ho
Chi Minh City, and other marketing devices include special
offers
for students and for new businesses.

Not everyone is happy. Domestic manufacturers complain that
sales
of their generally less-expensive models are dropping as
consumers
use credit to afford more-expensive, usually imported, items.

JAPANESE TAKE THEIR COLD REMEDIES SERIOUSLY

Getting to school and work every day is an obsession with the
Japanese, no matter how ill they feel. That may be one reason
that
the Japanese spend $5 per capita every year soothing the
common
cold, the most spent by any of the world's six largest
markets for
cough and cold remedies. Cold remedies represent 11 percent
of the
Japanese market for the entire sector.

While the Japanese focus on colds, residents of the United
States
spend about the same amount per capita ($5.50) for cough
remedies,
according to MarketLine International.

MarketLine analysts say that the market for over-the-counter
(OTC)
remedies can be expected to grow as Japan joins other
developed
countries in trying to cut back on healthcare expenditures
and
instilling a sense of personal responsibility in consumers.

While many U.S. and European companies are entering the
Japanese
OTC market, Taisho Pharmaceutical company, which is
practically
unknown outside the Japanese market, continues to hold a
strong
position.

ROOM FOR GROWTH IN INSURANCE IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION

The Pacific Rim, which in 1993 had insurance premiums of
about
$375.8 billion, has the greatest potential for insurance
market
growth of all regions in the world, according to a new report
on
insurance in emerging markets, published by Datamonitor
International.

China alone represents about one-quarter of the world's
population
but ranks 25th in terms of premium income. Its premium growth
rate
is about 30 percent a year and it currently has a per capita
premium income of just $3, compared with per capita premiums
of
about $473 in Taiwan. China is typical of the markets in the
region that combine high premium income growth with very low
insurance penetration.

The combination has started to tempt multinational insurers
who
realize that a rapidly growing, but immature market adds up
to
untapped opportunity.

Other countries with high market potential, such as India and
the
Philippines, have really not started to grow yet. India will
shortly privatize its entire insurance industry, which should
create competition-based growth that will start to release
the
market's potential.

Currently, Japan's insurance industry dwarfs its Pacific Rim
neighbors. It is now the second-largest insurance industry in
the
world. Insurance companies have successfully adapted western
methods to suit the Japanese taste for investment. Even car
insurance often has a built-in investment element.

Japan's insurance industry registered an increase of 1.4
percent
between 1992 and 1993, compared with South Korea's growth in
the
same time period of 8.5 percent. Between 1991 and 1992, South
Korea's insurance industry grew even faster at 18 percent.

According to data from the Japan Institute of Life Insurance,
annuity policies in Japan have grown as worries about the
National
Pension Fund have grown. In 1994, 95 percent of Japanese
households had life insurance. Annuity policies have been
especially popular among the young who are worrying about
their
eventual retirement. Among all households, ownership of
annuities
rose 7.6 percentage points between 1991 and 1994, while they
rose
from 9 percent to 24.6 percent among people under age 30.

New life insurance products for women have contributed to the
growth in Japan and women may also be prime targets for
insurance
in emerging markets as more women become contributors to
household
incomes.

ENGLISH LANGUAGE BECOMES A FLASH POINT IN NEW ZEALAND

There may be a market for teaching would-be New Zealand
immigrants
in English.

New Zealand wants to be seen as part of Asia, but it is
scaring
away Asian migrants with a compulsory English-language test,
and
immigrants are risking a more-than-$13,000 bond if they don't
learn English quickly enough.

Asian New Zealanders are unhappy with Wellington's
introduction in
1995 of an English proficiency test for would-be immigrants
which
they feel is targeted mainly at Asians.

Asian migration to New Zealand has increased rapidly in
recent
years. Migrants from North and Southeast Asia comprised
24,000 of
the 50,000 residence visas granted in the past year.

Foreigners who want to migrate to New Zealand must pay a
deposit
that will be lost if they fail to pass the English-language
proficiency exam within a year. They must also pay a $160 fee
for
their residence visas.

Learning English is not a completely academic exercise
because how
you speak English may affect your acceptance in New Zealand.
Uma
Shakti Ba, a student services development officer at Auckland
University says the way immigrants speak English largely
determines how they are treated in New Zealand. "Your accent
plays
a role in how people judge your English ability here. However
well
educated you may be in English, if you have an accent it is
seen
as incorrect. If it is not the English they wish to hear, you
will
be judged as incompetent," she told Inter Press Service.  "I
see
it happen here every day."

Government officials admit that the new language test may
dampen
immigration from some Asian countries, but they say it will
also
affect immigration from non-English-speaking European
countries.

Soo Lee Lim, director of the Auckland Chinese Radio AM 1476,
agrees that many New Zealanders are opposed to Asian
migration,
but she says there is a stronger view that New Zealand should
not
be overpopulated. "On the whole, the Kiwis are broad-minded
people. That's my experience," added Lim who migrated from
Hong
Kong five years ago.

There is, however, a strong feeling within the Asian
community
that New Zealanders should be thankful to Asians and
especially to
Asian money which helped pull New Zealand out of recession.
Asian
investments in New Zealand and the country's exports to Asia
have
risen dramatically since 1991. One-third of the country's
tourists-Qa major foreign exchange earnerQ-come from Asia.
Brunei
invested more than $20 million, for example, in 1993.
Business
experts say they have never seen this kind of wealth coming
into
the country before.

But Lim says small business migrants from Asia find it hard
to
make money here because most local products like fruits and
meats
are controlled by monopolies. "It's not easy for foreigners
to
break into this system," she said. "When we come here we have
to
start from scratch."

She says they would have made more money had they remained in
Hong
Kong. Most business migrants coming here are not from the
very
rich segment, but from the upper middle class. Typically they
are
in their 40s, and they are seeking a quiet life and a less-
pressured school environment for their children.

Migrants from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Malaysia are mostly
newly
rich who tend to show their wealth by dressing well, driving
sleek
cars, and buying big houses. "It attracts some jealousy from
the
local people," Lim said.

New Zealanders have been complaining that Asian business
immigrants are not creating jobs for locals, preferring to
run
small family businesses. "After the past four years, I think
they
are quite disappointed with us," says Lim, and business
monopolies
and communication barriers don't help either.

"Given 10 to 20 years, after we are familiar with the system
and
the customs, I'm sure we'll be able to contribute to this
country," she adds.

GOING OVERSEAS?  HERE'S AN EXCELLENT BUSINESS REFERENCE...

Whether you are hiring native employees, relocating employees
to
another country or trying to get yourself ready for a stint
overseas, a good cultural and business reference book is
invaluable.

Craighead's International Business, Travel and Relocation
Guide to
78 Countries,1996-97 includes a general introduction to each
country, an economic and political overview, sections on
doing
business in the country, money, banking and taxes,
communications
and media, living in the country, health and safety,
preparing for
a trip, arriving and getting around, lodging, dining and
nightlife, leisure activities, and suggested additional
reading.

The three-volume set is useful because the country reports,
though
designed for the business person, also take into
consideration the
family. In the "doing business" chapter, for example, there
are
sections on work ethics, employment conditions, power
structure
and hierarchy, business networking and business services. For
most
countries, there is a commentary especially addressing the
concerns of business women.

For personal consideration, such issues as taxes, housing,
household help, importing pets, and driving conditions and
owning
a car are covered. The guide lists restaurants, cafes,
museums,
and other places that you might wish to take a colleague if
it is
up to you to make the social arrangements.

We were especially happy to see references that we do not see
elsewhere such as information on faith healers in the
Philippines
or the importance of remittances to the economy of that
country.
Again in the report on the Philippines, readers are warned
not to
rent a house or apartment that doesn't already  have a
working
phone line installed. The reason is that installation of a
telephone may take six weeks to six months or longer. You
will
also learn that corporations often use messengers for local
communications because telephone service is so unreliable.

COMMUNIST CHINESE COMBINE HISTORY WITH CAPITALISM

Hoping to capitalize on a domestic audience of well over 1
billion
people, a group of old Chinese revolutionaries is planning a
theme
park to celebrate one of the seminal events of China's
Communist
history.

Known as the "Long March Park of the Red Army" and located on
a
240-acre site in a southwestern Beijing suburb, the park
would
commemorate the trek 60 years ago in which the beleaguered
Communist forces sought to escape annihilation by the
nationalist
government of General Chiang Kai-Shek.

Theme parks are not new to China. Yunnan province in southern
China is home to a multimillion dollar park reflecting
Chinese
society, particularly its varied ethnic minorities, while a
Chinese version of Disneyland, to be funded by overseas
investors,
is reportedly under discussion.

In 1934, besieged Chinese communists led by Mao Zedung broke
a
blockade by the Kuomintang (KMT) nationalist party and
embarked on
a year-long, 6,000-mile escape that became known as the Long
March. Many of the 80,000 men died as they traveled over the
uncompromising terrain. It has gone down as a heroic saga in
Chinese Communist history.

In order to draw crowds and better depict the historical
event,
organizers are seeking to use all the latest technological
and
special effects normally associated with Western-style theme
parks.

The park will include sound and lighting effects, a simulated
firing range, a space observatory, movie theaters, ferris
wheels
and merry-go-rounds, cable cars, and rides on army tanks and
armored personnel carriers, and it would even include China's
first bungee-jumping tower.

"We want to show the Long March events and recreate them to a
scale for the general public," said Liu Chengan, a Communist
Party
official involved in the planning, adding that the park will
have
other attractions in order to draw the crowds.

Tourist developments
With social freedom and money to travel, a growing number of
China's 1.2 billion people are making pilgrimages to
rediscover
the country's revolutionary past. To cash in on the travel
rush,
government officials are converting revolutionary bases into
tourist meccas.

In Hunan province, for example, restaurants and hotels
appeared
to accommodate the tourist influx that accompanied the
celebration
of the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late Party
chairman
Mao Zedong. The main drawing card was Shaoshan, Zedong's
hometown.

In November, China Daily, the official English-language
newspaper,
reported another tourist development in the Jinggang
Mountains on
the border of Hunan and Jianqxi provinces, where Mao and
other
Communist revolutionaries first launched their peasant
uprising
against the Chinese nationalists.

Although such initiatives would have shocked Chinese
officials 20
years ago, no one in today's China is bothered by the idea of
Communism's historic past being a selling point for today's
businessmen.

Planners say that today's young people are so ill-informed
about
and uninterested in recent history that it would be a waste
of
time to try to teach them without the Western-style
packaging.
They say they must combine amusement with education.

Getting funding for the $20 million Long March Park is
proving
difficult.  Planners are unlikely to seek foreign investment
because that would be embarrassing to the government, which
has
not yet confirmed monetary commitment to the park. Planners
had
hoped to break ground in 1995, but have not because of a lack
of
funding.

Organizers also have logistical problems to iron out. Local
officials project that as many as 10,000 visitors a day would
come
to the park even with a $5 entrance fee. But they apparently
don't
know how they would move all those people around the hilly
terrain
and winding roads.

TIANJIN IS AN UNDERDEVELOPED CITY WITH IMMENSE PROMISE

A walk along the Haihe River in downtown Tianjin City is a
surprisingly peaceful affair, especially for China. A few
motorcycles and cars (mostly taxis) cruise the riverside
road, but
overall, the impression is of a sleepy town, not one of
China's
second most important industrial center and container port.

Tianjin is the least known of the three urban centersQ-the
others
are Beijing and Shanghai-Qthat are under direct control of
the
national government. Located 90 miles southeast of Beijing,
Tianjin is often overshadowed by its more important neighbor.
Nevertheless, it has gained a reputation as one of China's
best-
run cities and has become a favorite of several major Western
and
Japanese manufacturers. But Tainjin's development has been
much
quieter than that of splashy Shanghai or powerful Beijing.

This is a conservative city, but one whose foundation and
strategies for the future give it a substance unusual in
free-
flowing, fast-growing urban China.

Tianjin has a population of more than 8.8 million. More than
two-
thirds (5.8 million in 1993) of the population lives in the
city
center and its suburbs. The United Nations estimates the
population of the urban agglomeration at 10.4 million in
1994,
with a projected growth to 17 million by 2015. It ranks 14th
among
the world's largest urban agglomerations.

The city center has a unique flavor, mixing a variety of 19th
century European architecture styles, highlighting its
history as
a treaty port, similar to, yet very different from,
Shanghai.
Shanghai was only a small fishing village until the arrival
of
Westerners. Tianjin has a long history as an important
trading
center in China, in no small part due to its location so
close to
Beijing, yet with easy access to both inland and port
navigation
routes.

The municipality encompasses 11,305 sq. km. and includes five
rural counties in addition to urban center and suburbs.  It
is
China's third-largest city and a major hub with some of the
best
transportation links in the country. It is also a pleasant
city,
with more than one hundred parks, both large and small.

Per capita living space is small at 6.9 sq. m. The city
endured a
highly destructive earthquake in 1976 (in Tangshan) that
closed it
for a couple of years and forced the reconstruction of a
substantial amount of its housing. All households have
running
water, but hot water availability is small. Use of household
gas
is high, 89 percent in 1993, compared with 86 percent in
Beijing.

The municipality's economy is one of China's largest, with a
Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) of 53 billion yuan in 1993.  The
economy is
centered on automobiles, electronics, and chemicals. The city
has
one of China's largest automobile manufacturing industries,
built
in conjunction with Japanese automakers, and has been on the
cutting edge of telecommunications production under the
leadership
of companies such as Motorola.

Tianjin was one of the first cities to set up a Foreign
Investment
Office and a Foreign Services Center. This city is expected
to
emerge as an "export center," although until the last few
years,
imports exceeded exports. Nevertheless, with the high-quality
leadership of its former mayor, Li Ruihuan, the city began to
develop its status as a forward-thinking, yet conservative,
economic center.

Growth has been consistent and not insubstantial, and Tianjin
has
become a favorite of foreign investors. However, the city
still
possesses a surprisingly underdeveloped consumer market.

Tianjin Consumers
Tianjin's residents' quality of life lags somewhat behind
that of
residents in China's other major coastal cities (Beijing,
Shanghai, and Guangzhou). Per capita GDP in 1993 was 6,075
yuan,
70 percent of Beijing's and only one-half that of Shanghai
and
Guangzhou. Overall, however, the standard of living is higher
than
in the nation as a whole, with residents consuming 42 percent
more
than the national average.

Consumption patterns
Expenditures on all major categories of goods have increased
substantially since 1990. Expenditures on food increased 51
percent from 1990 to 1993. Even more importantly, the desire
for
diversity, edibility, and convenience has been growing among
Tianjin's consumers.

Food consumption represents over 54 percent of all living
expenditures, a larger share than in the nation as a whole.
Tianjin is a meat-eating city, with larger-han-average
consumption of beef and lamb which, to a degree, reflects the
eating traditions of the region. As a proportion of total
expenditures, sugar consumption is less than in Shanghai and
Beijing, but more is spent on other flavorings.

Vegetable consumption has not increased substantially in the
last
several years, but according to a 1991 consumer survey, the
supply
and variety of vegetables have increased.  Tianjin has been
an
active participant in the "vegetable basket" project,
designed to
provide ample supplies of food, especially vegetables, for
urban
dwellers.

The 1991 consumer survey also suggested that 61 percent of
Tianjin's residents are concerned with nutritional values.
Only 11
percent, however, were interested in specialty products,
brand
names, and delicacies. Current figures for these items are no
doubt significantly higher, as imports and processed foods
have
become increasingly available. Now the supermarket sections
of
department stores are filled with a variety of Chinese and
Western
snacks and sweets, and these store sections are jammed with
customers.

Western retailing in the city has lagged significantly behind
foreign investment in the city.  The main shopping streets of
Tianjin are narrow and filled with a variety of small shops,
restaurants, ice cream stores, and only one major modern
department store. Although situated just a few blocks from
the
quiet riverfront, these streets are busy. The ambiance is
more
traditional here than in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.
With
few high-profile non-Chinese retailers, the retail district
reflects the traditional preference for localizing individual
product lines along streets. Thus, off the main shopping
street,
one can find the flower street, the wedding street, and most
importantly, several centers for textiles.

Tianjin remains an important textile center, and 18 percent
of
total retail purchases were for clothing in 1993.  Not
surprisingly, Tianjiners prefer conservative styles. Clothes
tend
to be modern, tailored, yet comfortable. Fashion trends do
not
drive clothing purchases in the way they do in Shanghai or
Guangzhou, but quality is important.

Consumers in Tianjin are often considered by market
researchers
and retailers as a subset of the Beijing market, in spite of
its
own long consumer tradition, dating back to its years as a
treaty
port.  It is large enough, and important enough, to be
considered
in its own right.

A LIFESTYLE ENTERPRISE
The first, and still only, non-Chinese department store was
opened
by Isetan (a Japanese retailer) in 1993.  Isetan Tianjin
adjusted
its product lines and price points to accommodate the lower
incomes and preferences of local residents.

Located next to the main train station across the river from
downtown, yet within walking distance of the city center,
this
store has not been constricted by the narrow streets and
limited
retail space on the other side of the river.  It is thus able
to
carry a wider range of goods in various price ranges. Isetan
still
caters primarily, though not exclusively, to high-middle-
income
earners. Nevertheless with its location, size, and diversity,
this
store has become what the company describes as a "lifestyle
enterprise" for Tianjin.

Ownership of major consumer durables compares favorably with
both
Beijing and Shanghai. In 1993, for every 100 households,
there
were 77 sewing machines, 89 refrigerators, and 43 stereo
recorders. Ownership of other consumer goods, such as VCRs,
stereo
systems, and computer games was less, but still substantial,
and
conforms to the phases of distribution in household income
defined
in the consumer survey. Household electrical appliances and
durable goods were the first phase, gold jewelry and
cosmetics
were the second phase, and interior decorating materials and
small
household appliances were the third phase.

Consumerism may not have overwhelmed this city quite yet, but
its
components are clearly expanding. Television ownership is at
almost 100 percent of households, and the shrinking of book
and
magazine readership reflects trends underway nationally.
According
to one estimate, one favorite television program in Tianjin,
aired
during the lunch hour, is watched by almost three-quarters of
the
residents.

Similarly, in the last two to three years, expanding
telecommunications has become a central goal of the city,
aided in
no small part by investments of telecommunications giants
such as
Motorola and GE. In 1994, 18 percent of urban residents had a
telephone, and more than one-quarter of households had
installed
phones. During that year the number of lines more than
doubled to
1.1 million. Cellular phones and pagers are becoming
increasingly
important.

Nevertheless, the relatively slow growth of Tianjin's economy
has
both held down the proliferation of high-income earners and
inhibited the consumer explosion seen in the last few years
in
Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou.

However, several economic, political, and demographic
characteristics favor the future of this northeast city and
bode
well for the continued development of its consumer market.

Location and Transportation
Tianjin is on the main Beijing-Shenyang and Beijing-Shanghai
rail
lines and just two hours by train from the capital city.
Travel
between the two cities became even easier in the last three
years
with the opening of the Beijing-Tianjin expressway.

It is Tainjin's port, though, that is the centerpiece of this
city's past and current economic development. The original
port
was on the Haihe River in Tianjin city. Heavy silting forced
it to
be moved 40 miles downstream to Tanggu on the Bo Hai Sea
prior to
World War II. This port, which lies within the municipality's
boundaries, was expanded in 1976 into a major container port.

The Tanggu port had 68 cargo berths in 1993,  of which 37 are
10,000-ton class deep-water channels. In addition, special
berths
for coal, petroleum and ore are currently being built.
Freight
volume has grown at a rate of more than 20 percent annually
in
recent years.

The basic passenger transportation infrastructure within the
city
is only now speeding up.  A short (7.4 km) and simple (trains
ride
on one track) system was built in 1982, and is currently
being
expanded.  The first phase of the upgrade began in 1995.
During
the second phase, the system will be expanded by construction
of
another 4.16 km of subway and 5.17 km of elevated railway.
Due to
be completed by 1999, this is only the first part of the
city's
plan to build a railway network totalling 170 km.

Economic Development
Since 1993, the pace of change in the city has increased.
Now it
is part of what has been described as the "third wave" of
Chinese
development. The first wave included Guangzhou in southern
China,
the second was Shanghai, and the third includes Beijing,
Tianjin,
and the provinces along the Bo Hai [Sea] Rim of northeast
China.
In 1992, the state had announced that Tianjin was to be
developed
as the socialist Hong Kong of North China. The planned
development
included expanding an already existing New Economic and
Technical
Economic Development Zone (TEDA) centered on the port in
Tanggu,
expanding Tianjin's city center into a financial center, and
developing a free trade zone within Tianjin in the next
decade.

TEDA, located in Tanggu, forty miles from the center of
Tianjin,
was cited in a series of economic reports of China's special
economic zones as the best-managed zone in the country. It
encompasses 33 sq. kilometers and has a population of
slightly
more than 227,000. Transportation between the city center and
TEDA
improved substantially with the extension of the Beijing-
Tianjin
Expressway into the zone in 1993, but construction of a
dedicated
road is still a year or so in the future. The zone, which
began
with only 12 joint venture enterprises, has grown
significantly.
By the end of September, 1994, more than 1,400 enterprises
had
located in the zone, with an output value of 100 million
yuan.
The zone has become a favorite of foreign manufacturers, who
find
its investment climate easier to manage than that of Beijing,
Shanghai or Guangzhou.

Names of companies that have invested in the New Tech Zone
read
like a who's who of international businessQcompanies such as
Otis
Elevators, Motorola, Mobil Petroleum, Coca-Cola, IBM, and
AT&T.
TEDA has clearly benefited from the quality of its
administration
and organization.

TEDA administers all aspects of the zone from a single office
with
employees drawn from universities rather than the typically
more
entrenched city authorities. Corruption, rampant in Shanghai
and
Guangzhou, is rare here.

Regulation of the zone has been designed to facilitate
investment.
Land costs have been held to less than one-half those of
Shanghai.
The power supply is consistent, and the government has set up
its
own training facilities as well as made several other
accommodations for zone investors.

Binhai Free Trade Zone and the Tianjin Financial Center
The Binhai free trade zone and the Tianjin financial center
are
designed to reinforce the overall attractiveness to foreign
investors of this city as well as to create a comprehensive
economic center. Binhai Economic Region consists of 2,270 sq.
km.
in the eastern part of Tianjin city. It has a population of
almost
one million residents, of which two-thirds are
"nonagricultural."
Significant investment has been made in this zone in an
effort to
improve its water and power supply, and several other
infrastructure developments are currently underway.

Similarly, plans are underway to create a financial center in
downtown Tianjin.  This center, covering 85,000 sq. meters is
being built with both domestic and foreign funds and is
intended
to become the major cog in a network of foreign and domestic
banking.

Prospects for the Future
Tianjin's potential for growth is substantial.  In addition
to its
strong industrial base, city residents are well-educated, and
it
is home to one of China's premier universities. Its 11.7
percent
illiteracy rate in 1990 was second only to that of Beijing
(11
percent).  Labor mobility is comparatively high, and the
labor
force is well-educated.

In addition, the leadership of Tianjin is sophisticated,
concerned
with both fiscal stability and creating a positive and
flexible
environment for investment.  Combined with a strong
infrastructure, both social and economic, this bodes well for
the
future.

The potential of this city is not going unnoticed in China,
particularly in Beijing. Lower real estate prices (less than
one-
third that of Beijing) have driven some of Beijing's newly
wealthy
residents to purchase homes in the municipality.

Nevertheless, there is a shortage of high-quality office and
living space for foreign investors. However, Tianjin's real-
estate
market has not exploded, unlike the overheated markets of
Beijing,
Shanghai, and Guangzhou, where overbuilding has distorted the
local office-space market.

With the city's solid foundation, excellent transportation,
and
high-quality infrastructure, the future looks bright for
Tianjin.
However, development in this city will likely be without
massive
investment from the central government. Beijing has, instead,
staked its future on the growth of Shanghai and the Yangtse
River
Delta.

Funding growth will have to come from creative planning by
municipal authorities.  Many of these authorities have been
discouraged because they expected that creating a high
quality
economic environment would automatically generate growth.  As
Tianjin's reputation grows, investment will likely increase.
But
in the meantime, Tianjin will remain an important, although
underdeveloped, urban center.

STUDY SHOWS WEALTH MAKES LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN ATTITUDES TOWARD
RELIGION

With the exception of the poorest groups, socioeconomic status
seems to make little difference in how Europeans view the
importance of God in their lives.

A Eurobarometer study among a representative sample of the
population in the 12 countries that were members of the European
Union at the end of 1994 finds that among groups A through E1,
about one-third of respondents say God is important to them. An
equal share say God is not important in their lives. The rest are
somewhere in between.

As we have seen in earlier polls, God seems more important in the
lives of women over age 55 who are less well educated and poorer
than the rest of the population.

Among respondents whose education ended before they were age 16,
48 percent say God is very important in their lives. Among
respondents in the E3--the poorest--socioeconomic group, 56
percent say God is very important in their lives. The younger the
age group, the less likely they are to say that God is important
in their lives.

Catholicism prevails
Roman Catholicism, various Protestant religions, and Greek
Orthodox are still the main religions in Europe among those who
say they "belong" to a religion. Fundamental Muslims constitute
less than 1 percent of the total population.

In France, the United Kingdom, and Luxembourg one percent of
respondents say they belong to the Muslim religion; in the other
nine countries that were part of the European Union at the end of
1994, fewer than one percent make that claim.

One-half of those polled say they belong to the Roman Catholic
religion, with the highest shares in Portugal and Ireland (91
percent), Luxembourg (89 percent), Italy (88 percent), Spain (79
percent), Belgium (67 percent), and France (63 percent).

Nineteen percent of respondents say they belong to a Protestant
religion, with the highest rates in Denmark (72 percent), and the
United Kingdom (44 percent).

The least religious countries are The Netherlands and the eastern
part of Germany. Forty-eight percent of the Dutch say they belong
to no religion, and 69 percent of those living in east Germany
give that response. There is an even split among Catholics and
Protestants in the western part of Germany, with 40 percent saying
they are Catholic and 43 percent saying they are Protestant.
Thirteen percent do not claim a religion.

Greece is the one country which claims a religion not shared by
many others. Ninety-eight percent of respondents say they are
Greek Orthodox. Seven percent of respondents in the Netherlands
also claim that religion.

Does "belonging" mean
being "religious"?
In some countries, there is a strong correlation between belonging
to a particular religion and "seeing oneself as religious."  These
are probably the countries where religion has the most influence
over behavior.

More than 80 percent of respondents in Greece, Italy, and Portugal
say they are religious, compared with 59 percent of respondents in
the 12 countries surveyed. The highest share of those who say they
are religious is in Greece (93 percent).

In the Netherlands, where 48 percent of respondents claim no
religion, 50 percent of respondents say they see themselves are
"religious."

Atheism is highest in France, where 19 percent of respondents say
they are  atheists. Despite the fact that 63 percent of the French
say they belong to the Roman Catholic Church, only 46 percent say
they are religious.

Except for Ireland and Italy, where 12 and 7 percent of
respondents, respectively, say they attend religious services
several times a week, overall about 4 percent of Europeans say
they attend religious services several times a week.

Twenty-two percent overall say they attend once a week, with 64
percent of Irish and 35 percent of Italians saying they attend
services once a week. A recent poll by Gallup found that 42
percent of U.S. respondents said they attended services in the
previous seven days.

Thirteen percent of Europeans overall say they never attend
religious services, with the highest shares in France (21
percent), Belgium (17 percent), and the UK (16 percent.) Fully 15
percent of respondents in Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands
say they never attend religious services.

Despite the fact that 30 percent of eastern Germans say they are
atheist and 33 percent say they are nonreligious, only 9 percent
say they never attend religious services.

CZECHS ARE EUROPE'S CHAMPION BEER DRINKERS

If they gave out gold medals for beer consumption, the Czechs
would win.

In 1994, Czech breweries produced 38.34 million hectoliters of
beer. In the last quarter of 1995, production was running about 1
to 1.5 percent behind production in 1994. The 1995 estimated
annual per capita domestic consumption was 160 liters per person,
ahead of the Germans. In 1994, it was 161 liters per person.

The president of the Czech Association of Breweries, Antonin
Kratochvile, believes that the reasons for the decline in sales
this year were a cooler summer, Slovak government barriers against
the sale of Czech beer, as well as some decline in exports to the
former allies in East and Central Europe. He does not foresee
major changes in the near future and thinks that in the next three
years, domestic beer consumption should remain stable. This means
that growth in beer production and profits will depend on exports.
Kratochvile sees the most promising export potential to the
countries of East and Central Europe as well as to Russia.

In 1995, the Czech beer exports did well in the German, United
Kingdom, and U.S. markets; exports to Russia also grew.  The total
beer exports reached 1.8 million hectoliters. Foreign producers
have made little impact in the Czech market, capturing less than
one-tenth of one percent so far. This apparently has little do to
with prices. The Austrian brewery, Zwettel, offers its beer at the
price of the Czech premium beer, but well-known global brands--
such as HeinekenQ-are up to three times more expensive than local
beers.

Kratochvile does not think that domestic newcomers in the category
of larger breweries have a chance to succeed on the Czech market.
Their numbers have decreased steadily from 104 breweries in 1970
to 79 in 1980, and 71 currently. If foreign brewers want to
participate in the Czech market, he believes they will best do so
in mergers with medium-sized breweries or joint ventures.

Besides the large Czech companies there are also 14
"minibreweries," but their market share taken together is
relatively small. The ten largest breweries together claim a 49.4
percent market share.

GERMANY CONTINUES AS A STRONG CAR MARKET

Among the five largest markets in Europe, Germany was the only one
where sales value of medium-sized passenger cars grew between 1989
and 1994, according to a new report from MarketLine International.
The other growth market worldwide was the United States, which is
the world's largest market for medium passenger cars.

On the basis of a constant 1994 foreign exchange rate, the global
value of medium-sized passenger car sales declined from $194
billion in 1989 to $173.9 billion in 1994, providing an indication
of how tough the auto market has become.

The definition of medium-sized cars is different in Europe and
Japan than in the United States. In the lower-medium group in
Europe and Japan are models such as Rover 200, Renault 19, Ford
Escort, VW Golf, and Toyota Corolla.  Upper-medium cars include
Ford Mondeo, Opel Vectra, Renault Laguna, Peugeot 405, and the BMW
3 series.

In the United States the lower-medium category includes Pontiac
Grand Am, Dodge Spirit, Ford Contour, and Honda Civic. In the
upper-medium category are Honda Accord, Ford Taurus, Nissan
Maxima, and Toyota Camry.

In 1994 nearly 10.4 million medium-sized cars were registered/sold
globally, up 2.8 percent over 1993. Medium-sized car registrations
peaked in 1989 at about 11.9 million. Globally, sales of medium
cars are split almost equally between lower-medium and upper-
medium cars. The table at left shows the number of
registrations/sales of new medium-sized passenger cars in 1994, by
country.

General Motors led the market in 1994 with a 19.5 percent share of
the medium-sized passenger car market. Ford and Toyota took 11.8
percent, and 11.7 percent respectively.  The leading eight
companies account for 76.3 percent of all medium-sized car
registrations globally.

In 1994, the United States had the largest number of dealers
selling medium passenger cars (35,136) and hence the lowest number
of medium car registrations per dealer at 101. Spain has the
fewest dealers selling this size car and the highest registrations
per dealer at 227. MarketLine says this indicates the highly
focused distribution network in Spain.

The medium-car market is forecast to rise 8.7 percent globally
between 1994 and 2000, with Germany expected to overtake Japan as
the second-largest market globally. By 2000, first-time
registrations in Germany are expected to rise to 2.1 million
compared with 1.9 million for Japan. The prediction is based on a
forecast of stronger economic growth in Germany during the period.

RESIDENTS OF PRAGUE MOVE FROM BUSES TO CARS

In the first nine months of 1995, car sales in the Czech Republic
grew nearly 40 percent compared with the same time period in 1994.
In those nine months, 77,985 new cars were sold. In addition,
81,497 used cars were also sold. Both figures include new and used
cars imported from Western Europe.

The most successful car manufacturer was SEAT (the Spanish VW-
owned concern). Ford sold the most small trucks and vans. The
table on page 5 shows the top-ten manufacturers in sales in the
first nine months of 1995.

The penetration of cars in the Czech Republic has grown from 241
cars per 1,000 persons in 1991 to 287 per 1,000 in 1994. In Prague
the growth has been especially dramatic: from 283 per 1,000 in
1991 to 418 per 1,000 in 1994.

The number of people using public transport declined from 4.9
million passengers in 1991 to 4.3 million passengers in 1994, a
decrease of about 12 percent. In some other post-Communist
markets, this drop has been even more dramatic: in Hungary, 25
percent; Poland, 33 percent; and in the former East Germany, 55
percent.

EUROPEANS BELIEVE IN EATING THEIR FRUITS AND VEGGIES

Europeans are getting the message that eating habits may have
something to do with the risk of cancer. A survey by Eurobarometer
(see source, pg. 2) underscores the importance of structuring
messages for foods in a way that is compatible with cultural
context. For example, it is probably easier to promote high-fiber
products as contributing to good health in Ireland, Denmark, the
Netherlands, and Belgium than it is in other markets because
people there believe that high fiber has a good effect on cancer.

When asked the question, "For each of the following, do you think
that eating more of it increases the risk of getting cancer,
decreases it, or has no effect?," responses varied by country.

The Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Belgians are most likely to
believe that alcohol increases the risk of cancer, while the
British, Dutch, Danes, and Irish believe that the consumption of
alcoholic drinks has no effect on the risk of cancer.

Greeks, Italians, and Irish think red meat will increase the risk
of cancer, while the French, Dutch, Danes, and British do not
think it will.

Consumption of salt seems to be the most uniformly agreed-upon
risk factor, with about one-third of citizens of the European
Union seeing salt as increasing the risk of cancer. Twenty-eight
percent of people overall say sugar can increase the risk of
cancer, but 63 percent of the French and Dutch, 62 percent of
Danes, and 59 percent of the British believe it has no effect.

Green vegetables are highly rated by respondents, with 45 percent
overall believing that consumption of them will decrease the risk
of cancer. That view is most prevalent in Ireland, Denmark, and
Spain. Fresh fruit gets similarly high marks.

SIZZLE SLOWS IN THE BRITISH FAST-FOOD MARKET

In 1995, the fast-food market in the United Kingdom increased by 4
percent to GBP5.37 billion, representing about 16 percent of the
total catering market. Market Strategies for Industry (MSI)
forecasts the market to grow by 3 percent in real terms in 1996.
Increase in consumer spending and continued penetration into new
markets are the two main reasons behind the growth forecast.

MSI projects that the UK market for prepared sandwiches will reach
GBP1.92 billion when final turnovers are tallied for 1995. The
sandwich sector is expected to be one of the strongest for the
rest of the decade.  Hamburgers, however, are expected to lose
some of their sizzle for the rest of the decade; that sector's
growth is projected to decline, after about 5 percent growth
between 1994 and 1995.

Pizza and pasta were expected to grow about 3 percent each during
1995.  In the UK, these two sectors have been widely marketed with
discounts, and MSI says the value of the pizza and pasta market is
being restricted because of this marketing strategy.

Fish and chips, the British tradition, was projected to grow only
2 percent during 1995, apparently being put under pressure by the
increased choice in the fast-food market. This sector is expected
to peak in 1997 and then begin a slow decline.  The market for
fried chicken, on the other hand, increased 5 percent to about
GBP347 million in 1995, and is expected to grow at least 2 percent
in 1996.

Chinese and Indian takeaway foods are becoming slightly less
popular, according to the MSI study, increasing in real terms by
only 1 and 2 percent, respectively, which MSI says reflects an
actual decline in sales.  The market for these items is expected
to remain flat in the next year or two and to decline towards the
end of the decade.

DIRECT MARKETING SHOW FINALLY GETS A EUROPEAN CHARACTER

Database marketing and the use of electronic media are the two hot
topics in direct marketing today, not only in the United States,
but in the rest of the world as well.

International Direct Marketing Week, to be held January 24 to 26
in Paris, will give you the European perspective on these issues.

Speakers from Europe, including the managing director and the
marketing director of Germany's Bertelsmann Online, which recently
invested in America Online, will comment on topics such as
"integrating the electronic media into a commercial strategy" and
how to create business relationships via on-line.

A session on the legalities of selling and creating other
transactions on-line will also assist companies that want to sell
via new technologies but also want to respect the laws of the
countries in which they sell.

In the past, this conference and others on direct marketing have
often featured many of the speakers you would hear if you attended
a similar event in the United States. A review of the program for
this year's French event shows virtually no American speakers.
This means a better learning environment for those who are truly
trying to understand the European viewpoint. The event offers the
additional benefit of a large and active trade show, which will
quickly bring you up-to-date on direct-marketing services-Q
including listsQ-in Europe.

BUSINESS TRAVELERS HEAD OFF TO WESTERN EUROPE

Fully 89 percent of U.S. corporate travel managers surveyed by
Runzheimer International say that Western Europe is a primary
business destination for their companies. Seventy-nine percent
said Canada and 75 percent said Asia. Eastern Europe was mentioned
by 57 percent.

The average cost of an international trip is about $3,485,
Runzheimer says, with airline tickets (obviously business class)
accounting for about one-half of that amount.  Hotel rooms average
$170 a night, and car rentals $56 per day.

DIRECTORY OF E. EUROPE AND CIS BUSINESSES HELPS FILL A VOID

So you want to find wholesalers for sporting goods and toys in the
Baltic countries and Eastern Europe? Other than contacting your
competitors to learn the names of their distributors, where can
you start?

One possibility is a directory that covers a wide range of SIC
codes. It's called Major Business Organizations of Eastern Europe
and the Commonwealth of Independent States 1995/96, published in
the United Kingdom by Graham and Whiteside and distributed in the
United States by Gale Research.

Turning to the index based on business activities, by country, you
will find three wholesalers of sporting and recreational goods and
toys and hobby goods in Bulgaria, one in Russia, two in Hungary,
three in Poland, and one each in Romania and Slovakia.

Turning to the actual listing for a company, you find full contact
information, bank references, the number of employees, activities,
and the names of directors and senior managers. In many cases, the
most-recent information on total sales is provided, along with the
date the business was established and the number of its employees,
two indicators of stability. If you already know the name of a
company and need additional information to find out whether it is
a legitimate business, the directory is also an excellent place to
start.

Graham and Whiteside's company directories for many regions of the
world are also available on-line through the Company Intelligence
services of Information Access Company as well as on CD-ROM.

INSURERS LIKE TO KEEP THEIR BRANDS' NAMES IN PUBLIC VIEW

One of five insurance companies in the United Kingdom says that it
would not advertise if its competitors did not do so. Yet,
companies recognize that advertising is their most important
promotional tool in a market that is growing very little and is
highly competitive.

These are some of the findings of new research on the ways that
financial companies in the United Kingdom spend their marketing
dollars.

In auto and homeowners' insurance, direct writers such as
Churchill and Direct Line are battling to attract a larger share
of a finite market. They must advertise continuously to encourage
new customers to contact them. In the life and pensions market,
150 companies are vying for the same customers and are suffering
from consumer distrust following scandals in the sales of personal
pension policies.

A survey of advertising managers in financial services by
Datamonitor found that advertising is their most important
promotional tool, but direct marketing use is expected to increase
by the year 2000. Financial services companies already account for
about 25 percent of the direct mail sent in the UK.

Datamonitor analyst Brian Evans-Jones says that even if direct
marketing increases, advertising would not die out. "Companies
still need to attract new customers before they can hit them with
mailshots. What we will see in the future is advertising and
direct marketing working in harmony: one attracting new customers,
the other dealing with them afterwards."

EDUCATION LEVELS OF EUROPEAN PRINT MEDIA READERS ARE RISING

Results of the sixth Pan-European Survey (PES6) of print media
readers in 14 European countries are in and find that one-third of
print readers now have post-graduate qualifications. The survey,
carried out by Research Services, involves more than 7,000 face-
to-face interviews in 14 countries.

Other general findings of the survey, which monitors readership
for a host of newspapers, newsmagazines, and in-flight magazines
across Europe, are that English-language use is becoming more
prevalent, that educational levels are up among readers, and that
the share of readers who work for multinational organizations is
on the decline.

Specifically, the European Union now has about 125 million
English-speakers. Among PES6 survey respondents, 68 percent use
English and 40 percent use it regularly at work. The survey also
found that 73 percent of respondents now have at least a college
degree, compared with 68 percent in the last survey.

Analysis of PES6 reported in the November issue of Media &
Marketing Europe comments on the differences between the last
survey and this one, as well as some of the problems inherent in
the survey.

BRITISH WOMEN FACE BALANCING ACT

More women are breaking through the "glass ceiling" in the United
Kingdom. At the same time, three-quarters of women still cook the
evening meal in their households. And overall, women suffer higher
levels of stress than 10 years ago.

About 15 percent of women now experience "a lot" or a "great deal"
of stress, with those aged 35 to 54 the most likely to be under
duress, according to a government study, Social Focus on Women.

The study also shows a pattern of growing financial independence
and spending power among British women, accompanied by increased
social status. Despite the positives, women in the UK are
struggling to balance their traditional family roles with growing
opportunities in the outside world.

An explosion of part-time employment has brought increased numbers
of women into the labor force. In 1994, 12 million female
residents of the UK were working. The proportion of economically
active women rose from 37 percent in 1971 to 44 percent last year.
The share of part-time work increased 19 percentage points over
the last decade, to 45 percent of the women who work. About 80
percent of women with part-time work say they do not want a full-
time job, mainly because of family commitments.

About one-half of women believe that a mother should not work
while her children are younger than school age, but about 30
percent consider part-time jobs acceptable for women with pre-
school children, and over 60 percent think they are acceptable for
women with school-age children.

Despite shifts in favor of women in the workplace, women still
have traditional roles in the UK, notwithstanding opinion polls
which show a widespread belief among both sexes that domestic
tasks should be shared.

A 1991 opinion survey cited in the report indicated that both men
and women think cooking the evening meal should be shared equally.
But when asked who actually cooks, 20 percent said that meal
preparation was jointly shared. In 9 percent of households, the
evening meal was prepared by the man. In 70 percent, the woman was
responsible.

With traditional male activities such as repairing household
equipment, 31 percent thought they should be shared equally. In
reality, 82 percent of these tasks were done by men.

Women are waiting longer to get married and to have children,
often because of increased career opportunities. The average age
for a first birth within a marriage rose from 24.8 years in 1971
to 28 years in 1993.

Having children can, however, still have a negative impact on a
woman's career. Many women who have children have less opportunity
for advancement than women who do not take career breaks to bring
up children.

THE EARNINGS GAP
Many women continue to earn less than men in comparable jobs. In
April 1994, for example, one-third of female employees earned
GBP190 (about $300) or less per week compared with 13 percent of
male employees. Conversely, three-quarters of males earned over
GBP230 per week, compared with only one-half of females.

Even so, women now have more money of their own. Almost 75 percent
carried some form of "plastic money" in 1993, with one-third
having a charge credit card.

More are taking on long-term financial responsibilities as well.
The proportion of women holding a mortgage in their own name more
than doubled between 1983 and 1994, to 17 percent, while the share
of men with their own mortgage went up only three percentage
points, to 20 percent, during the same period.

After food and housing, women are most likely to spend their money
on household goods. Compared with men, women spend more on
clothing and considerably less on motoring.

In their leisure time, women are abandoning traditional
activities. Dressmaking, knitting, and needlework, practiced by 48
percent of women 10 years ago, have declined in favor of
participation in the audio-visual revolution. Listening to
records, tapes, and CDs has increased among women from 62 percent
to 75 percent in 10 years.

Virtually all womenQ-99 percentQ-watch television at least once a
month. Satellite television is watched most by women aged 25 to
34. Soap operas, followed closely by drama series, are the most
popular TV programs among women.

Despite television's popularity, women still find time to read.
The share of women who read regularly rose from 61 percent in 1983
to 71 percent in 1994. However, women are less likely than men to
read a national newspaper--54 percent compared with 66 percent.
Instead, magazines enjoy tremendous popularity. Four of five of
the most popular weekly magazines are for women.

Women  also read men's magazines. About 200,000 read the pop music
magazine, The Face, which is aimed mainly at young men, and 30,000
women read Penthouse, which is aimed at the adult male.

About two-thirds of women went to the cinema last year. Young
women are the most regular cinema goers, with 87 percent of those
aged 15 to 24 attending once a year or more.

Alcohol plays an increasing role in women's lives. The share of
heavy drinkers has gone up, with 11 percent drinking more than the
government-set "sensible" level of 14 units of alcohol per week.
Young women aged 16 to 24 drink on average just over seven units
per week--three times more than those aged 65 and over.

Women spend, on average, more of their income on tobacco, and have
been slower to quit smoking than men.

THE ROLE OF MARRIAGE SHIFTS

Inequality among women in the United Kingdom has increased as a
result of greater access to jobs and wealth. The gap between rich
and poor women has been widened by a significant rise in numbers
of "dual earner" couples, according to two studies on incomes and
families by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

A growing number of working women now enjoy prosperity and social
status on a par with their male counterparts. On the other hand,
there is an expanding pool of single and unemployed females unable
to break into the job market. Women who maintain a household with
children are most likely to be in the lowest income bracket, while
two-earner couples are over-represented in the top brackets.

In 1981, male earnings accounted for nearly three-quarters of
total household income. By 1991, this had fallen to two-thirds. In
dual-earner families, the difference is even more marked, with
women who worked full time in 1991 bringing in an average of 42
percent of family income.

THE ROLE OF MARRIAGE CHANGES
The growth in female employment, together with the greater
availability of contraception, has brought couples closer
together, according to the Rowntree Foundation. Yet paradoxically,
there has been a substantial increase in divorce.

There is now  a greater acceptance of premarital sex and
cohabitation. Marriage is seen as a means of enshrining a
relationship rather than as a legal nicety preceding and
legitimizing parenthood.

Far from being the death knell of a traditional institution, this
shift in attitude indicates how much more is expected of marriage,
the Foundation says.

"Marriage is increasingly regarded as an evolving institution," it
concludes. "[Its] modern role is to confer public recognition on
the relationship between two adults whose parenthood may be
neither imminent nor assured."

The Foundation cites a survey which found that people in the
United Kingdom were more likely than in other European Union
countries to regard the primary role of family as "providing love
and affection," rather than "bringing up and educating children."

Marriage, however, is no longer a source of stability. Four out of
ten marriages now end in divorce in the United Kingdom, and the
number of marriages is at its lowest level in 150 years.

GERMANS SHOP FOR FRESHNESS

This is the second part of a two-part series on consumers in
Germany. The first part appeared in the December issue of
Market:Europe and included basic demographic data about the states
in Germany as well as economic, employment, and education
information. To obtain a copy of Part I, call W-Two Publications
at (607) 277-0934.

Germany's retail trade totaled DM 685 billion in 1992. Almost 90
percent of this money was spent in stores, but some DM 78 billion
were not. One out of five retail businesses was not store-based;
these businesses employed almost 10 percent of the 388,000 retail
employees.

Mail-order firms, of which there were 10,000 with about 100,000
employees, accounted for DM 40 billionQ-slightly more than one-
half of this nonstore turnover. The rest flowed through kiosks and
"nonstationary" sales locations.

One of the latter channels is open-air markets, which still play a
significant role in the life of the ever-freshness-conscious
German consumer, who goes shopping almost daily. In the large
cities, these markets are assembled at the crack of dawn on
parking lots or town squares, then moved to another location in
the early afternoon. They travel from borough to borough on a
weekly schedule and typically offer a wide variety of produce,
baked goods, meats, fish, eggs, cheeses, and the all-important
cold cuts, as well as flowers, some clothes, and perhaps baskets
or jewelry.

Another source of competition for Germany's grocery chains is an
increased number of food cooperatives. More than 2,000 are now
operating in the country. Members use their group purchasing power
to buy directly from farmers. Members sometimes work in the
business or pay a membership fee, but they get the advantage of
lower prices and fresher, often organically grown, food.

The market for organic food in Germany is about $2.1 billion, less
than 2 percent of the $176 billion that consumers spent in 1994
for food. Co-ops have a 3 to 5 percent share of the organic
market, according to data published by The Week in Germany.

Germany continues to suffer under the severely restrictive shop
closing time law which, with few exceptions, prohibits
storekeepers from keeping stores open on Saturday afternoons, all
day Sundays, and past 6:30 p.m. during the week. Consumer
dissatisfaction with this tired statute appears finally to have
reached critical mass, however, and changes are discussed ever
more forthrightly in the media and some political circles.

For the time being, the trade unions--the main proponents of
keeping the law as is--still have the upper hand, but their reign
is eroding. Methods used to dodge the regulations include
greengrocers who forget to close on time and bakers who on Sundays
sell only to club members. (As we went to press, the government
had just introduced a legislative initiative that would permit
stores to stay open till 8 p.m. on weekdays as well as on Saturday
afternoons.)

Gas stations, which are for the most part exempt from the law
because they cater to the traveling public, long ago turned into
minimarkets, with the result that, just to pay for gas, one
frequently has to stand in line behind grocery shoppers.

"Airports and train stations have turned into shopping centers
with travel opportunities," writes Stern, Germany's biggest mass
market magazine. In a representative poll, the magazine found that
30 percent of the population want the shop closing time law
stricken entirely, and another 30 percent were in favor of
liberalization. Almost two-thirds were against keeping on the
books the law that prohibits bakers from making fresh rolls on
Sundays.

Bakeries may serve as the perfect example of the unreasonableness
of the trade unions' position. Whereas they oppose a
liberalization of the closing time law ostensibly in part to
safeguard the existence of small and medium-sized enterprises,
three small bakeries go out of business every day. Apparently the
law does little to help them fight the regional superbakeries'
success. The big bakeries are also in favor of liberalization in
order to be able to compete with competitors from neighboring
countries who operate under less-restrictive conditions.

Germans are, by the way, European champions in bread consumption.
Statistically, each German eats 81 kg (178 pounds) bread per year.
Whole grain and rye breads are still predominant, but varieties of
white bread have above-average growth rates.

The recent flat retail sales climate (see Market:Europe June 1995)
shows few signs of improvement. In the first half of 1995, in
nominal terms, retail trade remained stable; in real terms, it
declined by 2 percent.

The retail woes have begun to affect store rents. Except for the
very best addresses, rents for retail space in the downtown areas
of big cities have eroded up to 5 percent, and for the first time
in years, interesting spaces are relatively freely available.

The average store rental in fine downtown locations is about DM
120 per square meter for small locales and DM 83 for large ones.
But there are regional differences and, in general, one can expect
substantially lower rents in eastern and southern towns.

Commercial rentals are, of course, most expensive in the biggest
cities. For a small store expect to pay DM 220 per square meter in
Bremen and Stuttgart, DM 300+ in Dortmund and Essen, and up to DM
400 in the best locations in (West) Berlin, Hamburg, Koln, and
Munchen. Larger storefronts rent for between DM 60 and DM 120 per
square meter less than smaller storefronts.

THE GREEN CONNECTION
Whatever you sell, the green angle is important in Germany, it
seems. Ikea, for example, advertises cups made from recycled
glass. A company called memo, "the supply house for the
environmentally conscious," provocatively asks in one of its print
ads whether the reader is an armchair culprit and offers office
supplies and furnishings "that are good for humans and nature."

Tengelmann-Qa supermarket chain which in 1984 banned turtle soup
and frog's legs from its shelves and now boycotts products from
Norway because of that country's record regarding whales-Q
pioneered the ban on detergents containing phosphates (now
nationally accepted) and declines to stock PVC beverage
containers, chlorine-bleached paper products, and one-way pens and
tableware, among other environmentally questionable products.

Pioneer Tengelmann is by no means alone. "The traditional
shopkeeper's credo, according to which trade just offers the goods
and the customer alone decides [what to buy], is losing
importance," wrote Die Zeit, Germany's most respected liberal
weekly. "Merchants want to pursue actively their role as
gatekeeper between producer and consumer."

Hertie, one of the biggest department store chains in the country
and another forerunner of green thinking, removed many nongreen
products from its salesfloor and introduced more environmentally
conscientious packaging. In cooperation with BUND, a respected
environmental organization which tested more than 300 cleaners for
this project, the retail giant introduced a collection of 38
especially environment-friendly household cleaners. Mail-order
giant Otto sells "affordable and environmentally friendly" washing
machines and television sets; competitor Neckermann offers an eco-
fridgeQin conjunction with Greenpeace.

The polling institute Emnid found that 69 percent of shoppers paid
attention to environmental issues. One in five households told the
Federal Office for the Environment that it made substantial
changes to address environmental realities. The Office found that
80 percent of the population think of themselves as
environmentally conscious, and that about two-thirds are willing
to act that wayQ-unless buying green hits the pocketbook too hard.
One in two consumers was not willing to pay more for green
products; most of the rest tolerated a premium of no more than 10
percent.

Ten years after the beginning of the eco-boom, it is no longer
that easy to differentiate a product simply by its greenness. On
the one hand, the driving forces, the consumers, are a bit weary
in face of conflicting claims and an inflation of eco-this and
eco-that, and on the other, German advertising law, which
prohibits comparisons, can make it difficult to position a product
in context. Furthermore, customers expect concrete, understandable
benefits, not fuzzy promises. To that end it is also important
that ecology-mindedness not be confined to a single product;
rather, the entire company must be credibly engaged.

Consumer Credit and Payment Methods
Seven of eight Germans do not have a credit card. One reason for
this low penetration may be that credit cards' usefulness is
limited because they are not nearly as widely accepted as they are
in some other countries. Germans also are a bit wary of the very
concept of disposable credit.

Every-day monetary transactions are made almost exclusively in
cash, and Germans pay bills usually by transfers among financial
institutions. For the payment of recurrent bills, most Germans
have placed orders for automatic deduction from their giro
transfer accounts. Besides regular banks, Postbank AG, one of the
three institutions that emerged from the breakup and privatization
of the government's monolithic Deutsche Bundespost, is a major
player in the giro transfer market.

Meanwhile, the number of bankruptcies continues its three-year
climb. The Federal Statistics Office reported 11,542 insolvencies
in the first five months of 1995, up 15.9 percent from a year
earlier. About one quarter of the total of 2,305 May 1995
bankruptcies were filed in the new Lander; the 1,725 cases in the
west meant an increase of 9.9 percent as compared with May 1994.

Similarly, the number of individuals with overdue debts has risen
by 1 million in the last three years to well over 8 million.
Delinquent debtors do not come exclusively from the socially
weaker stratum of society, but more and more doctors and
pharmacists are unable to meet their obligations, too.

TRAVEL
Are recession, high unemployment, and ever-higher paycheck
deductions finally taking a bite out of German travel habits? It
is too early to tell. Whereas a steadily growing percentage (39
percent in 1992, 40 percent in 1993, and 41 percent in 1994) of
west Germans remain at home, their eastern cousins pick up the
slack and ever-more-frequently use their still relatively new
freedom to see the world.

In 1994, 54 percent of Germans vacationed for five days or more
(1993, 55 percent), and 45 percent (46 percent in 1993) were away
from home for two weeks or more, found a B*A*T Freizeit-
Forschungsinstitut study. East Germans travel for an average of
12.9 days, and west Germans for an average 16.4 days.

One in four vacationers remained in Germany. Fifty-eight percent
of these national tourists were aged 65 and older, and 27 percent
of them were aged 14 to 29.

As always in the last 20 or so years, Spain (11 percent), Italy (8
percent), and Austria (8 percent) were the top-three international
destinations for German vacationers, together drawing more German
travelers than all national tourist destinations together.

The trend to one-person households benefits the tourist business
as, according to the B*A*T study, money that otherwise would be
spent on children, flows into travel. Fifty-six percent of
traveling families, 69 percent of vacationing couples, and 82
percent of singles with Wanderlust could afford an international
trip in 1994.

When asked about their dream destinations, almost one in two
Germans named the Caribbean. Other tropical island paradises such
as the South Sea, Bali, Java, the Maldives, and Hawaii received
frequent mentions. Australia (+12 percentage points in 1994 as
compared with 1991), the Dominican Republic (+9), and South Africa
(+6) are the newest trendy destinations, whereas Florida, Egypt,
and Russia led the pack of destinations rapidly losing attraction.
No doubt the attacks on tourists in each of these markets have
helped to dull their luster for Germans.

In the first half of 1995, overnight stays in German hotels,
motels, and guesthouses with nine or more beds were up 4 percent
as compared with the first six months of 1994. The new Lander and
east Berlin registered a hefty growth rate of 16 percent, whereas
the west saw only a 2 percent increase.

The number of overnights of national guests grew 3 percent to
123.1 million, and the number of overnights of foreigners
rebounded 5 percent to 14.7 million.

Italians (+110,000 overnights/+16 percent), Japanese (+67,000/+13
percent), and citizens of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
(+61,000/+5 percent) led all other nationals with respect to
growth rates. With +38,000/+3 percent, U.S. citizens were in sixth
position. Overnights by visitors from The Netherlands, however,
who constitute the single-largest group of visitors to Germany by
country of origin, declined by 6,500, or 0.3 percent.

Media and Advertising
Newspapers are Germany' most important advertising medium; they
attracted 31 percent (slightly more than DM 10 billion) of all
advertising spending in 1994. The 420 daily newspapers publishing
in the fourth quarter of 1994 sold over 30 million copies per
issue, two-thirds of them to subscribers. The 32 weeklies sold
more than 2 million copies each week, but saw their advertising
revenue shrink to DM 416 million (minus 7.7 percent) as compared
with 1993. Advertising spending on supplements decreased 4.8
percent to just under DM 270 million.

Magazines, which garnered 3.3 billion advertising deutschmarks in
1994 (+2.8 percent compared with a weak 1993), numbered just over
700 and sold a cumulative 123 million copies per issue in the
fourth quarter of 1994; the 963 journals sold 17.3 million copies
per issue and earned DM 2.2 billion (+1.0 percent) through
advertising. (All figures take into account only titles that are
accredited with IVW, an industry watchdog that verifies print
media distribution and, since 1994, radio and TV advertising spot
broadcasts.)

Television is the second-largest advertising medium, commanding 17
percent of the entire advertising pie. Its 1994 advertising income
was DM 5.6 billion, an increase of 16.6 percent compared with 1993
and four times as much as 10 years ago. Almost 90 percent of these
advertising deutschmarks (up from 70 percent in 1992 and 14
percent in 1988) flowed in the coffers of private TV stations.

Presently home-shopping programs are limited by law to a maximum
of one hour per channel per day, but the industry hopes that the
1996 broadcast treaty will eliminate this barrier. Home Order
Television (H.O.T.), a joint venture of a television channel and a
mail order company, began a pilot project in October, and QVC and
the Swedish Kinnevik are reportedly poised to beam their programs
into German homes.

In 1994, Germans registered 32.3 million television sets and 36.2
million radios. The fee attached to this household-based mandatory
registration finances the "public-legal" media, which until 10
years ago were the only players on German airwaves.

Of the 37.4 million reception points (households, workplaces, and
lodgings), 23.2 million (62.0 percent) were wired for cable in
1994, and 14.6 million (39.2 percent of total) were actually
hooked up to cable reception. Cable penetration was highest in the
three city Lander (Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen), where it was 55
percent and higher. Other western states averaged around 40
percent of cable hookup, while eastern Lander fell between 12 and
25 percent of reception points actually being hooked up.
(Anecdotally, it seems that everyone not hooked up has a satellite
dish on the balcony.)

One television channel's study showed that people in east and west
differed markedly in their TV-viewing habits. People aged 14 and
older in the east spent 212 minutes daily in front of the
television set compared with 183 minutes in the west. This
imbalance reverses itself as late in the day as 10:30 p.m., when
west Germans become more likely to watch than east Germans. West
Germans find information, variety and entertainment shows, and
domestic police dramas more interesting than do their eastern
cousins, whereas the latter are especially fond of game shows,
infotainment, and U.S.-made police dramas.

With DM 1.1 billion (+12.9 percent) in 1994, radio earns three
percent of the advertising deutschmark. 1994 was the first year
that private radio stations pulled in more advertising money than
the 'public-legal' stations, whose advertising income shrank 10.4
percent from a year earlier to DM 492 million (43 percent of total
advertising spending on radio). Private radio's income jumped 41
percent to DM 643 million.

Advertisers spent DM 276 million in the 3,718 movie houses in
1994, up 5.9 percent compared with 1993. Even though 1993 was a
banner year with movie ticket sales surpassing all expectations
(+23.2 percent over 1992), the number of tickets sold in 1994 was
up again to 132.8 million (+1.8 percent). Multiplex theaters are
relatively new in Germany and they are doing well at drawing
advertising. Even though there were only 13 such centers in
Germany in 1994 (another 15 to 20 are in the concrete planning
phase), they had a 13 percent share of movie house advertising
expenditures.

The age distribution of the movie-going public is as follows: 24
percent are aged 14 to 19, 47 percent are aged 20 to 29, 16
percent aged 30 to 39, and 13 percent aged 40 or older. There are
slightly more female than male moviegoers in the age groups 14 to
19 and 40 and older. The group aged 14 to 19 represents 6.9
percent of the population but constitutes 15.2 percent of
moviegoers. They are the only age group that is overrepresented.

Total investment into direct-mail advertising was estimated at DM
11.2 billion for 1994; postage alone accumulated to DM 4.5
billion. In that year Deutsche Post AG, the private successor of
the erstwhile Deutsche Bundespost, which also included what became
Deutsche Telekom AG and the aforementioned Postbank AG, delivered
4.6 billion pieces of "infomail" (mass advertising addressed to
specific patrons) and 1.9 billion pieces of "mail drop shipments"
(unaddressed material delivered to every household on the route).

Closing
Five years after unification people still have to come to grips
with the costs. For westerners these costs are real and
immediately reflected in their monetary and job security concerns;
for easterners costs include widespread unemployment and a
lingering second-class citizen status.

Enthusiasm for unification has been steadily waning in polls;
perhaps it is being replaced by acceptance of and arrangement with
reality, however.

The rugged German economy seems to weather the giant sucking sound
of the eastern vacuum, and polls consistently show that the
present federal government enjoys broad popular support. To this
reporter such voter confidence would seem to indicate that,
despite all the pains and hardships unification has brought, the
German people in the final analysis say, "We can live with thisQ
somehow." The continued strength of the deutschmark seems to
indicate that indeed they can.

NEW MEASURE FOR INDENTIFYING LATIN AMERICAN CONSUMER SEGMENTS

Identifying appropriate consumer segments for specific products
and services is not always an easy thing to do in Latin America.
In these emerging markets, consumers' tastes and purchasing power
can differ widely from country to country, and even from city to
city within a country.

Enter the Socioeconomic Allocator  (SEA), a measure of consumer
socioeconomic status developed by The Gallup Organization, Miami,
Florida. SEA measures variables of occupation, education, type of
building material of the home, and ownership of an automobile and
selected durable goods.

Gallup's study identifies eight distinct consumer segments within
the Latin American population. These segments fall into the three
categories of upper class--emerging professional elite and
traditional elite; middle class--progressive upper middle, self-
made middle, skilled middle, and self-skilled middle; and working
class--industrial working class and struggling working class.
Following are descriptions of one segment each of the upper, the
middle, and the working class.

*UPPER: Of the two upper socioeconomic segments identified by
Gallup's SEA, the emerging professional elite accounts for 14
percent of the total sample population.

This group is highly educated--51 percent has graduated from
university or technical college. They are employed in top-level
executive and professional occupations. Surprisingly, this segment
is very young--65 percent are under 40 years old, and single--45
percent.

These consumers are most likely to own the durable goods that
represent the good life. Over 90 percent own a VCR, color
television set, automobile, washing machine, and vacuum cleaner.
Eighty-nine percent own a credit card.

When it comes to new products or services, this is the market to
target. Thirty-two percent of the members of this segment own
cellular phones.

Entertainment is another big spending category for this group--
over 60 percent list dining, dancing, and going to the movies
among their interests; 48 percent are interested in buying
records. Although sports do not rank high on their list of
activities, 26 percent express interest in swimming, 18 percent in
tennis, and 17 percent in boxing.

*MIDDLE: The self-made middle class (11 percent of the total
population) has the most buying power. Higher education is not a
key factor in the success of this group. None of the members of
this segment has any schooling beyond the secondary level; the
majority completed only primary school.

Instead, the members of this group built their way to success
through entrepre-neurial skills, as is evident in their relatively
older age--40 percent are over age 40.

Of the four middle-class segments, this group has the highest
level of ownership of credit cards--46 percent--and automobiles--
81 percent. Household appliances such as a vacuum cleaner and
washing machine are more common among this segment, and the
presence of air conditioning is more likely.

Sixty-one percent of these consumers express interest in
activities with their children. This translates into a market for
children's toys and clothes. This group also likes to shop for
small electronic appliances.

For entertainment, nearly 60 percent like dining, 48 percent like
going to the movies, and 45 percent like driving. When it comes to
sports, 51 percent prefer soccer, but 23 percent named swimming
and 21 percent boxing.

Religious activities are also important  to this group, as
reported by 46 percent.

It's important to note that although the progressive upper-middle-
class and the skilled-middle-class segments do not currently have
the purchasing power of the self-made middle class, they do
reflect the growing trend in Latin America of greater emphasis on
extended education.

*WORKING: The industrial working class represents the better
consumer market of the two working-class segments. Half of this
segment is between the ages of 20 and 39, and one- third are age
40 and older. Fifty-seven percent are married.

Extended education is not the norm for this group. Only 16 percent
has more than a secondary education.  Twenty-four percent has a
secondary school education, and 29 percent only a primary
education.

While 92 percent own color TV sets, listening to the radio is as
popular as watching television. Nearly half enjoy going to the
movies, but going shopping, especially for clothes and jewelry,
are favorite pastimes with well over half of this group, as are
decorating and cleaning the house.

Religious activities figure prominently in the lives of this
segment. Eighteen percent also mention interest in keeping a
personal diary, the highest share of all eight segments.

FREQUENT FLIER PROGRAM TAKES FLIGHT

With the wave of privatization of government-owned companies
sweeping Latin America during the 1990s, many Latin American
airlines were launched into open markets. In order to compete more
effectively--especially with large United States' airlines--and to
attract frequent travelers, several airlines joined together to
create LatinPass, a frequent-flyer program. By banding together,
these airlines can offer travelers service and frequent flier
miles to more Latin American gateways and flights between the
United States, Canada, and Latin America than any one U.S. airline
can offer.

LatinPass started in January 1995 with 14 South and Central
American airlines and U.S. Air as participating members. The
company's processing center in Miami, Florida, handles enrollment
for all LatinPass frequent fliers living outside Latin America. To
avoid duplication of miles, LatinPass keeps a database of the
frequent-flier programs for each of the participating airlines

LatinPass has invited Caribbean airlines to join, and  BWIA of
Trinidad, APA of the Dominican Republic, and Air Aruba are
currently negotiating agreements with the program. Eventually,
LatinPass hopes to expand to include all Latin American airlines
that fly into the United States and to expand participation to
European and Asian airlines flying into Latin America as well.

Hertz and Avis car rentals, Diners Club International charge card,
and Radisson Hotels currently participate in LatinPass. Avis and
Radisson offer miles at any of their Latin American, Caribbean,
North American, and European outlets.

Mariott Resorts International is expected to join in the near
future. AT&T is also negotiating membership with plans to offer
miles for points in their True Rewards program as well as to
develop a co-branded calling card.

WINES LOSE OUT IN THE ALCOHOLIC DRINK MARKET

The market for alcoholic drinks in Latin America increased 11
percent over the 1990s, but beer is clearly the alcoholic
beverage of choice in the region. In 1994, beer accounted for 80
percent of the sales volume of alcoholic drinks for the major
Latin American markets, according to Euromonitor International.
Wines and spirits accounted for the other 20 percent.

Beer sales are generally driven by demographics. Men aged 18 to 24
are traditionally the big beer market, and that age group is still
growing in Latin America; but young Latin American women are
drinking beer as well. In addition, the region's young adults tend
to use beer as much as a thirst quencher as an alcoholic beverage.
Other factors influencing beer sales are the region's rising
disposable incomes, increased advertising, and beer's low price
compared with other alcoholic drinks. While the alcoholic drinks
market will continue to grow through the rest of the decade, beer
sales will gain even more of the market share--83 percent by
Euromonitor's estimates.

Per-capita consumption of beer varies by country. Venezuela, for
example, averaged 78 liters per capita in 1994, the highest in the
region despite its relatively small population size. Mexico's
large population, on the other hand, consumed only 36 liters per
capita that same year.

When it comes to volume, Brazil and Mexico are the leaders, with
sales of 5,994 million liters and 4,207 million liters,
respectively, in 1994. These two countries will continue to
dominate the market in sales volume through the rest of the
decade--not surprising, given their large populations. As for
ranking in the global beer market, two Latin American countries
are among the top ten--Mexico ranks 7th and Venezuela 8th.
Colombia ranks 14th.

There are some niche markets within the overall beer market. Dark
beer, for example, is a popular seasonal drink, with the greatest
amount of sales and consumption occurring during the winter
months.

Not only is Latin America a key market for beer consumption, it is
also a key beer producer. Of the twenty largest beer brewers in
the world, six are located in Latin America and account for over
11 percent of the total world beer production.

Even as beer consumption is increasing, the market for other
alcoholic beverages--wines and spirits--is declining. Even in
Chile, where wine has long been a traditional alcoholic drink,
beer sales surpassed wine sales in 1994. Only Argentineans
continue to drink more wine than beer--42 liters to 31 liters per
capita. However, when Latin Americans do order wine, they are
likely to order a better-quality wine. Both these trends--less
wine consumption but of better-quality wine--will continue through
the rest of the decade.

While these trends point to a healthy market for beer sales, don't
be surprised to see a counter trend emerge encouraging less
consumption of alcoholic beverages as awareness and concern about
alcoholism develops.

OPINION POLL HIGHLIGHTS CONCERNS OF LATIN AMERICANS

In June of 1995 the Latinobarometer completed its survey of eight
Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico,
Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

More than 9,000 respondents aged 18 years and older were asked to
identify the main problems their countries face socially,
economically, and politically. A range of economic problems were
identified by respondents--inflation, low salaries, and poverty.
Their responses offer marketers a better picture of the overriding
worries and concerns influencing consumer attitudes and purchasing
behaviors.

In Mexico and Venezuela, 27 percent and 31 percent, respectively,
named inflation as the biggest concern for their country. Twenty
percent of Uruguayans and 18 percent of Chileans were concerned
about low salaries.

Not surprisingly, poverty is viewed as a major problem in several
countries, and was mentioned by 16 percent of respondents in
Paraguay, 13 percent each in Peru and in Chile, and 12 percent in
Brazil.

Despite economic concerns, a significant share of respondents in
Chile and Brazil also put health concerns on the list: 11 percent
in Chile and 19 percent in Brazil.

The 1990s has been a time of major changes in Latin America as
countries shift from closed economies, often tightly controlled by
the military, to open, market-oriented economies with many
formerly government-owned businesses now privatized. Yet, the
Latinobarometer survey shows that, in the minds of the people,
things change slowly. Most Latin Americans still see their
governments, rather than the budding corporate structure, as
wielding the most power. And in some countries, the military is
still seen as more powerful than business.

For example, more than one-half of all respondents in Mexico and
Peru named the government as more powerful than either big
business or the military. This is not surprising in view of the
recent events in those countries, where economic policies and
decisions made by the governments have had an immediate and
dramatic effect on the business environment. In Venezuela and
Brazil responses were more evenly distributed among the three
choices. In Paraguay, 61 percent of respondents said the military
held the most power.

Respondents in Argentina saw things in their country completely
differently. Only 14 percent saw the military as having more power
than either the government or big corporations, but 61 percent
said big business was the most powerful.

Although this was the first Latinobarometer survey in Latin
America, it follows the long tradition of the Eurobarometer in
Europe. For more information on Latinobarometer, see Market:Latin
America February 1996 or contact Hector Casanueva or Marta Lagos,

DON'T OVERLOOK MEXICO'S FOOD MARKET

Despite Mexico's economic problems over the past year, caused by
the devaluation of its peso in late December 1994, the country
offers an unparalleled opportunity for food marketers, reports
PROMAR International, a strategic marketing and business
consultancy. Demand for processed food, which was just beginning
to grow before the peso devaluation, will return, PROMAR
International predicts. This, along with Mexico's growing
population, will make market conditions ideal for processed-food
manufacturers. But in order to be successful, manufacturers must
be willing to enter the market now, and stay in it for the long
term.

Although Mexico's current food chain--production, distribution,
and consumption--is highly fragmented, government economic
policies and market and industry influences will help to
streamline it and make it more efficient.

Demographic factors will also force the system to become more
efficient. More women entering the work force will put a premium
on time and convenience just when disposable income is rising.
Furthermore, the extensive U.S. influence through television and
advertising, as well as the presence of U.S. and multinational
companies operating in the country, will educate the consumer to
more choices in brands, services, and values.

The costs of entering the market now may seem formidable,  but
they are likely to rise over the next few years. PROMAR suggests
that food manufacturers may want to form partnerships with
domestic companies or simply buy a domestic operation.

For more information on the opportunities and challenges offered
by this market, order The Food Market in Mexico: Development After
Devaluation (cost GBP7,500). Contact Zoe Hamilton, Head of

WHERE BRAZILIANS GO, CAN JAPAN BE FAR BEHIND?

Ties between Brazil and Japan are likely to strengthen in the next
century, predicts  Ricardo Sergio de Oliveira, director of the
international division of Banco do Brasil. In an interview with
the Japanese newspaper Nikkei Weekly, Oliveira says the new
century is likely to see a proliferation of business, industrial,
and cultural alliances between the two countries.

Brazil's wealth of natural resources and Japan's technology can
work together to the benefit of both countries. Recently, Japan's
Export-Import Bank provided a loan to finance Japanese exports to
Brazil. In addition, many Japanese companies are making use of
Banco do Brasil's services at its outlets in Tokyo and Hamamatsu.
Although the bank provides loan and deposit services for the
150,000 Brazilians of Japanese nationality living and working in
Japan, nearly one-half of its banking activities come from
Japanese businesses.

Brazil's connections with other Asian countries such as Hong Kong,
Singapore, and China are developing as well. Oliveira sees this as
an extension of the growth and development Brazil will experience
over the next century.

NO PAN-REGIONAL TREND IN LATIN AMERICAN CINEMAS

The global rise of VCR ownership and video movies, and of
satellite and cable television over the past few decades put a
dent in movie audiences. With the introduction of multi-plexes,
which offered better-quality sound and pictures, and provided
bright, modern surroundings, movie attendance started to pick up
again. The early 1990s actually saw a surge in movie attendance in
many parts of the world, especially in some emerging markets in
the Asia-Pacifc region, while in most of the developed countries,
movie attendance continued on a downward slide.

Movie attendance in the seven major markets of Latin America is
mixed, but it has not returned to the level of the mid-1980s.

Film Distribution International: Rights and Markets, a resource
book published by Baskerville Communications Corporation, tracks
the trends in the cinema industry as well as in video movie
rentals, and the penetration of cable, satellite, and pay-TV. The
book provides information on over 50 countries throughout the
world, including the seven major consumer markets in Latin
America: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and
Venezuela.

In Brazil, for example, movie attendance in 1985 was 91 million
but slid slightly to 90 million in 1990. It then climbed to 95
million in 1991 only to drop precipitously in 1992 to 73 million.
In 1994, movie attendance was once again on the rise in Brazil,
reaching 78.5 million by that year's end.

Argentina experienced a similar curve in cinema attendance,
although the levels of attendance in the 1990s were less than half
those of the 1980s. From 52 million in 1985, movie attendance in
1990 dropped to 25 million. Attendance bottomed out in 1991 at
14.7 million, then began a slow climb.  Although numbers for 1994
are not available, by year end 1993, cinema attendance was
definitely on the rise, with 22 million movie-goers recorded for
that year.

On the other hand, cinema attendance in Mexico, Chile, and
Colombia has been steadily declining.

Despite the unpredictable trends in cinema attendance in Latin
America, advertising in cinemas has steadily increased (although
cinema advertising represents only a small portion of overall
advertising in the region). In Argentina, revenues from cinema
advertising were almost five times as much in 1994 as in 1991. In
most of these seven countries, however, the increase in revenues
for cinema advertising is not as high.

AFFORDABLE PRICES, QUICK SERVICE DRIVE FAST-FOOD SALES IN CENTRAL
AMERICA

People in Central America are interested in convenience and
willing to pay for it. Over the past five years, the number of
fast food outlets in Honduras, Guatemala, and Costa Rica has
increased significantly. In El Salvador, new marketing formats
such as convenience stores are a big success. For example, after
adding convenience stores to their gas stations in El Salvador,
Esso Automarkets saw total sales increase 96 percent, with fast
food becoming a best-selling item.

A research study conducted by Panorama Internacional in Central
America indicates that over a period of five years the number of
fast-food outlets in Honduras tripled while the number in
Guatemala doubled. According to this study, Central Americans like
pizza, hamburgers, and fried chicken much in the same way that
Americans do. And the success of fast food in this region is due
to the same factors that make it successful up northQfast service
and a variety of food alternatives at affordable prices.

Both multinational and local companies compete in Central
America's fast-food market. Pizza Hut, McDonald's, and Burger King
are the dominant multinational companies. Together they account
for 78 percent of the fast-food outlets in Costa Rica and for 21
percent of fast-food outlets in Guatemala. In Honduras,  Pizza Hut
and Burger King account for 36 percent of the fast-food outlets.
Other multinational fast food companies competing in Guatemala,
Costa Rica, and Honduras include Wendy's, Taco Bell, Domino's
Pizza, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Subway, and Wimpy's.

As for local companies, there are at least 12 large companies in
those three countries, of which Pollos Campero and Bigos are the
most important competitors in terms of number of outlets. Pollos
Campero is present in Guatemala and Honduras, with 38 and 6
outlets, respectively, and Bigos is an Honduras-based company with
11 outlets.

Fast-food competition is greatest in Guatemala and least in Costa
Rica, where there are only seven companies with a total of 63
fast-food outlets. Honduras has nine companies with 83 outlets,
and Guatemala's 173 outlets are owned by just 15 companies, 8 of
which are local companies.

According to Panorama Internacional, multinational companies
target the middle-to-high-income consumer, while local companies
focus more on the mass market.

Menus offered by local fast-food companies revolve around local
tastes and preferences, while multinational companies tend to
stick to their menus offered worldwide. However, some of the more-
successful multinationals in Central America have found that
modifying their menus to incorporate local dishes pays off. For
example, gallo pinto, a typical breakfast dish in Costa Rica, is a
popular addition to some fast-food menus.

In addition, some multinationals have adapted marketing strategies
to the local needs of each country's consumers. For example, Pizza
Hut offers the Executive Discount Card, a membership program which
gives employees from participating member companies significant
discounts on meals eaten at Pizza Hut restaurants. Since it is
common practice in many Latin American countries for employers to
subsidize their employees' mid-day meal, this discount plan meets
the needs of employers and employees.

There is no doubt that the fast-food market in Central America is
growing. Those interested in this market will want to assess the
level of competition and the competitors, both multinational and
domestic companies, in each country. In addition, the ability to
be flexible and  to adapt the product to the local tastes of each
country, and to design marketing strategies geared to the needs of
the local market, will go a long way to ensure success in this
fast-growing fast-food market.

JAMAICA: CARIBBEAN POWERHOUSE IN THE MAKING

Jamaica is poised to become a key business market in the
Caribbean. This achievement has come about over the past few years
as a result of the government's commitment to making Jamaica into
a market economy with a strong private sector.

Policies are now in place to spur economic growth and attract both
domestic businesses and foreign investors. Among these policies
are changes in taxes and customs tariffs. Since the election of
prime minister Percival J. Patterson in 1993, many government-
owned businesses have been privatized, including NCB Bank and Air
Jamaica, the national airline. Other privatizations have occured
in airline services, telecommunications, hotels, and sugar and
banana companies. Privatization of the state-owned petroleum
corporation, PETROJAM, and railway, Jamaica Railway Corporation,
is in process.

These changes and the government's commitment solidify larger
changes that have evolved in Jamaica over the past few decades.
Once an agriculture-based economy that relied on exports of sugar
and bananas, Jamaica's economic base has shifted twice--first to
mining and then to services.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, mining of bauxite and alumina
for export replaced agriculture as the major economic activity. In
more recent years, the service sector, including tourism,  has
taken the economic lead, boasting the largest growth.

The service sector now accounts for 55 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP), while the goods-producing sectors--
agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and construction--contribute
only 45 percent of GDP. Between 1990 and 1994, banking and
communications services nearly doubled, and tourism increased
steadily, earning Jamaica the title of top Caribbean destination,
according to International Travel Trade Gazette.

Jamaica's official language is English. The country gained
independence from the United Kingdom in 1962, although its
government structured itself as a parliamentary democracy in the
tradition of the United Kingdom. But intense political party
rivalries within the country since then have overshadowed
Jamaica's government.

Jamaica still faces some problems.  The robust growth experienced
throughout the 1980s slowed in the 1990s to just one percent
annually. The country's dependence on imports and the slow growth
of exports are major problems.

Inflation and currency depreciation also pose problems for
Jamaica, although inflation has seen a steady decline in recent
years. In 1994 inflation was about 27 percent, down from 30
percent in 1993. By the first quarter of 1995, inflation was 3.4
percent, down from 8.1 percent for the same period in 1994. As of
October 195, the Jamaican dollar exchanged at about J$37 to US$1.
Jamaica also has a heavy foreign-debt burden.

Crime is on the rise and, to some extent, has dampened tourist
interest in the country.

RELIANCE ON IMPORTS
Historically, Jamaica's economic structure was organized to
produce industrial raw materials for export while consumer goods
were imported. In recent years, Jamaica has tried to correct this
imbalance but, as yet, the range of goods produced locally is
limited, and imports continue to grow. Exports of goods and
services averaged only 59 percent of GDP in 1994, while imports of
goods and services were 64 percent of GDP during that same year.

Apparel is one export that has seen significant growth in Jamaica.
Since 1989 apparel exports to the United States increased 60
percent, according to LA/C Business Bulletin.

Alumina, bauxite, sugar, and bananas accounted for over 60 percent
of total exports of approximately $1.2 billion in 1994. Jamaica is
the world's third-largest producer of bauxite, which remains the
country's largest export. In 1994, bauxite production reached its
highest level since 1980. Production for 1995 will be considerably
less, however, due to a strike over wages early in the year that
interrupted production at nearly three-fourths of the country's
bauxite refineries.

Sugar and sugar products, bananas, citrus, coffee, cocoa, spices,
and rum have long been Jamaica's major traditional agricultural
exports, but, except for coffee and rum,  their total production
has declined.

Jamaica relies heavily on imports of both consumer goods and
production resources. Total imports exceeded $2.1 billion  in
1994, of which 63 percent were raw materials and intermediate
goods for further processing. The rest are consumer goods, meaning
Jamaica is a good market for all kinds of consumer goods. Most of
Jamaica's imports come from the United States, followed by
Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom, and Canada.

Emigration helps slow growth
Jamaica's population of 2.4 million has grown slowly over the last
few years, at about 1 percent annually. Slow population growth is
due to declining fertility and to emigration.

The total fertility rate (TFR) in 1995 was 2.4 children. The
average TFR for the Caribbean region is 2.9. (Total fertility rate
is the average number of children born to a woman during her
lifetime.) Yet, despite a low fertility rate, Jamaica's population
is young. Thirty-three percent is under the age of 15. In
countries with a large proportion of youth it is unusual to have a
significant share of the population in the older age group. Yet,
in Jamaica, eight percent of the population is over age 65.

The reason for this unusual juxtaposition of young and old
population is the high level of emigration from Jamaica. An
estimated 20,000 young and middle-aged adults leave Jamaica each
year to pursue education or employment in other countries, often
not returning to Jamaica until retirement.

In addition, Jamaica attracts a number of retirees from other
countries who choose to spend their golden years in the Caribbean.
Jamaica's group aged 65 and older, which includes both Jamaican
and foreign retirees, is made up in part of consumers with
comfortable incomes, well-developed consumer tastes, and specific
needs to which marketers can cater.

HOUSEHOLD REMITTANCES ARE IMPORTANT
Jamaica is quite rural. Although urbanization is increasing at
about 1.4 percent a year, only 53 percent of the population
currently lives in urban centers. Somewhat surprisingly, the 1982
census data showed greater numbers of females than males in urban
centers.

Average household size in Jamaica is about 3.8, down from 4.2
persons in the 1982 census.

GDP per capita, a rough estimate of household purchasing power,
was about $1,565 in 1994, although this number is distorted by the
continued depreciation of the Jamaican currency. Actual GDP per
capita has grown by only about $50 since 1989. However, the true
level of disposable income is higher since, in many households,
income is supplemented by remittances sent from family members
living overseas. In fact, remittances sent home to Jamaica have
surged, according to the Economic and Social Survey of Jamaica
1994. Private transfers, the largest share of which is
remittances, reached $214 per head in 1994.

The Jamaican Survey of Living Conditions 1993 shows an average
annual per capita household expenditure of about J$23,408 (US$716
at 1993 rate of exchange), a decline in real terms compared with
1990.

Levels of consumption vary considerably among income groups. The
top 10 percent of income earners spent 12 times more on
consumption than did the bottom 10 percent. Sixty-six percent of
all households spent less than J$8000 (or US$245) per month in
1993.

Consumption expenditures also vary by region. Per capita
expenditure in the Kingston metropolitan area, where 33 percent of
the population lives, exceeded the country average by 31 percent
in 1993. Per capita consumption was lowest in the rural areas,
where 47 percent of the population live.

Spending on food accounts for 54 percent of total consumer
expenditures. Clothing and footwear account for nearly 12 percent
each, and fuel, household supplies, and transportation for
approximately 6 percent each. However, household food consumption
is augmented by home production, from gardens or farms. In fact,
home production accounts for 5 percent of overall food
expenditures. Home production accounts for a larger share of
consumption in rural areas, the food-producing areas. Root crops,
tubers, fruits, vegetables, and poultry are dietary staples.

Although in some Caribbean and Latin American countries it is
common to have well-to-do households side by side with very poor
households, this is not the case in Jamaica. The wealthy and the
not-so-wealthy live in distinct neighborhoods, although in some
areas one drives through the poorer neighborhoods to reach an
affluent neighborhood. Around the Kingston metropolitan area, for
example, many wealthy people live in the hills, middle income
people live in the lower areas, and poor people live in the
flatlands.

CONSUMER MARKET
United States culture has a strong influence on Jamaica's culture.
Jamaica is just an hour's flying time from the United States, and
economic relations between the two countries are centuries old.
The flow of people between the United States and Jamaica further
accounts for this strong influence.

Tourists from the United States account for about 60 percent of
the nearly 1 million annual stopover visitors to Jamaica. Also,
tens of thousands of Jamaicans have migrated to the United States
over the years, and emigres from Jamaica to the United States
typically move back and forth. Jamaican students return after
years of living in the United States, and so do many retired
workers. U.S. goods are also dispersed by hundreds of travelers
returning to Jamaica with large boxes and suitcases brimming with
articles to be sold through informal distribution channels.

U.S. media have perhaps the strongest influence of all. The
Statistical Yearbook 1994, published by UNESCO, reports about 330
thousand television sets licensed or in use in Jamaica during
1992, most tuned to U.S. stations despite the availability of
several hours of local programming. Satellite dishes are
everywhere--on rooftops and dotting the landscape, especially in
the more affluent neighborhoods.

Radio is even more prevalent with over 1 million radio sets in the
country. Three newspapers are published daily and numerous foreign
magazines and newspapers are also available.

All of these media carry advertising for businesses and consumer
goods. Advertising agencies, both local and foreign-owned, abound
in Jamaica. The 1994/95 telephone directory for Greater Kingston
lists 67 advertising agencies and counselors, including
internationally known McCann-Erickson.

Consumer goods, whether imported or domestically produced, are
sold in modern supermarkets and malls, boutiques, and hotel gift
shops. Goods are marketed through billboards, radio and talk
shows, and sponsorships of beauty contests and sports events. U.S.
fast-food chains have franchise outlets in Jamaica, including
Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald's, Burger King, Pizza Hut,
Domino's, and Popeye's.

As in the United States, the use of credit and debit cards is
growing rapidly.

Telephone penetration is increasing, and in 1994 there were nearly
400,000 lines. Use of cellular phones is also increasing rapidly
with the number of cellular phone customers approaching 25,000 in
1995. Fiber optic equipment is speeding communications between
cities and rural areas and facilitating international
communication, making it ever easier and more economical to do
business in Jamaica.

LABOR FORCE
The labor force currently exceeds 1 million workers, about 44
percent of the total population and 68 percent of persons aged 14
and over (the working age in Jamaica). Female labor force
participation rates are high. Forty-one percent of women aged 14
and above are in the labor force, compared with 47 percent of
males. Jamaica's work force is well-educated and highly skilled.
The literacy ate is 98 percent. Nearly one-quarter of the work
force has some education beyond secondary level, according to
Craighead's International, Business, Travel, and Relocation Guide
1996-97, although only 4 percent have actually graduated.
Approximately 6 percent have vocational degrees. Use of
professional titles, such as Doctor or Professor, is considered
good business manners.

Unemployment is a problem in Jamaica, and women and young persons
are the hardest hit. While overall unemployment was 15 percent in
1994, the actual unemployment rate for males was 10 percent and
for females, 22 percent. Worse yet, according to Labor Force
Survey, 48 percent of those unemployed in October 1994 were
workers between the ages of 14 and 24.

Government "downsizing" through privatization accounts for some of
this unemployment--the government work force was cut by over 20
percent. Data from the Statistical Institute of Jamaica shows
employment increasing across all categories, and there has been a
steady increase in jobs in the private sector, especially in
services and in self-employment. But for workers in agriculture
and fishing, jobs are decreasing due to a decline in manufacturing
output and agricultural exports.

Direct labor costs are low by U.S. standards. In 1994, the average
hourly wage of workers in businesses with 10 or more employees was
approximately J$37, or less than $1.15. Wages are generally even
lower in establishments with fewer than 10 employees. Even so,
wages have kept pace with Consumer Price Index increases over the
last few years.

According toLA/C Business Bulletin, the government no longer sets
wage guidelines for the private sector other than the minimum
wage. In 1995, the minimum wage was increased from $J350 to J$500
per week, or from US$10.54 to US$15.05 (with the exchange rate of
J$33.22 per U.S. dollar at that time).

Although Jamaica's work force is literate and skilled, the
government is emphasizing the importance of higher and technical
education to cope with increasing labor market technology.
Despite an otherwise disciplined economic plan with limited
expenditures, the government is allocating about 10 percent of its
total spending in the 1990s to education.

Enrollment at post-secondary institutions, including the
University of the West Indies, has increased despite
implementation of a student cost-sharing plan. As a further
emphasis on the importance of technological training, the College
of Arts, Sciences, and Technology (CAST) was converted into the
University of Technology (Jamaica U Tech). Current enrollment is
over 6,000.

INFRASTRUCTURE
Jamaica has natural harbors, many of which cater to transport and
cruise vessels. There is specialization among the ports, however.
Cruise ships stop at Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, and Port Antonio.
More than 50 percent of all incoming cargo is handled at the Port
of Kingston. Most of the outgoing cargo is loaded at ports other
than Port of Kingston.

Many international shipping lines maintain offices in Jamaica, and
others are represented by various steamship agencies. Over 14
million tons of cargo were transported in and out of Jamaica in
1994. Transshipment cargo--cargo entering the country temporarily
en route to other countries--represented nearly 12 percent of
total cargo movement in 1994 and is growing rapidly.

Air traffic is served by two international airports, one located
near Kingston on the southeast end of the island, the other near
Montego Bay in the northwest. The latter airport serves most of
the tourist resort areas and accounted for two-thirds of passenger
arrivals in 1994. Fifteen foreign airlines fly in and out of
Jamaica, in addition to Air Jamaica.

THE FUTURE
In 1994, Jamaica implemented its National Industrial Policy, a
plan to upgrade the country's infrastructure to better accommodate
increasing economic activity. All ports and airports will be
upgraded, and new port transshipment facilities will be built to
take advantage of the boom in transshipment service. Construction
of a new airport terminal in Montego Bay is already underway.

The 1995-96 fiscal year is the last one during which Jamaica is
covered by an International Monetary Fund borrowing agreement.
Jamaica's economy appears to be stabilizing, although it has grown
only slightly since the start of the decade.

International reserves have grown substantially, and foreign
currency can now be obtained from banks and cambios reducing the
level of black-market activity.

 CHILE: CHILE'S DEAL WITH THE MERCOSUR: BOLIVIA TO FOLLOW?

 Chile finally signed an agreement on commercial association with the 
Mercosur on 25 June. The deal, which effectively makes Chile an associate 
member of the trading bloc, will come into force on 1 October. This deal, 
and the somewhat fudged framework agreement with Bolivia, were driven 
forward by Argentina, which held the rotating six month presidency of the 
Mercosur until the end of June. The presidency for the next term is held by 
Brazil, which is keen on making similar agreements with Colombia and 
Venezuela.

 The Mercosur's agreement with Chile will not make the country a full member 
of the Mercosur and will mean that any future agreements between the 
Mercosur and other countries will have to be agreed by the Mercosur and also 
by Chile (the so-called four plus one formula). The Argentine foreign 
minister, Guido Di Tella, admitted that Chile's position could be seen as an 
intermediate step: he said that the Mercosur would like Chile to have an 
even closer relationship and did not rule out this possibility. The big 
sticking point here though is external tariffs: Chile has a fixed 11% tariff 
while the Mercosur's tariffs range in bands from zero to 20%. 

 The agreement between the Mercosur and Chile runs to 58 articles and 27 
chapters which deal with topics such as commercial and customs arrangements, 
fiscal policy, capital movement and integration of infrastructure. The two 
sides also agreed on a dispute settlement procedure based on a panel of 
experts. Under the terms of the agreement roughly 80% of the trade between 
the Mercosur and Chile will face immediate tariff reductions of 40% and more 
than 90% of the value of the products traded between Chile and the Mercosur 
will be free of tariffs in eight years' time.

 Some products (mostly agricultural, but also carparts) have been excluded 
from the arrangement. In Chile's case these products are meat, edible oil 
and sugar. Chilean production of these products will be protected by tariffs 
for 15 years.  Chile's wheat tariffs will only start to come down after 
eight years, provided that 90% of the rest of the trade between the Mercosur 
and Chile is free of any tariff, as is envisaged. The Chilean wheat market 
will be open to its Mercosur partners from 2014.  

 Sticking points. One of the thorniest issues that had to be resolved before 
the agreement was signed was over rules of origin. The Mercosur's rule is 
that 60% of a product has to be manufactured in the Mercosur area to be 
considered local and therefore eligible to be bought and sold free of 
tariffs in the Mercosur. Chile broadly agreed with this but wanted 
exceptions made for some bottled foods, clothes and printed and computer 
goods coming from Chile.

 Argentina made a concession on textiles and shoes, agreeing that Chilean 
products could enter its market on the same terms as other Chilean products. 

 The two sides have also fudged the issue of whether in future agreements 
the concessions offered to a third country should automatically be offered 
to the other parties to this agreement. The two sides agreed to set up a 
committee to study this. 

 One big attraction of the deal with Chile from the Mercosur's point of view 
is Chilean agreement for the use of its ports to ship Mercosur products to 
the booming markets of East Asia. 

 Bolivia. Di Tella said that the Mercosur and Bolivia had agreed on 
mechanisms covering 80% of the trade between the Mercosur and Bolivia. They 
failed, however, to sort out a deal for the other products. Bolivia wanted 
an asymmetrical deal under which the Mercosur would open its market to 50% 
of Bolivia's exports but Bolivia would only open up to 25% of the Mercosur's 
exports. Bolivia also wanted a special deal on local content: 40% instead of 
the Mercosur's 60%.

 The two sides have now come to an agreement: signing a framework document 
at the end of June that commits them to negotiating a free trade deal within 
90 days. This deal is supposed to come into force on 1 January 1997. 

 According to Alejandro Mayoral, the Argentine foreign trade minister, what 
the Mercosur has done with Chile is sign a framework agreement that will 
allow each Mercosur country to then sort out bilaterally its tariff 
arrangements with Bolivia. This, he pointed out, was very different from 
what had been arranged with Chile, and the framework agreement with Bolivia 
was more likely to be a model for future Mercosur trade agreements with 
Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador, Mayoral said. 

 He argued that this was an extension of the old Aladi (Asociacion 
Latinoamericana de Integracion) system, which grades each country according 
to its economic development and uses this as a basis for fixing trade 
preferences. This means that each country in the Mercosur could have 
different trade arrangements with a third country with tariffs ranging from 
12% to 41%.

 REGION: HELMS BURTON: PREPARING FOR RETALIATION: TO TRY AND HEAD OFF THE US

 So far the US has only been criticised for approving the Helms-Burton law 
which seeks to penalise non-US companies which do business or invest in 
Cuba. The law was even discussed at the recent G7 summit in France: the 
other industrialised countries made it clear to the US that they disagreed 
with the law but agreed to wait a bit longer before they launched a 
concerted protest at an international body such as the World Trade 
Organisation.

 What everybody is waiting for is 15 July. By then President Bill Clinton 
has to decide whether to allow the sanctions envisaged by the Helms-Burton 
Act to be imposed. If he does so, he is likely to trigger a welter of 
reprisals from two of the US's most important trade partners, Canada and 
Mexico.

 The penalties envisaged by the Helms-Burton law (or to give it its proper 
title, The Cuban Liberation and Democratic Solidarity Act) are due to come 
into force from 1 August. Last month the US published details of how it 
would apply these provisions of the Act (the so-called Title III) and a list 
of which companies would be subject to them.

 Blacklist. In accordance with the law, the US warned three companies that 
they were falling foul of the Helms-Burton Act by using assets which were 
claimed by their original US owners. The three companies are Sherritt 
International, a nickel mining company which uses nickel deposits and 
equipment claimed by Freeport MacMoRan; Domos from Mexico and Stet from 
Italy, both of which are developing Cuba's telephone system with assets 
claimed by the US company AT&T. Though these companies have 45 days to 
withdraw from Cuba or face the penalties, they have all said that they will 
not withdraw from Cuba.

 On the other hand Cementos Mexicanos, the world's third largest cement 
company, has bowed to US pressure and told Washington that it will withdraw 
from Cuba. Cemex had already suspended its activities in there as a 
precautionary measure. 

 Around 340 Mexican companies, all with business and investments in Cuba, 
could be affected by the Helms-Burton Act. 

 So far, Mexico has taken a more conciliatory attitude to the Act than 
Canada. Mexico seems determined to go through all the Nafta hoops before it 
starts to take reprisals. Canada, on the other hand, has already prepared 
its retaliatory legislation. It is only using the Nafta mechanisms as a 
back-up. 

 Nafta hoops. Mexico has asked for a meeting of the Free Trade Commission, 
which is composed of the three countries' trade ministers, to discuss the 
issue raised by the Helms-Burton Act. Mexico intends to argue that the 
Helms-Burton Act violates Nafta. Herminio Blanco, the secretario de Comercio 
y Fomento Industrial (Secofi), called for the  meeting under Article 2.007 
of Nafta.

 Canada. Blanco's Canadian counterpart, Arthur Eggleton, has also called for 
a trade ministers' meeting but has already drafted retaliatory action. 
Canada had previously held two bilateral meetings with the US on this issue, 
to no avail.

 Eggleton accused the US of taking aim at its foes but shooting its friends. 
He said Canada was the US's closest ally and that if the US has a 
disagreement with Cuba it should not take it out on Canada.

 Canada's government has drawn up legislation which would allow its citizens 
to sue in Canadian courts to recover any losses caused by Helms-Burton and 
to block the enforcement in Canada of judgments handed down under any 
objectionable foreign law, such as  the Helms-Burton Act. 

 The Canadian legislation is in the  form of an amendment to the Foreign 
Extraterritorial Measures Act. The amendment also raises the maximum fine 
under Fema from Can Dollars 10,000 to US Dollars 1m to match the maximum 
imposed by Helms-Burton.

 The government, which has been criticised for proposing the changes as 
amendments to a current act rather than proposing them to parliament, says 
that the counter-measures will be in place by 1 November. This is the first 
date by which companies could be punished by Helms-Burton. 

 Pre-emptive. The Canadian action is specifically designed to stop President 
Bill Clinton authorising implementation of the penalisation clauses of the 
Helms-Burton Act. The President has the right to impose or suspend the 
provisions of the law according to his view of events in Cuba, though the 
first period of authorisation expires in mid-July.

 Concerns. Both Canada and Mexico are worried that their companies and 
nationals could be punished by the US for doing business with Cuba. The most 
controversial provision of the Helms-Burton Act gives US companies the right 
to sue any company in the world for the losses it claims to have suffered 
from the use of its expropriated assets in Cuba.

 Besides this, the US government also has the right to refuse entry to 
executives (and their families) of companies who trade and invest in Cuba. 
Already the children of some senior executives at Mexican companies with 
extensive businesses in Cuba, have been withdrawn from US universities. 

 Mexican companies trade and invest extensively in Cuba. In 1995 the two 
countries exchanged goods and services worth US Dollars 363m, according to 
Secofi. This was nearly twice as much as in 1994. 

 Mexican argument. Herminio Blanco at Secofi argues that the Helms-Burton 
Act clearly infringes both chapter 11 and chapter 16 of Nafta, which 
enshrine the free circulation of investment, trade and businessmen 
throughout the territory of the three Nafta signatories. 

 Schedule. Under the terms of Nafta, a commission has to be convened within 
10 days of one of the members calling for it. (Both Mexico and Canada have 
done so). The Mexicans lodged their application on 18 June, but the 
commission failed to meet by the beginning of July. Nafta rules stipulate 
that as the next stage a complainant can call for a Nafta panel to be set up 
to consider the issues. This panel, which will be composed of experts and 
officials, has five months to reach a decision.

 Reprisals. Although the Mexican government's line appears to be to exhaust 
Nafta procedures before taking unilateral action, some Mexican senators are 
already preparing retaliatory legislation. Rodolfo Becerril Straffon, a 
member of the ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional and chairman of 
the senate's trade committee, has tabled a draft bill which would penalise 
companies owned by Cuban-Americans which wanted to do business in Mexico. 
Another suggestion is that companies that withdraw from Cuba because of the 
Helms-Burton law should be fined. 

 Becerril Straffon said that the tricky part of such a bill was to ensure 
that it did not lead to further countermeasures by the US against Mexican 
companies trying to do business in the US. The senate has plenty of time to 
come up with a solution, as it is currently in recess and not due to 
reassemble until September. 

 The senate reckons it is in a strong position. It notes that according to 
Secofi, Mexico's imports from the US increased from US Dollars 41.6bn in 
1994 to US Dollars 46.3bn in 1995. 

 Cuba. The island's government is also working hard on ways of getting 
around Helms-Burton, the Cuban minister of foreign investment, Ibrahim 
Ferradaz said. He refused, however, to go into details about what the 
government would (or could) do. He pointed out that the international 
community had objected in very strong terms to the law and the people most 
penalised by it would be US executives wanting to do business in Cuba.

 The minister was speaking during a trip to Europe last month (June) to 
promote Cuba's new free trade zones. Although no zones have yet been 
created, there is legislation in the works to set them up, probably in 
Mariel, Cienfuegos and the area around the airport at Havana. Ferradaz said 
that the legislation would be designed to attract foreign investors and 
create jobs. 

 Regional objections. Apart from Canada and Mexico, the US's closest allies 
in the region reckon that the US has overstepped the mark. Venezuela's 
foreign minister, Miguel Angel Burelli, said that Helms-Burton broke the 
first principle of international law which was that one country could not 
apply its laws to another. He said that Venezuela would continue to do 
business with Cuba and not stop businessmen from travelling there. 

 Burelli noted that the OAS had also asked its legal committee to comment on 
the scope of the Helms-Burton Act. He said that 32 of the 34 members of the 
OAS had voted for the report on the Act. [Dominica was an absentee, while 
the US voted against].

 Honduras was another country to support the OAS report. The foreign 
minister, Delmer Urbizo Panting, said that there were some elements of 
extraterritoriality about the law which needed clarification. 

 Russia: An official close to the Russian foreign minister, Yuri Primakov, 
said that he doubted that the Helms-Burton Act would affect Russia's 
relations with Cuba. 

 Mexico: Three Mexican daily newspapers, La Jornada, El Financiero and 
Excelsior are now free to circulate in Cuba. Currently Excelsior is sending 
about 50 copies a day to the island. The papers are sold for dollars in 
tourist resorts. Other foreign publications on sale in Cuba include Hola, 
Cambio 16 and El Pais from Spain, Le Monde from France and Corriere della 
Sera from Italy. 

 Spain: The right-wing government of prime minister Jose Maria Aznar is 
taking the most pro-US line. Aznar announced that Spain would stop official 
cooperation with the Cuban government. The projects covered by this 
programme are minuscule (the only one still running is for a bakery) but the 
symbolic effects of the suspension are far more significant. The Cuban 
government is fretting that Spain might end a US Dollars 160m credit line 
which insures Spanish exporters to Cuba. Another vulnerable project is the 
Instituto de Cooperacion Iberoamericana which is providing US Dollars 2m to 
help repair one of Havana's aqueducts. 

 Chile: The Chilean government said that seven Chilean companies could be 
vulnerable to the Helms-Burton Act. The bulk of the companies involved have 
made investments in Cuba's citrus industry, though one has invested in the 
shoe industry and another in the tourism sector. The companies involved are: 
Zapatos Dolphin and in the fruit sector Ingelsco, New World Fruit and Pole. 
The three companies with tourism investments are Latinexim, Santa Ana and 
Inmobiliara Santa Cruz. Altogether Chilean companies have invested about US 
Dollars 60m in Cuba.

 The right in Chile alleges a US Dollars 23m credit line to finance Chilean 
humanitarian exports to Cuba from the Banco del Estado de Chile has been 
used to finance newsprint which is used for propaganda.

 REGION: AROUND THE BLOCS

 Mexico: Mexico's trade is becoming even more dominated by its North 
American partners, the official Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia 
e Informatica reports. It noted that despite government efforts to diversify 
the country's trade, the US and Canada accounted for 86% of Mexico's exports 
and supplied 78% of its imports. In the comparable period of 1995 the 
figures were 80% for Mexican exports and 70% for Mexican purchases.

 Mexico's free trade deals with other Latin American countries (Bolivia, 
Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile and Venezuela) are not doing as well. In the 
first quarter of this year only 8% of Mexico's exports went to Latin America 
and only 5% of its imports came from the region. Only Chile, among Mexico's 
regional partners, has seen its exports to Mexico increase between the first 
quarter of 1995 and the first quarter of 1996.

 Overall Mexico's exports in the first quarter were US Dollars 21.9bn and 
its imports were US Dollars 20.3bn. 

 Chile/Mercosur trade: Chile's trade with the Mercosur boomed last year. In 
1995 Chilean exports to the four Mercosur countries were US Dollars 1.77bn. 
This was 157% up on 1994's figure.

 The Mercosur's exports to Chile increased by 154% in 1995 to US Dollars 
2.56bn.

 Chile/Mercosur deal:  President Eduardo Frei has agreed that congress 
should have the right to vote on the trade deal with the Mercosur. 
Previously the government had been unwilling to do this arguing that the 
deal was an extension or modification of existing Aladi arrangements and 
therefore there was no need for congress to become involved. The opposition 
parties had argued that the deal was in fact a treaty and therefore should 
be submitted to congress.

 The foreign minister, Jose Miguel Insulza, said that the President was 
making a goodwill gesture and not setting a precedent.

 EU: The EU's relations with the Mercosur are getting closer. An EU 
commissioner, Miguel Marin, attended the recent Mercosur summit in Argentina 
(at which the deal with Chile was signed) Earlier the EU's (almost 
powerless) parliament agreed a framework trade agreement with the Mercosur. 

 Labour challenge: Three groups from Mexico and the US are protesting over 
alleged labour violations in Mexico. Human Rights Watch/Americas, the 
International Labor Rights Fund and the Mexican Association of Democratic 
lawyers submitted a petition in mid-June to the US National Administration 
Office claiming that the Mexican government has not upheld workers rights 
and in particular has impeded their freedom of association and their legal 
rights of a fair trial and appeal. 

 The case will go a long way to settling whether Nafta can be used to uphold 
Mexican labour rights. The USNAO was set up to respond to violations of the 
North American Agreement on Labour Rights, commonly known as the Nafta side 
agreement on labour.

 In their petition the three groups accuse Mexico's federal conciliation and 
arbitration tribunal of repeatedly violating the labour side agreement in 
its deals with the former union at the fishing ministry.

 According to the petition, the tribunal has prevented members of the 
independent fishing ministry union (the Sindicato Unico de Trabajadores de 
Secretaria de Pesca) from exercising their right of freedom of association 
and to organise a union. This behaviour started in 1995, when the union ws 
replaced by one that was more loyal to the ruling PRI. The tribunal, which 
deals with issues involving public sector employees, used a law that 
prevents government agencies recognising more than one government entity. 
Once the new union was recognised the SUTSP was outlawed. 

 The executive director of Human rights Watch/ Americas, Miguel Vivanco, 
argues that what the tribunal has done falls into a pattern in which the 
laws and structures of pro-government unions in Mexico are used to inhibit 
independent union activity. he said that he hoped Nafta's labour rights' 
side agreement would be strong enough to resolve both the case and the 
fishing ministry's wider problem. 

 The USNAO panel has 60 days to decide whether to take the case. Even if it 
does, it has no powers to force a change or a remedy upon Mexico. The Human 
Rights Watch/America people realise this and say that the true test will be 
how the Mexican government reacts to the findings. 

 The omens are not good. The government failed to act even after the SUTSP 
won some favourable rulings in the Mexican courts.

 On the other hand, the ILO argues that this case is much stronger than 
previous cases dismissed by the USNAO because it focuses on the law than 
restricts the number of unions in federal workplaces. This law is, according 
to Joel Solomon, Human Rights Watch's research director, a clear violation 
of the Nafta side agreement that guarantees that workers can organise unions 
free of government interference. 

 The Mexican counterpart to the USNAO is currently  considering a claim from 
the Mexican telecommunication workers' union which claims that a US company, 
Sprint, closed down a San Francisco office to prevent a unionising effort by 
235 employees. The Mexican NAO has agreed to delay action until the US 
National Labor Relations Board makes its final ruling on the case. 

 Costa Rica-Chile: The two countries have agreed on an investment protection 
deal. The deal will be signed during President Eduardo Frei's visit to Costa 
Rica in July. This has suddenly become important following the purchase of 
the Del Monte fresh fruit company (which has US Dollars 200m worth of 
investments in Costa Rica) by Chilean investors. Chilean companies also have 
important investments in the Costa Rican fertiliser company, Fertica. 

 Mercosur/Textiles: Brazil has agreed not to cut the period for financing 
textile imports from six months to one month. Its Mercosur partners had said 
that this measure would damage their textile exports to Brazil. Brazil has 
also been criticised by Paraguay and Uruguay respectively for blocking 
exports of dairy goods and rice from its two neighbours.

 MEXICO: WHY ZEDILLO MUST PROSECUTE RAUL SALINAS TO BOLSTER LAW AND ORDER

 As we warned last month, President Ernesto Zedillo's run of luck so far 
this year was overdue a reverse. The government has had a bad month: the 
unrest in the south of the country, which we examine in some detail in this 
issue, has been capped by the appearance of the Ejercito Popular 
Revolucionario in Guerrero. Political analysts in Mexico have hinted very 
broadly that the EPR may be a group of agentes provocateurs, set up by the 
authorities to justify a crackdown.

 The yearning for law and order is not confined to the government. Even the 
EPR called for more law and order in its Declaracion de Aguas Blancas: a 
strange demand for a group that is also apparently calling for the overthrow 
of the state.

 Opinion polls in Mexico City show that the rise in crime is the main 
concern. This is why the President's decision to replace Mexico City's 
police chief with a general (who in turn has appointed soldiers to key 
positions) may well be politically astute. 

 Yet establishing the rule of law means, as the ordinary Mexican 
understands, curbing the rule of men. This means that the government has to 
make up its mind about the Salinas brothers. There is growing evidence that 
Raul Salinas de Gortari made money because his brother was President. So far 
the focus of the investigatory efforts, both official and by the media, have 
been on Raul. His brother, and other key people in his entourage, have just 
as many questions to answer. 

 If President Zedillo is serious about reform, unraveling the tangled 
affairs of the Salinas brothers is vital. Raul must be brought to trial. 

 The case will clearly pose a serious problem for the ruling Partido 
Revolucionario Institucional where the Salinas brothers still have large 
numbers of supporters. But Zedillo could turn this to his advantage, using 
the case to separate the party from the government, which is the key 
objective of his political reform programme. 

 Zedillo could also argue that such a dramatic court case, culminating in 
the conviction of Raul, could help the PRI in next year's mid-term 
elections. And the PRI is going to need all the help it can get.

 The economy is still centrifuging: the export companies and the rich are 
doing well but for the domestic economy and the poor life is getting 
tougher. It seems almost inevitable that the US Federal Reserve will start 
to raise short-term US interest rates in the autumn to slow down the US 
economy. Once this happens, Mexican exporters may well start to feel the 
pressure.

 MEXICO: GUERRERO: ANOTHER REVOLT?: OR AGENTES PROVACATEURS

 The government tried to play down the sudden appearance of another 
guerrilla army, the Ejercito Popular Revolucionario, in Guerrero. The 
guerrillas, who appeared to be well-equipped and armed with new guns, made 
their appearance on 28 June at Aguas Blancas, the site of a brutal massacre 
of 17 peasants exactly a year earlier: that massacre and the revelation of 
the ham-fisted attempt by the governor of the state, Ruben Figueroa, to make 
it appear that the peasants were armed, forced his resignation earlier this 
year.

 Upstage. The EPR's sudden appearance upstaged 5,000 other political figures 
who had come to pay homage to the peasants killed in the massacre. Among the 
notables attending the ceremony at Aguas Blancas, was Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, 
the left-wing presidential candidate (and probable victor) in 1988. He was 
clearly surprised by the EPR's appearance and annoyed when they started to 
read a document they called the Declaracion de Aguas Blancas. 

 This declaration appeared to be a justification for the armed struggle. It 
termed the government anti-democratic and committed to protecting the 
interests of foreigners and the business class. The document claimed that, 
against a background of institutionalised violence, the armed struggle was a 
legitimate and necessary means for a people to recover their national 
sovereignty and the rule of law.

 The EPR. The guerrillas themselves numbered about 100, according to those 
at the ceremony. The Secretaria de Gobernacion and the Procuraduria General 
de la Republica were more precise: they said that exactly 38 'armed persons' 
interrupted the ceremony as it was concluding. 

 The guerrillas had their faces hidden with balaclavas and handkerchiefs 
(like the Zapatistas) and were dressed in olive-green military fatigues. 
They were armed with AK-47s, which are known in Mexico as cuernos de chivo 
(goats' horns). 

 The guerrillas laid flowers at the tombs of the massacred peasants before 
reading out their declaration. During the reading of this document, the 
guerrillas claimed that they numbered 500 and were active right across the 
mountains in the south of the state. They said that the organisation had 
arisen after men and women from the oppressed sectors of society had 
realised that they must organise themselves to fight back against their 
exploiters.

 One theme that runs through the declaration is the need for justice. This, 
the EPR reckons, can only be achieved by overthrowing the existing 
government. 

 One significant difference between the EPR and the Zapatistas is that the 
EPR does not make any claims to be speaking for the Indians. The EPR also 
seems to be much more aggressive: it called for the creation of popular 
tribunals to judge enemies of the people. 

 On the evening of 29 June, the EPR (apparently) stopped motorists on the 
highway between Mexico City and Acapulco and gave them copies of the 
Declaracion de Aguas Blancas. This led to a confrontation with the police. 
The guerrillas, according to the police, opened fire on them from a lorry 
which they were using to block the road. Three policemen and one civilian 
were wounded in the exchange of fire before the masked members of the EPR 
escaped. The police say that they found weapons and explosives in the lorry. 

 Government response. Like the PRD, the federal government doubted that the 
EPR was anything more than a publicity stunt. The government said that the 
only subversive groups in the mountains were drug traffickers and criminal 
bands.

 Nevertheless, the federal government sent 3,000 troops and police up into 
the mountains to try and flush out the guerrillas. The government said it 
would ensure that the army took more care than it did in Chiapas, where it 
was used to reclaim territory occupied by the Ejercito Zapatista de la 
Liberacion Nacional in 1994.

 Guerrero, more than Chiapas, has a reputation in Mexico for being the last 
redoubt of guerrilla bands. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the remnants 
of Maoist focos holed up in the mountains. They were only dispersed when 
their ideological leader, professor Lucio Cabanas was killed in December 
1974. Cabanas was the leader of the Partido de los Pobres. 

 Criticism. Unlike the Zapatistas, whose leader subcomandante Marcos 
impressed the middle-classes with his wit and general air of romance, the 
EPR has annoyed the middle classes. One of the most annoyed was Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas, one of the PRD's most senior figures. The EPR's arrival at the 
tombs of the massacred peasants interrupted his eulogy of them. All of the 
murdered peasants had been PRD members. 

 Cardenas and other senior PRD figures at the ceremony left Aguas Blancas 
almost as soon as the guerrillas appeared. Cardenas then issued a fierce 
statement from Mexico City. He called the EPR's appearance a grotesque 
pantomime. He said that the appearance of the group 'disguised as guerrillas 
would have been unimportant if it was not for the fact that they were 
carrying heavy weapons.' He called the 'guerrillas' both 'irresponsible' and 
'provocative'. He accused them of being under the control of those who had 
ordered the killing of the 17 peasants a year earlier. 

 Other politicians as well as NGOs, the Church and businessmen have said 
that an armed uprising is a dead end and that the EPR risks undoing what the 
Zapatistas have achieved. 

 Gonzalo Ituarte, a priest in San Cristobal de la Casas, said that the EPR 
would definitely have an effect on the peace talks between the government 
and the Zapatistas but it is still too early to speculate on what the effect 
will be. 

 Some analysts have even claimed that the EPR is a group of agentes 
provocateurs, set up by the authorities to link the left-wing Partido de la 
Revolucion Democratica to guerrillas and more importantly, head off the 
investigation into who knew what about the cover-up of the massacre at Aguas 
Blancas.

 This scepticism is shared by locals who say that the army has been 
patrolling the mountains for the past couple of years and found traces of 
guerrillas. In Chiapas, it should be remembered, the army found several 
camps six months before the Zapatistas seized San Cristobal and the other 
towns on 1 January 1994. The army, though, thought that the camps were not 
important.

 MEXICO: OAXACA: MORE GUERRILLAS?: PRD CLAIMS

 Hector Sanchez, a PRD senator and a likely candidate for the governorship 
of the state, claims that Oaxaca, a traditionally polarised state, is also 
on the point of revolt. He claimed that there were guerrillas to the south 
and east of the state and in the northern Indian communities there was a 
feeling that the political system had failed them and they needed to resort 
to arms to make their points.

 Sanchez claimed that the state government, headed by Diodoro Carrasco, was 
to blame for letting the situation get out of hand. He said that the 
Oaxquenos are irritated at what is happening in Chiapas, where Indian issues 
are (now) treated delicately.

 Oaxaca, which was the scene of bitter feuds and fighting in the Revolution, 
is still a very Indian state. According to the 1990 census, 40% of the 
state's 3m inhabitants  either speak an Indian language or are dependents of 
a head of a family who is either bi-lingual or a monoglot speaker of an 
Indian language.

 Government. According to the senator, the state government does not realise 
that the state is a tinderbox. He accused the government of not realising 
that the chorus of complaints were about similar things: political 
assassinations, squabbles over the results of elections, crime, the 
hopelessness of the law enforcement agencies, the use of troops in the state 
and the lack of democratic accountability were all part of the same story. 
The state government prefers to view each case as a product of a unique 
circumstance. 

 Carrasco admitted that there had been and there still were social problems 
in the state and pressure for the fight against poverty to be speeded up but 
he flatly denied that any of the agitators on social questions had links to 
armed groups, with political and ideological objectives. 

 The senator claimed, in Proceso, a news magazine, that the heavy handed use 
of troops to try and prevent the Zapatistas establishing their organisation 
in Oaxaca could trigger an uprising. The army, under the pretext of clamping 
down on drug traffickers, has been moving into Indian villages and 
interrogating Indian leaders. The focus of this activity has been in the 
Sierra Sur where hundreds of police and soldiers have been searching for 
Zapatistas.

 Politics. What is clear is that electoral violence (including 
assassination) is on the increase in the state. According to Proceso, there 
have been at least 11 political assassinations in the past six months. In 
April alone first Feliciano Riano Lopez, the president of the Comisariado de 
Bienes Comunales de San Lucas Atoyaquillo and two of his supporters were 
gunned down by a group, presumably hired by local landowners, and then 
Orlando Guerra Guerra, a leader of the local left-wing opposition was killed 
by Mariano Guerra Lopez, the mayor and a member of the ruling Partido 
Revolucionario Institucional.

 MEXICO: CHIAPAS: MASSACRE: IN NORTH OF STATE

 The outbreak of political violence in the north of the state in June has 
left 26 people dead. In the first half of 1996, clashes between the ruling 
Partido Revolucionario Institucional and the opposition Partido de la 
Revolucion Democratica and the Partido de Trabajo have cost 34 lives.

 According to the opposition parties and human rights organisations, the PRI 
is backed by thugs known as guardias blancas. These groups are financed by 
local landowners and politicians and even federal deputies. 

 The violence may be the start of an attack on civil society, said Samuel 
Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas. He is also the president of 
the Comision Nacional de Intermediacion, which is trying to mediate between 
the government and the Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional.

 The people behind the killings, according to the bishop, are being backed 
by the authorities. He said that in several cases where witnesses were 
prepared to testify the authorities refused to act. he said that the 
killings had been responsible for driving 800 peasants from their homes.

 The bishop pointed out that the authorities, instead of acting, preferred 
to blame priests for fomenting the social unrest in the area and even 
sometimes being involved in murder. He also claimed that the authorities 
were using evangelical Christians to try and weaken the support for the 
Roman Catholic Church in the area of conflict. 

 The big problem in the state, besides the Zapatistas, is land. The peasants 
want to use it for subsistence farming while the landowners prefer ranching. 
According to figures from the state government, 80% of the people in the 
area where the killings are most numerous are illiterate and landless. 

 Zapatistas: The government is due to hold another round of talks with the 
Zapatistas on 8 July. This will follow their Foro Especial Para la Reforma 
del Estado, which was scheduled for the first week of July. As a token of 
good faith, the Zapatistas would like the government to release 17 
Zapatistas held in prison and cancel the arrest warrants for other Zapatista 
leaders. The government negotiators, in the form of the Comision de 
Concordia y Pacificacion, are disposed to agree.

 MEXICO: POLITICAL REFORM: PRD PROTESTS OVER TABASCO: AND WITHDRAWS FROM 
political reform talks

 The left-wing Partido de la Revolucion Democratica has withdrawn from the 
political reform debate that is being held in the national congress. The 
PRD's decision, which is more symbolic than practical, came after President 
Ernesto Zedillo made a visit to Roberto Madrazo, the governor of Tabasco on 
25 June. The PRD saw this visit as a gesture of support for Madrazo.

 The government accused the PRD of trying to use the negotiations over 
political reform as a lever to achieve its own political ends. The PRD is 
well aware that the main opposition party scored a success by refusing to 
take part in the negotiations over political reform until the result of an 
election in Huejotzingo, in the backwoods of Puebla, had been resolved in 
its favour. 

 The PRD has accused Madrazo, and produced supporting evidence, of breaking 
the legal limit on how much could be spent on his (successful) election 
campaign in 1994. According to the PRD, Madrazo spent 128m pesos on his 
campaign: at the then prevailing exchange rate that was US Dollars 43m (or 
more than President Bill Clinton spent on his election campaign in 1992). 
The defeated PRD candidate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, said that the 
President's visit to Madrazo was unwise and provocative. Wisely, Lopez 
Obrador chose to spend the day of the President's visit in Monterrey, in 
Nuevo Leon. Lopez Obrador is one of the three candidates to take over from 
Porfirio Munoz Ledo as president of the PRD.

 The PRD has accused Madrazo of taking money from some doubtful sources, as 
well as breaking the law on election spending. In particular, the party has 
accused him of taking US Dollars 4m from Carlos Cabal Peniche, the former 
head of the (now bust) Banco Union-Cremi. Peniche is now on the run, with 
warrants out for his arrest. He has been accused of using his fresh fruit 
business as a front for drug-running.

 Violence. The PRD was also angry at being blamed for the violence that 
accompanied Zedillo's visit. There were riots in the capital Villahermosa 
which left 20 people injured. 

 The riots were at their worst when the President visited the state's 
Procuraduria General de Justicia. The PRD claims that the riots were caused 
by the PRI, which assembled 200 thugs, armed them with machetes and then set 
them loose. The PRD said that the people who caused all the trouble had also 
demonstrated in favour of Roberto Madrazo. The PRD admitted to trying to 
seal off the capital from the rest of the state for the duration of the 
President's visit but claimed that its protest was peaceable. It said that 
the police did nothing to stop its supporters manning the roadblocks from 
being attacked by the Priistas 

 According to the authorities, the PRD's supporters blocked the roads 
leading to Villahermosa and burnt a  bus that was bringing Priistas to a 
rally in the city. The authorities also say that the PRD burnt a lorry as 
well as causing damage to other vehicles. The authorities said that two of 
the PRD's leaders, Julio Cesar Alvarez Santos and Alejandrino Alvarez, were 
leading attacks by PRD supporters on the passengers in the bus. Both men are 
local PRD deputies. The authorities also claimed that another PRD leader, 
the federal deputy, Octavio Romero, was leading another band of Perredistas 
who were blocking the road between Villahermosa and Ciudad del Carmen. 

 The unrest around Villahermosa led to the President cutting short his visit 
and departing from his published schedule. After the President had left, 
somebody threw a petrol bomb at Lopez Obrador's house in Villahermosa. 

 Demand. The PRD has now demanded that the national congress declare Tabasco 
ungovernable and that the current state government should be replaced. What 
the federal PRD deputies are asking is for the national congress to declare 
that the authorities in Tabasco have lost their powers, technically 
desaparicion de poderes. 

 This is a legal term which can only be declared by the federal congress. It 
means that the federal authorities recognise that the state government no 
longer has the legal and political authority to carry out its duties.

 The PRD argues that the state government is no longer in control and that 
the federal authorities must now, as the constitution envisages, step into 
the breach. One PRD leader in the state, Rafael Lopez Cruz, made the barely 
veiled threat that there was a danger of people in Tabasco taking the law 
into their own hands. 

 The PRD pointed out that the day after the President's visit, Priistas had 
stormed the XEVA radio station to broadcast a message of support for 
Madrazo. They added that two days after the President's visit, local Priista 
deputies and officials had attacked Julio Cesar Alvarez Santos, the PRD 
deputy and supposed leader of the demonstrations on the day of the 
President's visit, in the local congress. 

 Federal level. The PRD has also called on the federal Procuraduria General 
to complete its investigation into Madrazo's election expenses. The local 
PRI had tried to claim that the federal authorities had no rights to 
investigate elections in the state, but the supreme court ruled against 
them. The Procuraduria investigation, though, is proceeding slowly.

 The PRD denies that it is playing politics over constitutional reform. The 
head of the party in the lower house, Jesus Ortega, said that the first 
condition for the party's resumption of talks is that the PRI publish its 
final, edited version of its proposals for constitutional reform.

 The second condition was that the main parties should set up a so-called 
mesa de coyuntura which would sort out the politics of introducing the 
reforms. The PRD would be happy for the question of Madrazo's election to be 
settled at the same time. 

 The PRD's third condition for rejoining the discussions is that the 
authorities in Tabasco should abandon their attempt to gaol the Perredistas 
whom they blame for the riots during the President's visit. 

 State of play. The discussions on constitutional reforms are currently 
trying to take on board the proposals made by the Partido Accion Nacional. 
The PAN had withdrawn from the discussions for three months, during which 
the PRI, PRD and the Partido de Trabajo, reached an agreement in April. The 
PAN wanted to get the result of an election in Huejotzingo overturned. 

 After winning its point a month ago, the PAN rejoined the discussions in 
congress. Currently legislators are considering 27 modifications to the 
constitution and a further 80 amendments to other laws. 

 The main change, which is supported by all the parties, is for the 
President and congress to surrender their (dominating) roles in the 
Instituto Federal Electoral. The IFE is in charge of running federal 
elections. The current proposal is that there should be an absolute majority 
of independents on the IFE board and that its president should be chosen by 
at least two thirds of congress. 

 The parties have also agreed that the Tribunal Federal Electoral, which is 
responsible for resolving election disputes, should now be answerable to the 
supreme court rather than the President. 

 A mechanism for the allocation of federal funds for elections was also 
agreed by the two parties: 70% should be awarded according to votes won 
while 30% should be awarded in inverse proportion to votes won. The 
government has also conceded that Mexicans resident abroad should be allowed 
to vote.

 The parties are now trying to find ways of turning these agreements in 
principle into legislation.  

 PAN. After getting its way over Huejotzingo, the PAN is now trying to 
behave in a statesmanlike way. Its president, Felipe Calderon Hinojosa, said 
that the riots in Tabasco did nobody any good.

 The party's secretary general, Juan Antonio Garcia Villa, has accused the 
ruling PRI of deliberately trying to stall the electoral reform programme. 
He accused the PRI of wanting to keep the negotiations deliberately 
ambiguous. The PAN's congressional leader, Ricardo Garcia Cervantes, accused 
the PRI of delaying talks for meetings where no firm proposals were made or 
crazy ideas were floated. 

 Garcia Cervantes pointed out that the politicians were running out of time. 
He said they had to agree on reforms, by the end of this month (July) at the 
very latest. If this did not happen, it was unlikely that the 1997 mid-term 
elections would be held under the new system. 

 The PAN complains that the PRI refuses to distinguish its position from the 
other parties. This, it says, will enable everybody to reach compromises 
that will work.

 MEXICO: THE PRD ELECTION: THREE CANDIDATES: 1.4M VOTERS

 The country's third largest party, the left-wing Partido de la Revolucion 
Democratica is electing its new president on 14 July. The PRD's  1.2m 
members are all entitled to vote in the secret ballot. 

 The three candidates are Heberto Castillo, a veteran senator from Veracruz; 
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the PRD leader in Tabasco and Amalia Garcia, a 
member of the party's national committee.

 Our bet is that Lopez Obrador will be elected. He is younger than Castillo 
and better known than Garcia. Castillo is the most interesting: he is 
campaigning on a platform of better organisation for the party and a 
harnessing of support from environmentalists and other activists. 

 The winner will take over from Porfirio Munoz Ledo, one of the senior 
Priistas who left the ruling party in 1987 to support Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in 
his run for the presidency in 1998.

 Mass suffrage. In order to enable most of its members to vote, the party 
expects to set up 6,000 polling booths across the country. Gerardo Unzueta, 
the head of the PRD's election committee and a former member of the Partido 
Comunista,  says that this part of the election alone will cost US Dollars 
400,000. 

 This will be the first time that a political party in Mexico has used a 
method that allows (most) of its members to vote. Previously, parties such 
as the PAN (the clericalist opposition party) held special congresses to 
elect members.

 The PRD claims that this method is the most democratic way to elect a new 
leader. The PRD says that it will even allow members who join at the polling 
station to vote.

 The party expects voting to be heaviest in the capital where it claims to 
have 135,000 members. It also has 48,000 members in Chiapas and 33,000 in 
Jalisco. Other important states are Sonora with 27,000 and Cardenas's home 
state of Michoacan, which has 25,000 perredistas. 

 PAN: Vicente Fox, the governor of Guanajuato and a possible presidential 
candidate in 2000, if the constitution is changed to allow the children of 
foreign nationals to become President, shocked both the PAN and the country 
by saying that Petroleos Mexicanos should be privatised. Fox, who was 
recently on a visit to New York, was quoted as saying that Pemex, a national 
icon, should be sold off. Although Fox has not denied what he was reported 
to have said, he has backed away from repeating it.

 Fox has long had a stormy relationship with some of the more orthodox 
Panistas, such as the former party president Carlos Castillo Peraza. Fox is 
widely thought to be out of sympathy with the current party president (and 
Castillo protege) Felipe Calderon Hinojosa. 

 In a long interview in Proceso, Fox appears to rule out an alliance between 
the PAN and the PRD in either of the next two elections (the mid-term 
congressional elections in 1997 and the presidential elections in 2000). He 
points out that under the current election law, alliances between registered 
parties are specifically outlawed. Indeed the PRD had to become a new party 
in order to fight elections as the party of the united left.

 MEXICO: THE DROUGHT: MAIZE IMPORTS TO DOUBLE TO 7M T IN 1996: STRUCTURAL 
adjustment in agriculture

 The consequences of the drought in northern Mexico are beginning to become 
severe. On 30 May, 400 women and children stopped a train at San Nicolas de 
los Garza, near Monterrey, by putting cement bars across the tracks: they 
then carried away 40 tonnes of food in buckets. On 11 June, 50 youths 
stopped a grain train in the same area and raided it. 

 According to Mexican Commentary, a twice-weekly E-mail publication, an 
official report on the drought in Chihuahua found that 77 indigenous people 
(mostly children and the elderly) had died because of malnutrition and 
associated conditions in the first four months of the year.

 As we have reported regularly this year, the drought has become steadily 
worse. At the end of June, Proceso  published an in-depth report on the 
state of Mexican agriculture. The report was a damning view of recent 
Mexican agricultural policies. 

 Over the past three years Mexico has grown to become the US's fourth 
biggest agricultural market. According to US agricultural exporters, 
Mexico's maize crop (which provides the country's staple food, tortillas) 
averages between 12m and 15m t a year, but demand from human beings alone 
runs to 22m t.

 Proceso claimed that the government would have to spend at least US Dollars 
4bn on grain imports this year. The agriculture minister, Francisco 
Labastida Ochoa, said that the country would have to import between 8m and 
10m t of food. He reckoned that this would cost at least US Dollars 1.9bn.

 Labastida claimed that the country's stocks of food were adequate: he said 
that the Compania Nacional de Subsistencias Populares (Conasupo) had four 
months worth of meat and grains in its stocks. 

 This may be an overestimate: farmers are beginning to demand back crops 
which they have sold to Conasupo: at General Frias, members of the Frente 
Democratico Campesino said that they wanted 1,900 t of beans back. They said 
that Conasupo had paid them only 1,940 pesos a tonne when the market price 
was 4,000.  

 Labastida also claimed that the government would not alter its policy of 
subsidising staple foodstuffs. He said that the tortilla subsidy alone would 
cost 6bn pesos this year. 

 Infrastructure strains. The huge increase in Mexican imports of grains is 
putting a heavy strain on the country's infrastructure. Recently 30,000t of 
maize could not be unloaded at the port of Coatzacoalcos for two weeks 
because there were not enough railway wagons to transport the grain. 

 Cycle. The government has admitted that this year's production of grains 
will be badly hit by the drought. Farmers have been unable to sow for the 
spring summer season. The worst hit states according to the government are 
Baja California Sur, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Durango, Nuevo Leon, Sinaloa, 
Sonora and Tamaulipas.

 The problems this year follow on from a poor crop last year. US figures, 
cited by Proceso, put last year's harvest in Mexico at 23.77m t of grains 
and oilseeds. This was 11% down on the previous harvest of 26.8m t.

 The Union Nacional de Organizaciones Regionales Campesinas y Autonomas 
reckons that this year Mexico's maize, wheat, rice and bean crops will be 
13% down on 1995's. It reckons that the oilseeds crop will be 33% down. 
Unorca reckons that the country will have to import more than the regular 3m 
t of maize it has averaged over the past six years. The deputy trade 
minister has said that the government expects to import 5m t of maize and 
250,000t of beans. According to Ricardo Celma, director of the Consejo 
Norteamericano de Granos Forrajeros, the Secretaria de Comercio y Fomento 
Industrial has already authorised maize imports of 7.3m t for 1996. 

 The government reckons that the drought in these states (the worst for 50 
years) has prompted an increase in immigration. The government says that 
day-labourers have lost 25m working days because of the drought.

 Worries. Mexico has been using credit to help buy grain from US farmers. As 
part of the bailout package last year, the Mexican government got a credit 
line from the US Department of Agriculture of US Dollars 1.1bn which it has 
drawn down. 

 The problem this year is that US farmers are loth to allow grain to go to 
Mexico at subsidised rates. Ranchers in particular are putting pressure on 
the US government to halt the exportation of animal feed to Mexico. US 
ranchers say that the price of their animal feed has increased because of 
the drought in the Great Plains and that they have been forced to cut their 
losses by slaughtering cattle early. They now want the US to halt grain 
exports so that the price of feed can come down and they can start making a 
profit again.

 The US harvest this year is likely to be well down on last year's 275m t. 
The wheat crop this year is likely to be around 56m t (or 3m t less than 
last year. Wheat available for export is likely to be around 26.5m t (or 35% 
less than last year). The same sort of figures apply to maize. 

 Policy issue. The Mexican government is being criticised for having to 
spend so much on imports when it could avoid them by investing a fraction of 
the money in domestic agriculture. In particular, farmers say that the 
government should encourage banks to lend to agriculture. Farmers leaders, 
from the Congreso Agrario Permanente and the Union Nacional de Trabajadores 
Agricolas, claim that bank lending to agriculture has dropped by 50% since 
the economic crisis and the consequent increase in bad debts. 

 The Union Nacional de Organizaciones Regionales Campesinas y Autonomas 
recently distributed a report, Mexico y la Seguridad Alimentaria, which 
claimed that Nafta had severely damaged the prospects for 80% of Mexican 
farmers: the 3m ejidatarios and the 2.5m small farmers. Unorca also blames 
the agricultural reforms pushed through by the Salinas government (as a 
result of Nafta) for the fall in agricultural output. Essentially, the 
Salinas administration wanted to move from subsidising maize production to 
subsidising small maize producers. 

 The report reckons that the country will have to import a third of its food 
this year. This is despite a 29% fall over the past six years in demand for 
basic grains. 

 Dams: An official report by the Secretaria de Agricultura reported that at 
the beginning of June the country's 137 dams, which have a capacity of 
135,000m cubic metres, held only 10,000m cubic metres of water. This is only 
5m cubic metres more than the lowest figure ever recorded. The water levels 
at the beginning of June were 15,000m cubic metres below the normal level 
for this time of year and 15,000m cubic metres below the levels of a year 
ago. In round figures, the dams now hold 68% less water than they did a year 
ago.

 MEXICO: GAS: PRIVATE PIPELINES: 10 NETWORKS

 The government is inviting bids from the private sector for the 
construction of 10 new pipelines to supply industrial zones with natural 
gas. 

 One of the most attractive franchises will be to supply Mexico City. Its 
16m people use 350m cubic feet a day. Guanajuato also looks promising: its 
industrial zones at Leon, Salamanca, Celaya and Irapuato are also heavy 
users of gas. 

 The government hopes that bids will be made over the next 18 months and 
that the licences will be awarded and work will start at the end of 1997. 

 Pemex: The government's second attempt to sell off the country's 
petrochemical industry is not going well. Even the government admits that 
there are lacunas in the documentation.

 MEXICO: THE UNIONS: TEACHERS' DEMO ENDS IN VIOLENCE: MEXICO CITY POLICE 
chief sacked

 The President sacked Mexico City's police chief at the end of May after his 
brutal crackdown on a teachers demonstration in the capital. To the horror 
of the opposition the new police chief is General Tomas Salgado. Salgado 
further alarmed the opposition by saying that he in turn would appoint 
soldiers to the principal police jobs in the capital.

 The dissident teachers were demonstrating for higher wages. They wanted a 
doubling of their US Dollars 150 a month salaries. Their union had settled 
for a 10% rise in January and a further 12% rise in May. 

 The official teachers union, the Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la 
Educacion, is one of the most powerful unions in the country. Its head, Elba 
Esther Gordillo, has been mentioned as a possible president of the ruling 
Partido Revolucionario Institucional. The teachers have embarrassed  
President Ernesto Zedillo before when he was minister of education. They 
forced him to withdraw a revisionary history textbook that put a positive 
gloss on the Porfirio Diaz period. Earlier textbooks had focused on the 
Revolution, which followed Diaz's fall, as laying the basis for modern 
Mexico. 

 The demonstration against the smallness of the pay award was led by the 
dissident Coordinadora Nacional de Trabajadores de la Eduacacion. The police 
argued that they had been attacked, but the President, in sacking the police 
chief David Garay, said that they had used too much force. 

 Fears that the country might be facing a wave of labour unrest are abating. 
The university teachers at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico have 
settled for the 12% increase offered. 

 On the other hand the Sindicato de Telefonistas is taking a tough line with 
Infonavit, the state organisation charged with supplying cheap housing. The 
union says that Infonavit has not been offering mortgages to telephone 
workers in proportion to the worker's contributions. 

 The telephone workers' union is one of the strongest in the country. It has 
survived the privatisation of the state telephone company, Telmex. The 
union's leader, Francisco Hernandez Juarez, has long squabbled with other 
unions which he sees as arms of the ruling PRI.

 The telephone workers' union is also concerned that Infonavit has not 
invested the money collected from workers wisely. Most of the money is 
currently held in low-yielding government bonds. The union wants its 
members' contributions to be invested in higher yielding (but not 
speculative) instruments. 

 Colosio killing: The judge has said that he will take another month to 
decide whether Othon Cortes Vazquez was in fact the man who fired a second 
shot in the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Colosio was the ruling PRI's 
presidential candidate. He was killed on 23 March 1994 in Tijuana.

 Othon Cortes's lawyers argue that the prosecution case is weak: they point 
out that the only witness who says that he saw Cortes fire a shot was 17 
metres away. Another two witnesses who claimed to see Cortes brandishing 
what looked like a gun could not agree on his appearance. The defence also 
noted that the prosecution had not found the gun that Cortes was supposed to 
have fired, nor had they produced any forensic evidence to suggest that he 
had fired any gun. 

 The prosecution alleges that Cortes fired into Colosio's body while the 
convicted assassin, Mario Aburto, fired at Colosio's head.

 The Procuraduria General de la Republica said that the investigation into 
the supposed plot behind Colosio's assassination would continue to be run by 
Pablo Chapa Bezanilla, even though he was now moving to be subprocurador de 
procedimentos penales.

 MEXICO: FOCUS ON THE SALINAS BROTHERS: THE PRESSURE MOUNTS

 The scandal over the way Raul Salinas de Gortari, the elder brother of the 
former President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, acquired his wealth refuses to 
die down. At the end of June, following a couple of US TV investigations 
into Raul's finances, the procurador general de la Republica, Antonio Lozano 
Gracia, announced that the Mexican authorities were investigating to see 
whether Raul had committed tax evasion. He is already in prison, accused of 
being the mastermind behind the assassination of the secretary general of 
the ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Jose Francisco Ruiz 
Massieu.

 According to the investigation, broadcast on CBS, Raul had used false 
identities to accumulate US Dollars 300m in bank accounts outside Mexico. 
The implication is that Raul used his position as a senior official, and his 
relationship with his brother, for his own purposes. A programme on NBC 
implied that the President knew of this.

 The procurador said that his investigation had already discovered that Raul 
had understated his assets in Mexico alone by US Dollars 24m. In his 
position at the Comision Nacional de Subsistencias Populares, Raul's annual 
income should never have exceeded US Dollars 190,000. 

 The procurador is coming under pressure to take evidence from Amy Elliot, 
Raul's banker at Citibank. She is presumed to know more about Raul's 
finances than anyone else. CBS claimed that she had already been 'secretly' 
interviewed by officials from Mexico, the US and Switzerland about her 
client. CBS said that she had checked into Raul's background and been told 
that the money he was depositing came from the sale of a construction 
company.

 The procurador also claimed that the notion that Raul was involved in drug 
trafficking comes from the US Drug Enforcement Agency. 

 According to an article in La Jornada, which seems to draw on information 
that Raul gave to the Swiss authorities when they interviewed him in gaol 
last year, US Dollars 86m of his fortune was payment for advice he gave 
Mexican firms. Raul apparently said that this money would be used to set up 
an investment fund to promote Mexican economic development after his brother 
left office.

 This chimes with what Carlos Peralta, the head of Iusacell, a mobile 
telecoms company, said in January: he said that he had paid Raul US Dollars 
50m towards a fund. 

 Property: Before the programmes were broadcast the authorities seized 13 of 
Raul's properties on the Pacific coast. He has 10 apartments and two 
building lots in Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo and one apartment in Acapulco.

 Carlos: The government tried to deny that it has dismissed its ambassador 
to Ireland, Agustin Gutierrez Canet, for sponsoring the interview between 
the commentator, Jorge Castaneda and the former President, Carlos Salinas. 
It said that it had offered Gutierrez Canet the ambassadorship to Haiti 
which he had turned down. 

 The foreign minister, Jose Angel Gurria, said that the ambassador had lost 
the government's confidence and that the Irish post was important since 
Ireland held the presidency of the EU for the second half of 1996.


 Wages: The government said that claims from the independent Alianza Civica 
that President Zedillo's pay had trebled to 82,000 pesos (US Dollars 10,900) 
a month over the past 18 months were nonsense. It said that the President's 
pay had in fact dropped from 124,372 pesos (US Dollars 16,583) to 59,139 
pesos (US Dollars 7,885) a month. The Alianza was equally surprised when the 
presidency claimed that President Salinas had been paid US Dollars 36,050 a 
month. The Alianza thought he was being paid US Dollars 4,000.

DIVIDED OPPOSITION: THE PAN

As campaigns for the gubernatorial and midterm congressional elections
move into the final stretch, the PRI could hardly be in a better position.
Deep divisions have been reactivated within both major opposition parties
-- the rightist National Action Party (PAN) and the center-left
Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), as their leaders battle over
candidacies and campaign strategy.  The bitter fights waged in party
conventions have exacerbated factionalism and created confusion among
party rank-and-file, while publicly displaying the two top opposition
parties' disorganization and lack of definition.  Needless to say, the PRI
and government publicists have hammered these points across in the print
and electronic media.

While no one expects the opposition to gain ground in this year's
elections, to be held on August 18, the voting outcome will be highly
significant.  First, the PRI sees it as absolutely vital to recover
votes lost in 1988 to verify its historic claim of being "the party
of the 74 majorities." If the PRI can win more than 50% of the vote
cleanly, so much the better.

For their part, the PAN and PRD are locked in a bitter battle to secure
the position of the nation's second strongest electoral force after the
PRI.

In the 1988 elections, the National Democratic Front (the pro-Cardenas,
four-party coalition) overtook the PAN to become the strongest
opposition force, winning 31% of the national vote in the presidential
race, according to official statistics.

The strength of the Front forces (now registered as the PRD) has rankled
the administration ever since, because Cardenas's strong showing in the
official vote count caused Salinas's legitimacy to be questioned when he
took office.  Since the beginning of this year, senior PRI officials have
confidently predicted the demise of the Cardenista PRD party in this
year's elections, asserting that the PRD will only get 15% of the vote.
PRI leaders see similarly dim prospects for the PAN, and they predict
the conservative party will "return to its historic levels" of perhaps 20%
of the vote.

The best chances for significant opposition victories -- numerical or
moral -- lie in the gubernatorial races (see Mexico Service April 10,
1991).  In San Luis Potosi, a broad opposition front, the Coalicion
Democratica, which includes the PAN and PRD and other political and civic
groups, is considered a serious challenger to PRI candidate Fausto Zapata.
(It would hurt the administration little to sacrifice Zapata, who is
identified with the administration of former President Luis Echeverria;
other Echeverria associates --like Colima gubernatorial hopeful Socorro
Diaz -- are being sacrificed as part of the Salinas administration's
message that the liberal wing of the PRI is dead.)

In Guanajuato, PAN candidate Vicente Fox is considered a strong
contender against the PRI's Ramon Aguirre, an unpopular former
Mexico City mayor who has weak ties in the state.  The surprising, last-
minute registration of PRD candidate Porfirio Munoz Ledo (see XI-13),
however, opens up new scenarios.  According to some observers, Munoz
Ledo could come in second after Aguirre.  This would represent a moral
victory for the PRD, particularly because Guanajuato is traditionally a
PAN stronghold, being one of the Catholic bastions dating from the days
of the Cristero war.  Perhaps more importantly, if Fox is relegated to
third place, this sends a devastating message to the PANistas, like Fox,
who oppose negotiating with the PRI government.

In the senatorial races, the only major contest where the opposition has
a strong chance of winning is in Mexico City.  Observers now say the
PAN contender, Vicencio Tovar, could upset PRI challenger Manuel
Aguilera, who is a little-known figure in the mammoth capital.  PRD
challenger, Heberto Castillo, a former presidential candidate for the ex-
socialist party coalition (PMS), is well known and well liked in the
capital and cannot be discounted.

PAN and PRD are expected to win a modest number of Deputyships that
are elected by direct majority vote, particularly in their respective
strongholds of Baja California, Sonora, Yucatan and Chihuahua, and
Michoacan and Guerrero.  The strongest hopes for PAN and PRD are
the "proportional representation" or "plurinominal" contests in which
Deputy seats are apportioned according to the percentage of votes won
by each party in a congressional region (called "circumscription") that
takes in several states.  Proportional representation traditionally favors
opposition parties of all stripes because it grants seats to parties that
won less than a majority vote.  (Indeed, proportional representation was
included in the 1970 political reform as a means of creating spaces for
opposition participation and provides for a more pluralistic, less
hegemonic political system.)

While PAN and PRD might each win dozens of proportional
representation seats, neither party is expected to equal its take in the
1988 races, which gave an unprecedented 110 seats to the PAN and close
to 50 seats to the parties that made up the National Democratic Front.
Most observers predict the real winner at the polls will be what Mexican
wags call "the abstentionism party."  This group of non-voters typically
ranks high in all Mexican elections, and by tradition the congressional
races evoke even less participation than the presidential contest.  In
this, Mexicans correctly identify the presidency as the key office in their
political system.

In this SPECIAL REPORT, MS begins a two-part series focusing on
internal divisions in Mexico's leading opposition parties.  In this issue,
we examine the splits afflicting the PAN.

NATIONAL ACTION PARTY

The PAN regional and national conventions earlier this year underscored
the divisions within the party between the neo-PANistas and the so-called
"traditionalists," or "democratic forum."  In the last decade, and
particularly since 1985, the neo-PANistas have gained power in the
party, and this year they virtually secured control of all key leadership
posts and the overwhelming majority of congressional candidacies.

ASCENDANCY OF NEO-PANISTAS

The neo-PANistas are the businessmen-turned-activists who have pushed
the PAN to take a higher profile and challenge the government more
openly.  As such, they have moved away from the more traditional,
sedate style of a loyal opposition party adopted by the PAN from its
founding in the 1930s through the mid-1970s.  The fiercest advocates of
this position are wealthy northern ranchers who were infuriated -- and
politically motivated -- by former President Echeverria's 1976
confiscation of private ranches in the fertile Yaqui and Mayo valleys of
Sonora state.  Former PAN gubernatorial candidate for Chihuahua,
Francisco Barrios, and PAN President Luis H. Alvarez, a Chihuahua
businessman, exemplify the neo-PANistas.

The neo-PANistas are allied with and inspired by conservative forces,
particularly the far-right civic group, Desarrollo Humano Integral,
Asociacion Civil.  Today, the PAN has largely abandoned its traditional
role of crying out against fraud, corruption and mismanagement in the
PRI government in favor of a new tune.  Since President Salinas came
to power, he has preempted the PAN's program by deepening the
economic liberalization program, hinting at an end to the agrarian reform
lands (ejidos) and has begun courting the Roman Catholic church,
allowing it greater latitude in society.  In this context, the neo-PANistas
have been the first in Mexico's oldest opposition party to cooperate with
the PRI by holding regular meetings and negotiations with Salinas.

Their strategy of alliance with the government is based on a congruence
of ideology with Salinas and the fact that the PAN secured an
unprecedented 106 Chamber of Deputy seats (of 500 total) in 1988,
giving the party the swing vote on issues such as constitutional reforms
that require a two-thirds majority.  Concomitantly, the PRI gained only
a 10-seat majority (with 260 seats), and was compelled to forge an
alliance with PAN in order to pass constitutional reforms.

Seeking to capitalize on their newfound strength, the neo-PANistas
eagerly entered into talks with the government aimed at influencing
policy.  Early on, Salinas scored an important victory by gaining PAN
support for the constitutional reform that revised the electoral code and
set the new rules that will govern the 1991 races.  Support for the
electoral reform is the single best example of how much the newly
ascendant ideologues of the PAN are willing to compromise with the
government.  The electoral reform vote took place just three weeks after
former PAN presidential candidate Manuel Clouthier died in a car
accident.  Clouthier was an adamant opponent of such collaboration and
specifically opposed voting with the PRI to pass the electoral reform.

Neo-PANistas justify this action by saying that they demanded and got
government compliance to formulate a new and clean voter registration
roll. In exchange, however, the PAN voted for electoral rules that
limit or close off opportunities for opposition representation in the
legislature.  These are the "governability clause," which provides that
the party winning 35% of the vote will automatically be awarded 50% plus
1 of the Chamber of Deputy seats, and a prohibition on the formation of
electoral coalitions.  Most analysts believe the governability clause
favors the PRI because no opposition party has ever been awarded more
than 31% of the count in official election results; they say the PRI
would not have supported the measure if it would harm its own interests.
Also, the electoral reform bans the formation of coalitions, such as the
four-party National Democratic Front, which backed Cardenas and nearly
toppled the PRI in 1988.

In exchange for collaborating on the electoral reform, the PAN has
reaped rewards on several fronts.  First, it has gained unprecedented
electoral victories, most notably the governorship of Baja California.
Central government collusion in the PAN win is suggested by the fact
that PRI President Luis Donaldo Colosio went on national television to
announce the victory of PAN's Ernesto Ruffo at the same time that PRI
leaders in Baja California were still debating the outcome.  Building on
its newfound strength in the legislature, the party has become an
influential mediator of government policy.

The association with the ruling group has also bolstered the party's
treasury -- a direct outcome of the ascendancy of the neo-PANistas, who
overturned the 50-year policy of refusing to accept money from the
government.  The PAN now receives financial support assigned it by the
Interior Ministry in proportion to the number of votes won by the party
in national elections.

It is doubtful that the PAN-PRI alliance will become a permanent feature
of Mexico's political landscape, even though it has served Salinas's
interests well.  The informal association became mutually beneficial in
1989 when a shaken PRI, commanding a slim 10-vote majority in the
Chamber of Deputies, was obliged to seek cooperation to gain passage
of constitutional reforms.  In a formal sense, the alliance has fallen into
disuse ever since the October 1989 electoral reform.  Since then, Salinas
has not advanced a single legislative initiative that would require a two-
thirds majority.  Additional constitutional reforms are probably being
held back until after the new Congress is seated, with the PRI expecting
that more than two thirds of the seats will be occupied by loyal PRIistas.
As a result, the August mid-term congressional elections could severely
curtail the PAN's newfound power.

DISSIDENTS OR FORISTAS

The rise of the neo-PANistas has been countered by a faction that
defends the traditional PAN stance as an uncompromising opposition
party that cuts no deals with the government.  The fissure widened
during the debate about allying with the PRI to approve the electoral
reform.  The PANistas who opposed that alliance have formed a group
called the Foro Doctrinario y Democratico.

The Foristas oppose negotiations with the government and are pressing
for greater rank-and-file participation in party conventions and selection
of party nominees, and in the political system as a whole.  On the issue
of electoral fraud, the Foristas follow the lead of Clouthier, who staged
hunger strikes to protest fraud and steadfastly refused to negotiate with
the PRI government any compromise regarding electoral procedures and
outcomes.  In this, they are similar to the so-called "intransigent"
faction in the PRD, which is identified with Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who
adamantly refuses to meet with President Salinas for private talks,
demanding instead that talks with the government be conditioned on the
prior setting of an agenda.

Indeed, two prominent Foristas have joined the "National Accord for
Democracy," a pluralistic group launched by Cardenas that calls for
clean elections and negotiations to set the terms of a peaceful transition
to democracy.  For the coming August elections, the Foristas call for no
talks between the national PAN leadership and the government that could
decide outside the ballot "on the outcome of congressional and
gubernatorial races."

Foristas have occupied important leadership posts in the party in recent
years, from which they have been able to confront directly the neo-
PANistas.  Mexico City PAN President Jose Angel Conchello and Nuevo
Leon PAN leader (and former presidential candidate) Pablo Emilio
Madero are Foristas who have led head-on confrontations with
ideological opponents in the party.  Other leading figures of the dissident
group include former party Secretary-General Jesus Gonzalez Schmal,
Deputy Bernardo Batiz, former Federal Election Committee delegate
Juan de Dios Castro and Mexico City Assemblyman and former PAN
press spokesman Gonzalo Altamirano.

Guanajuato gubernatorial candidate Vicente Fox is also a Forista.  Fox
is an important figure in PAN because the party generally lacks strong
candidates for senior elective offices.  Fox is considered a serious
contender for that governorship, thanks to his personal dynamism, his
repeated stumping of Guanajuato state and the flatness of PRI candidate
Ramon Aguirre and internal PRI squabbles.  However, Fox's
identification with the Forista cause worries the party's national leaders
who, it is said, are willing to sacrifice him order to cement the neo-
PANistas' stranglehold on the party.

Foristas who campaigned to run as PAN candidates for Congress were
blocked in their bid for nomination at both the national and Mexico City
PAN conventions.  At the national convention, the National Executive
Committee vetoed the candidacy of Jesus Gonzalez Schmal, a former
Deputy, as a Mexico City Assemblyman.  Gonzalez Schmal had won
68% of the convention's vote for his nomination.  Forista Jose Angel
Conchello opted to withdraw from the competition for proportional
representation slots after he was excluded from the party's list of pre-
candidates.  At the Mexico City convention, rivalries between the two
factions were opened wide when neither Abel Vicencio Tovar, a neo-
PANista, nor Forista Bernardo Batiz captured the necessary 66% of the
vote for securing the nomination.  In two rounds of voting, Batiz won
52% against 48% for Tovar.  However, Tovar came out the nominee
when the issue was put to a vote by the National Executive Committee
which defeated Batiz, 13 to 3.  Batiz blames his defeat on his activism
as a Forista.

The rough handling of Foristas has precipitated a predictable airing of
the party's dirty linen in public.  Gonzalez Schmal has publicly protested
the veto of his candidacy (which the party's senior leaders refuse to
confirm), claiming that he was given no reasons for the rebuff.  In early
June, Batiz announced his resignation from his post as vice-coordinator
of the PAN delegation in the Chamber of Deputies.  His resignation
came after Tovar, PAN's congressional coordinator named two non-
Foristas as vice-coordinators to take over his responsibilities while he
campaigned for the Senate.  At the same time, a letter circulated among
PAN Congressmen calling for the resignation of Batiz from the
coordinator post.  Batiz has launched barbs at the party, saying it is
running for the distinction of being the "second official party" after the
PRI.

CONCLUSION

Facing the upcoming elections, PAN's national leadership is in a hopeful
mood.  Party President Alvarez confidently predicts the PAN will take
five governorships: Vicente Fox in Guanajuato; Rogelio Sada Zambrano,
in Nuevo Leon (see POLITICS); coalition contender Salvador Nava in
San Luis Potosi; Moises Canale, in Sonora; and Arturo Nava Bolanos in
Queretaro.  In addition, party leaders believe that PAN candidates will
win 74 direct majority deputyships (primarily in Baja California,
Chihuahua, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Mexico City, Nuevo Leon, San Luis
Potosi, Sinaloa, Sonora and Yucatan).

However, most political observers expect the PAN will win only one
governorship outright -- perhaps Guanajuato -- and, at most, a second
statehouse in coalition with the PRD in San Luis Potosi.  And taking
even 74 deputyships would still leave the PAN delegation diminished in
comparison with its showing in 1988.

This year's races are likely to be even tougher for the opposition than
1988.  The PRI campaigns are more intense, as the ruling party is
forewarned this time about popular discontent, and is taking steps
through populist spending programs to woo voters.  The divisions within
the PAN can only debilitate the party on the eve of elections that are
likely to bring setbacks for the conservative party.

BANAMEX PUT UP FOR BID

With Banamex formally put on the block on July 2, the bank
privatization goes into full swing.  In a press conference on July 4,
Finance Undersecretary Guillermo Ortiz, in charge of bank
privatizations, announced that all these privatizations should be
completed in the first half of 1992.

The government will sell off its 70.7% holding in Banamex, the largest
and most profitable in Mexico, in several tranches.  The sale conditions
differ from those of the other banks so far offered, owing to Banamex's
size and relative importance.  Some 31% of its shares will be offered
through an auction mechanism; another 20% will be offered to directors
who form part of regional boards and already have expressed an interest
in participating.  The winning bidder will have the right to the shares not
taken up by the regional directors.  The remaining 20% may also be
purchased by the winning bidder in order to attain the 51% necessary for
overall voting control -- although it is likely that most of this will be
placed, subsequent to the award of the controlling stake, with foreign
investors.

Payment terms for the auctioned shares are: a deposit (in Cetes) of
Mex$150 billion (US$50 million) prior to the auction on August 23; 20%
of the bid price to be paid five days after the award; and four other equal
installments at 30 day intervals after that date.  Bids are due to be
awarded by September 6.

Banamex currently has a market capitalization of approximately Mex$12
trillion (US$4 billion), implying that 20% would cost US$800 million.
With a net worth of US$1.8 billion, this implies a current ratio of price
to net worth of 2.2 times: should the bank go for 2.5 times net worth,
as is expected, this would represent an overall value of US$4.5 billion.
The bank's Mex$78 trillion (US$25 billion) in total assets represents
25% of the Mexican banking system, and its profits for the first five
months of 1991 were Mex$512 billion (US$170 million).  With
annualized profits of approximately US$400 million, this would put
Banamex's prospective P/E at current market levels at 10 times earnings.

Key bidders for Banamex are likely to be Roberto Hernandez and the
Accival brokerage; Manuel Senderos and the Grupo Desc (to whom we
understand that Alberto Bailleres, a major industrialist, has allied
himself); and the Visa group, headed by Eugenio Garza Laguera (which
already has all elements of a financial group, except a bank, through
Grupo Vamsa, and formerly owned Banca Serfin).  Hernandez, who was
the underbidder in the Telmex auction, is currently the favorite for
Banamex.  However, Desc has a good chance.  The Visa group is
considered to be more interested in recovering its former bank, Serfin.

SWELLING CONTINGENCY FUND

Guillermo Ortiz also stated that the Contingency Fund, formed as a kind
of reserve to protect Mexico against oil price fluctuations has already
amassed US$4.5 billion.  Funds have come from the Telmex
privatization (both the controlling stake and L shares), which have
brought in approximately US$4 billion, and some of the proceeds
(estimated by the government at US$632 million) from the three banks
already sold off (Multibanco, Banpais, Cremi).  With only half the year
gone, the government has practically achieved its US$5 billion
privatization target for this year.

PEMEX ISSUES ECU BOND

In the first such bond issued by a Latin American borrower, Pemex
placed an ECU100 million bond in the Eurobond market, according to
a July 5 announcement.  The bonds have a term of 3 years, a coupon of
11.5%, and were priced at 100.05, giving a yield of 11.48%, equivalent
to 9.68% in dollars.  The lead manager was Paribas, with co-managers
Swiss Bank, Bear Stearns, Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Bankers' Trust,
Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch.

This latest bond issue follows a total of US$650 million raised through
seven issues by Pemex, Nafin and Bancomext in 1990.  The coupon is
the lowest yet achieved by a Mexican state borrower.  It represents the
beginning of a second financing stage for Pemex.  In the first, the state
oil company sought to reestablish its image as a borrower in international
markets (after the 1982 debacle): the second stage is intended to fund its
expansion program.  Pemex plans to raise US$500 million annually over
the next four years, which would cover at least 10% of its investment
program during that period.

The "voluntary" return by Mexican borrowers to the international market
is considered by the Mexican government as a sign that the debt crisis is
over.  The key change from 1978-1982 borrowing patterns is that, so
far, all Mexican financings have been made through bond and equity
markets.  This approach offers marketable instruments and spreads the
risk over a broad range of investors.  The earlier practice of direct bank
borrowing, which concentrated the risk, led directly to the 1982 crisis.

FREE PESO FUTURES

The market for exchange rate cover (coberturas cambiarias) was extended
to the free rate on July 1.  The new system has several limiting features:

* Participants must be corporations in the private sector.

* Settlement, although denominated in dollars, will only be in pesos.

* Terms are between 72 hours and 365 days.

* Rates will be set with reference to free rates fixed for Tesobonos
(government short-term loan instruments denominated at the free rate).

As of July 5, quotations for exchange rate cover at the free rate were
exactly the same as those for the controlled rate.

The introduction of this market could lead to two positive outcomes over
the medium term for Mexico: unification of the free and controlled rate,
and introduction of a more orthodox peso-dollar futures (or forward)
market in Mexico.  This development, as well as the return to the
international marketplace (see previous item) would mark the final stages
of rehabilitation of the Mexican economy following the 1982 crash.

COMERCIAL MEXICANA DEAL

Comercial Mexicana, one of three major Mexican supermarket chains
(along with Cifra and Gigante), has associated with Price Club of the US
in a 51-49% joint venture.  They plan to set up 12 stores, beginning in
December, the first one to be located in the heavily populated middle
class suburb of Satelite in Mexico City. Comercial Mexicana, which
owns 75 stores throughout Mexico, went public earlier in 1991 on the
Mexican Stock Exchange.  Price Club operates 59 stores (51 in the US
and 8 in Canada) on a wholesaling formula.  The initial plan for the
Mexican venture is to supply US-made products, but the new stores will
be gradually moving towards stocking Mexican merchandise.  Price Club
already supplies several of Comercial's competitors in Mexico, and it is
rumored that they have stopped these purchases since hearing of its
linkup with Comercial. Gigante, the other main supermarket chain, is
likely list its shares on the Mexican Stock Exchange in July.  It intends
to make an up to US$200 million share offering through Inverlat (in
Mexico) and an international underwriting group led by Bear Stearns.

KOREAN AUTO INVESTMENT

Kia Motors, Korea's third largest auto manufacturer, announced on June
26 that it plans to invest up to US$2 billion in an auto assembly plant in
the state of Tamaulipas or Sonora.  Other major Korean chaebols
(groups) that already have investments in Mexico include Daewoo
(televisions), Hyundai (containers and trailers), Goldstar and Samsung
(both electronics).  Korean companies are clearly intent on imitating
Japan in using Mexico as a platform for entry into NAFTA.

PEASE LETTER ON FORD LABOR PRACTICES

US Congressman Don Pease (D-Ohio) is preparing a letter to President
Carlos Salinas questioning the handling of a recent labor dispute at the
Ford plant in Mexico City.  Pease is a member of the House Ways and
Means Committee, the key committee with oversight over the free trade
negotiations.  His inquiry into Mexican labor practices, as reported by
the official news agency Notimex, could set a precedent for ongoing US
congressional questioning of the Mexican government for the duration of
the FTA talks.

The letter will express the congressman's concern about the dispute over
which labor confederation is to represent Ford employees.  Copies of the
Pease letter will be sent to the US Trade Representative, senior officers
of the Ford Motor Company and the United Automotive Workers union.

The Pease inquiry stems from a year-long dispute over whether the Ford
workers would be represented by the PRI-affiliated Confederacion de
Trabajadores Mexicanos (CTM) or by the less official Confederacion
Obrera Revolucionaria (COR).  Earlier this year, the CTM allegedly won
the majority of workers' votes to renew its control of the union.
However, COR-affiliated workers, who claim to have the allegiance of
55% of the 3,000-plus members, demanded a recount. Official results in
the June 3 reballoting gave a slim majority to the CTM -- with 1,325
votes against 1,112 for the COR.  That narrow margin has raised
questions in many quarters.  PRD congressmen denounced the recount
in advance, revealing that Labor Minister Arsenio Farell had intervened
to favor the CTM.  They disclosed a letter signed by Farell in which he
requested Trade Minister Jaime Serra Puche's "intervention to make
Ford see the grave consequences it would bring to lose."  Several days
before the new balloting, Senator Paul David Wellstone (D-Min.)
expressed his concern about the fairness of the recount procedure in a
letter addressed to Mexican Ambassador to the US, Gustavo Petricioli.
"From my point of view, the letter [of Farell] puts in serious doubt the
impartiality and fairness of the preparation of the election for
representation of the Ford plant.  I am very worried that underground
intimidation, such as open violence, not be repeated in this conflict," the
Senator wrote, alluding to attacks by shock groups on the union picket
lines on Jan. 8, 1990 that ended in the death of one worker, Cleto
Nigmo Urbina.  On the day of the recount, workers had to make their
way through police lines manned by traffic cops, anti-riot squads,
highway police and judicial police and Interior Ministry agents to cast
their ballots while helicopters flew overhead.

Following the alleged CTM victory in the recount, workers supporting
COR were threatened with loss of their jobs.  The CTM has demanded
that COR backers who want to continue working at the Ford plant must
sign a letter which says: "...due to confusion or lack of thought, I
expressed my vote (in the June 3 recount) in favor of the COR, however,
in reasoned reflection I have reached the consideration of accepting fully
my union discipline as much for the organization I belong to...as for the
CTM, which has always been characterized by its defense of workers."
As the free trade talks progress, more US Senators and Congressmen
with close ties to the US labor movement are sure to scrutinize Mexican
labor practices very closely.

NUEVO LEON ELECTIONS

The leadoff contest in the gubernatorial stakes, in Nuevo Leon, offers a
preview of what to expect from the August 18 contests in the other
states, hints at upcoming administration policy, and puts to the test
government promises that electoral procedures will be cleaned up (MS
XI-13).  The outcome shows that charges of electoral irregularities are
unlikely to be put to rest this year.

As expected (XI-8), PRI candidate Socrates Rizzo held a strong lead over
PAN and PRD challengers in preliminary returns from the July 7 Nuevo
Leon state gubernatorial elections.  With more than 60% of the vote
counted, Rizzo had won 62% of the ballots, against 38% for PAN
challenger Rogelio Sada and 3% for PRD contender Lucas de la Garza.
According to official statistics, more than 50% of eligible voters cast
their ballots.  This is a high voter turnout for Mexico where abstention
rates of 65% or more are common in state elections.  Early returns had
no information on the outcome of the vote for 26 state congressional
seats.  The turnout for all parties other than the three leading contenders
was abysmal: 0.2% each for the Partido Popular Socialista and the
Partido del Frente Cardenista de Reconstruccion Nacional, both satellite
parties controlled by the PRI; 0.1% for the Partido Autentico de la
Revolucion Mexicana, another PRI satellite; less than 0.2% for the
conservative Partido Democrata Mexicana and the locally based Partido
Liberal Revolucionario.

The Nuevo Leon campaign was significant in that it was the first real
three-way race for governor in country's history.  Each of the candidates
of the three leading parties -- PRI, PAN and PRD -- is a prominent
figure, has roots in the state, and commands a strong base of support.
In a sense, Rizzo was the least locally based of the leading challengers.
He was launched as candidate for Monterrey mayor in 1988 by then-
Programming and Budget Minister Carlos Salinas de Gortari.  Once in
the mayorship, and bolstered by official backing from the central
government, he was able to preempt the governor in many functions, and
succeeded in completing public works programs that gained him
popularity. Rogelio Sada is a prominent business leader descended from
the founding families of the Monterrey industrial establishment.  He was
CEO of the glass giant, Vitro, until six years ago when the firm ran him
out for participating openly in PAN party politics.  He enjoys a strong
following among the PAN's traditional constituency, the conservative,
pro-business upper class and the middle classes.

Lucas de la Garza, PRD candidate, is the son of a popular former
governor.  A cattle rancher, de la Garza served the previous governor
for five years as planning director and was the top cabinet official
(Secretario de Gobierno) for the sitting governor, Jorge Trevino, until he
resigned to protest corruption in government.  De la Garza's natural
constituency is in the state's rural areas, but his charisma, home-style
campaigning and reputation for honesty have gained him support in
Monterrey as well. Rizzo's closeness to President Salinas lend a special
note of significance to the governor-elect's pronouncements, which can
be interpreted as a signal of the policy thrust the Salinas administration
has in mind for the remaining half of the sexenio.  At the July 2
ceremony closing his campaign, Rizzo proposed a Pacto Nuevo Leon
which, he said, would improve the standard of living in the state.  The
seven points of the Pacto are:

* Internationalization of Nuevo Leon: make the state into a beachhead of
economic modernization in preparation for the FTA;

* Decentralization and regional development;

* Growth with order: improve urban transportation, emphasizing electric
transport;

* Improve the quality of life: substitution of fuel oil with natural gas in
industry and promote supply of ecological fuels;

* Safety and justice: create an office to defend citizens, set up a Human
Rights Commission and a special appeals office to improve the
administration of justice;

* Modernization of finances and public administration: renegotiate the
state debt, extending the repayment period and improving the interest
rates;

* Democratic Solidarity: "implement democracy as a form of life that is
not reduced to political and electoral aspects, end arrogance and
arbitrariness of public officials."

On a symbolic level, the close of the Rizzo campaign also sent some
clear messages.  The ceremony, attended by 9,000 PRIistas, was held in
Cintermex.  This is the new international trade center built by the major
Monterrey enterprises on land donated by the government to serve as a
convention center and to house permanent exhibits of Monterrey industry
products, including ordering and shipping facilities.  Rizzo took
advantage of the setting to leave behind his former life as an activist in
an ultra-left group related to the Spartacus League.  Seeking to touch all
the right buttons for his audience, Rizzo embraced the conservative
Monterrey values, saying, "I believe in the family as the essential pillar
of society.  I believe in the enterprising spirit, in the strength and
values of the work ethic that have created the Nuevo Leon of today."  In a
highly unusual statement for a PRIista, Rizzo overlooked the formal
separation of church and politics and said, "I believe in God above all
things."

The Nuevo Leon gubernatorial and state congressional contest also
marked the debut of the new federal voter registration list and voter
credentials.  It thus provides early warning of problems that may be
expected to plague the six gubernatorial and nationwide congressional
races on August 18.  Opposition parties of all stripes reported
irregularities that would permit fraud or prevent eligible voters from
casting a ballot.  Political parties received the voter registration list
later than scheduled, allowing them minimum time to correct errors on the
padron.  PRD militants detected names that appeared three and four
times on the voter registration list. In addition, the list of designated
opposition party observers scrambled the names of poll-watchers and
their respective districts, forcing opposition parties to work quickly to
correct these errors.

The Federal Electoral Institute delegate for Nuevo Leon, Roberto
Villarreal Roel, reported July 5 that more than 228,000 voter credentials
had not been distributed, meaning that 15% of the state's 1,564,972
voters were effectively disqualified.  Two days before the election, PRD
candidate Lucas de la Garza charged the PRI was organizing shock
groups to intimidate voters and "carrousel" operations to transport PRI
supporters to different voting booths to vote several times.  De la Garza,
saying he had received information from high-ranking state PRI sources,
claimed that the PRI had already decided how many votes it would
obtain in various districts.

PAN and PRD had arranged to run a joint operation on election day to
detect and report election fraud and to compare voting results.  The two
parties agreed to "share" poll-watchers, with PRD militants covering the
polls in rural areas and PAN in charge of the greater Monterrey polling
booths. The two parties will cross and compare information gathered by
their poll-watchers about the vote counts at each precinct.  The election
was to be watched by at least 150 observers gathered by the Asamblea
Democratica por el Sufragio Efectivo (ADESE), a national, pluralistic
group formed by representatives of opposition parties, human rights
groups and civic associations.

Nevertheless, the elections themselves were marred by a series of
irregularities.  PAN candidate Sada Zambrano alleged that the ballots had
not been appropriately signed by electoral officials at the state capital.
There was a heavy voter turnout in two large townships governed by
PAN mayors, but insufficient ballots available at voting booths: the State
Electoral Commission sent only 200 ballots to precincts that had
registered 1,000 voters.  Throughout the day, "carrousels," traditionally
operated by the PRI, were reported to be carrying voters to different
locations to vote several times.  Poll-watchers from the PAN and PRD
parties were expelled from several precincts.  In districts that are
opposition strongholds, voters were allowed to vote without credentials,
a move alleged to favor the PRI.  One person was arrested for stealing
a ballot box and another charged with trying to organize a carrousel.

Other serious irregularities reported in rural areas included no ballots
sent to the rural town of Montemorelos, and in the towns of Mier y
Noruega and Dr. Arroyo, the location of voting booths was scrambled
so that citizens did not know where to cast their ballots.  By the close of
election day, the PRD issued a list of 69 irregularities - although it is
not clear how much difference they would have made, while Lucas de la
Garza, the PRD candidate, said it was too early to make a judgement
about them.

ELECTION DEBATE INTENSIFIES

This experience will only intensify the growing controversy over
electoral procedures and the government's intention of democratizing
Mexican political life.  The PRD delegation in the Chamber of Deputies
proposed on July 3 that the August 18 elections be postponed until
September 22.  The purpose would be to allow enough time to hand out
credentials to all eligible registered voters and to provide political
parties with the voter registration list enough in advance of the elections to
allow for corrections to be made.  The proposal is to be debated in the
Chamber beginning July 8.  As the preparations for the Nuevo Leon
election demonstrate, the government has been unable to meet either of
its self-imposed deadlines for handing out the voter registration lists or
distributing voter credentials to all eligible voters.

Questions about the government's intentions are being raised anew
because of recent statements made by President Salinas that indicate that
economic reform takes a higher priority that political reform.  During his
trip to Europe (see below), President Salinas stated that democracy
cannot become strong nor justify itself in the absence of appropriate
economic conditions. "For that [reason] stability has a high priority,
because without it the reforms of the productive apparatus, expectations
and even the social spirit (could) be placed at risk," Salinas told Czech
President Vaclav Havel.  Also in Europe, Salinas reiterated his
administration's refusal to admit international observers to elections.

These comments sparked a sharp response from PAN President Luis H.
Alvarez.  Speaking in Monterrey, at the close of the PAN  gubernatorial
camapaign, Alvarez said, "We will insist that in Mexico economic
measures cannot be successful if they are not matched by an opening in
the political sphere.  A common effort between people and government
is needed to face the challenges, and this can only take place in a
democratic setting."  Those thoughts were echoed by the director of the
Manufacturers' Chamber of Nuevo Leon, Mariano Montero Zubillaga,
who commented that "We see some advances in political matters,
although the ideal would be for those advances to be more rapid in order
to match the economic opening."

SALINAS TOUR OF EUROPE

The primary goal of President Salinas's early July swing through Europe
was to seek foreign investment, particularly in Germany and Italy.  The
purpose of the visits to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, according
to sources close to the president, is to observe first hand the
transformation of those societies.

In Germany, Salinas met with the presidents of Volkswagen and
Mercedes Benz.  Both automotive giants announced new investments:
US$900 million to expand the VW plant in Puebla, and DM27 million
for Mercedes Benz, which will begin producing light trucks in Mexico.
In Germany, the two governments signed an agreement establishing a
mechanism for holding bilateral talks to strengthen cooperation, and
another arranging joint financing, with a German loan and Banobras
credits, for construction of a second light train line in Guadalajara.  At
the conclusion of the German tour, Trade Secretary Jaime Serra
announced that more than 60 German firms have pledged to invest about
US$3 billion in Mexico over the next few years.

During his brief visit in Czechoslovakia, Salinas met with President
Vaclav Havel, and called for a European dialogue with Latin America.
Reflecting on the contradictory forces of Balkanization that is breaking
up European republics and globalization of national economies, Salinas
averred that foreign financing and opening of trade opportunities are the
necessary ingredients to bolster incipient democracies.  In this regard,
Mexico sees the successful completion of the Uruguay Round of the
GATT as critical, the president said.

In his meeting with Salinas, Soviet President Gorbachev expressed his
interest in deepening ties with Latin America and Mexico.  The two men
discussed the free trade agreement, Cuba and the July 18-19
Iberoamerican Summit to be held in Guadalajara.  Cuban President Fidel
Castro is to attend, which could lead to policy decisions about relations
in the hemisphere with the Castro regime.  In a press conference,
Gorbachev announced that he will make a state visit to Mexico next year.
The presidents signed agreements that provide for Pemex to offer
technical assistance in reconstruction of an oil refinery, setting up a
direct telephone line between the two countries, and establishing joint
cooperation in combatting drug trafficking.

Salinas also held talks with Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian
Federation, and former Foreign Relations Minister Eduard
Schevardnadze, who resigned from the Communist Party hours after his
meeting with the Mexican president.

Salinas was accompanied on his trip by leading Mexican businessmen
including Carlos Slim, owner of Telmex, Claudio X. Gonzalez, director
of Kimberly Clark and presidential adviser on foreign investment, and
Roberto Hernandez, head of the Accival brokerage.

EXCHANGE AND METALS

The exchange rate continued to devalue by 40 centavos/day.  During the
period, exchange cover for the free rate was introduced (see FINANCE),
on the same lines as that for the controlled rate.  There was no difference
in quotes between free and controlled rate cover.  This could be the
prelude to an eventual unification of rates, but the government seems in
no hurry.

INTEREST RATES

Rates for 28-day Cetes backed up for two successive weeks, with 91-day
paper rising in sympathy, as the government mopped up liquidity with
larger Cete issues.  With projected real rates close to 6%, we consider
it unlikely rates will rise much further.

STOCK MARKET

The stock market index advanced by 3% over the period, although it is
still just off its June 6 high of 1,131.  The period began with a fall of
28
points (to 1,052) in sympathy with the Dow, itself influenced by the
Nikkei, which had plunged on the Nomura revelations.  It was choppy
for the rest of the week, closing on June 28 (the end of the month and
the semester) at 1,058.

Influenced by the Dow, the market showed a strong upswing at the
beginning of the second week, with rises of 19, 18, 2 and 23 points on
the first four days of trading, before profit taking on July 5 pushed it
back down to 1,114 at the end of the period. An analysis of the market
for the second quarter and the first semester is provided in this week's
SPOTLIGHT.  In it, we continue to recommend 30% in stocks in:
Cemex, Cifra, Codumex, Kimberly, Telmex and Ttolmex.

There is no change in the overall MS portfolio recommendation:
positions of 10% in Adjustabonos, 25% in Tesobonos, 30% in stocks,
30% in money market instruments and 5% in BIBs.

MEXICAN STOCK MARKET: FIRST SEMESTER 1991

Favorable developments on the financial and privatization fronts have
lifted stock prices beyond the highs achieved in the previous quarter, and
the market still has plenty of momentum.  The Bolsa index shot ahead
by 32% from April through June (up from 28% in the first quarter),
cresting at a record 1,131 on June 6.  For the semester, the gain was
68% in peso terms and 65% in dollars (see Table 1B in printed copy of
newsletter).

In this regular quarterly MS analysis of the Bolsa, we look at the
market's performance in the second quarter (see Mexico Service, April 10,
1991 for first quarter results) and the first half of 1991, breaking down
the surveyby sector and individual companies.  Then we consider the factors
moving the market, prospects for the remainder of 1991, and offer our
stock portfolio recommendations.

SECOND QUARTER TRENDS

The market had closed the previous quarter at a record 803 points.
(Note that the final three zeroes were removed from the index on May
13; for purposes of this analysis, we have dropped these three digits for
earlier figures retroactively).  That spurt was followed by four distinct
phases in the market's behavior in the second quarter, with alternating
periods of advances and consolidations.

April 1-17: Scaling new heights

By the end of the first week of April, the market had risen to 859 and
continued on its upward course in the second week, reaching a new peak
of 934 on April 17.  Fueling the drive were the bull market in the US,
where the Dow broke 3,000 on April 17; generally favorable reviews of
Salinas's April visit to the US and Canada to promote the FTA; and
market anticipation of a successful selloff of the government's Telmex
L shares, which boosted the Telmex stock quotation.

April 18-May 6: Consolidation

Following the explosive advances in the first half of April, the market
took a breather, mainly on technical grounds, through the beginning of
May.  It had doubled back to 919 on May 6.

May 7-June 6: Further advances

The following period saw the Bolsa breaking a succession of records,
propelled by two important developments.  One was the success of the
Telmex issue as priced on May 13, reinforced by positive news for the
FTA as two key US congressional committees rejected resolutions
blocking extension of the fast-track on May 14, and as other obstacles
were cleared away thereafter.  The index leaped from 931 on May 7 to
993 on May 9, and attained a new closing high of 1,008 on May 13
(without the index adjustment that day, it would have broken through the
one million barrier).  By May 17, it had soared to 1,018.  The index was
further spurred the following week by positive fast-track votes in the
House on May 23, putting it up to 1,045, and the Senate on May 24;  by
May 31,  it had reached 1,096.  The market crested on June 6 at an all-
time peak of 1,131 (80% above its level at end-1990).

June 7-28: Second Retracement

Following May's extraordinary performance, the market went through
a period of consolidation in June, dropping back to 1,080 by June 21.
The main influences during this period were the announcement of the
first three bank sales at higher prices than expected, which caused
switching on the margin between nonbank and bank stocks by some
Mexican investors.  A slight backup in interest rates also took its toll,
as did profit-taking to cash in on the gains of the previous month.  Even so,
the market closed the semester on June 28 at 1,058, only 6% off its all-
time high.  This meant a 68% advance in pesos and 65% in dollars over
the end-1990 level.

SECTORAL PERFORMANCE

SECOND QUARTER

Against the average (index) increase of 32%, eight sectors came in above
average and twelve below (see Table 2 in printed copy of newsletter).
Only three sectors failed to keep pace with the 3% estimated CPI increase
for the quarter. The top eight groups were as follows: Banks, Construction,
Insurance, Clothing, Brokerage, Food, Groups and Tobacco.  Financial
concerns (banks, insurance, brokerage) dominated the lineup owing to
euphoria over the bank privatization and the potential synergies from the
formation of financial groups.  The Construction sector was spurred on by
continued strong performances by the cement companies (Cemex, Ttolmex).
Food was boosted by good results for Bimbo, and Groups by the big hikes in
the shares of Contal and Visa, whose main holding is Femsa.
Metallurgy, Electricals and Engineering, at the other end of the scale,
did not even beat inflation.  The primary cause of this weak performance
is the unmarketable nature of the stocks in the Metallurgy and
Engineering sectors.  In the Electrical sector, share prices of telecoms
suppliers (Ericsson, Indetel) also failed to lift off due to investor
concerns that Telmex, under new ownership and management, would
squeeze their margins.  Codumex also showed little positive movement.

Several high capitalization, marketable sectors are clustered in the area
above inflation, but below the average.  In the Utilities sector, Telmex -
- with the dominant weighting -- turned in a moderate 26%.  In Steel,
Tamsa's 24% increase also held down the overall sectoral results.
Exporting sectors (Chemicals and Mining) continued to do relatively
poorly, pending confirmation of a US recovery.  Paper and Stores stocks
adjusted downward after relatively strong performances in the previous
two quarters.

FIRST SEMESTER

For the first half of the year (see Table 3 in print copy of newsletter),
there are just five sectors that beat the index increase of 68%, with 15
sectors underperforming.  Only three sectors did worse than inflation,
estimated at 9% for the period. The big advance in Construction stocks
reflected a major catchup by Cemex and Ttolmex, which had underperformed
the market during the two previous years.  The surge in bank stocks is
attributable to movement on  the  privatization  front;  when  the  first
three banks were sold at multiples of price/book at least 50% higher than
had been expected, the sector was revalued overall.  The strength showed by
Groups reflected advances in Contal, Visa and Desc.  A major runup in
Telmex prices prior to the latest phase of its privatization underpinned
the move in Utilities.  Steel's good showing was accounted for by
advances in both Tamsa and Sidek (which still has about half its assets
in Steel, with the rest in tourism).

At the bottom of the ranking, Mining stocks were damaged by soft
demand for exports (stemming partly from the US recession), and
specifically by stagnant metals prices; all the key mining players
(Penoles, Grupo Mexico, Frisco and Sanluis) underperformed the
market.  The next two sectors from the bottom, Electricals and
Metallurgy, slipped badly in the second quarter, driving their first-half
positions down.  The Electrical sector was undermined by the poor
performances of Indetel and  Ericsson, which were not compensated by
a reasonable increase in Codumex.

Beating inflation but still below average were: Drinks, Food, Brokerage,
Insurance, Clothing, Tobacco, Consumer Goods, Paper, Engineering,
Stores, Autoparts and Chemicals.  Of these stocks, the advance in
financial stocks (Brokerage and Insurance) in the second quarter did not
overcome their relative stagnation in the first.  Meanwhile, of the main
marketable sectors, Paper and Stores drew back from their
overperformance in the previous year, while Chemicals continued to be
hurt by the US recession.

INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES

SECOND QUARTER

Of our 88-company sample, 31 overshot the Bolsa's general advance of
32% and 57 fell short of it (Table 5 in print copy of newsletter), while 29
matched or fell below the estimated 3% inflation for the period.  The
fifteen stocks that did not move at all (0% increase) reflect mostly lack
of marketability rather than price stagnation.

Financial companies dominated the top ten stocks.  The sharp increases
in the price of Vamsa (insurance), Atlanti (bank), Cbobsa (brokerage),
Confia (bank), and Promex (bank) all reflect the current euphoria about
bank privatization and the formation of financial groups.  Also
outperforming the index were Comermex, Banamex, Cremi, Bancen,
Bacomer, Banorie, Serfin, Banorte, Banoro, Intenal and Inverlat.  This
means that 16 of the 31 companies that outdid the index were financial
stocks.

Nonbank high achievers were Visa, a holding company with illiquid
stock whose price caught up with that of its key holding, Femsa; Cemex,
whose profits were improved by price increases and reduced debt; Vitro,
benefitting from the turnaround in Anchor; Sidek, boosted by investor
perceptions that it is the only strong tourism play in the market; and
Ttolmex, benefitting from higher cement prices.

In the below-inflation group, companies whose stocks are relatively
visible and marketable include telephone suppliers (Ericsson, Indetel and
Latinca), still subject to a squeeze from Telmex's new cost-minded
management; mining companies suffering from weak metals prices (e.g.
Frisco, Sanluis, Grupo Mexico, Penoles); and chemical exporters hit by
the US recession (Neromex, Celanese, Carbide, Borden). In the middle-
range are companies that did not keep up with the index but still did
quite well (by most country standards).  Femsa, Telmex, Cifra, Tamsa,
Apasco, Kimberly and CMA stocks are marketable and a positive case
can be made for their prospects.

FIRST SEMESTER

Over the first semester, 21 stocks raced ahead of the 68% gain in the
Bolsa index and 67 came in behind it, with 33 of these stocks
underperforming estimated inflation of 9% (Table 6 in print copy of
newsletter).

Of the 21 highest-ranking stocks, there continued to be a preponderance
of financial institutions: Atlanti, Promex, Cremi, Bancomer, Banamex,
Vamsa, Banoro, Serfin, Intenal.  However, unlike the second quarter
alone, they are not generally among the top performers; other,
nonfinancial stocks surpass them because of excellent performances in
both quarters.  These stocks include Cemex, Contal, Eaton, Nadro
Sidek, Tremec, and Ttolmex in the top seven places, with Telmex
placing 11, Visa 12, Vitro 16 and Apasco 19.

At the lower end of the scale are marketable companies in the Mining
(Sanluis, Frisco, Grupo Mexico) and Electrical (Indetel, Ericsson,
Latinca) groups.  The middle range contains several companies that did
well last year (Cifra, Sanborn, Kimberly, Crisoba) and appear to have
leveled off.

MARKET FACTORS

The major trends of the first and second quarters overlapped for the most
part, but with a marginally different emphasis.  The key driving forces
were as follows:

* Mexican investors focused on banks and financial companies.  Their
interest was only reinforced in the second quarter when prices under the
first three bank privatizations exceeded the most optimistic estimates.
This optimism spilled over into evaluations of most other financial
companies and lead to a leveling off of nonfinancial stocks.

* Foreign investor demand continued to set the tone for prices of non-
financial stocks (foreigners may not buy bank or brokerage stocks, and
insurance stocks are illiquid).  Foreigners continued to focus on highly
marketable, high-capitalization stocks with strong product focus and a
domestic orientation.  This explained the strength of companies such as
Contal and Sidek, the cement companies, and Telmex.  It also accounts
for the relative weakness of conglomerates such as Desc and Alfa).

* Weakness in the stocks of internationally oriented companies.
Chemical and mining operations continued to do poorly, as the market
remained uncertain about the duration of the US recession.

PROSPECTS

In our last report (XI-8), we stated that if Mexico reaches a historic
price/earnings multiple of 20, it would imply an index level of 1,150.
The index is not quite at this point yet, as we reckoned without the
earnings strength of the first quarter.  The index peak of 1,131 was
reached on June 6, with a historic P/E we calculate at around 18 and a
price/book value ratio of around 180%.

The outlook for further gains is favorable, as the same positive factors
will continue to operate in the market in the third quarter:

* strong earnings growth for most companies in 1991 combined with
better-than-expected GDP growth (higher than 4%);

* continued price flexibility under the Pact, permitting higher operating
and net profit margins;

* further reductions in nominal and real interest rates despite the current
blip (see MARKETS);

* continued foreign investment in the Mexican market; and

* ongoing improvements in capital market mechanisms.

Factors that could put a brake on stock prices include an increase in the
number of new stock issues, or a diversion of repatriated Mexican capital
away from the stock market and into bank privatizations.  However, on
most fundamental valuations, the Mexican market is still rated lower than
most Asian emerging markets with similar growth prospects.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Of the stocks in the MS portfolio, only two -- Cemex with 79% and
Ttolmex with 52% -- performed better than the average of 32% in the
second quarter.  The other stocks advanced as follows: Telmex 26%,
Cifra 25%, Kimberly 15%, and Codumex 6%.  Assuming an equal
weighting in each stock, this provides an average return of 34% against
the index average of 32%. Over the semester, the portfolio did even
better.  Stock gains have been: Cemex 210%, Ttolmex 121%, Telmex
92%, Cifra 60%, Kimberly 39%, and Codumex 38%.  Again equally
weighted, this would produce an average return of 93%, against the
market index of 68%.

Given the continued positive outlook for the market, we still recommend
retention of the existing portfolio at 30% (cost) in stocks.  We still have
not reached the point when out-of-favor stocks (Conglomerates, Mining,
Chemicals) will return to popularity: this could occur before our next
quarterly report, and we will advise readers accordingly.  Therefore, our
recommended peso stock portfolio remains invested in Cemex, Cifra,
Codumex, Kimberly, Telmex, and Ttolmex.

By Georges, they're gorgeous!

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 1

By Hisham Harun

WHEN my two friends and I were invited by French fashion export agent
Beatrice Bostyn to view several items from Georges Rech's latest
Fall/Winter accessory collection from Paris, we didn't quite expect to be
thoroughly bowled over.
  So what if Rech was famed for integrating creativity with realism, or
that he was one of the pioneers to revolutionise ready-to-wear in the
early 60s... we've seen so many great designs by numerous top couturiers
and so how much different could Rech be?
  Then we saw his new line of bags, scarves, shoes and jewellery which
were simply displayed on Bostyn's hotel room bed. We were captivated, to
say the least. Why, we even picked up some items with intent to buy.
  Sweet as she was, however, the marketing executive who had brought the
items down with her couldn't help us here as she was assigned by her
company, Anne Mucci, to look for potential Georges Rech distributors in
this region.
  The items Bostyn had brought with her would have to follow her to the
next destination, Singapore, and then later to Hong Kong and "a few other
places" before going back to the world's fashion capital.
  So there we were, clinging on to some of the most vibrant flowy floral
silk scarves, jewellery pieces, bags and shoes, feeling a tad
disappointed.
  Under Rech's establishment, big and bold jewellery that belonged to the
80s looked nonetheless elegant and classy.
  The smaller, simpler pieces looked chic and sophisticated while the more
artistic, almost avant garde ones, were contemporary, fun, stylish and
most importantly, still wearable.
  Rech's jewellery - that formed bracelets, necklaces and earrings - took
on basic oval, round or square shapes and came either in matte silver or
gold. Onyx and sparkling clear Swarovsky crystals were the main stones
used.
  The belts were mostly slim, and came in shades of brown and black with
silver and gold detailing as well as the popular GR logo that didn't seem
too loud or overbearing but gelled naturally with the overall look.
  In keeping with current trends, one could see that Rech also included
Prada-like buckles and the ever-popular Paloma Picasso criss-cross in his
range.
  Both the shoes and belts collection in ebony conformed to the minimalist
requirements of all that's classic and refined.
  Besides the generous flower prints, most of his designs for the scarves
were presented in a delicious offering of brown and red hues. Ribbons and
fruits were also the main focus.

Your last chance to catch `Tanah Abang'

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 4

By Shuib Taib

TANAH Abang, a period play produced by Panggung Negara, will end its run
at Auditorium DBKL tomorrow. The curtain rises at 8.30pm.
  Tickets priced at RM10 can be obtained from Panggung Negara (tel:
2943022) or Matic (tel: 2643929).
  Scripted and directed by Onie Moraza, Tanah Abang tells of the British
intervention in the administration of Perak in 1528. In order to
strengthen his position, Sultan Muzaffar Shah (played by Karim Latiff)
decides to marry Tun Merah (Erma Fatima) and make her the new queen.
  However, his intention is misconstrued. Tun Merah's parents and brother
think he only wants her to fulfil his sexual needs, thus making her a
gundek or mistress. Tun Merah is naturally disgusted by the thought.
Besides, she has a long-time fiance.
  Also in the cast are veteran actor Zulkifli Zain who plays Megat
Terawis, Sidek Husin (Anjang), Mustafa Abu Bakar (Pedro) and Wan Norazlin
(Tun Perabu).

Just think: Childers, a true servant of justice

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

By Chandra Muzaffar

ONE of the most courageous and eloquent voices in the eternal struggle for
a just world is silent.
  Erskine Childers died of a heart attack on Aug 25 in Luxembourg hours
after making an impassioned speech on his favourite theme - the importance
of UN reform - at the 50th anniversary congress of the World Federation of
United Nations Associations (WFUNA) of which he was Secretary-General. He
was 67.
  In the last few years of his life, Childers campaigned with relentless
vigour for a United Nations which in its structure and content would
reflect the interests of the majority of humankind.
  He wanted the UN General Assembly in particular strengthened because it
was that one political organ in the UN system that, theoretically at
least, treated each and every member state as an equal.
  But the UN, he argued, should go beyond the nation state. It should,
through the creation of a new tier, give real meaning to that fundamental
concept embodied in the UN Charter, namely, "We, the peoples of the United
Nations."
  It was one of his great sorrows that the UN had been hijacked by the
powerful in the North, especially after the 1991 Gulf War. It was being
used against the nations of the South.
  For Childers, the UN was vital for the well-being of the South or the
Third World. It gave them the collective security that they needed in a
world dominated by the elites of the North.
  In a 1993 essay, essay he noted that, "The arrival of the Third World in
the United Nations ... was a truly epochal, history-making moment ... for
the whole of humankind ... For it was the first moment in the entire
history of human life on this planet when all of its societies could meet
in one place, supposedly on terms of equality and mutual respect among
nations large and small, to strengthen common standards of behaviour and
to develop and then implement all across the world common programmes for
peace, justice, and social and economic equity."
  But Childers knew that if the UN had failed to realise the aspirations
of the people of the South, it was because the entire international system
was weighed against the interests of the majority of humankind.
  The intellectual, economic and social, and political frameworks had been
established in such a manner that they facilitated the dominance of the
world by a small minority located largely in the West.
  Western intellectual domination, for instance, "closed down, placed in a
straitjacket, all indigenous processes of intellectual enquiry and
evolution of political and social institutions of most of humankind...
Whole peoples were taught that nothing in their culture, however long
proven and however vibrant, was any longer worth anything; that the only
way to that condition called `progress' was to learn from their colonial
masters."
  As he lamented the intellectual suppression of the South, so did
Childers lambast the gross iniquities in the economic and social relations
between the North and the South.
  He was never tired of highlighting that indisputable fact that in the
Nineties, the 20 per cent Northern minority controls 82.7 per cent of
world gross national product; 81.2 per cent of world trade; 80.5 per cent
of domestic investment; and 94 per cent of research and development.
  Childers would often quote the UN Development Programme which has
calculated that "the developing countries are losing over US$500 billion a
year in income that they could earn, because of protectionist barriers
against the exports they try to sell to the North, because of Northern
manipulation of interest rates on their borrowings, and because of other
structural inequities between the North and the South. That is to say that
the policies of Northern governments are preventing the developing
countries from earning 10 times all the official aid they receive from the
North."
  For Childers, the political framework of the North-South divide was also
a major cause of global tensions and conflicts.
  He bemoaned "the imperial legacy of grafting the western centralist
nation state onto every society in the world, whether or not that
structure had the remotest relevance or "fit" to the value-systems of a
given culture."
  It is partly because of this that ethnic conflagrations continue to
break out every now and then in many post-colonial societies.
  These conflagrations deeply troubled Childers which is why he often
implored the UN to develop mechanisms that could deal with ethnic and
cultural conflicts.
  The UN - its shortcomings notwithstanding - had a very special place in
Childers' heart for it was in the UN that he built his career.
  He joined the UN secretariat in 1967 and worked with almost every organ
and agency within the UN system in different parts of the world for 22
years.
  His last UN post was that of Senior Adviser to the UN Director for
Development and International Economic Cooperation.
  After his retirement, he continued to travel all over the world talking
and writing about global injustices with that passion and commitment that
was his trademark.
  It was at one such conference on UN intervention and national
sovereignty in Sigtuna, Sweden in May 1992 that I first met with Erskine
Childers.
  We met a couple of times after that and corresponded with one another.
  When Just World Trust (JUST) established an International Advisory
Panel, he was one of the first persons I approached to become a member. He
accepted the invitation with much enthusiasm.
  Later, in December 1994, he was one of the main speakers at the JUST
international conference on "Rethinking Human Rights" in Kuala Lumpur.
  At the conference and in a television interview I did with him, Childers
spoke in great detail about how crucial it was to organise and mobilise
the South to fight the injustices in the global system.
  Indeed, fighting for justice was in the genes of the man. His
grandfather was a revolutionary who gave his life for the cause of Irish
freedom.
  Executed by the British in 1992 for treason, Erskine Childers won
international fame as the author of the classic, The Riddle of the Sands.
  His son, also Erskine Childers, became President of Ireland and was also
a steadfast advocate of social justice.
  It is one of the sad ironies of life that the second Erskine Childers
also died after delivering a speech.
  Coming from a family with such a strong love for justice, was it any
wonder that the third Erskine Childers took up cudgels on behalf of the
oppressed and the downtrodden?
  It is significant in this regard that the cause that first attracted the
energy of the young Childers was Palestine.
  His first book, Common Sense about the Arab World, was a product of this
commitment. His second book, The Road To Suez: A Study In Western-Arab
Relations, expanded the ideas in the first book and articulated profound
concerns about inter-civilisational ties which remained dear to Childers
till the end of his life.
  In more specific language, Childers felt that the West has been terribly
unjust in its treatment of Arab, and, in a larger sense, Islamic
civilisation.
  The West has to this day sought to block out its collective
consciousness its immeasurable debt to the Arabs and Muslims for "the very
rise of Western civilisation itself".
  Childers called this "the largest self-induced amnesia in human
history".
  His incisive analysis of this phenomenon is contained in one of his most
brilliant essays entitled "Amnesia and Antagonism" which JUST helped to
distribute worldwide.
  In it Childers employs meticulous scholarship to illustrate how in
almost every sphere of human activity, Europe borrowed heavily from Arab
and Muslim sources.
  From medicine and mathematics to architecture and the arts to government
and commerce, the European Renaissance absorbed a whole variety of ideas
and institutions from the Islamic world.
  As an example, Childers observes that, "The million word Qanun of Ibn-
Sina (980-1037) cataloguing all then-known ailments, diseases and their
treatments, was the prime textbook of the new medical schools at Paris,
Bologna, Montpellier, Padua and Naples and continued in use until the
early eighteenth century."
  The adamant, arrogant refusal to acknowledge the pervasive influence and
impact of Islam upon the West was not the only injustice which concerned
Childers; in the interface between the two civilisations, the West has
also displayed a great deal of antagonism towards Islam.
  He attributes Western antagonism to theological differences, to the
Muslim occupation of parts of Europe, to the Crusades, to colonialism, and
to contemporary neo-colonial interests.
  It is mainly because of the desire of the centres of power in the West
to protect and perpetuate their economic interests, specifically oil, that
certain important Western governments pursue foreign policies that are so
palpably unjust to the Muslim world - especially those countries that are
determined to preserve their independence and autonomy.
  Childers regarded this as a formidable obstacle to any Western-Islamic
dialogue.
  In fact, he believed that, "The dissolution of the Russian-Soviet empire
has released the West from its historically brief fixation with that
particular "East", just as its concerns with its original demon-East -
Islam - have begun a new cycle of volatitily."
  In order to break this volatile cycle, the West, Childers was convinced,
should try to be just and fair to Islam and Muslims.
  Whether it was the relationship between the West and Islam or the divide
between the North and the South, Erskine Childers' paramount
consideration, it is apparent, was justice. It is, in that sense, that he
was a true servant of justice with very few parallels in the modern world.

Bolshoi Ballet set to mesmerise KL folk

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 5

By Hafidah Samat

IT isn't everyday that Sleeping Beauty wakes up to paint the town red. But
the Bolshoi Ballet of Tashkent is offering nothing less with their
mesmerising performances when they stage a three-act ballet of the 19th-
century classic Sleeping Beauty, in Kuala Lumpur.
  The performance, which will be taking centrestage for two days starting
Oct 31, is organised by Event Management (EM) Consultants Sdn Bhd in
collaboration with MAA-Medicare Kidney Charity Fund.
  To formalise the understanding between MAA-Medicare and EM Management
Consultants Sdn Bhd, a memorandum was signed recently.
  Signing on behalf of MAA-Medicare was Datuk Lee Lam Thye, a member of
the Board of Trustees, while EM Consultants was represented by its
managing director, Syed Isa Syed Alwi.
  According to Lee, the primary aim of the MAA-Medicare Kidney Charity
Fund is to provide more affordable dialysis treament to patients
throughout the nation.
  "In only one-and-half-years, we have successfully set up three charity
dialysis centres which are located in Kuala Lumpur, Teluk Intan and
Butterworth," he adds.
  The largest is the one in KL which is treating 89 patients and has 19
haemodialysis machines. The Teluk Intan branch has seven machines and
treats 14 patients, while the Butterworth branch, which was launched in
May, is treating seven patients with five machines.
  "Our efforts have benefited more than 110 patients who are charged RM99
per bicarbonate treatment. This is much cheaper than those charged by
private clinics and hospitals which are between RM150-RM250 per
treatment," says Lee.
  According to Lee the urgent need for more charity centres is evident as
insufficient funds and the lack of machines have caused many unnecessary
deaths.
  "These projects require huge funding. Besides appealing to corporate
bodies and the public for financial support, we are open to co-operating
with any party to organise fund-raising activities," says Lee.
  And of course, one such event will be the Bolshoi Ballet's performances
in KL. According to Syed Isa, the 120-member troupe will include 40
orchestra musicians and 53 dancers.
  "The Bolshoi Ballet is in the middle of its Asian tour and Malaysia will
mark its first stop," says Syed Isa.
  "We strongly feel that this cultural exposure will enable Malaysians to
witness world-class performances ...
  "We will ensure that its two-hour show is going to be entirely different
from any other ballet performance," say Syed Isa.
  All proceeds from the performances will be forwarded to MAA-Medicare
Kidney Charity Fund.
  "We hope to donate about RM500,000 to the fund, but this depends on the
ticket collection," says Syed Isa.
  The production of Sleeping Beauty was first staged in St Petersburg in
1890 and was adapted from Charles Perrault's fairy tale.
  Tickets for the charity premier show on Oct 31 are priced at RM250,
RM350, RM550 and RM800. Tickets for the performance on Nov 1 are priced at
RM180, RM250, RM450 and RM800.
  For corporate bodies, tickets can be purchased in various packages of
differing amounts and privileges.
  For futher information, call Abdul Aziz of EM Consultants Sdn Bhd at 03-
9811129 or MAA-Medicare Kidney Charity Fund at 03-4447906.

Music magic from piano duo

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 5

By Shuib Taib

WHEN you are on your own in a foreign land, the will to "carry on"
inevitably becomes stronger despite the odds.
  Take Dennis Lee, for instance. Born in Penang, the professional pianist
has come a long way since the first time he played the piano. Like most
professional musicians, Lee also had to sit for one exam after another to
upgrade himself.
  At 14, Lee won a scholarship to study piano - with Angus Morrison - and
violin at the Royal College of Music. Having obtained his Bachelor of
Music with First Class Honours and his Masters of Music, he then received
an Austrian government scholarship to study with Joseph Dichler in Vienna
where he earned both the Akademie Diploma with Distinction and the
Stepanow Prize.
  And when he was in Venice, Lee had to continue his piano lessons in
Milan. He had no money then.
  "Then again, music has nothing to do with economics. It's not only for
the rich, and no one should be deprived of it," chips in his wife, Toh
Chee Hung.
  Lee, who was penniless at the time somehow managed to find his way to
Milan for his practices. This he did religiously until he completed his
course.
  "I think music is magic. It is multi-functional and can help train your
mind. It teaches you to be disciplined, helps you to co-ordinate and to
use your five senses to your advantage," says Lee.
  It was also in Milan that Lee met his wife, Toh.
  "You could say that, for us, Europe is where it all happened. Musically
speaking, it's where classical music began and it is also where we first
met." While Lee had to travel from Venice to Milan, Toh travelled from
Switzerland for her piano lessons with the same 95-year-old teacher named
Kodaly.
  "For geographical reasons, we are now based in London as it's difficult
to stay in Asia and travel to Europe regularly to fulfil engagements,"
explains Toh.
  Like Lee, Toh also sat for many examinations and won many prizes. Born
in Singapore, Toh studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London under
Max Pirani. She then won the Sterndale Bennett Prize, Christie Moore Award
and MacFarren Gold Medal (the top piano prize).
  She has also made recordings that have been aired worldwide over the BBC
World Service. Before finally residing in London, she held various
professional posts in Switzerland.
  While Lee has performed in Washington DC, Japan, Malta, France, Germany,
Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong, Toh has toured Britain, US, Canada,
Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark and the Far East.
  Their 1996 appearances include performances in France, Italy, US,
Canada, Malaysia and the Barbican Centre in London.
  Lee and Toh are in Malaysia for a series of special performances - two
held over the weekend in Ipoh and Penang and the third tomorrow - called
"Piano Duo" where, for the first time, they are featured side by side.
  Although it is rare to see two pianists playing simultaneously, Lee says
that "it should be interesting to hear different interpretations of the
same melodies. We will do four songs together and one solo piece each".
  "You will hear stereo-phonic sound and it should also be interesting to
see two people in action at the same time."
  Their final performance will be held tomorrow at the Petaling Jaya Civic
Centre at 8pm. Tickets, priced at RM30, can be obtained from Yamaha Music
branches in Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya as well as Sedaya Music College
and L & J Music Studio, Old Klang Road.

First person: Why some films turn me into a wretched sob queen

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 7

By Saleha Ali

I TRIED but I still cried.
  Okay, if you must know, movies have a way of affecting me up close and
personal. Forget about self control, the tears will just roll.
  Last week, I found myself weeping unabashedly in the theatre (yet
again!) as this guy puffed his last breath in the arms of his lady,
stricken as he was with some malignant brain disease.
  I wasn't sure who was more devastated, me or the silver screen blonde.
As I stumbled out of the darkened cinema, I remembered why I had vowed to
see tear-jerkers only in the safe haven of the living room.
  You see, once the lights go up and reality bites, red puffy eyes are
just a no-no.
  This crying game will strike when you least expect it too. For instance,
is Independence Day a heartrending tale? Far from it, right?
  Hmmm, that was what I thought. No prizes for guessing who left the
cineplex with a wrung-out heart and an all-night sniffle after seeing the
newly-widowed US President holding on to his little daughter for strength.
  On assignment in Singapore some time ago, I caught a movie called Bright
Lights Big City, about a young man coming to terms with his mother's
impending death from cancer.
  That struck too close to home. A colleague, Joan, who shared the same
experience, broke down in floods too.
  Boy, was I glad I was home alone when I saw The Joy Luck Club. Grief
struck at almost every juncture and at the end of it, I felt faintly
dehydrated.
  The film, on the lives of four courageous women and their rapport with
their daughters, was only too reminiscent of my sometimes turbulent
relationship with my late mother.
  I saw my enterprising, take-the-bull-by-the-horns Mak in the mothers and
caught glimpses of the hurting child that I used to be in the daughters.
  You see, because of Mak's constant chidings (she used to think I was the
world's greatest procrastinator), I thought she loved me least until I saw
her hastily wiping away tears when I made my maiden voyage to KL to attend
college years ago.
  Altitute doesn't help matters, I have discovered. The watertap can still
flow some 15,000km above sea level.
  I recall seeing several in-flight movies which left me completely
bereft. One was Father Of The Bride II (I know, I know!).
  You see, while it had a good dosage of Steve Martin's hilarity, there
were also plenty of tender father-daughter bonding scenes, not unlike
moments when my dad carried me on his back at age five to do some awesome
underwater swimming and gave me the thumbs-up when I brought home my first
domestic science achievement - a wobbly concoction called cornflour mould.
  The list goes on. Watching The Mambo Kings turned me into a wretched sob
queen. It was seeing the sacrifices that the older sibling made to keep
the younger one afloat that got me.
  Another film, Mr Wonderful, about a couple who separate only to discover
that there are many invisible threads holding them together, sadly
reminded me of ... well, never mind.
  So, you get the picture. Tales of family, loss of a loved one, human
bonding, unrequited love, injustice and missed opportunities touch me in
the raw.
  I wish sometimes that I could crow along to Jim Carrey's antics but
slapstick humour leaves me cold. No, you would not find me buying popcorn
in readiness for an Ace Ventura evening.
  Nor am I inclined to drool over brawny Arnie Schwarzenegger in The
Terminator or hunky Bruce Willis in the Die Hard series.
  But I relish feature films which are warm and witty, with a pulse on
real life situations. I appreciate lines which remind us of something or
someone.
  But then again, these are the very movies which can ruthlessly peel away
at the layers of armour we wear to shield off the elements.
  I would like to think it is all therapeutic, this blubbering and losing
all sense and sensibility watching films like Sleepless In Seattle, French
Kiss and Forget Paris, not to speak of the out-and-out "heavies" like
Cyrano De Bergerac and The Scarlet Letter.
  But it has made me distinctly wary of even titles like Pinocchio and The
Hunchback of Notre Dame....!

Enlightening on AIDS

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 9

By Cheah Chor Sooi

THE deadly HIV/AIDS is the cover story for this month's issue of Jelita.
  Writer Lily Haslina Nasir interviews Health Ministry Public Health
Department AIDS/HIV Division deputy director Datin Dr Harrison Aziz
Shahabuddin as well as Tenaganita director Irene Fernandez on the issue.
  They agree that every woman should have the right to question her hubby
if she is doubtful of his health status.
  "The present mind frame that the decision to pursue sexual intercourse
lies with the man should change.
  "Women have the right to probe if they become suspicious of their
spouse's movements. The truth is, it has become more difficult these days
to ascertain if one party has remained faithful to the other."
  Jelita relates the first-hand experiences of women who have fallen prey
to the disease because of their husbands' infidelity.
  Early detection helps greatly to counter the spread of the disease. Find
out the necessary steps to take if the medical check-up shows that you are
a carrier or have contracted AIDS.
  There is also a list of counselling bodies and voluntary organisations
that can lend a hand to ease suffering.
  In the world of dresses, view the elegant kebaya and baju kurung made
contemporary after being fashioned from silk and batik.
  For those taking exams, Jelita gives tips on how to get good grades.
  Annual subscription rate for Jelita is RM64.30 in Peninsular Malaysia
and RM84.30 for Sabah and Sarawak.
  Maxima cardmembers enjoy a special subscription rate of RM56.20 for
Peninsular Malaysia and RM73.70 for Sabah and Sarawak.

By Azura Abas

CULTURAL EXTRAVAGANZA ... Nonrinji Mantuku from the Rungus tribe was a
star attraction with her bead work at the "Mini Sabah" promotion at the
Sungai Wang Plaza in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
  The promotion was among a host of cultural activities held in
conjunction with Malaysia Fest which was launched on Saturday night.
  Mantuku, 36, from Kudat, a full-time beads stringer in her village,
said: "It only takes me a day to string beads with simple patterns while
it takes almost a week to complete those with difficult patterns."
  She learnt it from her mother when she was only 10 and hopes her six
daughters will continue the colourful tradition. Beads are the main
decorative items of the tribal women.
  Other attractions of the promotion included demonstrations on making the
Kota Belud parang or machete, Tandek rattan mat, Ranau tree bark yarn,
Nabawan bag and Kota Merudu basket-weaving.
  The 15-day promotion was launched by Sabah Tourism and Environmental
Assistant Minister Nahalan Damsal.
  Meanwhile in Petaling Jaya, the Pahang Government launched its Cultural
and Arts Festival under the theme "Treasures of Pahang".
  State Culture and Arts Committee chairman Datuk Law Kee Long launched
the festival using a traditional blow-pipe to burst a balloon filled with
coloured particles at the foyer of Subang Parade shopping complex.
  It was then followed by an Orang Asli dance and several cultural dances
staged by a State cultural group.

KL to play major role in R&D of renewable energy resources

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 1

By Syed Nadzri in Harare

MALAYSIA will play a major role in the development of renewable energy
resources in the absence of a strong commitment from the West towards
international efforts in this area.
  Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the country was
always prepared to be at the forefront of research and development
strategies to counter depleting energy sources.
  "We are showing our commitment and will continue with our efforts," he
told reporters after attending an investment briefing at the Zimbabwe
Industrial Corporation office yesterday.
  Dr Mahathir's affirmation came a day after he was appointed vice-
president of the World Solar Commission which is organising the Second
World Solar Summit here from today.
  He is one of the two vice-presidents of the commission headed by
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe. The other is Pakistani President Farouq
Ahmad Khan Leghari.
  The presence of Dr Mahathir and Leghari added the only sparkle to the
otherwise lacklustre summit which was supposed to be attended by no less
than 14 heads of government.
  Asked on the poor turnout, especially the absence of leaders from
developed countries, Dr Mahathir said he could not find a clear reason.
  "Maybe they are not interested in solar energy," he quipped.
  The Prime Minister was also asked whether the commission would face
problems due to lack of financial support from the richer countries.
  He admitted that development efforts would be a little difficult because
"people with funds are not too keen".
  Later in the afternoon, he witnessed the signing of investment
agreements involving YTL Corporation which has won the privatisation
contract of a power station at Hwange.
  Asked on the role of Malaysian companies in the development of Zimbabwe,
the Prime Minister said the firms could contribute effectively based on
their experiences in Malaysia which had trodden Zimbabwe's path before.
  "Zimbabwe is at the begining of an industrial process and this is
somewhat similiar to what Malaysia went through several years ago.
  "At the moment, Malaysian companies are concentrating on infrastructure
development. Once this is achieved, they will venture into other areas,
especially labour-intensive industries," he said.

Interview checklist

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By Nor Azlina Abdul Wahab

YOU can't escape them. For most of us anyway. For employment or enrolment
in a tertiary institution, the interview can determine, in a large part,
your acceptance or rejection by the other party.
  In an interview, which is a face-to-face meeting, communication skills
are required. This is not as complicated as it sounds. You won't need to
attend classes to acquire such skills. What would be useful is a checklist
of what you would need, and need to avoid.
  Before the interview, make sure you:
  * Confirm your attendance by calling up the organisation or sending the
reply cards if required.
  * Find out the exact location of the interview prior to the session so
that you will know your way around on the big day.
  * Read and find out more about the job or course that you are applying
for and the organisation or the institution involved.
  * Prepare the relevant documents in a file. Don't have them folded or
stapled together.
  * Prepare intelligent questions, such as "What are the job/course
prospects?"
  * Prepare the correct attire and be presentable. Avoid wearing colours
that are too bright. Try to wear soft, but not dull, colours. Avoid jeans
or T-shirts.
  * Arrive early and act in a proper manner while waiting for your turn.
  During the interview:
  * Do knock on the door before entering unless the door is being opened
for you.
  * Do greet the interviewers appropriately and wait until you are asked
to be seated. Sit straight, but not stiffly with your hands folded over
defensively.
  * Do watch your body language. Avoid habits such as picking your nose or
biting your nails.
  * Do relax and answer positively but politely. Avoid answering with a
simple "yes" or "no". Try to use "Usually, but...", or "Yes, unless...",
or even "It depends on what you mean by..."
  * Do take the chance given to ask questions.
  * Do watch out for the interviewer's tricks. Try not to be angry easily.
Furthermore, do not curse in any language.
  * Do thank the interviewer for seeing you when leaving.
  Even though the qualities that interviewers look for differ depending on
the situation, there are a few aspects that are usually evaluated. These
are:
  * Physical appearance, which includes your dressing.
  * General knowledge.
  * Special skills that you have.
  * Personal interests.
  * Your attainments.
  This may not be the A to Z guide on interviews, but it is a basic
checklist for that all-important date.

Health threat from poor alien worker screening methods

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 1

By Ramlan Said

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The Malaysian Medical Association today expressed
concern over weaknesses in the health screening procedures for foreign
workers which are posing a threat to public health.
  Dr Tibbs Fernandez, chairman of its Private Practitioners Section, said
this was the reason behind the increase in cases of communicable and
contagious diseases in the country, some of which had for years been
successfully controlled or eradicated.
  Public health would be at risk as the diseases were contractable, he
added.
  He said reported cases like malaria, tuberculosis and elephantiasis at
government hospitals among foreign workers were disproportionate to their
population in Malaysia, indicating the seriousness of the problem.
  He said even diseases that had never been seen or detected for a long
time in Malaysia like kala-azar had surfaced. Kala-azar is a viral
infection which causes inflamation of the liver.
  "No doubt the country's development is partly dependent on foreign
workers but it should not be at the expense of public health."
  There are about two million foreign workers in Malaysia.
  Dr Fernandez was speaking to reporters after chairing the section's
first national working committee at Bangunan MMA. Also present was MMA
president-elect, Dr Milton Lum.
  Dr Fernandez said the diseases were most probably brought in by foreign
workers who came mostly from less developed countries with inferior public
health systems.
  He said the problem could be overcome through a concerted and systematic
approach from the authorities, like stricter enforcement especially in
nabbing illegals and enhancing screening procedures.
  "For instance, one problem that can be ironed out is the refusal by some
Immigration Department offices to use a medical examination form with a
new format for foreign workers although the Health Ministry and MMA have
agreed on it."
  Dr Fernandez said the council had tried to solve the matter with the
Task Force on Foreign Workers but was unsuccessful.
  He also said medical tests for foreign workers should not be monopolised
by certain groups. He declined to elaborate on the matter.
  Dr Fernandez added that MMA fully supported action against those found
manipulating medical tests for foreign workers, even if it involved
private doctors and laboratories.
  "The medical screening exercise is time-consuming and costly especially
for employers.
  "But we can't afford to cut corners as the consequences would be
disastrous."
  A standard medical test for a male and female foreign worker costs RM205
and RM220 respectively.
  Dr Fernandez said the council viewed with concern the danger posed by
the foreign workers, especially those who entered illegally as the latter
were not subject to any health screening tests.
  "If left unchecked, it can turn into a national security problem.
  "Nobody knows the exact number of the illegals, so the magnitude of the
problem could be far worse.
  "We fear we will reach a stage where diseases like malaria and
tuberculosis can be easily contracted by, or passed to, the public."

Picture perfect: Caring for the camera

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By Zahari Zakaria

BESIDES picture-taking accessories, a complete photographic outfit should
contain a range of accessories for maintaining and repairing equipment.
  Like any equipment, cameras and lenses need a certain amount of
attention if they are to continue functioning accurately.
  Heavy use, particulary on location, inevitably causes wear and tear, and
certain moving parts, optical surfaces and integrated circuitry are
sufficiently delicate to be affected by dirt, moisture, heat and cold.
  The basic maintenance programmes consist of care in use, regular
cleaning and regular checks of major systems. In addition, damage may be
repaired by the user, although this should be approached with caution.
  Regular checking of all camera functions is an important precaution.
Familiarity with the sound, feel and appearance of the mechanisms makes it
easier to identify potential faults and can be an aid to repair. A good
occasion is when the camera is empty.
  There are, in most cameras, five major systems in the camera body -
shutter, wind-on, mirror box, viewfinder and metering, and three in the
lens - focusing, aperture diaphragm and aperture lingkage.
  The slower speeds of the shutter can be checked visually by opening the
camera back, holding the camera to the light and triggering the shutter
from its slowest speed to its highest.
  Speeds of about half a second and longer can be timed, while
progressively reducing the speed-setting makes it possible to judge speeds
even to about 1/125 second, as each should appear to be about one half the
duration of the previous one. Faster speeds cannot be reliably assessed by
the eye.
  The winding mechanism should feel and sound smooth and an additional
check is to watch the movement of the film leader when a new cassette is
installed. In use, the rewind lever on a 35mm single lens reflex will
move, although not necessarily each time the film is moved on.
  The mirror operation in a single lens reflex can be checked from the
front with the lens removed, both during normal operation and by moving
the mirror lock-up lever fitted to some models.
  Any significant problems in the viewfinder system will be immediately
obvious, but the seating of the viewing screen should be checked by
inspection.
  Any optical faults in the viewfinder which might affect accurate
focusing can also be checked by opening the shutter and the camera back,
fitting a lens and focusing an image on a piece of tracing paper held
against the open shutter.
  This should compare with the focus as seen through the viewfinder. The
best immediate check of the metering system is to compare it against
readings from at least one other meter.
  Two likely lens-focusing faults are a slack mechanism and lateral
movements, and both can occur through extended wear and tear.
  The first can be checked by holding the lens face down and watching it
to see if the focusing bow slips down under its own weight.
  Lateral movement can be seen through the viewfinder while shifting the
focus; it does not effect the recorded image but is distracting.
  The aperture diaphragm should be checked visually, with the lens both on
and off the camera, for smooth operation and to make sure that it stops
down to the full range of apertures.
  Careful handling of photographic equipment under normal circumstances
can be vital to avoid later problems or damage. Both front and rear lens
surfaces, and the body aperture can be protected with caps and clear glass
filter.
  When carried, equipment should be packed carefully. In use, moving
controls like the cocking lever and the rewind lever should be operated
smoothly and without straining.
  In storage, tensioned parts, which include the shutter mechanism and the
full automatic diaphragm (FAD) should be left slack.
  Equipment should be regularly serviced by professionals. A well-used
camera, for instance, should be serviced at least once a year.

company's products. Though regular checking of all camera functions is an
important precaution, the equipment should be regularly serviced by
professionals.

By Farouk Aziz Peru

ONE of the kings of France was a vicious and cruel man. He loved torturing
his enemies to death and his favourite method was to wrap them up in
animal skin, let them escape and hunt them down with dogs, letting the
animals tear them to pieces.
  For all his cruelty, however, he was also fascinated by animals. He kept
an elephant, monkeys and bears. He had a tame lioness even, which he often
took with him as he travelled throughout his kingdom.
  His weirdness reached new heights when he asked the Abbot of Baigne, a
local cleric, to produce a concert using swine voices.
  The abbot (who was probably used to the king's nonsense) agreed and
asked for a sum of money which was immediately delivered to him.
  He gathered hogs of all ages and got them together under a tent. He kept
them under a cover of velvet and made an organ out of them.
  How?
  His "keys" to the organ were little spikes which pricked the hogs on
command. Apparently he delighted the king and his companions that day.
  About 400 years later, the instrument created by the abbot was adapted
by the inventor of the so-called Porco-Forte.
  This device, however, was a little different. The pigs were put in a
partitioned box and their tails projected through holes.
  With a keyboard mechanism, the tails were pinched to produce a
harmonious range of oinks.

HERE is a relaxation method for those who feel tense after a hard day's
work or at school. It may seem a little strange to do it at first but if
you keep at it, you'll find yourself more energetic and relaxed than ever
before:
  Do a little stretching before the exercise. Gently please! No bouncing
and forced stretching which can only heighten tension.
  Find a place free of interruptions. Loosen all clothing and remove
watches, belts and glasses.
  Lie down and close your eyes. Feel the heaviness in your body. Feel your
body melting into the ground. Breathe deeply. Again, no forced efforts.
Breathe as deeply as you possibly can.
  Keep this breathing up for another two minutes.
  Now curl your toes up as  tightly as possible. Hold to a count of five.
At that point release and relax. Feel the difference?
  Next, tense up the muscles in your lower legs like the feet, calves as
well as the toes. Count to five and release. Enjoy the feeling.
  Next, tense up the muscles in the upper as well as lower part of the
legs. When you feel the tension, tense them a little more. Count slowly to
five and release. As usual, enjoy the feeling.
  Then tense up the buttocks, lower back and abdomen. Hold for a count of
five and release.
  The upper torso such as the shoulders hold a lot more tension. When you
tense them, do so more than for the other parts of the body. Hold for a
count of five and release.
  Now, tense up your arms. Hold them for a count of five. Release and let
them hang loose at your side.
  Squeeze the muscles of your face like your jaw, cheeks and scalp. Hold
for a count of five and as usual, release. Feel the relaxation in every
part of your face. This exercise makes you look younger!
  Now tense your entire body, starting with your toes and working your way
up. Hold for a count of five. Now relax. Unwind. Release. Let go. Mentally
scan your body for any tense parts and relax that body part.
  Now count to five slowly. At the end of the count, open your eyes. Keep
up the practice and your sense of well-being will experience a dramatic
increase.

Towards more open education (HL)

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 1

By A. Kathirasen; Noor Adzman Baharuddin

PENANG, Sun. - A more open education with stress on critical and creative
thinking, and the atmosphere to voice them, is needed for Malaysia to
progress in the information age, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim said today.
  He added that Malaysia could not afford a copycat mentality, especially
in the field of science and technology, if it wanted to progress and
compete in the global arena.
  "We need in Malaysia today an education which is open; where people can
voice their views, offer and accept criticism while being committed to
acquiring a diverse range of knowledge and skills.
  "We need to master new skills and disciplines to progress. A country
will not progress if its knowledge is copycat knowledge; if its
scientists, experts and knowledgeable persons simply copy what others have
said and done.
  "We must have innovative technology, creative minds and critical
thinking for society to progress."
  In this context, he said, it was also important to master the English
language.
  Anwar said this when launching the Penang Free School Foundation at the
PFS hall this afternoon. Also present were Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh
Tsu Koon, PFS Foundation chairman Tan Sri Mohd Sheriff Mohd Kassim, old
boys Tengku Datuk Ahmad Rithauddeen and Tan Sri Elyas Omar, and PFS
principal Mohd Ismail Ibramsa.
  "We want Malaysians to master Bahasa Malaysia. It is the national
language. But we also want Malaysians to master other languages,
especially English. While we maintain Bahasa Malaysia as our national
base, our attitude should be global. This means better mastery of
English."
  He said many Malaysians wanted to learn various languages. Mandarin, for
instance, was now being encouraged as it had potential to be a language of
the economy. More people were picking up Tamil too, just as an increasing
number are learning Japanese, French and German, he added.
  "Mastery of other languages would not obstruct the usage of Bahasa
Malaysia or result in the sacrifice of Bahasa Malaysia. We are promoting
English after being satisfied and convinced that the promotion of Bahasa
Malaysia will proceed undisturbed at a greater pace."
  He said the country could progress only if it pursued a more open policy
and encouraged the mastery of English and other languages so that more
knowledge could be derived from the mastery of these languages and used in
taking the country to greater heights.
  The Finance Minister said while academic excellence was important, it
should not be at the expense of the creation of a wholesome adult and the
inculcation of moral and religious ideas.
  "At present there is too much stress on our schoolchildren. Parents
appear obsessed with academic excellence - at the expense of the birth of
a wholesome man.
  "I do not deny that Malaysia needs academic excellence - that we need to
master new disciplines - but it should not stop there. Emphasis should be
placed on morality. Critical and creative thinking should be our goal too.
  "How can we progress if the thinking habit is absent, the love of
scholarship is not there?" he added.
  Anwar also reminded Malaysians of the need to temper material goals with
moral goals, adding: "There is excessive and unbridled individualism today
in our country. This has caused the downfall of many civilisations in the
past. If the motivation is materialistic and individualistic, we will be
in trouble. And that is why wholesome education is needed."
  The Deputy Prime Minister praised PFS, the oldest English school in the
Asean region, for coming up with the foundation and suggested that the
board prepare a list of all successful old boys and get them to contribute
to its fund.
  The foundation is a charitable organisation to raise and donate funds
for upgrading and improving the school and to carry out activities in the
interest of the school. Mohd Sheriff, who is also chief executive officer
of Khazanah Holdings, hopes to set up a RM5 million trust fund.
  Anwar later received RM494,000 in donations from various groups,
organisations and companies including RM375,000 from the Kuala Lumpur and
Selangor PFS old boys association headed by Mohd Sheriff, RM100,000 from
old boy Datuk Md Zain Yusof and his relatives and friends, RM34,000 from
PFS, and RM11,000 from Elyas.
  Earlier in Prai, Anwar urged politicians and community leaders to
encourage more youths to participate in team sports and recreational
activities.
  He said by doing so, they would not idle their time away, and could put
to good use their youth and strength towards racial harmony and nation-
building.
  "Let's stop nagging them on what they should do with their youth.
  "Instead, provide useful programmes and activities such as canoeing,
hill-climbing, jet-skiing and the various games and sports to them so that
they can participate actively as a team.
  "Also, don't just provide them with the programmes and activities that
can be participated by all, but we must also join them so that they can
fully understand why we are encouraging them to do so," he said after
participating in an eight-km canoeing competition along Sungai Prai, from
Titi Timbul in Sungai Dua to the Seberang Prai Municipal Council
recreational park in Ampang Jajar.
  It was organised by the State Youth and Sports Department to promote
Sungai Prai and the Ampang Jajar recreational park as a major watersports
centre in Seberang Prai.
  Also taking part among the 400 participants were Chief Minister Tan Sri
Dr Koh Tsu Koon, his deputy, Datuk Mohd Shariff Omar, State Land,
Entrepreneur and Co-operative Development Committee chairman Abdul Latiff
Mirasa and several State Assemblymen.
  Anwar also reminded schools against being too obsessed with achieving
academic excellence that they neglect or downplay the importance of sports
and athletics.
  Earlier when launching a cleanliness campaign in Jalan Tuna here, Anwar
said the Government would not budge from its policy in requiring housing
developers to build low-cost houses in their schemes.
  "We have to insist that they comply with the requirement (of building
low-cost houses in their schemes) since this is the only way to ensure the
poor can enjoy affordable housing," he said.
  More than 200 flat-dwellers took part in a gotong-royong, held in
conjunction with the ceremony.
  He also urged all developers to fully understand why it was necessary
for them to assist the Government in providing ample affordable housing
for the people.
  Anwar also took to task some residents, especially flat-dwellers, who
refused to participate in cleanliness campaigns organised in their
neighbourhoods.
  "It is for the good of all. Gotong royongs help ensure your surroundings
are clean besides fostering closer relationship among neighbours," he
said.
  Later, when witnessing the sale of 8.4ha land, valued at RM6.5 million,
belonging to the Sungai Pelet area farmers' organisation to JKP Sdn Bhd in
Penanti, Anwar praised the organisation for its efforts to venture into
non-agricultural activities which could bring bigger returns for its
members.
  JKP Sdn Bhd, a company formed by the State Bumiputera Steering and Co-
ordination Committee, plans to carry out a RM40 million mixed development
project on the land.
  The company was represented by its managing director Dr Zulkifli Hassan

Klang heartbeat: Motorcycle thefts getting serious

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By Annie Freeda Cruez

THEFTS of motorcycles are becoming a serious problem in Klang especially
with at least 150 of them being reported stolen every month for the past
few months.
  Strangely, there are many who are not reporting the theft of their
machines  to the police in the hope that they would recover their
motorcycles or for reasons only known to them.
  Klang district police chief Assistant Commissioner Aziz Ariarasa
Abdullah strongly feels thefts of motorcycles can be prevented if owners
are more responsible and take proper security measures.
  He said many of the motorcycles are stolen when the owners leave their
machines unattended with the keys still in the ignition, not properly
locked or in places known for such thefts.
  "There were even instances when thieves rode away with motorcycles after
the owners left their machines running while going into a shop to get
something," he said.
  "If people are more careful, many of the motorcycles would not have been
stolen."
  He said the public should take the initiative to protect and safeguard
their property.
  He said motorcycle thefts could be reduced only with the co-operation of
the owners who had to ensure their machines were always locked up
properly, possibly with additional security locks.
  Motorcycle thefts have been reportedly high at Kampung Delek, Berkeley
Garden, Taman Sentosa, Jalan Meru, Jalan Kapar, Bandar Sultan Sulaiman,
Jalan Kem and Taman Sri Muda.
  Most of these bikes, especially the brand RXZ Yamaha, were reported
stolen near flats and shopping complexes in the district.
  Aziz said the recovery rate of stolen motorcycles per month was about 15
to 20 per cent with many of them found abandoned along road sides and
recovered during police operations.
  Recently, police arrested eight youths aged between 15 and 20 years,
mostly school dropouts and recovered from them eight stolen motorcycles.
  "People steal motorcycles for joyrides, transportation, to resell them
for cheaper price or to cannibalise and sell to illegal racers," said
Aziz.
  He said many of those who steal motorcycles for joy-rides were
schoolchildren and youths.
  Aziz said it would surprise many that there were even people who
"borrow" motorcycles as a means of transport to take them to a particular
place where on reaching they abandoned the machines.
  "Those who actually steal them are groups of youths usually school
dropouts who sell them at a cheaper price to unsuspecting buyers in
estates and Felda schemes or cannibalise the parts to sell to illegal
racers to make quick money," he added.
  So far this year, Aziz said, the police had picked up eight such groups
or in police jargon "pocket groups" with each group comprising between
three and seven people, and recovered several stolen motorcycles.

Many candidates seeking clarifications on functions

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 2

PENANG, Sun. - Umno deputy president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said today
he was getting letters from Umno Ministers and leaders contesting for
posts in the October party elections, seeking clarification on functions
they could attend following the ban on election campaigning.
   Speaking in his capacity as Umno disciplinary committee chairman, he
said: "Several of them have written to me seeking my advice on certain
programmes that they were slotted to attend. I have cleared some
programmes and disapproved some programmes."
  He was asked on the fact that many Umno Ministers were not attending
even official functions following the directive of the Umno supreme
council that they should not attend functions which could be construed as
campaigning.

City sidewalks: Ugly attitude of urban indifference

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By Balan Moses

CONSIDER this assumption: As a nation develops and people become more
sophisticated and knowledgeable with better education, civic consciousness
should be heightened.
  Right-thinking people will probably rationalise this as being logical
and, therefore, theoretically quite probable.
  But does this actually happen in Malaysia, or closer home, in Kuala
Lumppur today?
  Let's look at the facts. Between January and July this year, City Hall
collected RM6 million in fines and compound penalties from a total of
228,042 notices issued to the public.
  This is RM400,000 more than what was collected for the same period last
year. Are city folk regressing as far as civic responsibilities are
concerned?   Facts, invariably cold and bare, give an accurate picture.
They are neutral and do not lie.
  What then ails city folk that they end up paying so much to the
authorities in fines and compounds for civic infringements?
  As Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Sharif said on Saturday (see story
on Page 23), the figures show that some city folk are not interested in
observing the law.
  Lamenting on the increase in fines and compounds, he said it was not a
good sign of the times.
  More received compound notices for not paying metered parking charges in
the first seven months this year compared with the same period last year.
  They paid a total of RM2,792,175 to City Hall for the period this year
for the offence.
  The local authority collected RM1,267,130 from hawkers for a variety of
offences while traffic offences brought in RM1,220,480.
  Other offences that brought in substantial amounts in fines were
committed under the Earthworks By-Laws 1988, Parks By-Laws 1981, Streets,
Drainage and Building Act 1974 and the Collection, Disposal and Management
of Garbage By-Laws FT 1981.
  Why this indifference among city folk to rules and regulations?
  A critical look around will show that indifference to rules are not the
only thing city folk are guilty of.
  Many are also indifferent to fellow Malaysians and in some cases, their
neighbours.
  Granted that there is an equal number or more of caring Malaysians who
always rise to the occasion when it comes to caring for others, the ugly
Malaysian syndrome and the number of people subscribing to it is
frightening.
  Why do people dump rubbish along roads and in front of their neighbours'
homes? Why do people wantonly dirty public toilets?
  Why have more road bullies surfaced recently? Some men have even taken
to assaulting women drivers, something unheard of before.
  Why do drivers end up in fist fights over trivial issues like cutting
lanes or blaring the horn?
  The Press has also reported recent cases of people standing by while
robberies were being committed.
  The environment, especially green lungs and forests, are also becoming
victims of indifference. Some businessmen are beginning to think that a
concrete jungle and the almighty ringgit are what life should be all
about.
  They do not have time to stop and smell the flowers.
  Something needs to be done to check this rot before it is too late and
such abberant behaviour becomes an accepted part of Malaysian culture.
  City folk have to sit up and ask themselves if indifference is what they
want to leave behind as a legacy to their children.
  We, as a society, will suffer if this becomes a reality.
  The authorities also have a role to play in helping Malaysians become
more caring and responsible.
  The young should be taught the need to help and care for one another,
regardless of their station in life. After all, this is what community
living is all about.
  Religious education, regardless of the faith, will go a long way in
inculcating civic consciousness among people.
  In the final analysis, however, change has to come from within. City
folk, and others, should give their best in making Kuala Lumpur and the
nation a better place to live in.
  * Sometimes, the most obvious things are the last seen. And so it may
have been in the case of the city-above-the-river Kuala Lumpur Linear City
(KLLC) project.
  The river and its reserve were there waiting when some developers were
busy cutting trees and hills for projects.
  We could have saved some of our natural heritage if the project had been
proposed earlier.
  The KLLC, to be built over the Sungai Klang, will result in a deeper and
wider Sungai Klang besides a squatter-free environment along the river
which will ensure a less polluted waterway.
  The People-mover Rapid Transit system which runs alongside the river is
another benefit accruing from the project.
  The mega-project itself will cover 117.6ha over a 12km route along the
river.
  It will stretch above and along the Sungai Klang between the Jalan Tun
Razak bridge at the upstream and the Jalan Klang Lama bridge downstream.
  It will have offices, entertainment centres, restaurants, hotels,
medical centres and apartments on arch frames over the river.
  While the benefits cannot be denied by way of more space for
development, the authorities also have to ensure that the project is
environment-friendly.
  This means that they have to ensure that the quality of river water is
not affected by the project.
  At a time when many children have not seen cows or goats save for what
is shown on television or in movies, we hope they will not forget what a
river looks like.
  We hope there will still be something of the river to see when the
project is completed. With the deepening and widening of the river, we
also hope it will lose its ugly brown hue for a healthy colour.
  It is left to be seen if the KLLC will spawn similar projects over other
rivers in the city.
  Some have raised the question of whether the project is violating the
guidelines of the Drainage and Irrigation Department.
  The authorities have to provide acceptable answers to such questions.

Town Planning head to perform duties of council secretary

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 2

KOTA BARU, Sun. - The Kota Baru Municipal Council has appointed its Town
Planning Division chief Kamaruddin Mamat to take over the duties of the
council secretary.
  Its president Hassan Abdullah said the appointment which was approved by
councillors at the special full council meeting today took effect
immediately.
  He added Kamaruddin was asked to perform the duties because MPKB did not
recognise the appointment of Shokri Mohamed.
  The council and the State Civil Service Commission are facing a standoff
following the council's rejection of Mohd Aiseri Alias to the post of MPKB
deputy president and Shokri as secretary.
  Hassan said MPKB had nothing against the two officers but did not
recognise their appointment by the commission because they were not made
according to procedures.
  Under service circular 5/1989, appointment to the two posts can only be
made upon the council's request. However, Hassan had said that the
commission did not refer the matter to him before making the appointment.
  However, he added, the council would not ask the two to leave or vacate
their posts.
  "I have no plans to take any action against the two but would appreciate
it very much if the commission withdrew the appointment," he said after
chairing the meeting.
  Hassan also did not rule out the possibility of the council filling the
posts with officers of their own choice.
  "If we do appoint our own people to fill the two posts, they would have
to be appointed by the State Exco," he added.

Feedback: Letter: Towards a better bus service

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By A Regular Commuter

ON taking over the Sri Jaya operated bus service 244 (Klang bus stand-
Bandar Utama through Pusat Bandar, Damansara Utama, Damansara Jaya and
Taman Tun) recently, Intrakota has redesignated the route as 21C.
  In addition, it has renamed Service 21 as 21A, and introduced 21B to Lot
10, giving all three services a common path between Bandar Utama and Bank
Negara.
  Unfortunately, the rather pale yellow dot-matrix numbers on a light
black, often greyish black, background becomes readable only when the bus
is almost upon one.
  Is it possible for Intrakota, which no doubt has the interests of both
commuter and driver at heart, to have the numbers boldly displayed as Sri
Jaya did?
  Would it also be possible for Intrakota to make available the schedule
of buses on this route so that, while allowing for the time of day and
uncertain traffic conditions, one can attempt to minimise waiting time?
  Can it be possible as well to have this information displayed at the
terminals at least for the benefit of all?
  When, for example, does the first bus leave either end of the route in
the morning and when does the last bus do likewise?
  Now that commuters can only board the bus one at a time - and at
terminals when the bus is ready to move - should not steps be taken to
inculcate the habit of queueing?
  For example, during the initial days, a security guard could be
stationed at the Klang bus stand during peak hours to ensure commuters
wait in line.
  In the mornings and evenings and during peak periods, one only has to
see the rush to board buses at the Klang bus stand to realise how
immeasurably advantageous it would be for all concerned - young and old,
men and women, drivers and management alike - to have such a system
enforced.
  Despite its many idiosyncrasies, Service 244 was predictable. Regular
commuters would undoubtedly in due course have the information to manage
their commuting but at this stage of Intrakota's takeover, the company
should make such information more widely available.

By Joe and family

WE are an elderly couple who have been staying alone in a TOL home at Loop
Road, Seremban for some 30 years now.
  Often our house and nearby homes get flooded when a nearby river
overflows during heavy rain.
  Although some digging at the river was done sometime ago, the situation
has not improved.
  On Sept 2 at 3.30am, flood waters entered our home and there was not
much we could do as the flood waters damaged our carpets and furniture.
  We aren't against development but such things should not mean that we
suffer as a result of it.
  We are appealing to our State Assemblyman and MP to please look into
this and help us improve the situation here.
  The Menteri Besar has promised titles to this place during the last
elections but nothing has come about so far.

Penang takes court action against 10 for polluting rivers

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 2

By K. Suthakar

PENANG, Sun. - The Penang Water Authority has initiated legal action
against 10 private landowners for allegedly polluting rivers in water
catchment areas.
  The charges included that of diverting water flow illegally.
  A source said some of the cases were being heard while others were in
the pre-trial process.
  The action is being taken following the gazetting of all rivers as
catchment areas in April 1994 under the Penang Water Authority Enactment
1972.
  The cases included development which had polluted rivers as early as
1991.
  The source said this when commenting on a recent New Straits Times
report that pollution resulting from encroachment into catchment areas by
developers was threatening the quality of water supply in the State.
  The report quoted State Infrastructure Facilities, Transportation and
Telecommunications Committee chairman Datuk Dr Hilmi Yahaya as saying that
the water authority had detected mud and E. Coli in the raw water supplied
to water treatment plants.
  He was also reported to have said the State Government had yet to
gazette land around the rivers as catchment areas "due to limitations in
the law".
  The source said three catchment areas on the island - at Teluk Bahang,
Sungai Pinang and Air Itam - were facing serious water pollution problems
caused by encroachment.
  Private landowners who have put up structures to tap the potential of
eco-tourism have been blamed for this state of affairs.
  "We have detected toilets built near rivers and some people diverting a
stream to create a `private reservoir' for water durian trees.
  "We have also detected a bungalow in the catchment area. The Penang
Island Municipal Council had removed the roof as it was an illegal
building, but the owner has since put up a new roof," the source said.
  The source also said the water authority had taken a developer in Teluk
Bahang to court two years ago for allegedly polluting a river from
hillslope cutting activity. The case is pending.
  Meanwhile, Penang Housing Developers Association chairman Datuk Eddy
Choong said the authorities should allow owners of land within catchment
areas to develop their property. However, he advocated conditions such as
a minimum distance from rivers to ensure pollution was averted.

Feedback: Letter: `Killer' Seremban junction

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By G. Tarlochan Singh Gill

LOOP Road in Seremban and its surrounding areas have seen much improvement
lately with the upgrading of roads, the new Sungai Senawang, construction
of new bridges and overall renewal of Tenaga cables.
  Thanks to efforts undertaken by wakil rakyat Goh Siow Huat and Datuk
Wong See Wah, who have visited the areas frequently.
  Furthermore, another Bailey Bridge has been completed and was officially
opened on Sept 8, to the relief of many residents of Kampung Semarak and
surrounding areas whose schoolgoing children now have a proper access to
go to the Jalan Loop schools, and the working class group.
  However, attention has not been given to the "killer junction" (picture
above) at the trunk road which leads to Taman Rasah Jaya, Taman Thivy
Jaya, Taman Blossom Park, Taman Blossom Heights and the many housing
estates which have sprung up in the area over the years.
  Even southbound traffic ply this road to get to Port Dickson and Kuala
Lumpur via the south toll plaza.
  As a result of the heavy traffic, there have been many accidents at the
spot.
  Recalling an incident, a motorcyclist was dragged to his death some 200
metres while coming out from Taman Ujong and colliding with a car coming
downslope towards the town from Rasah Jaya. Months later, a pasar malam
operator was dragged similarly along this stretch.
  Since then, there have been more accidents, including fatal ones.
  It is advisable to have traffic lights controlling the Taman Ujong and
Taman  Blossom Park traffic flow, possibly also with a new approach route
to Taman Ujong at the upper section for oncoming traffic.
  Residents staying nearby are so used to the sounds of "bangs" that they
would quickly quip satu lagi, meaning one more accident, when they hear
one.
  The accidents at the nearby Rahang overhead railway bridge and Jalan
Tampin-Jalan Tuanku Antah junction have also kept the Seremban traffic
police very busy, especially during weekends.
  Since this falls under the Seremban Municipal Council's traffic
committee, it is hoped the committee will act promptly before more lives
are lost.

Feedback: Letter: One lane access problem

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 17

By Wife of Agitated Driver

PLEASE do something about the one lane going in and out of Plaza Phoenix,
Km 10.4 Cheras.
  The junction is the only access to 14 housing estates in the area.
  In addition to the one lane problem, there is also a big hole at the
junction, adding to the massive congestion which lasts throughout the day.
  Two-way lanes have been turned into one lane. It would not surprise me
if accidents were to occur and even result in lives lost as motorists
using the lane to get to work or return home are getting very impatient.
  Can someone do something about this? Just getting out of this place
during peak hours to the main road in Cheras takes almost half an hour.
  Think of the precious time wasted. And even in town, we have to face the
crazy traffic situation.
  I know that jams are everywhere. But residents in Cheras have been
putting up with traffic jams for quite some time.

Concert in honour of Tamil poet

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 18

THE Temple of Fine Arts Malaysia will stage a Sangeetha Nruthya Nataka
Upanyaasam entitled Krishnaarpanam at the PJ Civic Centre on Thursday.
  The programme celebrates Shri Oothakkadu Venkatasubbier's selected
inspired outpourings.
  This is the first time a concert in recognition of the poet is being
attempted in the country although most Carnatic music lovers here are
familiar with the Shri Thyagaraja's compositions.
  Venkatasubbier was a poet, musician-cum-saint who lived 350 years ago in
the Tanjor district of South India, dedicating his life to Krishna.
  Many of his pieces such as Alai Paayuthey, Paal Vaadiyum and Aadathu
Assangathu are popular pieces to those who appreciate Tamil poetry.
  Most lovers of Carnatic music and the bharatanatyam dance form are
familiar with his immortal composition Taye Yasodha.
  Many of Vekatasubbier's compositions are a delight to dancers because
the percussion sounds are rhythmic in character.
  TFA's music department director Suresh Ramachandran said the
presentation of song and music would follow the traditional Nadopasana
style of Vadya Gita Brindam or a vocal and instrumental ensemble.

Stipe's report: Maszeli suspended three days

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 43

APPRENTICE Maszeli Amin pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding and
was suspended three day by the Stipendiary Stewards yesterday. He was
astride Allez Allez III in Race 6.
  The Stipe's report is as follows:
  RACE 1: Park Lane III (S Sam), Vietnam Ranger (A John) and Caro Lad (I
Azhar) which were difficult to be boxed, will each be required to pass one
starting stall test prior to them being declared to race again. Inside the
final 100m, Caro Lad drifted out under pressure, causing Bendemus to
steady. Jockey I Azhar was warned to make more attempt to keep his mount
on a straight course in future.
  RACE 2: Near the 300m, Aspen Gold (App M Zaini) was steadied when
Fullmarks (I Azhar) was carried inwards by Pay Me Cash (A John) which
shifted in.
  RACE 3: Soviet Wonder drifted outwards in the closing stages of the race
carrying Mega Gold (WH Lao). Jockey WH Lao (Mega Gold), placed second,
lodged an Objection against Soviet Wonder, being declared the winner, on
grounds of interference in the last 200m of the race. After considering
all of the evidence, the Race Meeting Stewards were of the opinion that
the incident had not affected the result and the Objection was overruled.
The result stood and Jockey Lao's deposit was refunded.
  App SH Lee was warned to make more attempt to keep his mount on a
straight course in future.
  RACE 4: Acting on veterinary advice that Haramoun (J Saimee) was
coughing, the Race Meeting Stewards ordered its withdrawal. Jockey SY
Leong, the rider of Gleam, reported that this horse did not act in the
going.
  RACE 5: Trainer D Baertschiger was fined $50 for failing to produce the
correct colours on Silently Yours.
  Near the 600m, Bellotto Glory (KL Oo) was steadied to avoid the heels of
Jade Princess II (SH Oh).
  RACE 6: Rounding the 800m turn, Dear Sir and Brown Sugar were both
checked when tightened between Treasure Dragon (App T Ong) which was
hanging out and Allez Allez III (App M Maszeli) which shifted in. This
incident also resulted in Track Lark II having to be steadied. At a
subsequent Inquiry, App Maszeli, in the presence of his master, Trainer D
Dragon, pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding under MRA Rule 149
(a) (ii) in that he allowed his horse, Allez Allez III, to shift in on the
turn at the 800m mark causing varying degrees of interference to Brown
Sugar and Dear Sir. The Panel took into account mitigating circumstances
and suspended App Maszeli from riding in three race days with effect from
Mon, 16 Sep 96. He was advised of his Right of Appeal.
  Near the 100m, Jockey SH Oh the rider of Valid dropped his whip when
attempting to straighten the horse who had a tendency to lay in. He
pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding under Rule 149 (a)(ii) and
fined $500. He was informed of his Right of Appeal.
  RACE 7: Approaching the 1100m, mark Charming Star (V Sivan) began to
buck repeatedly losing some ground. Charming Star will be required to pass
a 100m, gallop trial from the barrier and veterinary examination.
  Trainer JF Heng was questioned about the apparent reversal of form of
King Of Hearts II (WH Au-Yeung). He explained that this horse had returned
from a break prior to which he had problems with its off-fore hoof.
  RACE 8: Rounding the home turn, Martina (App B Tai) when racing tight on
the inside of Because Of You II (KL Oh) steadied and then stumbled
dislodging App B Tai. Game Of Bridge (SH Oh), Showgirl VIII and Sparrow
Hawk had to take evasive action losing some ground. Shortly after this
incident, High Colours stumbled over the fallen rider, App Tai, dislodging
App SH Lee. Wings Of Freedom (L Cropp) and Air Jumbo had to take evasive
action losing some ground.
  App Tai was taken to hospital for observation and a statement concerning
the fall will be taken from App Tai when he is available.
  RACE 9: Approaching the 300m mark, Sunway was held up for a run on the
inside when Dingsheng (M Narredu) drifted inwards. Jockey KK Loh was
questioned regarding his ride on Sunway in the early part of the race. He
advised the Panel that his instructions were to settle the horse in mid
field but he found that the pace was too fast and he ended up further back
than he had wished.
  RACE 10: Shortly, after the start, Raphael Gold (M Narredu) was
tightened when Yes It's True (P Carbery) and Jiwa Jiwa (TM Wan) both
shifted ground. Linford (J Saimee) was also tightened when River Palace
(KL Oo), and My Encore (L Cropp) both shifted ground.
  An investigation will be opened into the running and handling of
Chattaronga II (CH Chua).

By Hanizah Hashim

THE mood for celebration was still in the air for the crowd that turned up
to watch the 3-on-3 basketball tournament held in conjunction with the
39th Merdeka Day at Klang yesterday.
  Over 281 teams competed in the tournament, which was jointly organised

their free time at the university.

end of the one-day tournament, the 45 stands and hoops used - costing

Palm oil

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 35

CRUDE palm oil physicals ended sharply lower the week in moderately active
trading, in line with the weaker CPO futures contract and uncertainty in
the Chicago market.
  Talks that palm oil production for end-August will be 15 percent firmer
over July contributed to a bearish sentiment on the cash market.
  Estimates by private crop forecaster Ivan Wong that end-August oil palm
production would increase by 11 percent to about 800,000 tonnes from July
while palm oil stocks to grow to 775,000 tonnes from the official figure
of 754,634 in July, however was factored in by the market.
  A lack of fresh leads and uncertainty over the market's trend in the
immediate and near term contributed to lacklustre trading on the cash
market.

Rubber

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 35

THE Malaysian rubber market closed mixed to lower last week in overall
quiet trading despite brokers regaining confidence to trade actively in
the market.
  The International RSS One buyer was unchanged from last Friday at 329.00
sen per kg while SMR 20 declined by one and a half sen to 314.00 sen per
kg.
  Improved buying interest from local traders and increased overseas
enquiries, had boosted prices Thursday.
  A dealer said there would be encouraging buying interest in the
immediate term, following traders' response to what they describe as
"comfortable" price levels.
  The market see-sawed in a tight range owing to the uncertainty in
regional markets and the lack of fresh factors.
  The International Natural Rubber Organisation (INRO) daily market
indicator price for Friday (September 12) was at 250.30
Malaysian/Singapore cents per kg.

Berita Harian-EON East-West Tour 1996.: Cycling.: Domingo dominates stage
five

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 44

By Zakri Baharudin

THE Philippines strengtened their lead in the overall team standings after
Enrique Domingo won the fifth stage of the Berita Harian-EON East-West
Tour from Taiping to Sungai Petani yesterday.
  Domingo's time of three hours 33:11.41 not only enabled his team to pull
away from the rest but it also allowed him to snatch the overall leader's
yellow jersey from teammate Victor Espiritu.
  Kuala Lumpur B's Wong Ah Thiam came in second in 3:34:57.12 while Harris
Fadzillah Osman of Kuala Lumpur B was third, a futher 56.71 seconds
behind.
  Domingo put up a strong performance and led the first breakaway 30km
after the starting line near Pondok Tanjung.
  He maintained his lead through the flat and narrow 140km stretch and
pulled away again with about a dozen other cyclists near Selama.
  "With this win, I have avenged our defeat in the first stage of the
Tour," said Domingo.
  "I knew that this stage was in the bag because as I got closer to the
end I could only see Wong trailing me," added the 26-year-old who works
for the Philippine Star daily.
  Philippines coach Bart Flores was glad that his cyclists adhered to his
orders.
  "My plan is working, especially now that the team are in a solid
position," said Flores.
  He added that it would be very difficult for any of the other teams to
win the overall championship at the end of the Tour in Langkawi.
  Meanwhile, Kuala Lumpur A coach Ng Joo Ngan admitted that his strategy
didn't quite work out.
  "The Philippines are a strong team but I didn't expect them to break
away as early as in Kamunting," said Ng.
  All 86 riders will lineup at the Kuala Muda District Council office to
begin the 137km stage six from Sungai Petani to Alor Star today.
  RESULTS - 140km stage five from Taiping to Sungai Petani - Individual: 1
Enrique Domingo (Phi) 3hrs 33:11.41, 2 Wong Ah Thiam (KL B) 3:34:57.12, 3

Tin

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 35

TIN price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) settled the week 11 sen
lower at RM15.02 per kg from the previous Friday on overall higher
offerings and volatility on the London Metal Exchange (LME), dealers said.
  An overall drop of three-month tin on the LME by US$30 from last Friday,
resulted in sentiment being easier which sparked off a wave of
liquidations by miners.

Taking stock: Prestar may scale new highs in profit growth, turnover

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 34

By S. N. Lock

AS the KLSE second board continued on its unabated record-breaking surge,
some second board counters went about their consolidation while some
others were in a hurry to complete their base-building consolidation to
join in the superbull bandwagon.
  On Friday, some second board counters broke out of their recent lull and
maintained their technical composure while the second board underwent its
meaningful consolidation in late afternoon trade.
  Prestar Industries Bhd (Prestar) was one such counter that bucked the
KLSE SBI trend on Friday while Sin Kean Boon Group Bhd was the other.
  Prestar was incorporated under the Companies Act 1965 as a private
limited company on July 12, 1984 by some members of the Toh family.
Subsequently, it was converted into a public limited company on June 27,
1994 when it changed its corporate identity to its present form. The
change in its corporate identity was a move that prepared Prestar for its
listing on the KLSE second board.
  Prestar is principally involved in the manufacturing and trading of
wheelbarrows, building materials and material-handling equipment hardware
which includes hand-trucks, wheels and hot-dip galvanised overhead
transmission accessories and parts.
  The manufacturing set-up of Prestar was originally intended to
complement the marketing and trading services of YK Toh Marketing Sdn Bhd
which was involved in the importation and distribution of hardware,
building materials and material-handling equipment. The group later
diversified into the manufacturing of other related material-handling
equipment like hand-trucks and hot-dip galvanised products.
  Besides meeting the domestic demand for wheelbarrows, Prestar embarked
on an international marketing campaign and has successfully secured orders
from the United States of America, Japan and Middle East countries. With
the increasing domestic and export market demands, Prestar undertook an
expansion programme when it moved to its new factory in Rawang.
  In July 1995, Prestar subscribed to a 35 per cent equity stake in
Zelleco Metal Galvanising Sdn Bhd. The remaining stake in the joint
venture company was taken up by Selleco, a subsdiary of Malaysian
Resources Corporation Bhd. The joint venture company was formed to
undertake projects undertaken by MRCB-PNB Consortium.
  Chartwise, Prestar made its debut on the KLSE second board on Sept 20,
1995 when its shares were traded from an intra-day low of RM3.26 to an
intra-day high of RM3.62 before easing to close at the RM3.54 level with
913,000 shares changing hands.
  Immediately after its listing on the KLSE second board, its price trend
went sideways for the next 2 1/2 months before embarking on its first
upleg to RM7.45 on Jan 23, 1996. Prestar's price trend corrected down to
RM5.00 on Feb 13, 1996.
  A new uptrend unfolded immediately after its price trend reversed out of
its short consolidation. The feverish uptrend with the KLSE second board
run-ups sent its share prices to yet another all-time historical high of
RM10.60 on April 26, 1996.
  The ensuing second board corrections sent its price trend all the way
down to RM5.50 on June 3, 1996. A strong technical rebound to RM8.15 on
July 17, 1996 followed by a swift retreat to RM6.20 on July 30, 1996 set
the stage for its current uptrend breakout. Its share prices closed at
RM9.00 on Friday.
  Here are the readings of some of its technical indicators:-
  Moving Averages: Prestar's current prices continue to stay above all its
10-, 20-, 30-, 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages in their bullish
sequential order.
  Momentum Index: Its short-term momentum index has since reversed to the
upside following its recent successful re-test of its neutral reference
line.
  On Balance Volume: Its short-term OBV is firmly staying above its 10-day
exponential moving averages after moving sideways for four months.
  Relative Strength Index: Its 14-RSI staged a decisive breakout of its
immediate overhead resistance at the 65 per cent level.
  OUTLOOK:
  After establishing its market leadership in wheelbarrows, hand-trucks
and other material-handling equipment in the domestic market, Prestar is
on the move once again.
  Its joint venture with Selleco into a galvanising project for works
undertaken by MRCB-PNB Consortium and its venture into the manufacture of
steel guard rails (used mainly as road dividers) clearly signalled its
determined diversification into supplying projects related to
infrastructure development of the country.
  Apart from its diversification into infrastracture projects, Prestar
moved further upstream when it acquired a 70 per cent stake in Summit
Steel Service Centre Sdn Bhd. Summit Steel Service Centre Sdn Bhd sheers
steel into coils and supplies them to the steel industry, including metal
stamping companies.
  Its diversification exercise coupled with its domestic market leadership
in material-handling equipment will afford Prestar to scale newer highs,
both in terms of turnover and profit growth. This will continue to
underpin share prices.
  Technically, Prestar's decisive breakout of its immediate overhead
resistances (See Prestar's weekly bar chart - D3-D4 - and daily bar chart
- E1-E2) clearly signals a trend reversal to the upside. Its price trend
has successfully taken out the neckline (E1-E2) of its double-bottom
pattern formation.
  Its pattern measuring objective is likely to take Prestar's short- to
intermediate-term to stage a re-challange of its all-time historical peak
at the RM10.60 level.

Currency review: Currency review

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 34

THE greenback is poised to strengthen further against the ringgit in the
weeks ahead on the softening ringgit interest rate outlook. Although the
ringgit was steady against the greenback last week, we expect a declining
ringgit trend to commence soon. The greenback closed Friday at 2.4895,
unchanged from the week before.
  * THE Singapore dollar's recent rise took a turn downwards against the
ringgit last week. This was due to the unloading of Singapore dollars by
an institution last week. The Singapore dollar closed Friday at 1.7640,
down from 1.7700 the previous Friday. Although still on a medium term
bullish trend, the dollar's rise could continue to be checked this week.
  * THE Japanese yen continued to fall against the ringgit last week amid
expectations that the BoJ would maintain the yen's interest rate at its
historic low. This expectation was strengthened further when data on
Friday showed that Japan's second quarter gross domestic product shrank
0.7 per cent. The yen closed Friday at 2.2560, down from 2.2780 the week
before.
  * AFTER being boosted by the previous week's tension in the Middle East,
sterling pared its gains last week against the ringgit. The latest
economic figures show that the UK economy is growing steadily. This could
mean the end of further UK rate cuts and should be bullish for sterling in
the medium term. Sterling is not expected to rise just yet.
  * THE Australian dollar surged against the ringgit and other currencies
Monday on the expectation that global inflation would boost Australian
commodity prices. But the dollar weakened Thursday and Friday when the
central bank hinted that there was still room for lower Australian rates.
The Australian dollar closed Friday at 1.9750, from 1.9688 the previous
Friday. It is expected to be steady this week.

Technically speaking: KLCE CI's short-term trend shaping up well

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 32

By S. N. Lock

SHARE prices on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange closed broadly higher last
week. The bullish run-ups on the KLSE second board spilled over to some
second and third liners on the main board. Selective buying support on
blue-chips and index-linked counters underpinned the KLSE Composite Index.
  Persistent retail buying support chased KLSE second board counters on
Monday but blue-chips and index-linked counters continued to trade lower
amid lack of institutional support. In its earlier trading the CI dipped
to its intra-day low of 1,101.40 points before recovering to close at
1,104.28.
  The broader market ignored news that Malaysia's gross domestic product
was higher at 8.4 per cent in the second quarter of the year when compared
with 8.3 per cent the previous quarter. From the look of things, it was
expected and within the confines of some fund managers' forecasts.
  The KLSE Second Board Index cooled momentarily on Tuesday when its
advance was clipped 5.44 points, or 0.97 points, to 555.55 level. However,
the SBI managed to post an all-time intra-day high of 566.41 points in its
earlier trading
  Some investors switched from speculatives on the second board coupled
with some renewed buying from institutional investors sent the CI 7.47
points higher to 1,111.75 level on Tuesday. Many investors viewed the
second board as way overstretched and took profits accordingly. This
explained why the SBI suffered its first loss following four consecutive
daily upticks.
  Contrary to many investors' expections, the SBI reversed when retail
players resumed buying second board counters. Some second board counters
were marked up with triple-digit gains. There was talk that some fund
managers who missed the second board run-ups were waiting for the second
board bubble to burst before returning to invest in blue-chip stocks.
  While the second board continued with its unabated record-breaking run,
many analysts started to question the overvaluations on some second board
counters. On Friday, there were bouts of profit-taking pressure on second
board counters but bargain huntings managed to absorb the selling pressure
remarkably well.
  Reflecting the consolidation mood of the broader market, the CI managed
to put up a good show when it gained 12.22 points, or 1.10 per cent, to
close at 1,117.55 points on Friday. The KLSE All Share EMAS Index rose
4.28 points, or 1.34 per cent, to 324.20.
  The KLSE Industrial Index recovered 21 points, or one per cent, to
2,114.21 level. The SBI jumped 17.85 points, or 3.22 per cent, to 572.24
points.
  On the sectoral performance analysis, the property sector was the top
gainer with gains of 3.86 per cent followed by second board in second
place with a gain of 3.22 per cent. Elsewhere, all other remaining sectors
posted gains ranging from 0.26 per cent to 2.57 per cent.
  Chartwise, the CI recovered from its initial setback on Monday when it
staged a successful re-test of its 1,100 support.
  The next four trading sessions saw the strong buying support on blue-
chips counters. The following are readings of some of its technical
indicators:
  Moving Averages: The KLSE CI managed to recover above its 10-, 20-, 30-,
50- and 200-day moving averages while its 100-day moving averages
continued to hover.
  Momentum Index: Its short-term momentum index moved out of its recent
falling field trend.
  On Balance Volume: Its short-term OBV trend staged a re-penetration of
its 10-day exponential moving averages.
  Relative Strength Index: Its 14-RSI continued to trade within the
confines of its neutral zone.
  OUTLOOK:
  The KLSE CI successfully moved out of the upper two per cent standard
deviation band of its Keltner Channel. Similarly, it managed to break out
of its short-term downtrend (See KLSE CI's Daily Bar Chart - B3-B4). Both
of these technical scenarios suggest that the CI's short-term trend is
fast improving as it approaches its next bullish time window.
  From its weekly bar chart, the CI continued to stay within the gradual
upward path of its Andrews' Channel. Its immediate-term Andrews' Channel
provides glimpses of the CI's intermediate-term perspectives.
  The CI violated the Andrews' lower median line (See KLSE CI's weekly bar
chart - A5-A6) in November 1995, but was quickly vaulted back into the
channel, staying right below its median line (A1-A2). Once again, it
staged a successful re-test of the support of its lower median line (A5-
A6) on July 30, 1996.
  Thus, the CI's short- and intermediate-term perspectives are shaping up
very nicely as it approaches its next bullish time window. This week, the
CI is poised to take out its immediate overhead resistance at 1,123 point
level. Its next resistance zone hovers around 1,140-1,155 points.
  The SBI is poised to crack the 600 level this week amid intermittent
profit-taking. Rotational plays will once again feature prominently as the
SBI will continue to move along its uptrend channel (See KLSE SBI - C1-C2
and C3-C4).

Clean-up Day team clears up 620kg of rubbish

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 7

KLANG, Sun. - A car-seat, a baby-walker and motorcycle spare parts were
among the "treasures" collected at The Body Shop's Fifth Annual Coastal
Clean-Up at the esplanade, Port Klang, today.
  More than 100 participants from The Body Shop, Klang Municipal Council,
Klang Youth Council and Red Crescent societies from schools here scoured
the 1.5 kilometre esplanade for trash dumped by inconsiderate people.
  The total amount of trash collected weighed 621.20 kilogrammes.
  The clean-up was held in conjunction with International Coastal Clean-Up
Day which is co-ordinated by the Centre for Marine Conservation in
Atlanta, the United States.
  CMC is a non-governmental organisation which co-ordinates more than
200,000 volunteers in clean-up efforts around the world on the second
Sunday of every September.
  The Body Shop's public and media relations manager, Molly Fong, said it
initiated the first Malaysian clean-up in 1992 and had co-ordinated annual
clean-ups at different coastlines, including at Langkawi, Tioman and
Pantai Morib.
  Today's clean-up was launched at 9.30am by Sementa Assemblyman Datuk
Abdul Rahman Talil.
  Mina Foong, managing director of The Body Shop Malaysia, said the clean-
up was to single out the kinds of rubbish dumped indiscriminately.
  Participants recorded information about the trash collected on data
cards which will be sent to CMC. The information will be processed and
become part of CMC's annual International Coastal Clean-Up report.
  Foong said CMC would use the report to lobby Governments, the United
Nations and companies whose products were commonly found in coastal trash.

Using cards to pay toll by year 2000

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 7

By Mimi Syed Yusof

SUNGAI SIPUT, Sun. - Motorists in the Klang Valley will have to use
electronic cards for payment under the open toll system which will be
introduced in the year 2000, Works Minister Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu said.
  He said the central electronic toll collection system would reduce
manpower at toll stations.
  "The best option is to introduce electronic toll cards as a mode of
payment for motorists entering the Federal capital," he told reporters
after attending a badminton exhibition match yesterday.
  Samy Vellu said the proposal was submitted to the Cabinet at its meeting
last Wednesday.
  The move would ensure smooth toll collection as motorists need not queue
for long periods at toll booths.
  Under the system, motorists will have to purchase the electronic toll
cards.
  The Minister also said the Cabinet had requested his ministry to submit
a report on the system within two to three months.
  On the system, Samy Vellu said a central collection agency would be set
up to collect all toll payments via the electronic cards.
  The agency will then channel the payments to all the companies and
concessionaires of road projects.
  He said to date 12 road projects outside Kuala Lumpur had been approved.
  After the roads are completed there will be toll stations every three or
five kilometres along the roads leading to the city centre.
  "This means there will be about 200 toll stations around the Klang
Valley," he said, adding that several companies had recommended that an
intelligent system be implemented to facilitate toll collection.
  On whether Projeck Lebuhraya Utara Selatan would be included in the new
system, Samy Vellu said PLUS would be exempted because it dealt with long-
distance travelling based on the closed toll concept.
  "The focus is now on the toll collection system in Kuala Lumpur which
will include all the roads around the capital and from Kuala Lumpur to the
highways," he said.
  Also included are the Federal highway and roads from Kuala Lumpur-Shah
Alam, the integrated highway from Kuala Lumpur-Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur
International Airport in Sepang, Shah Alam-Putrajaya and KLIA, Jalan
Kuching to Kuala Lumpur and Shah Alam-Petaling Jaya.
  Another route is Jalan Cheras-Batu 7 Kajang which is connected to the
North-South Expressway.
  Samy Vellu said the system must be adopted because it was the best way
to collect toll from all the entry points of the city centre.
  He said the ministry would also hold discussions with consortiums of
road projects in preparing the proposal.
  He said six companies had started work on several toll stations and at
least two would start collecting toll when the roads are completed.
  He also said experts would be called in to study the situation and to
provide feedback.

`Ban Singaporeans from buying food'

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 7

TAIPING, Sun. - The Federation of Malaysian Consumer Association wants the
Government to ban Singaporeans from taking any food items out of Johor
Baru.
  It has proposed that the Government check the car boots of Singaporeans
leaving Johor Baru for the purpose.
  Speaking at a press conference after a forum on current consumer issues
organised by the Consumer Association of Taiping held at a leading hotel
here, Fomca president Mohamed Hamdan said the move was aimed at protecting
consumers in Johor Baru.
  He said if the Singapore Government could have a half-tank policy to
check on the petrol tanks of cars entering the republic, then it was not
unreasonable for the Malaysian Government to check the car boots of
Singaporean motorists to prevent them from taking away food items.
  Mohamed Hamdan said as the country was not self-sufficient and importing
many essential food items like rice, flour, fish and chicken, it was
unfair for Singaporeans to be allowed to take away food items from
Malaysia.
  "How can we allow Singaporeans to take away our imported essential food
items," he said.
  Mohamed Hamdan also cited as an example how Malaysia was importing wheat
100 per cent.
  He added that the Singapore Government was imposing a lot of
restrictions on Malaysians entering the republic.
  Mohamed Hamdan said since food had become costly in Johor Baru, it was
wise for Malaysia to control the "re-exportation" of such items by non-
Malaysian individuals.

Hamdan: Open system a burden

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 7

IPOH, Sun. - The Federation of Malaysian Consumers Association president
Mohamed Hamdan Adnan said today the open toll system requiring motorists
who enter Kuala Lumpur to pay toll was a burden to consumers.
  He said consumers were currently burdened with many taxes, which
included paying the highway toll.
  He said the association would only support the system if the Government
ensured that the public transportation system and infrastructure
facilities within the Klang Valley were up to the mark.
  While agreeing that this would help reduce traffic congestion within the
city centre, Hamdan said without a proper public transportation system,
the open toll concept was inappropriate.
  He also said there were other ways to reduce city centre traffic
congestion such as moving activities from Kuala Lumpur to other parts of
Klang Valley.
  "Kuala Lumpur is congested because development is currently concentrated
there.
  "The Government should also consider other alternatives such as
organising activities outside the city and to put a stop to development
plans within Kuala Lumpur," he told reporters after giving a talk at the
Old Andersonian Club on current consumer issues.
  Hamdan also said the Government should not concentrate solely on
development within the city but that it should be balanced and spread out
evenly.
  He proposed that the Government set up townships outside the city
centre. He, however, said development of townships should not harm the
environment but should be properly planned so that it would complement the
outskirts of the city.
  "The Government should not burden the consumers by asking them to pay
without giving them an option," he said.

State aims to reduce number of poor families

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 8

By Sa'odah Elias

SABAK BERNAM, Sun. - The Selangor State Government aims to reduce the
number of poor families to less than one per cent of the State's
population before the end of the century.
  The number of families living below the poverty line in Selangor
currently stands at 2,302 or slightly over two per cent.
  Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib said besides direct help
and assistance, various programmes would be introduced to provide members
of these families with new skills to enable them to better their lives.
  "Through our concerted poverty eradication programme, we hope to reduce
the number of poor families in Selangor to below 1,000 by the year 2000.
  "With the help of the State Poverty Eradication Foundation, we are
confident of meeting this target," he said at a key presenting ceremony to
14 proud homeowners whose houses were built by YBK.
  Each of the two-bedroom houses built under the YBK Desa Kasih scheme in
Kampung Tebuk Pulai near here cost about RM20,000 which includes the value
of a piece of land measuring 15 by 21 metres.
  They were built for families in the district identified as being very
poor. Besides a house, each family was provided with 20 hydrophonic cases
to enable them to venture into hydrophonic farming.
  Muhammad said in the effort to eradicate poverty in Selangor, emphasis
would be placed on upgrading the skills of the people to enable them to be
independent and discourage them from expecting Government handouts.
  He said the programme, which also encompassed the poor in urban areas,
would be further intensified over the next few years to ensure their place
in the mainstream of development in the State.
  He said the rural poor would be supplied with new farming skills while
those in urban areas would be provided with business opportunities with
the setting up of stalls and hawker centres.
  YBK chairman Datuk Zainal Abidin Sakom said since 1991, the foundation
had provided monetary aid to 481 families living in Malay traditional
villages to repair or rebuild their houses under the Lindungan Kasih
scheme.
  Under the Desa Kasih scheme, he said, three housing schemes - which have
benefited 90 homeless families - had been built.

Gold cheaper by RM3 per gm due to price war

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 8

IPOH, Sun. - The price of the top three grades of gold is down by RM3 per
gramme after a price war between Federation of Malaysian Goldsmiths and
Jewellers' Association members and non-members.
  Perak branch chairman Y.M. Chong said the price reduction came about
after an emergency meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Sept 3.
  "We are doing this to stabilise the price of gold in the local market,"
he told a news conference today.
  He said about 200 members in the State had been advised to adhere to the
association's resolution although their profit margin could be cut to less
than five per cent.
  Chong said non-members were selling gold at a lower price and this was
seriously affecting the business.
  "In the past, it was up to 12 per cent but we are making a sacrifice to
alert consumers of what is happening in the industry," he said, adding
that the price was expected to go up early next year.
  He said the 999 (24 carat gold), which was sold at RM39 per gramme, was
now being sold at RM36, 916 (22 carat) from RM37 to RM34 and 835 (20
carat) from RM34 to RM31.
  Chong claimed many non-members sold gold to customers at a cheaper rate
but this was of inferior quality.
  "There are also goldsmiths who offer gifts like radios and cameras.
  "This could be a sales gimmick to sell off inferior quality gold," Chong
said.
  He said these errant goldsmiths refused to become members because they
had to adhere "to our strict business ethics, rules and regulations".
  "We self-regulate ourselves by investigating members if customers
complain they have been cheated or shortchanged by them," he said.
  He advised consumers to buy jewellery from reputable goldsmith outlets
who were also members of the federation.
  Chong said customers could not get good resale prices for their
jewellery if they bought inferior items.
  He said the standard rate was 18 per cent off the current gold market
price.
  Chong said the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry's
enforcement unit also periodically checked the outlets.

Hotel Equatorial opens doors in Ho Chi Minh City

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 8

By Shareem Amry in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam

THE Hotel Equatorial chain was extended to seven locations when its latest
addition in Ho Chi Minh City officially opened its doors on Saturday.
  Owned by Singapore-based Planergo Pte Ltd, the RM87.5-million hotel was
opened by the acting chairman of Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee, Vo
Viet Thanh.
  Pembangunan Anika Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hotel Equatorial
(M) Sdn Bhd, is the biggest shareholder in Planergo with a 31 per cent
stake. Arab-Malaysian Development has 20 per cent, while Singapore's
NatSteel Properties Pte Ltd and Lim Kah Ngam (Investment) Pte Ltd hold
23.75 per cent and 20.25 per cent respectively.
  Vietnamese entrepreneur Phan Thanh holds the rest.
  Speaking after the launch, Planergo's executive chairman Datuk Lim Kong
Wai said:
  "We think things will improve here, especially since Vietnam established
relations with the Asean. We even upgraded the hotel because of our
confidence in Vietnam's economic reforms."
  The hotel now registers an occupancy rate of between 40 and 50 per cent.
  The chain extends to Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Singapore, Jakarta, Guangzhou
and Shanghai.

Golden Valley expects RM20m from sale of lots

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 30

GOLDEN Valley Golf Resort Bhd expects a return of RM20 million from the
sale of 180 bungalow lots at its course in Air Panas, Jasin, Malacca.
  Its executive director, Azman Abdul Ghani, said the 180 lots were 7,000
to 15,000 square feet in area and were being sold for between RM14 and
RM16 per square foot.
  "Those who had purchased these lots can choose from our 10 models of
bungalow houses. Our subsidiary company will construct them at a cost of
RM200,000 to RM500,000," he said.
  Azman added buyers would also get a free membership to the golf club
which is worth RM36,000.
  He told this to reporters after witnessing Chief Minister Datuk Seri
Mohd Zin Abdul Ghani launch the project on Saturday.
  The development of the bungalow lots is the second major project
undertaken by Golden Valley.
  Its previous project was a 27-hole golf course with a clubhouse, seminar
facilities, a karaoke lounge and a Japanese hot bath on 160ha.
  Azman said the company had spent RM8 million on the infrastructure for
developing the bungalow lots.
  He said owners who chose to let their houses could get assistance from a
Golden Valley subsidiary.
  Future projects for the company include the development of chalets and
220 service apartment units.
  "This project would be completed in five to eight years and we hope the
profit generated from this and our other projects would spur our drive to
become a listed company," Azman said.

Emerging companies: Company profile: Saujana sees lots of opportunities
waiting

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 30

By Zuraimi Abdullah

AS suggested by the Malay word saujana, which is often associated with the
phrase sejauh mata memandang (as far as the eyes can see), Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange main board-bound Saujana Consolidated Bhd sees its days of
glory not within its grasp yet.
  "The horizon is endless, and so are the opportunities," managing
director Abu Bakar Mohamad Nor said during a recent interview.
  Although it has carved a niche for itself in the hotel and golf course
management business the company believes there is a lot more business
opportunities to be seized.
  Recalling the history of Saujana, Abu Bakar said it all began in the
early 1980s when Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, after
returning from an overseas trip, instructed Peremba Group of Companies -
via the Urban Development Authority - to set up a company to manage hotel
cum golf resorts.
  "Peremba at that time was under UDA, and the Prime Minister who was in
his early years in office, had this vision. Thus, Saujana came into
existence.
  "Eventually, with the combination of expertise from three good partners
- Hyatt International, Peremba and Saujana itself - and after some
problems, we have grown to what we are today."
  Saujana now owns and operates the renowned Hyatt Regency Saujana Hotel
and Saujana Golf and Country Club, both in Subang Jaya, Selangor, and
develops and markets computerised information systems as well as sells
turf equipment to golf clubs.
  And more recently, it diversified into the property sector after
acquiring 30 per cent equity in developer PGK Sdn Bhd.
  Abu Bakar said Saujana was proud to have built the country's best golf
course at the Saujana Golf and Country Club. The 18-hole course had been
voted the best course by Golf Malaysia magazine in 1991, 1993 and 1995.
  He admitted Saujana had benefited much from its link with its parent
company, Peremba.
  The alliance with Hyatt was formed over eight years ago. The partnership
allayed Saujana's fears of stiff competition in the hotel and hospitality
industry.
  "When we mention the name Hyatt, the thing that crosses people's mind is
its five-star hotel. During the recession, when several hotels were coming
up in the Klang Valley, we still managed to record an occupancy rate above
75 per cent."
  Abu Bakar said Hyatt Regency enjoyed an average occupancy rate of 74 per
cent last year and 82 per cent for the first six months this year. This is
high when compared with the 66 per cent registered by other hotels in
Peninsular Malaysia.
  About 75 per cent of Hyatt Regency's customers are corporate and
business travellers and of this, about 65 per cent are repeat customers.
  Now after eight profitable years, Abu Bakar said Saujana wanted to
introduce the concept in other places in the country.
  "Future expansion will be geared towards synergistic growth consistent
with our core business."
  He foresees more golf courses will be built, providing greater business
opportunities for the company.
  "The best way to exploit this is to support them through full
utilisation of our Toro turf equipment and Club Car golf buggies. We have
already captured 70 per cent of the market share in turf equipment.
  "On top of that, we believe many local authorities are going to develop
parks and football fields and they still need our machinery.
  "Furthermore, many other hotels as well as airports need our products
like the buggies," he said, adding that Saujana is the sole distributor
for Toro products and the golf buggies.
  It also plans to increase its land bank, which stands at 7.6ha and
located close to Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah International Airport in Subang.
The land was initially earmarked for the development of 569 units of
condominium.
  "Although the development of the condominiums has been approved, we will
still evaluate other proposals to maximise returns on investment and those
that complement our core business."
  Saujana is now scouting for land in Johor, Phuket in Thailand and Bali
in Indonesia for property development.
  "We are now talking to several parties. In Johor, we hope to secure
about 400 acres (160ha) of land. As for Phuket and Bali, we cannot say
much as the discussions are still at the preliminary stage," he said.
  Abu Bakar said Saujana, backed by expertise from Peremba and its
associated company PGK, was capable of undertaking any property
development.
  PGK is now developing Bandar Baru Wangsa Maju in Kuala Lumpur which is
expected to be completed in about 10 years.
  The company recently completed Phase Six of the project and to date has
recorded sales of about RM650 million.
  He ruled out the possibility that the property sector would supplant
Saujana's core business, saying that income from both sectors would
probably be the same in a few years.
  "In the next few years, our hotel business and property business each
will contribute 40 per cent to our revenue. The remaining 20 per cent will
come from our golf business."
  Currently, the core business contributes about 60 per cent of its income
and property 30 per cent.
  Saujana has forecast a pre-tax profit of RM15.76 million for the
financial year ending 1996. Last year, it made about RM11.18 million.

Electrolux aims for larger market share in Asean

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 28

By Noorzita Samad in Stockholm, Sweden

SWEDISH home appliances giant Electrolux AB aims to be among the top three
suppliers of washing machines, refrigerators and vacuum cleaners in Asean
by the year 2000.
  The target was set amidst its comprehensive plan to capture a larger
share in Asia's emerging consumer markets - traditionally dominated by
price-competitive products from Japan and to a lesser extent, South Korea.
  Apart from Asean countries, other potential markets in Asia identified
by Electrolux are China and India.
  And having set its goal to make further inroads into Asia, Electrolux
has consistently focused its efforts in developing products as well as
widening its investment in manufacturing operations in various Asian
nations.
  The group recently unveiled a new range of environmentally-friendly
products known as AlphaCare in Singapore.
  The new Electrolux washing machine, refrigerator, vacuum cleaner, built-
in oven and gas hob, and microwave oven will be launched in Malaysia,
Indonesia and Thailand next month.
  Its senior executive vice-president and chief financial officer Lennart
Ribohn said EIectrolux hoped the introduction of the AlphaCare range would
provide an impetus towards realising its goal of becoming tops in Asean.
  The group is aiming for a 20 per cent market share of washing machines
and a 10 per cent market share of refrigerators in Asean within the next
four years.
  It is estimated that by then, the washer market in Asean (excluding the
Philippines) will be worth about US$500 million (RM1.25 billion) and
refrigerator, almost US$1 billion.
  Ribohn said this to a group of journalists from Malaysia, Thailand,
Indonesia, Vietnam, Hong Kong and China during a visit to Electrolux
global headquarters last week.
  The group also visited Electrolux-Zanussi factory in Pordenone, near
Venice in Italy; the group's vacuum cleaner factory, quality control and
testing facilities in Vastervik, about 280km from Stockholm; and,
Electrolux Home Centre and retail shops in Sweden's capital city.
  Ribohn said the group was now evaluating the feasibility of setting up
manufacturing facilities in the Asean region.
  Although he declined to disclose the possible locations and the
estimated investment for the ventures, Ribohn said the plants would
produce washing machines and refrigerators.
  They will likely be in the form of joint ventures with local partners,
with Electrolux maintaining the majority control.
  The deals are expected to be finalised by the end of this year, said
Ribohn, who also heads the new markets division which besides Asia also
includes Latin America, Eastern Europe and parts of Africa.
  Electrolux (Malaysia) Holdings Sdn Bhd deputy managing director S.N.
Soon was quoted as saying last month that the company planned to increase
its investment in Malaysia through the establishment of another factory.
  He said the company had yet to determine what to manufacture, adding
that the final plan would be decided by its Stockholm head office.
  Electrolux now has a vacuum cleaner factory in Shah Alam, Selangor.
  Electrolux is not a newcomer to the Malaysian market, having been around
since the 1970s. In fact, Electrolux is almost synonymous with vacuum
cleaners in Malaysia.
  But there is more to the group than just vacuum cleaners.
  It also produces other household appliances, commercial appliances and
outdoor and industrial products. It manufactures washing machines,
dishwashers, industrial-size laundry machines, lawn trimmers and
chainsaws, to name a few.
  Last year, sales reached 115.8 billion Swedish Kroners (RM45.16
billion).
  The group now manufactures appliances under a number of brand names of
companies which it had acquired over the years. In 1994, for instance, it
took over German appliance company AEG Hausgerate.
  It shifted to higher gear in its global expansion drive with the
acquisition of the famous Italian brand name, Zanussi, in 1984.
  Electrolux now has investments in more than 90 countries in commercial
appliances, industrial products and outdoor products.
  While its brands are tops in Europe and North America, sales in Asia
only contributed 5.1 per cent to the group's turnover last year.

     16 Sep 1996, page 28

AGENDA Istimewa Sdn Bhd, a member of the Gasing Heights group, will soon

  They are located within the proposed shopping mall area, between the
residential and commercial sections of the township, the company said in a
statement.
  Sales of the shop-offices are expected to be as brisk as those for the
bungalow lots, which breached RM120 million since the launch in July.
  Kesuma Lakes is a 548ha self-contained township comprising residential,
commercial and industrial development with facilities such as a private
college, four schools, a medical centre, police and fire stations.

Germany's Vega eyes Malaysian mart

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 28

GERMAN-BASED Vega AG, which produces unplasticised polyvinyl chloride
window and door systems, will join up with Malaysian companies to market
its products.
  "The companies will buy the (window and door) profiles from us as well
as the machinery for cutting the profiles. We hope to identify long-term
partners by the end of the year," regional manager (Asia Pacific) Lionel
Teng said in a statement.
  He added that the company had taken the first step towards regional
expansion by increasing the use of its softline system of window and door
profiles for the Asian market.
  "Veka is also seeking to consolidate its foothold in markets such as
Indonesia, Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines.
  "To date, we have formed strategic alliances with manufacturers in
Singapore, Thailand and Brunei," said Teng.
  To cater for the requirements of the Asia Pacific market, Veka has
developed a "tropical compound", which safeguards against discolouration
of uPVC from prolonged exposure to intensive solar radiation, heat and
humidity.
  "In Malaysia, profiles will be developed in co-operation with leading
architects and designers to ensure local appeal."
  Veka headquarters is in Sendenhorst, Germany and it also has operations
in the United States, Britain, Belgium, France, Spain, Poland and China.

RM1b sales expected form Lestari Perdana

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 28

SAP Holdings Bhd expects RM1 billion in sales from its latest development
project, Lestari Perdana, situated next to a forest reserve in Selangor.
  The 400ha project will see the mushrooming of bungalows, semi-detached
units and link houses situated within an integrated garden township.
  Residents will also enjoy facilities such as fibre optic networks, a
hypermarket, a private hospital as well as schools and community halls.
  The project, managed by SAP Air Hitam Properties Sdn Bhd, is expected to
be completed within eight to 10 years.
  Sales of the first phase of the project, comprising bungalow lots, was
launched in Kuala Lumpur Saturday.
  SAP Air Hitam general manager (property sector II) Ahmad Azhar Hanafi
said the response had been satisfactory with 65 of the 200 bungalow lots
sold during a soft launch a month ago.
  "Sales from the 65 lots amount to RM20 million," he told reporters,
adding that the cost per square foot ranges from RM28 to RM37 while the
bungalow built-up designs range from 8,000 square feet to 17,000 square
feet.
  SAP is now finalising the details and plans for the link houses and
semi-detached units which are expected to be launched mid next year.
  Lestari Perdana is the latest of a string of housing development
projects undertaken by SAP.
  Other projects under the company include Taman TAR in Kuala Lumpur and
Bandar Baru Selayang.

Bank to expand savings products

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 26

By Kasmiah Mustapha

PACIFIC Bank Bhd plans to boost its savings products and services in
response to the Government's call to nurture the saving habit especially
among schoolchildren and workers.
  President and chief executive officer Tan Sri Dr Lin See Yan said with
this in mind, the bank intends to introduce more savings products targeted
at people from various ages.
  "Our savings programme will be divided into four phases, starting from
age one right up until the person retires, as the needs of the public are
different."
  To develop the saving habit among the public, the Government has also
formed a Cabinet Committee on Savings, envisaged to help raise the
national savings rate and reduce the savings-investment gap.
  The country's savings rate which currently stands at 34.3 per cent is
insufficient to balance the needs for investment, which has reached 40 per
cent.
  Lin said as a first step, Pacific Bank has launched the Dolphin Save
account nationwide, to coincide with the opening of its branch in Bandar
Sunway, as part of its national savings campaign drive.
  Holders of the Dolphin Save account, who are children aged 12 and below,
will enjoy a free personal accident insurance coverage up to 10 times the
account balance and extended two-way insurance coverage which covers both
children and adults.
  Lin said through the systematic programme and a good branch network,
Pacific Bank hopes to attract more depositors. Last year, Pacific Bank's
total deposits were RM5.5 billion.
  "To date, the amount has increased to RM6.5 billion and we hope to
record total deposits of RM7 billion by the year end."
  Speaking to reporters after officiating Pacific Bank's latest branch in
Bandar Sunway on Saturday, Lin added the bank plans to have 60 branches by
the end of the year from 57 at present.
  "We believe with a strong branch network, we would be able to attract
more depositors and at the same time encourage people to save."

First Islamic credit card in region launched by Arab-Malaysian Bank

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 26

THE Southeast Asian region's first Islamic credit card launched by Arab-
Malaysian Bank Bhd on Friday is designed to help Muslims conduct only
halal transactions, said managing director Azlan Zainol.
  Payments for haram transactions - as for liquor, gambling activities or
pornographic materials - will be automatically barred, following Visa
International Inc's agreement to block such payments worldwide.
  "This AMBank Al-Taslif Visa card is designed to help Muslims live the
Islamic way of life," said Azlan, adding that only about 15 types of
products and services out of Visa International's 2,000-odd categories
would be affected.
  He also said the card, designed in accordance with Islamic principles,
is not a credit card by conventional definitions.
  Other Islamic cards have been issued by Pakistan and some Middle East
nations, he said, but their adherence to Islamic principles is not as
comprehensive as the Al-Taslif card.
  For one, the credit limit for the AMBank card is determined by how much
the subscriber has placed as a fixed deposit in the Al-Mudharabah account,
and is as such different from convetional credit cards which require no
collateral.
  Further, the management fees or effective interest rate applied to
outstanding balances is capped at 12 per cent per annum.
  When the return on investment or interest earned on the fixed deposit is
also factored in, the net interest rate applied to outstanding balances
for card users works out to about only six per cent annually.
  "There is no other additional penalty charge on outstanding balances,"
Azlan said after the card was launched at Restoran Seri Melayu in Kuala
Lumpur by Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
  Conventional credit cards usually charge an additional five per cent
interest on late payments.
  However, the Al-Taslif card user will still have to pay a minimum of 15
per cent of his outstanding balance at the end of each month in compliance
with Bank Negara's ruling.
  Another feature of the card is that no cash advance can be obtained; it
can be used only for transaction payments.
  "We may allow this in the future if advice from the Syariah Council is
that such a service is within Islamic principles," said Aslan, adding that
the card can also be used to make zakat payments.
  Further, a RM1 rebate will be given to the subscriber for every RM100
spent on payments using the card. Part of this annual total of rebates
will be given out to charity on behalf of the cardholder.
  "This is how Islamic principles should be applied. When doing business,
be prepared to also give to charity," Anwar said at the launch.

Talking point: Don't fall into credit card trap with wild spending

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 26

By K. H. Lim

CREDIT cards. Are they a boon or a bane? Depending on whom you talk to,
they can be either or both. We have heard of high income-earning
executives being hauled to court by card issuers for failing to pay their
debts. On the other hand, there are thousands of satisfied cardholders who
feel the card is as good as cash.
  Which brings us to the point: the card IS as good as cash. Therefore,
manage it like you manage your cash. Don't spend more than you can afford.
Of course, this is easier said than done. Which is why hundreds (maybe
thousands) of people have ended up on the wrong side of the law.
  In a timely move Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim last Friday
directed Bank Negara to study how regulations could be further tightened
to protect card users.
  I suppose he had in mind the questionable practices of certain issuers.
These may range from being Shylock-ish in their unending search for
interest charges or their incessant barrage of unsolicited mail.
  But then again, why do banks have such an image problem when it comes to
credit cards? Is it because they need the revenue from penalties on late
payments or are they incurring high costs in their card operations.
  Other than charging penalties for late payments or direct interest on
rollover balances, banks also get revenue from card acceptors, ie outlets
which have signed contracts with the various card companies to accept
their cards.
  Certain issuers charge as much as two per cent of the value charged as
their commission while others go as low as 0.5 per cent. Market forces
have determined that these rates cannot be arbitrarily increased just to
ensure card-issuing banks meet operational costs.
  One will then have to look at the cost of their card operations.
Although costing profile and work culture may differ from bank to bank, I
cannot help but notice that at least two banks are very aggressive in
their marketing campaigns to attract cardholders.
  Besides enticing customers with various gifts (which means more costs),
these banks hire card sales executives on fairly high salaries and then
impose high targets for them to achieve.
  It's no wonder that these banks record the highest turnover of staff in
card sales operations. One must bear in mind that all these costs will
ultimately have to be borne by customers, in this case, cardholders.
  The pressure on these young and ambitious salespeople is so great that
they have, to their credit (pardon the pun), managed to sell their
products to people already holding cards belonging to other issuers.
  I know of people who not only carry different cards, but have two or
more Mastercards or Visa cards from different banks.
  Bank Negara statistics show that there were 1.8 million credit cards in
use as of end-June 1996 compared to 1.6 million a year earlier. I don't
think there were 200,000 new cardholders in the intervening 12 months.
This means among them were people who already had cards and were reeled in
by the "pressure-selling" tactics of these card sales executives who had
to meet quotas, failing which they would lose their jobs.
  Is it a wonder then, that the default rate has increased? One must bear
in mind that there are annual charges to pay besides the interest on
rollover balance.
  Here again, consumers must be aware of the various costs of owning
cards. Credit cards are no longer a status symbol; they have become a
necessity unless one relishes the idea of carrying large amounts of money,
or using ATMs every other day.
  Consumers must demand that card issuers do not charge annual fees, not
only for the first year, but also for subsequent years. After all, they
should run their card operations based on revenue from outlets and not
cardholders' penalties.
  To be fair, cardholders must charge a minimum of, say RM5,000 a year, so
that issuers can recoup costs. The minimum could be two or three tiered
depending on the "colour" of the card.
  Cardholders must always remember never to under-estimate what a monster
interest can turn out to be. Its cousin, called compound interest, is even
worse. I have personally known of people who surrendered their cards to
the issuers and gradually paid back what they owed over the next few
years. All due to an impulsive spending spree and a gross under-rating of
interest.
  Talking Point: The word credit card is a misnomer. It is the
convenience, not credit, that you need. Use it like a charge card. Make
use of the 20-day to 50-day interest-free period to pay. And pay in full.
Spend only what you can afford to pay in those 20-50 days. Otherwise,
don't.
  This way, both you and the bank will be happy.

Restructing to put TRI ahead in telecoms

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 25

By Elaine Jeyakumar

TECHNOLOGY Resources Industries Bhd is rearranging its corporate structure
under a five-year plan to further spearhead the group towards realising
its vision of becoming the premier telecommunications company in Malaysia.
  In an exercise known as Focus II, TRI is dividing its various
telecommunication activities into seven core areas:
  * mobile services,
  * international services,
  * value-added/content/multimedia
  * transmission
  * fixed network
  * data group and other products
  * international ventures.
  Focus II is a continuation of TRI's "Project Focus" implemented in April
1993 which outlined the group's focus and emphasis in the
telecommunications industry.
  Chairman and chief executive Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli said the group's
business had grown such that there was a need to streamline its activities
into these core areas.
  "This will give us a better platform to expand each of the sectors and
move forward in the industry," he told a Press conference in Kuala Lumpur
on Saturday.
  Each of the seven units will be headed by a president who will oversee
and manage the activities of each sector, which will eventually be
separate business entities relying on their own strengths.
  Effectively, the group's activities will fall under seven main companies
under the TRI umbrella.
  Under the original structure, all of TRI's telecommunication activities
fell under the umbrella of its 100 per cent-owned subsidiary Cellular
Communications Network (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd.
  Celcom's subsidiaries include Celcom Transmission (M) Sdn Bhd which
handles the group's transmission projects such as fibre-optics and
microwaves and Celcom Technology (M) Sdn Bhd which manages the value-added
and multimedia services.
  Under the restructured organisation of TRI, some of these companies will
be brought out from under Celcom and recognised as independent units in
their various sectors.
  "We will reposition them and possibly change the names of the companies
to better reflect their importance," said Tajudin.
  Meanwhile, Celcom will only concentrate on the cellular business and
handle the group's ART 900 and Celcom GSM services, trunk radio and paging
activities.
  Tajudin added that new companies would be set up for three business
units, namely the fixed network, data group and international venture
sectors.
  He said the group was also working towards product branding in a bid to
associate both the company and the products as one.
  "TRI is widely-known mainly as a cellular service provider because of
the Celcom mobile phone service network which is managed by Celcom.
  "What many do not realise is that we have a complete range of licences
to conduct a host of other telecommunication-related activities, some of
which have already been implemented."
  This includes one for the group's fixed network activities, which have
yet to make an impact on the industry. Nevertheless, TRI already has deals
with 25 companies to provide fixed services which are in various stages of
planning and implementation.
  Tajudin said in time, the cellular division, which now contributes 65
per cent towards the group's earnings, would become one of the smaller
contributors.
  The reduced contribution to about one-third of the group's earnings, is
expected in the light of the more rapid growth anticipated for the other
sectors.
  Tajudin said the ART 900 network was maturing and there was not much
room for further growth in that area. However, the Celcom GSM network has
potential for expansion.
  He said a number of the group's operations, such as international
services, transmission activities and value-added services, had already
started turning in a profit.
  Certain overseas joint ventures are also profitable. In addition, the
group has recently received the licence to conduct cellular operations in
Bangladesh.
  The restructuring of TRI is similar to the exercise undertaken by
Malaysia Airlines, which is also in Tajudin's stable of companies.
  Tajudin said the TRI restructuring exercise was expected to take between
12 and 18 months, encompassing the legal aspects as well as the
contractual agreements between the companies within the group.

Petronas set to issue third Yankee bond

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 25

PETRONAS has confirmed that it will issue a third Yankee bond soon to
raise funds to finance both ongoing and new projects in the downstream
sector.
  The national oil corporation's president, Datuk Mohd Hassan Marican,
said the bond, to be issued end of this month, or early next month,
followed two previous successful issues in 1993 and last year.
  Mohd Hassan said Petronas had appointed two American financial
institutions, CS First Boston and Solomon Brothers, as joint lead manager
for the issue.
  "But the size of the bond would be determined later ... if the price and
the response from the market is good, we will take as much as we can," he
said on Saturday after launching the new image for Petronas service
stations.
  The service station at Taman Sri Hartamas in Kuala Lumpur is the first
to adopt the new concept which includes the "Mesra" convenience stores,
mini post offices and automated teller machines.

My Wakil Rakyat and I: Paloh "to be back on fast lane when S46 members join
Umno"

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 10

IT takes a lot to survive as the wife of a politician husband and this
could not be truer than in the case of the wife of Norzula Mat Diah,
Assemblyman for Paloh.
  Norzula's wife, a nurse, was transferred from Gua Musang to Kota Baru
last year in a move perceived to be connected to the fact that her husband
was an Opposition strongman. It seemed that the local Wanita Umno wing
thought she was campaigning among the patients.
  Since Norzula could not possibly move to Kota Baru, the couple made the
difficult decision that she resign from the service. And she did,
reluctantly and not without a great deal of resentment.
  The family also had to move out of the government quarters into a
makeshift home in the annex of the Semangat '46 service centre.
  Thus, it is high irony that barely a year later, her husband is now
preparing to return to Umno.
  "That's politics, I suppose," he said with a shrug.
  His long-suffering wife, he claimed, had been sabar sangat over the
latest development, or so he thinks.
  Norzula's constituency is virtually one huge land resettlement tract
variously under Kesedar or Felda. About the only big areas not under some
land scheme or other are the Orang Asli settlement in Pasir Linggi and a
traditional village in Limau Kasturi.
  Limau Kasturi is Paloh's current and sole claim to fame. The village was
the inspiration behind the award-winning TV drama of the same name, its
storyline woven around a teacher's dedication to his pupil in the face of
daunting Islamic fundamentalism.
  Fortunately, the problems faced by Norzula are far less unnerving.
  The population here is still very much tied to the land and subjected to
the caprices of nature. Thus, the off-fruit season often finds him
reaching deep into his pocket to meet requests from settlers for money for
their children's examination fees, uniforms or books. Requests for bigger
sums are forwarded to the Yayasan Kelantan Darulnaim or Kelantan Religious
Affairs and Malay Customs Council.
  A large chunk of his wakil rakyat allocation goes to constructing fish
ponds.
  Paloh, he said, will be back on the fast lane once Semangat '46 members
join Umno.

My Wakil Rakyat and I: The prince has big plans for placid Gua Musang

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 10

All reports on "My Wakil Rakyat and I" by Joceline Tan; Badrul Hisham
Mahzan

TENGKU Razaleigh Hamzah's association with Gua Musang began in 1969. Thus,
it seemed best not to be argumentative when he claimed to know almost
every nook and cranny of the constituency.
  Back then, getting to Gua Musang town - if it could be called a town -
meant a journey of a day and a half. The prince would motor from Kota Baru
to Kuala Krai where he would put up the night.
  The next morning he would be up at the crack of dawn, down some coffee
and head off to the train station to wait, hopefully, for the 6.15am,
southbound train. If all went well, meaning there was no derailment or
other delays, he and his entourage would arrive at Gua Musang before 11pm.
  Otherwise, he would still be waiting when the sun was overhead.
  The river was an alternative. But it was accessible only during the
rainy season which could be dangerous and less than accessible during the
dry season when it was safe.
  To his credit, the Kelantan prince endured the hardship and now, looking
back, even claimed that he found it beneficial.
  "It was a challenge. This is the best constituency for me to learn about
my state and my people," said, involuntarily slipping into the royal "my".
  Tengku Razaleigh is in Gua Musang at least once a month.
  There seems little doubt that he intends to roost over the constituency
for awhile to come judging by the house he has built as well as the annex
of facilities for meetings and gatherings nearby.
  It is here that even the humblest of constituents will come to see him.
  "Mostly they want a land title to their name," he said in what was to
become  a ringing refrain among the other wakil rakyat here.
  Being the benevolent host that he is, he ensures that they are fed and
rested before they depart. Those who have come long distances, as most of
them are apt to, often receive some reimbursement for the journey home.
  But Tengku Razaleigh's long-term intentions are perhaps most revealing
in his plans for the constituency. For several years now, he has been
talking about elevating Gua Musang into the State capital while Kota Baru
will enjoy the status as a royal town.
  The rationale is that Gua Musang is far more central a location than
Kota Baru in the peninsular context.
  And it is, geographically speaking. Gua Musang is certainly nearer Kuala
Lumpur, and all other major towns in the peninsula than Kota Baru.
  Unfortunately, only his supporters and those living in Gua Musang seem
to find this idea exciting.
  Shifting the capital calls for a great deal of political clout and until
such time that Tengku Razaleigh manages to rally such clout, then Gua
Musang town will remain a placid and sequestered dell.
  He also has grand plans for the town centre which he was unable to
develop further after breaking away from Umno.
  But now that he is breaking away from Pas, he intends to revive those
plans or as he put it: "I want to re-do the town centre once Nik Aziz (the
Tok Guru) retires."
  Then, more seriously, he said: "They (people here) have been left
behind."
  He believes some of the more immediate solutions to the people's
problems can be solved with better infrastructure (especially more feeder
roads linking remote villages to main route), residential schools and, of
course, jobs.
  Among the ordinary people, especially the Malays who make up 90 per cent
of the 100,000 population here, there is, after all these years, a certain
awe that a privileged personality like Tengku Razaleigh would choose to
spend time, money and effort on their behalf.
  Although much of his accomplishments came during the 1970s and 1980s,
the projects he pushed forth were right on target on the Malay pulse. He
quenched their thirst for land and he basically opened up what was till
then a god forsaken terrain.
  The Orang Asli support for him has also not been for nothing. He stands
among a handful of politicians who have treated the Orang Asli with the
respect and dignity they deserve and not only when he wants their votes.
  All this, explains to a large extent the bedrock of support that he
continues to command in spite of his political vacillation.
  Given the Malaysian propensity for titles, it would not come as a
surprise if he is lauded as the "Father of modern Gua Musang" one of these
days.

My Wakil Rakyat and I: Requests for land titles will test rep's abilities

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 10

OMAR Muhamad favours the jubah and with his flowing beard and white
turban, he looks more like a Pas man than a Semangat '46 assemblyman.
  He also did not look well. The effects of a serious road accident
several years ago seem to have affected his train of thought and his
opinions came in hesitant spurts.
  Omar presides over the largest of the three State constituencies with
Orang Asli form a substantial segment of the electorate.
  His is perhaps the only constituency where special campaign strategies
and tactics are employed on the parts of both the ruling and opposition
parties to win over the Orang Asli.
  During the by-election, the BN air-dropped thousands of posters and
pamphlets from helicopters. The paper campaign may not have been very
useful then, given the less than desirable literacy rate, but the posters
were probably put to good use by the Orang Asli to cover up cracks and
gaps on the walls in their houses.
  Although many Orang Asli have been moved to more permanent settlements,
a large number still prefer to stick to their traditional sites that can
only be reached by river or on foot in a journey that sometimes takes up
to two days.
  And according to Omar, the best form of persuasion with these gentle
people is not through "air-mail" but face-to-face contact.
  "Everybody wants land titles ... Malays, Orang Asli, squatters," he said
in a resgned manner.
  The legendary Malay attachment to the land could not be more stark than
here in the Kelantan heartland.
  In fact, there are some 1,000 squatters clamouring for land titles in
his constituency, a task that will surely put him to the test in the next
few years.

RM150,000 grab from goldsmith shop

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 11

SEREMBAN, Sun. - Four masked men, three with pistols and another with a
knife, escaped with jewellery worth RM150,000 during a robbery at a
goldsmith shop in Jalan Datuk Bandar Tunggal yesterday.
  The robbers who struck just before the shop closed for business at
6.30pm escaped in a car which was later found abandoned near a shopping
complex about 200 metres away.
  A district police spokesman said the robbers had warned several workers
and its owner to surrender jewellery placed in several trays inside a
glass showcase.
  He said the robbers scooped the jewellery into several bags. However,
during the heist an alarm in the shop was triggered and the robbers fled
with the loot in a car driven by another accomplice, which was parked
outside the shop.
  Police later found a white Proton Saga car, believed to have been
abandoned by the robbers, at the basement of a shopping complex in Jalan
Tuanku Munawir, about 200m from the goldsmith shop at 9am today.
  Those with any information on the robbery are urged to contact the
district police station at 06-7635522.

Bahasa: An appeal to private sector

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 11

By Hanizah Hashim

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Private sector leaders should show their commitment
towards Government's efforts to increase the use of Bahasa Malaysia by
holding discussions through open forums.
  Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka`s director-general Abdul Aziz Deraman said the
participation of the private sector in forums to be held in the 1996-98
Private Sector National Language Movement was essential.
  He said these forums would provide a platform for discussions and give a
clearer picture on the problems faced by the private sector in
implementing the use of the national language.
  Abdul Aziz was opening the forum "Enhancing the Economic Value of the
National Language" organised by the DBP and Malaysian Linguistics
Association yesterday.
  The panelists were Permodalan Nasional Bhd's group chief executive Datuk
Mohd Helmi Mohd Taib, Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd's managing director Datuk
Ahmad Tajuddin Abdul Rahman and Universiti Sains Malaysia lecturer
Professor Abdullah Hassan.
  Abdul Aziz said open forums would provide the best arena for the
exchange of ideas and opinions on ways to achieve the movement's objective
with the support and co-operation of the private sector.
  During the panel discussion, chaired by former DBP director-general
Datuk Hassan Ahmad, Mohd Helmi said it was important to find ways to
encourage the use of Bahasa Malaysia in the private sector.
  However, he said, in the financial sector, clearer directives were
needed from Bank Negara for the increased use of the national language in
official transactions.
  "The current reality of the job market in the private sector is that
graduates with a good command of the English language was preferred as
this is the language used for business communication.
  "We have to find ways to increase the use of Bahasa Malaysia in the
private sector or else graduates from local universities would not be
accepted as their lower proficiency in English could be viewed as a
weakness," he said.
  Ahmad Tajuddin said extra effort from all sectors and closer co-
operation between the public and private sectors would be needed to make
Bahasa Malaysia a respected language in the business community.
  He said the profit motive was an important factor in the private sector,
thus it would seem unnecessary to translate a document into Bahasa
Malaysia if the English version was more commonly used.
  Economic strength was vital, he said, citing the "language pride" of the
Japanese as an example which made it necessary for those interested in
doing business with them to learn the Japaneses language for easier
communication.
  "If we are economically successful, more people will want to know how we
succeed and will learn our language and culture."

60 unwed pregnant women find shelter in Negri

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 11

SEREMBAN, Sun. - Sixty unwed pregnant women have been placed under the
care of the State Welfare Department and a non-governmental organisation
in Negri Sembilan.
  Of the total, 56 have been placed in welfare institutions under the
department throughout the State while the remaining are under the care of
the State Malaysian Islamic Welfare Organisation branch.
  State Unity and Community Development Committee chairman Goh Siow Huat
said today most of them were students of private learning institutions and
factory workers aged between 16 and 19 years.
  He said some of them had sought the assistance of the department
voluntarily while the others were either sent by their families or ordered
by the courts to be placed under the department's care.
  "Most of them became pregnant after indulging in sexual relationship
with their male companions who later abandoned them," he said, adding that
these women came from all over the country.
  He said the four women under the care of Perkim were from outside the
State who became pregnant while working here.
  Goh said the department would take care of the pregnant women including
delivering their babies who would be returned to the mothers or their
families or placed under its adoption scheme.
  "We are really serious in wanting to help unwed pregnant mothers. So we
hope they will not be shy or afraid to come forward."
  The department's move was not to encourage pregnancies outside marriage
but to provide a place for these women to deliver their babies in efforts
to curb cases of abandoned babies, he said.
  Goh urged parents to instil discipline among their children especially
through values and religious knowledge to prevent them from indulging in
unhealthy activities.

My Wakil Rakyat and I: Rozali Isohak: A genuinely nice chap in politics

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 11

IT was hard to believe that the voice roaring through the loud speaker
belonged to Datuk Rozali Isohak.
  The first and last time I met him, had been in his office. Then, he had
struck me as a gentle soul, soft-spoken and muted in his views.
  And here he was, under the blazing mid-afternoon sun, lambasting Pas in
a fashion almost comparable to the king of political oratory, Datuk Seri
Anwar Ibrahim.
  Later, he said a little sheepishly: "This is Kelantan. You have to talk
like that to get their attention."
  Actually, as the Kelantan media clique will tell you, Rozali is a
genuinely "nice chap", so much so, that one wonders what he is doing in a
business like politics. Then again, niceness is not exactly the most
effective of political tools.
  He is one of Tengku Razaleigh's most trusted party comrades which
perhaps explains his appointment as Deputy Menteri Besar II. The party had
to settle for the "II" after failing to get their hands on the "I", and it
was incidents like this which eroded the early camaraderie of Semangat '46
and Pas.
  His constituency, Dabong, is one of the most remote and underdeveloped
in Kelantan. Here, roads are more the exception than the norm and many
villages are accessible only by river.
  The country may have been catapulted along at eight per cent growth and
skyscrapers in KL may be making headlines worldwide, but life has changed
minimally for Malays here.
  The everyday act of going to school continues to be a physical challenge
while a simple illness may lead to death. Amenities and services urbanites
take for granted are still the stuff of dreams or as they say here, mimpi
saja.
  According to Rozali, projects scheduled under the Sixth Malaysia Plan
were not implemented. This included a road linking Dabong and Gua Musang
and a bridge over Sungai Galas.
  The rural economy does not generate new employment and Dabong has seen a
steady migration of its young people.
  The biggest employer is the Komplex Perkayuan Kelantan, a subsidiary of
the Kelantan Economic Development Corporation with a payroll of 200; the
Majlis Daerah Kuala Krai Selatan comes a close second with 100 employees.
  "Dabong needs at least 1,000 more jobs," Rozali said.
  Like most politicians, Rozali thinks his constituency has tourism
potential. The Stong Hill Resort, boasting the longest waterfall in South
East Asia, has attracted more than 10,000 visitors, mainly foreigners.
  The Assemblyman returns weekly. As is typical of the way politics and
religion tend to merge in Kelantan, Rozali arrives in Dabong in time for
Friday prayers and then stays back at the mosque to meet his constituents.
  He has a service centre run by five volunteers but some constituents
still travel all the way to Kota Baru to see him.
  Rozali is confident the Dabong electorate will go where Tengku Razaleigh
goes. And although his party's pending merger withUmno has captured the
national imagination, life in Dabong is unlikely to change radically.

Squash.: Ong to skip Hong Kong doubles tour

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

By A. Devaraj

PROFESSIONAL player Ong Beng Hee, who has set his sights on winning the
Milo-Dunlop PJ Open title early next month, intends to skip the doubles
playing tour of Hong Kong on Sept 27-29.
  Beng Hee's father, K.H. Ong, said yesterday that the playing tour is too
close to the PJ Open, which is scheduled for Oct 2-5 at the Astaka courts.
  Said Ong: "Quite frankly Beng Hee is not very keen on playing doubles.
He'd rather concentrate on singles and for this year's PJ Open. I think he
has a very good chance of winning it."
  Ong has requested the SRA of Malaysia to reconsider sending his son for
the Hong Kong trip.
  SRAM executive director Lt Kol (R) Wong Ah Jit said yesterday they were
looking into Ong's request. "If Beng Hee is not really keen on playing
doubles in Hong Kong, there's no point in sending him. However, we will
make a decision soon."
  National director of coaching Mej (R) S. Maniam is currently in India on
a coaching course and SRAM are likely to wait for him to return before
making a decision.
  Beng Hee is supposed to partner Kenneth Low in Hong Kong. The other
players named for the Hong Kong trip include Yap Kok Four, Ng Tian Sin,
Tan Tian Huat, Ricky Lee and Allan Soyza.
  For the PJ Open, Beng Hee is seeded second behind Low and the duo are
expected to meet in the final.
  Said Ong: "If Beng Hee is excused from the Hong Kong trip, he will be
fresh for the PJ Open and that is another reason why I would prefer him
not to go.

Squash.: SRAM prepare players for England stint

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

By A. Devaraj

THE SRA of Malaysia will concentrate on improving the fitness of Kenneth
Low, Ong Beng Hee, Yap Kok Four and Kuan Choy Lin before they leave for a
four-month stint in England on Nov 1.
  SRAM executive director Lt Kol (R) Wong Ah Jit said this is to ensure
that they will be ready for the tough training and playing stints in
England.
  Said Wong: "We don't want them to waste time on their fitness there when
we can do it here. That is why they are doing a lot of runs and gym work
and will be ready, fitness wise, for the England stint."
  Low and Yap will be attached to John Milton, who runs Proace Management
in Broxbourne, outside London.
  Ong and Choy Lin will be attached to national coach Jamie Hickox. But
all of them will be staying together, only the training programmes will be
separate.
  "In the case of Ong, he will be playing matches with professionals in
London and also Wales while the others will be basically staying in
Broxbourne.
  "Proace, who manage several top profession`ls, will come up with a
training programme for Low and Yap while Hickox will prepare a schedule
for Choy Lin and Ong.
  "However, we have insisted that the players be involved in the League
where they will be able to play against some of the top names in the
world. The English League is a very tough one and most of the top players
in the world are involved in the League in November and December.
  "However I'm not sure whether there is a League for women where Choy Lin
can compete."
  Wong said that in the latest fitness tests conducted on the players
early this month at the National Sports Council sports and medicine unit,
Low was the fittest.
  "Low's results were impressive. He only has a fat level of five per cent
and this is very good. Top American athletes have a fat level of three per
cent.
  "Ong's results were also good but Yap is overweight and needs to lose
some weight and will have to undergo a special diet.
  "Choy Lin is also carrying excess weight and she too will have to diet.
  "However, we are still awaiting the final overall results of all the
players. Once we get that, those who are not fit will have to undergo
extra fitness training before they leave for England."

ACC qualifier 1996.: Cricket.: Bangladesh outclass UAE

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

By C. Navaratnam

BANGLADESH gave a classic all-round display to outclass the United Arab
Emirates by 108 runs in the final of the Pepsi-Asian Cricket Council
qualifying round competition at the Kilat Club padang yesterday.
  With this convincing win, Bangladesh have qualified for the Asian Cup
four-nation tournament in Sri Lanka next year. They will play against the
Test playing giants Pakistan, India and hosts Sri Lanka.
  Bangladesh were certainly a cut above UAE in all aspects of the game.
UAE, who fielded five players who took part in the World Cup competition
earlier this year, batted badly and went down meekly.
  Bangladesh, electing to bat, knocked up 212 runs in 49.3 overs. They
were given a flying start by their openers, Shariar Hoss`in and Harun-Ur
Rashid, who put on 66 runs by the 16th over.
  Shariar, in particular, was quick to punish the loose balls and went on
to make a majestic 58 which included seven fours off 95 balls, while Harun
hit a well-grafted 21.
  In-form Aminul Islam coming in No 4, kept up the tempo by belting 46
runs in only 44 balls.
  After his dismissal, wickets began to fall at regular intervals and they
were trotting at 180 for 9 but their last pair, Saiful Islam (15 n.o.) and
Sheikh Salauddin (8), batted well for a valuable 32-run partnership.
  Off-spinner Saleem Raza was easily the pick of the bowlers capturing
three for 31.
  Set a target of making just slightly more than four runs an over for
victory, UAE opening bat, Saleem Raza took off in blistering style
smashing 11 runs in the opening over off left arm medium pacer Anisur
Rahman.
  However, Saleem failed to last long and went out to a superb diving
catch by Mohamed Rafiq at deep midwicket off Khaled Mahmud for 20 runs off
17 balls.
  They then lost three quick wickets and were precariously placed at four
for 49 but a fifth wicket stand of 39 runs by Qais Farook (14) and Arshad
Laiq (31 n.o.) saw the score move up to 88.
  With the Bangladesh spinners bowling intelligently and backed by tight
fielding, the UAE batting crumbled and they were all out for 104 in 36.5
overs.
  Medium pacer Khaled Mahmud, who came in as a late replacement after
their regular opening bowler Hasibul Hossain was hurt during a training
session on the eve of the competition on Aug 5, was adjudged man-of-the-
match by match referee K. Srikanth, former Indian Test opening bat.
  "He fully deserves it. He broke the back of the UAE batting by taking
the three vital wickets to put his side on the road to victory," said
Srikanth.
  Off spinner Sheikh Salauddin bowled effectively to pick up three wickets
for 13 runs in six overs while left arm leg spinner Mohamed Rafiq bagged
two for 10 to trouble the batsmen.
  UAE, however, gained some consolation when Syed Azhar Saeed was named the
player-of-the-series.  FINAL - Bangladesh 212 (Shariar Hossain 58, Aminul
Islam 46, Harun-Ur Rashid 21, Saiful Islam 15 n.o.; Saleem Raza 3-31, Akbar
Rana 2-26, Arshad Laiq 2-35, Azhar Saeed 2-45).  UAE 104 (Arshad Laiq 31 n.o.,
Ali Akbar Rana 21, Saleem Raza 20, Quas Farook 14; Sheikh Saluddin 3-13,
Khaled Mahmud 3- 26, Mohamed Rafiq 2-10).

Hockey.: Yayasan see red despite victory

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

YAYASAN Negri Sembilan assistant manager Satwant Singh was an angry man
after his side's 2-0 win over Bank Bumiputra in a Malaysian Hockey League
match at the Tun Razak Stadium yesterday.
  Satwant's anger was not aimed at his players, who surprisingly struggled
to find the net in a match they dominated from start, but at umpire Surjit
Singh of Tenaga Nasional Berhad.
  The match ended on a controversial note when Mukesh Kumar was sent off
in the 67th minute after apparently hitting BBMB's Masrukin Kadiman on his
head with his (Mukesh) hockey stick.
  Mukesh and his teammates claimed it was an accident as Masrukin was
stretchered off with his head bleeding and were livid when Surjit thought
otherwise and flashed the red card.
  Satwant and several of his players could hardly contain their anger
after the match and stated what they thought of the umpiring.
  "I am aware that I can be hauled up for speaking my mind but this was
poor umpiring. What happened was not on purpose and I don't understand how
the umpire could have sent Mukesh off," said Satwant.
  YNS, who face Tenaga in a top-of-the-table clash next, will miss Mukesh
and also Maninderjit Singh and Satwant was furious.
  "I don't know what the umpire was trying to do. I leave it to others to
interpret it but something has to be done about the umpiring," said
Satwant.
  The red card constitutes an automatic one-match suspension. Maninderjit,
who received a yellow card in yesterday's match, misses the Tenaga clash
as well as it is his second.
  "I risk getting suspended by the Technical Committee but I have to speak
out as today's incident was daylight robbery," said Satwant.
  The controversial sending-off aside, the finishing of his players must
have also worried both Satwant and coach Stephen Van Huizen.
  Besides the two field goals through R. Shankar in the 13th minute and
Mukesh in the 50th minute, YNS missed one penalty stroke and 11 penalty
corners.
  In another match, star-studded Petaling Jaya Municipal Council (MPPJ)
returned to their winning ways when they edged Bank Simpanan Nasional 2-1
at the Petaling Jaya Stadium.
  MPPJ, who suffered a 3-2 defeat to defending League champions Maybank on
Saturday, looked lethargic throughout the match and needed a goal in each
half to subdue BSN.
  Forward Atul Kumar was the toast of the MPPJ team when he scored both
the goals in the 13th and 67th minutes.
  BSN, who did well despite losing 3-1 to favourites Yayasan Negri
Sembilan on Saturday, were again full of life yesterday.
  But for all their hard work, they only had a Sarjit Singh goal in the
59th minute to show for.
  BSN coach C. Paramalingam was obviously unhappy with the result.
  "But we are a young side. We will improve as the tournament goes on."
  In Ipoh, National player Kerpal Singh scored twice as pacesetters Tenaga
Nasional Berhad destroyed Armed Forces Electrical, Mechanical Engineering
Corps (JLJ) 4-1 to stretch their unbeaten run to three matches at the
Azlan Shah Stadium yesterday.
  It took Tenaga 30 minutes to breach the JLJ defence off a penalty
corner. The ball hit an onrushing JLJ defender and Kerpal was at the right
place to slot it home.
  Hardly three minutes after the break Tenaga increased their lead to 2-0
when ex-national player S. Sivabalan scored off a penalty stroke.
  Two minutes later, they were three up. Mahinder Singh scored off a move
initiated by Nor Basni Abas.
  Kerpal struck again in the 47th minute to stretch their lead to 4-0.
  However, JLJ never gave up and were rewarded with a consolation goal in
the 69th minute through former National player Zainal Hussain.
  In Kuantan, DeTas needed an Azman Ariffin goal in the 50th minute to
beat Segambut Hockey Club 1-0 at the Kuantan Hockey Stadium yesterday.
  DeTas controlled the game but could not capitalise on their chances.
They had 11 penalty corners, compared to one for Segambut, but failed to
convert any.
  Segambut's defence put up a brilliant performance and their goalkeeper
Jasvinder Singh was in top form.STANDINGS

Climbathon.: Salagan's hat-trick

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

DEFENDING champion Guainus Salagan coasted to an easy win in the men's
category of the 10th Malaysia Airlines-Mount Kinabalu international
climbathon, to notch a hat-trick of the title in Kota Kinabalu yesterday.
  With the exception of Indonesian Yoseph Lawa Yohanes, who finished
second, the top 10 finishers in the event - which attracted 164 entries
including 17 foreign competitors - were Malaysian runners.
  The climbathon is a race up and down Mt Kinabalu, Southeast Asia's
highest peak at 4,101 metres, with the event covering a distance of
21.4km. It is jointly organised by the Sabah Tourism Promotion Corporation
and the Sabah Parks with Malaysia Airlines as the main sponsor.
  The 29-year-old Guianus posted a time of 2 hours 52 minutes and 51
seconds to emulate his elder sister Hasny who yesterday extended her
winning streak in the women's category for three years in-a-row.
  First runners-up Yoseph recorded a time of 2:56:19 while self-employed
Rodimin Sodundu finished third with a time of 2:56:57.
  Guianus, who finished 82nd from a field of 160 international runners in
the recent World Mountain Race in Austria, received US$4,500 (RM11,250)
and a return air-ticket to London.
  The father of a three-year-old son also received a bonus of US$1,000 for
being the first to reach the summit.

Badminton.: Fancied Roslin too good for off-form Lo

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 47

By J. Naidu

TOP SEED Roslin Hashim had no trouble winning the men's singles crown in
the Proton-EON Kedah Open badminton championships at the ASRC Hall in Alor
Star last night.
  He beat an off-form Lo Ah Heng, the 1995 All-England semifinalist, 15-5,
15-11.
  The small crowd which turned out last night were totally disappointed
with the token resistance provided by Lo and Roslin was in full control
from start to finish.
  In the first game, he took four straight points in one service. After
that, it was one-way traffic with Roslin collecting his points with
pinpoint smashes and drop-shots to wrap up the game in just 16 minutes.
  Lo checked himself and led 6-2 in the second game but Roslin caught up
at 6-6 and romped home an easy winner in 26 minutes.
  This is his fourth win in the circuit. Roslin was champion in the Sabah,
Perlis and Johor Opens.
  The men's doubles final between the top seeds Lee Wan Wah and Choong Tan
Fook against second seeds Rosman Razak and Chew Choon Eng proved to be the
best tie of the night.
  After 72 gruelling minutes, Lee-Choong triumphed 8-15, 15-8, 18-14.
  In the women's singles final, second seed Norashikin Amin played a cool
and calculated game to upset top seed Geevien Saha 11-6, 11-3 in 23
minutes.
  The women's doubles final also saw topseeds Kuak Seiok Choon and
Norashikin Amin upset by second seeds Lim Pek Siah and Chor Hooi Yee. Pek
Siah and Hooi Yee gave a sterling performance to beat their opponents 15-
10, 15-4.  
RESULTS (all finals) - MEN - Singles: Roslin Hashim (Kel) bt Lo Ah Heng
(Mal) 15-5, 15-11.
  Doubles: Lee Wan Wah-Choong Tan Fook (Pk-Joh) bt Rosman Razak-Chew Choon
Eng (NS-Pg) 8-15, 15-8, 18-14.
  BOYS - Singles: James Chua (Sar) bt Yeoh Kay Bin (Pk) 15-4, 15-11.
  Doubles: Yap Wee Meng-Tang Soo Sen (KL-Pah) bt James Chua-Chan Chong
Ming (Sar-Sel) 15-10, 15-7.
  WOMEN - Singles: Norashikin Amin (KL) bt Geevien Saha (Sel) 11-6, 11-3.
  Doubles: Lim Pek Siah-Chor Hooi Yee (Pk-Ked) bt Kuak Seiok Choon-
Norashikin Amin (Pg-KL) 15-10, 15-4.
  GIRLS - Singles: Ng Mee Fen (KL) bt Law Pei Pei (Kel) 2-11, 12-9, 11-2.

Soccer.: Chow tells youngsters to prove their worth

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 48

By Vijesh Rai

DESTINED to miss the Malaysia Cup for the fourth consecutive time, Kuala
Lumpur aim to prove that their season has not been a total waste when
Premier League action resumes on Saturday.
  So far it has been a season where the bad things have far outweighed the
good things, starting with the failure to land three Indonesian players,
the poor performance of players on whom KL had placed much hope on, right
to the sacking of Azrul Amri Burhan and Wong Kah Loon.
  But in coach Chow Kwai Lam, KL have a fighter who will not allow his
boys to surrender until the final whistle is blown on Oct 19 - KL's last
match of the season against Terengganu.
  "I know that we are almost out of the running as we have dropped too
many points and are far adrift of the others," said Chow.
  Far is the right word as KL, above only Kelantan in the standings, have
collected a meagre 13 points from the 20 matches they have played.
  Mathematically, they are still in with a chance but Chow knows that
their fate doesn't only depend on how they do in the remaining matches as
the performances of several other teams too will decide whether KL make
the Malaysia Cup.
  "The boys know that we are looking at missing the Malaysia Cup again but
I have told them that we have to continue fighting," said Chow.
  What Chow wants them to do in the remaining matches is to prove that
they are worthy of being called professional footballers.
  "They must go out and show that they are capable of making the grade and
that KL can again be a team to be reckoned with," said Chow.
  But for that to happen, there must be more commitment as this is
something which has been lacking in several players.
  "I have been stressing to them that good performances will not only
benefit the team but individually as well," said Chow.
  Indications are that several KL-bred players, who left the team for
greener pastures, might return next year and this is bound to create a
rivalry for places.
  And for those who are still keen on playing for the city side again next
season, good and committed performances in the remaining matches will help
them when their contracts come up for renewal.
  "All I want from them is a fighting performance that will show that KL
may be down this season but in time, we will rise again," said Chow.

Letter from Moscow: Enthralled by the change in seasons and fortunes

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 12

By Vadim Potapov

TO tell you the truth, all the shopping for our family is usually done by
my wife. Actually, it's not a difficult task, as Moscow shops are nowadays
full of whatever you may want, even such exotic items as shark's fins,
giant lobsters and abalone. Prices bite, as we say, but that's another
issue.
  Yesterday, however, quite unexpectedly for myself, I made a small
contribution towards the family's shopping: I bought five packs of
detergent for cleaning irons ... I must confess that I've never before
even heard about such a thing.
  It so happened that while leaving the metro, I noticed an elderly well-
dressed man. He was a retail trader and was selling all kinds of stuff.
  His appearance was so unusual for a tradesman that I decided to talk to
the man.
  His name was Nikolai Ivanovich, he was retired, and before that he had
been a scholar in the field of mathematics. He became involved in retail
trade because his pension was too small.
  I felt sorry for him, and that's how I found myself an owner of five
packs of the detergent.
  By the way, the sum I paid for the purchase was equal to one US dollar,
and I can't even imagine how many such packs it would be necessary to sell
in order to earn one's living.
  Today, in Russia, it is believed that the market has put everything in
proper perspective.
  This is true to a certain extent, but there are many people who failed
to find their places in this new life.
  The government is trying to render assistance to poor and old, but its
reserves are hardly considerable for the given purpose. Its main goal now
is to collect as many taxes as possible.
  For the first two weeks of this month, this issue was widely discussed
by top government officials.
  Trying to increase critically small budget revenues, the government
prepared a presidential decree allowing tax authorities to levy taxes on
all payments into individual bank accounts.
  The step could lead to double taxation for simply shifting money from
one account to another, and that's why the news immediately caused a wave
of public indignation.
  The decree was adopted mainly because of Alexandr Livshits, the new
Minister of Finance and a former chief economic adviser to Boris Yeltsin.
  Livshits became a well-known personality in Russia for his revenue-
rising measures and frequent appearances on TV screen.
  Earlier this year, he revealed and made public that directors of big
state enterprises - instead of paying wages to workers - deposited the
money to commercial banks, gaining high interests.
  Then Livshit's revelations caused no negative reaction with the public,
while in the last case, the protest were obvious.
  "My salary is hardly that of a royal family member, and I am definitely
against the government's intention to collect taxes two or even three
times, and that's exactly what the implementation of this decree might
lead to", said Irina, a salesgirl in a large Moscow supermarket.
  Many ordinary people shared Irina's sentiments, and responding to that
tornado of public resentment, the new tax decree was cancelled.
  The promptness of that decision surprised the public just as much as the
absurdity of the decree.
  Early this month, President Yeltsin continue to surprise the Russians.
  This time he announced on TV that he had a heart problem, and would
undergo an operation at the end of the month.
  People were astonished as they were not usd to the president speaking
about his health himself, but many of them sighed with relief, as finally
the uncertainty was over and done with.
  Those, who just the day before scolded Yeltsin for his two-month absence
before the public, felt compassion for the man after his annoucement.
  "I do hope the president will return to the Kremlin in good physical
condition, even if it takes a long time. I really wish him complete
recovery," Olga, 26, a school teacher, said.
  Against the background of Yeltsin's lengthy absence, Kremlin security
chief General Alexander Lebed continues to strengthen his authority.
  He is a frequent guest on TV screens, and media comments on his every
word.
  The euphoria he causes today eclipses many other news, including the
information about the creation of a new political union, "For Truth and
Order".
  It was announced by Lebed's supporters that the new movement would serve
as a kind of supporting force for the general outside the government.
  Its creation belonged to Lebed himself, and its main goal now is to back
his peace initiatives in Chechnya.
  It is expected that Lebed soon will be elected as the leader of this
party.
  It is also reported that the three organisations that comprise this
party have branches in more than 60 of 89 regions in Russia.
  Thus it may serve Lebed as a good base if he is to make a bid for
presidency.
  Summer is over. I thought about it when I saw a man feeding two cute
donkeys with a large red watermelon.
  Piles of the fruit have appeared in Moscow along with the first signs of
autumn.
  Life goes on.

DELL AKBAR KHAN (Malaysian team manager): We played well and we could
match the Thais. They deserve my praise. We have shown that we can stand
side by side with the Thais. And if we had a little bit of luck last
night, we could have won it.
********
THAVATCHAI SAJAKUL (Thailand coach): It's a relief we are still the
kingpins of Southeast Asia football. I've always said it was going to be
close and tough. But as I said again whoever scored first would have the
advantage. We did tonight and that made the difference. But Malaysia have
proven that they are now a force to be reckoned in Southeast Asia football
also.

Asean Football Federation Championship Cup (September 1-15, 1996 :
Singapore).: Soccer.: End of a fairy tale

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 48

By Dan Guen Chin

MALAYSIA  .......... 0
THAILAND  .......... 1

THE fairy tale had come to an end. A sad end for Malaysia on a night the
Thais were crowned champions of Asean soccer.
  For all their hard work and will to win, the Malaysians knew deep down
in their hearts that Thailand were by far the better team in the final of
the Asean Football Federation championship last night and the winner's
cheque of US$80,000 (about RM200,000) rightly belonged to them.
  Psychologically, Malaysia were affected even before the start. The
experience of Dollah Salleh was not there in the starting lineup to
provide the steadying influence in midfield.
  Dollah's ankle injury and the fear that it could not take the strain was
the reason why.
  And there was no place for Negri Sembilan fullback Faizal Zainal
although he had served his mandatory two-match suspension and was
available last night.
  For the Thais, there was a bonus in the form of skipper Surachai
Jaturapattarapong, who returned to the starting lineup - ankle injury or
no - for that was the tonic they needed.
  Right from the kick-off, the Thais went straight for the jugular and
they kept pressing forward, comfortable in the knowledge that their
attacking flair would pay off.
  And it didn't take them long either.
  Only nine minutes into the match, the Thais were ahead - and deservingly
so too.
  As wave after wave of the blue-shirted Thais charged forward, Kiatisuk
Senamuang - in his roving role - picked up the ball midway in the
Malaysian half.
  Zainal Abidin Hassan hesitated, so did B. Rajnikandh. Kiatisuk saw the
opening and, from 25 metres out, hit a tremendous shot with all the swerve
and power that beat Khairul Azman Mohamed all the way.
  There was no response from the Malaysians after the early setback, and
in all honesty, they could not raise their game to match the Thais.
  The Thais were in no mood to give the Malaysians the space and
opportunity to create their moves.
  Even when Thai skipper Surachai left the field midway in the first half
for Phitaya Santawong to come on, the rhythm of the Thai attack was never
out of sync.
  As Malaysia continued to struggle to find their footing and the form
which had taken them right through to the final, the Thais grew even
stronger and could have punished the Malaysians further in the 25th minute
but Apichard Teelamcharlemdit's attempt from 20 metres smacked the
crossbar.
  Even Zainal, who had hardly put a foot wrong throughout the tournament,
could no longer carry the burden of rallying his men to the team's cause
and neither could K. Sanbagamaran force his way through from midfield in
search of another crucial goal to turn Malaysia's fortune around.
  For the 33,000 fans gathered last night, and there were many Malaysians
among them, they knew deep inside who were the better team.
  It had to be the Thais with their fluent movement and the varied attack,
leaving the Malaysians with little to offer except maybe to wait for the
one silly mistake needed to punish the Thais.
  Even when Zainal abandoned his defensive role to push upfront; even when
Rusdee Sulong was taken off and even when M. Chandran came in Rizal
Sukiman, there was little likelihood that Malaysia could score from open
play.
  But the Thais did look good for another goal. And although it did not
come, there was no denying that the Cup was theirs for the taking.
  Malaysia gained some consolation though when Zainal was named the most
valuable player of the tournament after the final.
  MALAYSIA: Khairul Azman Mohamed, Zami Mohamed Noor, B. Rajnikhand, Azmil
Azali, Zainal Abidin Hassan, Rizal Sukiman (M. Chandran), Nazri Yunos, Yap
Wai Loon, Azman Adnan, Rusdee Sulong (Shamsurin Abdul Rahman), K.
Sanbagamaran (Faizal Zainal).
  THAILAND: Wacharapong Somchit, Kritsada Piandit, Surachai Phatanapong
(Phitaya Santawong) (Yutana Bolsak), Natee Tongsukkao, Apichad
Teelamcharlemdit (Jakarat Tonhongsa),  Natipong Sritong-In, Surachai
Jaturapattarapong, Kiatisuk Senamuang, Worawwot Srimaka, Dusit Chalermsan,
Phitaya Santawong.
  Referee: Yoshimi Ogawa (Jpn).
  * IN the third placing playoff earlier, Vietnam came good last night
and, in doing so, made the Indonesians look so ordinary.
  Vietnam were one up in the 10th minute thanks to a cheeky back heel from
Huynh Quoc Cuong after Nguyen Hong Son had split the Indon defence.
  Vietnam went 2-0 up in the 27th minute when Hong Son's cross from the
right saw Indonesian defender Yeyen Tumena deflecting the ball into his
own net.
Indonesia pulled a goal back in the 65th minute from a Kurniawan Yulianto
shot from 15 metres out.
  But the Vietnamese dealt them another blow in the 76th minute after Hong
Son was brought down in the box and skipper Vo Hoang Bu made it 3-1 from
the spot.
  There was a brief fightback from the Indonesians after they reduced the
deficit in the 84th minute, from a wonderful goal put away by Aples
Gidgeon but it came too late.

Editorial: Bosnia votes to make or break

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 12

BOSNIA just made it in time to vote. On Saturday, the last day set by the
Dayton timetable, the international community narrowly managed to shepherd
the warring sides to the ballot box. It was Bosnia's brightest spot since
the Dayton signing last year. But plenty of hard feelings remain. Since
the Dayton implementation, all sides have been gravitating towards their
bastions and strongholds. Returning refugees have not been welcomed,
particularly by their Serb transplanters. Local mixed community elections,
such as in Mostar, have not been harmonious. Similar elections are due for
the rest of the country, with little cause for rejoicing. All parties
strike and parry and take postures - each looking to get what they can out
of the loose ends of the Dayton plan.
  Most of those loose ends could have been tightened by a more resolute
implementation effort. As it happened, Dayton's sponsors took too much for
granted after the accords' signing. They delayed the removal of its
biggest obstacle - renegade Serb leader Radovan Karadzic - and gave the
indicted war criminal enough freedom to push his own and the other sides
deeper into their nationalist corners. It is in the safety of these
corners that they have remained stuck, and where their votes will
eventually count.
  Disagreements about how sternly to treat the rebel Serbs have remained
to divide the Americans and Europeans even after the removal of Karadzic.
The Europeans never acted tough enough to purge the Serb leadership of his
supporters and their persistent calls for a separate Republika Srpska in
contravention of the Dayton formula. The Serbs were made to back down only
about a week before the elections. They have toned down their defiance,
rather cunningly calculating that they have a better chance of holding on
to ethnically cleansed territory (Dayton had handed them 51 per cent of
the country) by fixing ballot majorities than by showing resistance. In
the elections, non-Serbs returning to their former hometowns were
channelled to polling stations through specified routes, where many of
them found their names absent from the rolls. The shadow of ethnic
cleasing and forced eviction clouds the elections in other ways - more
than a fifth of the votes cast were the postal ballots of Bosnians chased
out of their homeland.
  Twenty-five years ago, the West pooled some US$60 million to help out a
Yugoslavia thrown on a limb by Marshal Tito's death. About four years ago,
their hastiness in recognising the independence of the Yugoslav
constituent states left the federation in tatters. The Europeans still
cannot see the difference between ameliorating and aggravating their
"Balkan problem," acting in two minds over the guilt of the Serbs in the
present crisis. Their dithering reinforced the Serbs' closed-in mentality,
justifying their acts of genocide and brutality on the grounds that the
rest of the world were against them. Although the holding of the elections
has been a qualified success, its results are anything but certain.
Bosnia-Herzegovina is too full of bad memories to cure its history in one
day. At best, Dayton will create something much less than a mini-
Yugoslavia - but at least Bosnia will survive, hopefully long enough to
heal its wounds. At worse, the institutional strings forced on by a weak-
willed international community will be pulled to breaking point - by a
Bosnia electing, rather than fighting, to carve itself up.

Letter: Artists as keepers of Malaysian national heritage

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By Jane Hughes

DURING a recent visit to Malaysia, I could not help wondering if even the
best Malaysian artist could survive the constant bombardment of cultural
imperialism from the West.
  Television, cinema, advertising push us all towards an international
homogeny that is hard to resist. In the art world, this is particularly
dangerous as a nation's cultural heritage needs to be nurtured in order to
flourish and move forward.
  I have spoken to many Malaysian artists who think deeply about this
threat and grapple with the problem in their work. Most have trained in
the West or been taught by visiting Western artists. Some influence is not
a bad thing as long as it does not become exclusive. Artists must, and do,
strive to take only the best of Western influences while remaining firmly
rooted in traditional cultural ideology.
  So artists realise the danger and take their role as keepers of national
identity seriously but there is an even more insidious threat. This comes
from the patrons and general public to whom art works are offered. If
their tastes are affected by the call to ape Western styles, will they not
demand such art?
  Few artists are privileged enough to be able to ignore such economic
influences.
  There are two main courses of action that would help this problem. The
first is greater government support for the arts in general with more
consistent provision for presenting contemporary art to a wide public.
While some States seem to provide lavishly, official commitment elsewhere
appears to be less enthusiastic. Improved State funding would ease the
economic pressure on artists.
  The second course of action is greater promotion of Malaysian art
overseas.
  Although there has been a few forays by artists to exhibit
internationally, Malaysian art is still almost unknown in the UK and the
US. I feel certain that if westerners had access to more contemporary
Malaysian art, it would be applauded unequivocally. Consequently, as the
Malaysian public see how their culture is valued, it will encourage an
even greater national confidence that is essential to withstand outside
forces.
  Malaysian art is an excellent advertisement for the country and should
be given a more prominent role.
  Politicians should not forget that, ultimately, all societies are
remembered for their culture.

Letter: Desludging of septic tanks: IWK explains

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By Mirza Mohamed Tariq

I REFER to two letters that appeared in the New Straits Times recently,
regarding the need to desludge septic tanks and sewerage rates. There
seems to be still many misconceptions about desludging of septic tanks.
  Septic tanks are settlement tanks and need to be desludged according to
their design. The Malaysian Standard (MS 1228) for a septic tank serving a
household of five people is two-metre cubic. These septic tanks are
designed with a settling basin with a retention time of 24 hours and a
sludge storage capacity of up to two years.
  Accordingly, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government's Technical
Committee on Sewerage Services has recommended that septic tanks be
desludged once in two years on an average to ensure that they operate
efficiently and their final effluents do not pollute the environment.
  If not desludged, these septic tanks will cause sludge solids to be
discharged into the waterways. Hence, it is not surprising that the
Department of Environment has identified domestic sewage as one of the
major pollutants of our rivers in every annual report.
  The sewerage rates for a domestic customer varies between RM2 and RM10 a
month and there are no additional charges for scheduled desludging.
Pending the outcome of the Sewerage Review Committee, IWK continues to
provide the scheduled desludging service and appeals to all customers to
co-operate and ensure that their septic tanks are desludged in order to
safeguard their immediate environment.

Letter: JB council's reason for failure to pay its debt is a real joke

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By H. Tan

AS a citizen from the State of Johore, and an old resident of Johor Baru,
I don't know whether to laugh or cry when I read in the New Straits Times
on Sept 6, that the Johor Baru City Council had failed to pay a debt of
RM100,380.67 to a music production house as a result of which the council
was sued and its premises, which has over RM100,000 worth of equipment and
other items inside, sealed.
  Failure to pay the debt, according to the council's secretary, was
"because of a communication breakdown". What will happen if the office
equipment and other items are sold to pay off the debt?
  Presumbly, the council's entire administrative machinery will grind to a
halt and the reason will be "because of a total office equipment
breakdown". What other jokes can the council produce to entertain us?

Letter: Arts or Science: Ringgit and sen is main issue

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By N. Sum

WE have heard calls from politicians and educationists to arrest the
declining interest of students in science and to make the subject more
interesting in class so that students would prefer to take up Science
subjects instead of Arts.
  But that is not the crux of the problem. It is a matter of ringgit and
sen.  At the end of school life and when the person starts to earn a
living, how much more can the former Science student earn compared to the
Arts graduate despite the extra effort put in to study Science subjects?
  The private sector does not call for more Science students as it does
not need scientists to sell a product or a service. So the banking, hotel,
tourism and trading industries, to name a few, do not need scientists.
Only in the Research and Development wing of the pharmaceutical, food,
chemical, heavy and light industries are a few scientists needed.
  In almost every country, it is the Government sector that employs the
largest number of scientists.
  Prior to the implementation of the New Remuneration System in 1992, a
A11 officer (senior timescale) earned about RM250 more than his junior A19
(timescale) officer.
  With the implementation of the NRS, the senior timescale officer is now
downgraded to a timescale officer. Not only that, within the same category
(Kategori IV), there are numerous grades according to the departments they
serve in.
  For example, in the Education Department, it is DG3, in the Agriculture
sector, it is G3, in the Science sector, it is C3, in the Economic sector,
it is E3 and so on and so forth.
  What is so demoralising is that with the implementation of the NRS, the
former A11 senior timescale officer may be earning a few ringgit less than
a former A19 timescale officer in another department. Particularly galling
is that he may have a Master's or a doctorate whereas the former A19
officer may only have a general degree (without Honours).
  Not only that, the system of salary increments to the P2 and P3 scales
from the P1 scale within the same category may see the former A19
timescale officer earning more than the former A11 senior timescale
officer.
  It is already bad enough that very often, junior officers are promoted
to higher posts (Kategori II) over more senior officers because of
favouritism. But to earn less than junior officers may be the last straw.
  Such is the anomaly of the NRS in the Government sector that mediocrity
is prevalent among the scientists; not that the scientists are mediocre,
(after all, they were the creme de la creme of their schools and their
universities), nor did they achieve mediocrity, but they had mediocrity
thrust upon them.
  For some of them, their talent in sales matches their talent in science,
and so they opt for the private sector. But to rub salt into their wounds,
the Government has stopped those in the teaching and medical professions
from opting out, citing their services are critically needed; yet at the
same time, treating them like bad step-children, to be punished and not
rewarded!
  However, for many others, (some have served more than 20 years), they
have no choice but to remain in the civil service until mandatory
retirement, since the private sector does not require that many
scientists.
  So, do not blame the parents, who only have the welfare of their
children at heart, if they advise their children to drop science subjects.
As it is, it has been stated that the country needs 10,000 accountants by
the end of the century, but has anyone said that the country needs 10,000
scientists who will be rewarded according to their work? Since the country
does not respect and reward scientists accordingly, how can scientists
respect themselves?

Outlook: Safety at workplace not for government to shoulder alone

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 13

By Lee Lam Thye

DEPUTY Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim launched a month-long
nationwide campaign on occupational safety and health on Sept 3 initiated
by the Ministry of Human Resources.
  This effort by the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health
of the Human Resources Ministry is being carried out with the objective of
increasing awareness among employers and employees on the importance of
occupational safety and health as well as to make OSH practices part of
our culture.
  Deputy Human Resources Minister Datuk Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir has
revealed that since the introduction of the Occupational Safety and Health
Act 1994, the number of workplace accidents has declined.
  He said the accident rate last year was 15 per 1,000 workers (117,231
accidents) compared with 17 per 1,000 workers (125,535 accidents) in 1994.
  But fatalities rose from 787 in 1994 to 1,167 last year.
  Now that the campaign has started, our industries need to re-assess
their safety and health practices, to see how far they fulfil present
requirements.
  In the final analysis, it is not only the awareness that we should seek
to promote but the palpable will to achieve the targets set for an
accident-free workplace.
  Employees and unions have a special stake in this life and death issue
and must assert their right for a high safety standard at the workplace.
  There is also a necessity for people to change to meet the demands of
industrial development.
  The most important change is that of attitude towards safety and health
practices at worksites.
  There is a need to remove the notion that safety and health at work are
the responsibility of the Government alone.
  It is not. It is a collective responsibility.
  In this respect the top-level management must prove their commitment and
adopt a pro-active approach.
  They should employ safety engineers, industrial hygienists and
occupational physicians and conduct occupational safety and health
programmes.
  Industrial accidents, including occupational diseases constitute a
serious problem. Apart from loss of life, injuries and personal suffering
to the victims and their dependants, industrial accidents also cause much
economic loss.
  Unlike accidents, occupational diseases are difficult to detect becuase
the signs take a longer time to manifest. The cumulative cost is
tremendous.
  Everybody loses - the employer, employee, Government and the nation.
Losses to property are quantifiable but human suffering is not.

Jitters over control by consortium

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 14

By Harris Iskandar Taib; Shareem Amry

PRIVATE waste contractors fear abuse of power, favouritism and
victimisation at the hands of the consortium that won the contract for the
nationwide privatisation of garbage collection.
  Klang Valley Solid Waste Contractors' Association president Francis Lai
said there was also no guarantee their services would not be wrongfully
terminated in favour of other contractors lobbying to take over their
existing contracts.
  "We are not against privatisation. What we are asking from the
consortium is that it liaise with us and let us know what the entire plan
will be like. At the moment it holds our future in its hands."
  The consortium, led by Hicom Holdings Bhd, and also comprising Malaysian
Mining Corporation, Konsortium K.K. Industries and Konsortium Consec Gali,
is set to take over the nation's waste collection on Jan 1 next year.
  It has set up a company called Eminent Flora Sdn Bhd to undertake the
project, and to date, has already taken over the dumpsite at Taman
Beringin.
  The consortium recently submitted a draft proposal of a new law
governing garbage collection to the Economic Planning Unit.
  New legislation is necessary not only to set national standards of
garbage management, standards now under the discretion of the local
councils, but also to award the consortium jurisdiction over all areas of
garbage collection.
  This includes collecting, storing, transporting, processing, treating
and recycling solid wastes, dealing with domestic, commercial, non-toxic
industrial and construction wastes and wastes from road cleaning, drain
and river cleaning.
  Lai said the association could offer some valuable suggestions and ideas
to the consortium if there was only an effort to consult them.
  "We do not want to get shortchanged by the privatisation programme. That
is why it is necessary for the consortiums and the Government to let us in
on their plans.
  "Some of us have invested a lot in machinery and equipment. Contrary to
belief, this is not a very lucrative business.
  "Therefore, if it is wiser for us to fold up now we will do it rather
than lose much more by waiting."
  Private sector waste collectors have been working on contract for all
142 local municipal councils since 1976. In the central and northern
regions alone, their investments add up to an estimated RM240 million and
they directly employ about 2,500 people.
  Alarmed by the privatisation exercise, private contractors formed the
association in December last year to put forward a plea to the Government:
Let us stay in business.
  In a letter to the Housing and Local Government Ministry dated July 16
this year, the association wrote: "We want our stake recognised so that we
are allowed to co-exist with the Government-appointment consortium
 ...Specifically, we would like to continue servicing the trade and
industrial community."
  Their stake can only be assured if legislation, currently being drafted
to make way for the privatisation exercise, states clearly that the
consortium will only handle residential waste and leave industrial garbage
collection to private contractors.
  The consortium is expected to allow private waste contractors already
servicing this industry a grace period before eventually being absorbed as
sub-contractors.
  Lai proposed that the consortium draw up a set of regulations and
principles that would allow the association to supervise and regulate all
sub-contractors on its behalf.
  He said the consortium should also include in the new legislation being
drawn up, a provision requiring all sub-contractors to become members of
the association before being allowed to operate.
  This would make it easier to regulate the operators, rather than the
consortium being left with the task of tackling every sub-contractor
individually.
  Describing the plans to take over every sector of waste treatment as
ambitious, he said the consortium should instead concentrate on opening
and managing new and existing dumpsites, the building of transfer stations
and incinerators.
  Some residents are unenthusiastic about changing the system for fear of
being at the mercy of the consortium.
  Said Bukit Bandaraya's residents association president Tunku Zahiah
Tunku Sulong: "Based on our past experience, we are worried that we would
not be able to address our complaints to the consortium as effectively as
we can to City Hall.
  "At least City Hall has shown that they will respond if we tell them our
problem.
  "When we have complaints about the cutting of grass in our area on the
other hand, which is handled by a private company, it is not so easy."
  "What happens when the contractors fail to collect our rubbish on the
designated time and date?" asked Petaling Jaya resident Ramlan Ismail.
"Does the new legislation allow us the opportunity to seek compensation
and damages?"
  Another houseowner was worried about the method of billing, fearing
there might not be a way to prove if the contractors were overcharging
him.
  "If we are going to be billed by the bin, this means every household
must keep track of how many bins of rubbish they dispose in a month.
  "What happens when our figures do not tally with that of the
contractor?"
  Perhaps the biggest question left unanswered in the project to privatise
the country's waste treatment system is whether the consumer will have a
choice of disposing the rubbish himself and so avoiding having to pay for
privatised services.
  One resident likened the situation to the privatisation of highways: "If
a motorist refuses to pay toll, he can still use the trunk road. Will we
have the same option?"
  Unlike the treatment of sewage, consumers have the capability and
resources to discard rubbish themselves as it involves no sophisticated
equipment and technical expertise.
  The present system makes it compulsory for consumers to pay for the
services as it is part of the assessment charges which also includes the
installation and maintenance of street lighting, drains and the cutting of
grass.
  But when charges for rubbish collection are taken out of the assessment
and the service run by a company instead of the Government, then the
service becomes more of an option.
  The new legislation is expected to address these issues, besides
proposing methods of how to separate charges for the collection of garbage
from the assessment charges.

Hanky-panky in garbage collection jobs

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 14

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Garbage collectors, who make low bids to get their
contracts, are cutting corners to ensure profits by hiring lorry drivers
and owners to do the job part-time but at the expense of the environment.
  The part-timers are dumping garbage indiscriminately as some don't even
know where the dumpsites are, people in the business said this week.
  The contractors' cost-cutting measures also ranged from not picking up
garbage as regularly as the contract specified, to the use of open lorries
instead of compactor trucks.
  "Some who win the contracts don't even own proper garbage compactors.
They haul the rubbish in open lorries, which is a cheaper mode of
transportation but very unsanitary," said Yamin Vong, group general
manager of the Sitamas Group, which also includes Conwaste Disposal
Services Sdn Bhd.
  Other private garbage collectors, who have been complementing local
council services since 1976, said these contractors were able to obtain
contracts from the local councils through low bids.
  "But they are not in the business so they don't even know where the
proper dumpsites are," said Hi-Tech Waste Management Sdn Bhd director
David Zon.
  "What happens is they just discard the garbage indiscriminately."
  With the average Malaysian tossing out between 0.5kg and 0.8kg of
rubbish a day, this has given rise to a number of foul, illegal dumpsites.
  But those in the industry claim that the contractors are not the only
ones to be blamed as the local councils are also partly at fault.
  There are allegations that some councillors who sit on the tender board
award contracts to companies owned by them, relatives or friends by
overriding the Urban Services Department's recommendations by a simple
majority vote.
  There are even accusations of councillors or politicians monopolising
the entire rubbish collection service within one district.
  "We know who they are, but there is no way to prove that these companies
belong to them because the permits are issued in the name of other
individuals," said one contractor.
  "What we know is that they collect a certain percentage at the end of
the month. Some politicians are also involved, lobbying for contracts
either for themselves or for their supporters."
  In some cases, allegations have also tainted the local council senior
officials.
  "Don't be surprised if the health inspectors, the council secretary, one
of the directors or even the council president has an interest in one of
the companies which have been awarded a contract for refuse collection,"
said another private contractor.
  When contacted, local authorities did not deny that their services fall
short of expectations, but said they were not professionally-trained to
handle the job and did not have the resources to compete with private
contractors.
  "This is why we need professionals to do it. Many of the people in local
councils today do not have the expertise to handle waste management,
because the entire rubbish industry is different today than it was 20
years ago," said Petaling Jaya Municipal Council president Mohd Nor Bador.
  "In the past, it was just a matter of collecting the rubbish and
disposing it. Today's urban services development involves recycling and
incineration. We are not trained to do this, and this will involve plenty
of re-evaluation."
  Mohd Nor said it would be unfair to say local councils were completely
inefficient in handling rubbish. Because of the lack of a proper system
and proper resources, he said, it would appear as if the local councils
were incompetent.

Concerted effort vital to maintain clean image of Langkawi island

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 18

By K. Bala

LANGKAWI, Sun. - Depending on the authorities alone to strive for a
constant clean image for the island resort is going to be a difficult
task.
  There must be help and concern from all parties - the business sector,
voluntary bodies, schools, sports bodies, political parties and the
layman.
  The District Council does carry out clean-up campaigns and invites
various parties to join them but these must be prolonged and not on an ad-
hoc basis.
  Hotels, particularly the bigger ones and other tour related businesses
do organise clean-ups in places other than their surroundings. But these
are few and too far in between to be effective. And one tends to get the
feeling that the outside clean-up is for media publicity.
  Sheraton Perdana general manager John O Shea is all for hotels to take
part regularly in such clean-ups by providing the voluntary manpower in
organised clean-ups.
  "A group of hotels and tour organisations can adopt a particular area
near their vicinity on a regular basis," he says.
  The hotel which opened for full business recently did a clean-up of the
Masjid Al-Hana and surrounding areas.
  Langkawi Village Resort manager Feisol Danker and public relations
manager for both Pelangi Beach Resort and Burau Bay resort, David Fong,
are also for the move for more co-ordinated efforts.
  "True, all the bigger hotels clean their surroundings and beaches daily
but if the other areas where our guests go are not as clean, it may negate
our efforts," Feisol says.
  Unlike major towns there are not many voluntary and sports bodies on the
island but the few active ones can play their part.
  For instance, the active Beach Hash House Harriers who have their run
every Sunday can adopt a particular beach to clean on the eve of the run
at least once a month.
  Kelab Puteri Langkawi comprising women in business organises an annual
charity event to raise funds for the needy.
  Its president Khorshida Begum said they are also contemplating getting
their husbands and children to take part in gotong royong activities
regularly.
  Perhaps the political parties particularly the BN component parties
which have large memberships could devote time to non-political activities
like clean-up of beaches and the town.
  The sector that has benefited most from the Langkawi boom are shopping
outlets in town, a few of whom were reported to have recorded a turnover
of more than RM1 million a month each.
  The least they can do is to employ workers if their own employees are
busy helping out in the business to clean up their surroundings of litter
and the clogged drains on a weekly or fortnightly basis instead of merely
complaining about the problems.
  This will sort of repay the island and community for the booming
business they have been enjoying because of the duty-free port status.
  Schools too can play their part in inculcating the clean habit from
young.
  Schools can organise at district level such activities just like they do
for sports and get the children to be involved with parental permission.
  All they have to do is pick up the empty cans, bottles, palm fronds and
driftwood without dirtying their hands too much.

Demand for inquiry into death of workers

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 19

IPOH, Sun. - The Perak Information Network and Service Organisation today
called for an inquiry to determine the party responsible for the
electrocution of two factory workers at Sungai Kinta in Jalan Raja Musa
Aziz on Friday night.
  Pinso legal adviser M. Kula Segaran said the Deputy Public Prosecutor's
office should apply for a magistrate to sit as coroner.
  He said the court should also determine whether Tenaga Nasional, Ipoh
City Council or the contractor carrying out the road widening project was
responsible for the incident.
  The bodies of R. Arumugam, 32, of Taman Emas in Chemor and A.
Santhanakumar, 28, of Pokok Assam, Taiping were found at the river bank by
a member of the public who called the police about 10.30pm.
  Tenaga Nasional staff removed a live electric wire near a bridge which
was also being widened.
  Preliminary investigations revealed that Santhanakumar touched the wire
while Arumugam was also electrocuted when he went to his friend's aid.

A higher standard of cleanliness is needed

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 19

LANGKAWI, Sun. - Village elder Aziz Musa,77, told his teacher son, Kamal,
32, that the big porch in his recently built house on a piece of land he
had presented would be just another tempat ayam berak (a spot for chicken
droppings).
  Both father and son laughed, for the remark made in humour, is a common
happening in kampungs on this enchanting island where chicken roam freely
just like the cows and buffaloes do in the green fields and at times stray
on to the roads.
  With wooden homes giving way to brick buildings as the island awoke from
its slumber under seven generations of curse by as the legend of Mahsuri
had it some eight years ago, the chickens tend to wander into the cement
flooring and make their droppings freely.
  But the specks of chicken droppings can be easily washed away. Just a
little water and a broom, the droppings disappear only to reappear a day
or two later.
  Of course a fencing around the homes can keep the hens, cockerels and
the chicks at bay.
  But these days city folk rarely get to see live chicken in their posh
housing estates except for dressed chicken in the supermarkets.
  Anyway the kampung chicken is much tastier than those from the
commercialised farms what with worry over use of nitrofuran in chicken
feed.
  This chicken episode bears importance when one discusses the cleanliness
of beaches and the blue waters of unique and scenic Langkawi comprising
104 islands.
  Generally, the beaches and waters are clean except for some litter and
occasional temporary spots of dark patches in the blue waters or on land.
  Elsewhere there are muddy or dusty roads depending on whether it wet or
dry season caused by the airport runway extension works and the marina
project on reclaimed coastal land in Kuala Muda and the island-wide
digging to lay a modern sewerage system.
  When these works are completed in a year or two, there will be bigger
runways to accommodate jumbo jets, a marina resembling the Mediterranean
and a comprehensive sewerage system.
  The only problem with this price for development is that most foreigners
plan their vacations well ahead.
  As they drive or ride a motorcycle along the pothole-ridden stretches,
they do not know that all these works are part of the development plan for
the island and that they will turn the muddy beaches of Kuala Muda into a
paradise.
  There is therefore a need to minimise the discomfort unless we want them
to return home with wrong impressions. Anyway the authorities have set
some guidelines of late and there seems to be some improvement.
  For an international resort which attracted some 1.83 million tourists
last year, there should be a higher standard of cleanliness, not
withstanding the more than a dozen big signboards along the main roads
exhorting the people to "Keep Langkawi clean".
  Just as the porch of Aziz's home will be soiled after a period of time
if the chicken droppings are left uncleaned, the image of the island may
suffer the same fate.
  The chicken can get away at most with a shoo or by having a slipper
hurled at it but the island requires the authorities, the residents,
visitors and those involved in development works to act more responsibly.
  Talk at coffeshops and pubs - the latter being an attraction among
Caucasians who have managed to make the island their second home - tend to
centre on the rapid pace of development and the accompanying problems it
may face including mantaining the serenity and cleanliness.
  Their fears of over-development at the expense of environment appear to
have little basis given the repeated assurances by Government leaders and
planners that the tranquillity of the resort island would not be
sacrificed.
  That means the hills, forests, sandy beaches and clear waters which make
the island unique will always be there for these have made Langkawi
popular since it opened its doors in 1987.
  "Rest assured that we are not going to kill the goose that lays the
golden egg," said Datuk Abdul Halil Mutalib, the general manager of
Langkawi Development Authority recently.
  But the fears expressed at the coffeeshops and pubs should not be
dismissed totally. For what it is worth, there is need for vigilance to
prevent the island from following the less cleaner ways of Penang or Port
Dickson.
  At present, the island's beaches and waters can be considered clean.
  The District Council which is responsible for mantaining the island
clean can do better particularly in Kuah town where rubbish and clogged
drains are a common sight.
  With impending nationwide privatisation of garbage collection, the
council should ensure that the company responsible does a better job than
what it has been doing.
  Most of the white sandy beaches along Pantai Cenang, Pantai Tengah,
Tanjung Rhu, Datai and Burau Bay are without doubt clean simply because
they are fronts for many of the classier hotels.
  Just like the family which has to wash the chicken droppings, these
hotels diligently keep their surroundings including the beaches (which
belong to the Government) clean by deploying workers to pick up litter and
other debris washed ashore daily. They are more interested in getting
their guests to return.
  The problem is with the budget chalets fronting the sea. Their
managements are more worried about filling their rooms rather than to
spare a worker or two to clean the surroundings including the beaches.
  There is also a problem with the public beaches like certain stretches
of Pantai Cenang, Pantai Tengah, Pantai Kok, Pantai Pasir Hitam and Pasir
Tengkorak.
  There has been an ongoing debate as to who the culprits behind the
littering are.
  The argument by the council that it is the work of visitors seems to
hold water.
  For generally, the Malays from the kampungs have always taken pride of
their home and surroundings, however poor they may be.
  Of course, Malaysians have yet to learn to take pride in their
surroundings in their their own backyards let alone when they are out of
town.
  Surprisingly, visitors from Asian countries also acquire the Malaysian
habit. Perhaps they want to express their freedom after being subject to
stringent anti-litter laws back home.
  We too have anti-litter laws. There are signboards in various parts of
the island which read: Warning. Please do not litter. Fine RM2,000.
  If enforcement is lax then we should not put up such signboards as they
are a waste of money. Fine them irrespective of whether they are
Malaysians or foreigners and word will get around just like the jail term
for drink-driving which was first enforced here.
  The unique Pantai Pasir Hitam (Black Sand Beach) is among the tourist
attractions which draws a large number of visitors. At times one has
difficulty seeing the sand as they are covered with plastic and driftwood.
  After the clean-up by council workers it looks better but worsens until
the next spruce-up.
  A group of traders operates from stalls built by the Government beside
this beach. A little gotong royong spirit can ensure cleanliness of the
short stretch which is their bread and butter.
  But then they would rather be counting the till selling samples of the
black sand and other souvenir items to the tourists. They are thinking of
getting rich with little investment while the Government and private
sector spend billions to make the island a popular international resort.
  Another scenic public spot is the short stretch at Pasir Tengkorak along
the way to Datai. Several wooden huts have been built amidst trees for use
by visitors who enjoy the clear cool waters of the Andaman sea.
  There are at least six large litter bins in the area yet garbage is
strewn all over.
  Perhaps more garbage bins should be put up. But frankly the beaches and
towns could do with more and bigger bins to prevent over-flow.
  But there is hope yet to change the littering habit among Malaysians
judging from the cleanliness along the Pantai Kok during a recent visit.
  It is a popular spot among the young expecially schoolchildren from
outstation who come to camp at the site. It was refreshing to see the
beach clean though many schoolchildren had camped there during the recent
school holidays.
  Perhaps the observations of two foreign tourists best sum up the
situation in Langkawi.
  Petite Miharu Nishima, 24, and her sister Yasue from Osaka who spent
three days on their first visit to the island found the beaches generally
clean though they had some reservations about the situation in Kuah town
where they went shopping.
  "You have such a beautiful island. Please ensure that it remains this
way, beautiful and more clean," says Miharu.
  Educationist Terry Swanson from New Zealand was at Pasir Tengkorak where
he had taken his wife Gillian and three children for a dip in the Andaman
waters in a 4WD hired from the five-star hotel where he was staying.
  He decided to spend a week in Langkawi - of which he heard so much -
after the New Zealand Education Fair in Kuala Lumpur.
  Asked for his frank opinion about the state of cleanliness in Langkawi,
Swanson, who is Dean of the Faculty of Commerce at Nelson Polytechnic
said:
  "You have beautiful white sand beaches, warm waters that are not
polluted and an enchanting island. You have a valuable asset which needs
to be protected and nurtured.
  "The island is not at all dirty but (the situation) could be better."
  The island could be cleaner just like the porch after Aziz and his wife
wash away the chicken droppings. Langkawi can be a shining example to
others with concerted efforts on the land and sea blessed by nature.
                       

Pix: Swanson ... could be better.

Pix: Nishima ... beaches generally clean.

Top Asian athletes among 3,000 for Terengganu run

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

KUALA TERENGGANU, Sun. - The Sept 22 Terengganu Bridge Run is expected to
attract some 3,000 participants.
  State Tourism Development, Arts, Culture and Sports Committee chairman
Datuk Aziz Awang said well-known Asian athletes were also expected to
participate.
  "Compared to the previous competitions, this year's response is
overwhelming," he said at a briefing for 700 tournament officials
yesterday.
  Among the international runners invited for the run are Myanmar's Thura
and Thinor, Chheng Piseh (Cambodia), Roy O Vence (the Philippines), Wong
Sai Wing (Singapore) and Mujini Ronala (Thailand).
  Indonesia will be sending its 15-year-old woman runner, Endang
Rahauingsih.
  India is sending its international woman runner, Sunita Godara.
  Singapore and Thailand will be sending the most number of participants,
with 250 runners each.
  So far more than RM225,000 has been collected for the run.
  Aziz said beginning this year the State Government had decided to turn
the 21.1km run into an annual event. Previously it was held biennially.
  He said each of the invited runners had a track record of less than 75
and 85 minutes respectively for the men's and women's categories.
  The run is jointly organised by the State Government, the Terengganu
Amateur Athletics Association, the State Youth and Sports Department and
AAC Sports Fitness and Recreation Sdn Bhd.

Police launch city-wide campaign to fight crime

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Prevention is better than cure... With this in mind,
police today launched a city-wide crime prevention campaign and urged
cityfolk to fight crime.
  Police hope the campaign would help reduce the number of break-ins
reported at homes and business premises.
  "Since 1994, we have received 7,613 reports of break-ins at homes and
business establishments," city police chief Datuk Ismail Che Rus said.
  There were 2,910 reported cases in 1994, 2,922 cases last year and until
last month, police have received 1,781 reports.
  Police investigations revealed in most instances the burglars gained
entry into the premises through doors and windows.
  "Of the 7,613 cases reported since 1994, this method of entry was noted
in 5,636 cases," Ismail said.
  Besides this, 770 cases showed the burglars had gained entry through the
roof while 247 cases were pulled off with the use of duplicate keys.
  Ismail was speaking at the launch of the Crime Prevention campaign at
the Sri Sabah flats in Cheras.
  The campaign was jointly organised by city police and the Kuala Lumpur
Housing Developers Association.
   Also present were city Criminal Investigation Department chief Senior
Assistant Commissioner (II) Zakaria Mohamad, Sentul and Brickfields police
chiefs Assistant Commissioners J.R.J. Raj and John Chong respectively;
Cheras deputy police chief Superintendent Asmaon Alias and KLHDA president
Mustaza Mohamad.
  Ismail said despite premises being fitted with window and door grilles,
burglars still gained entry using basic house break-in tools like
screwdrivers and crow-bars.
  "Very often, these grilles are of low quality material and can be easily
removed using these tools, he explained.
  He also advised property owners to ensure that locks are changed or
added when they receive the keys to their new homes.
  "Anyone, from the labourer to the developer, who handled the keys prior
to the owners, could easily make duplicates," Ismail said, adding that
police have identified the Cheras district as having the highest crime
rate.
  In view of this, police have intensified their efforts in Jalan Peel,
Jalan Menteri, Jalan Bendahara, Taman Kobena, Taman Maluri, Taman Shamelin
Perkasa, Taman Miharja and the Sri Sabah flat.
  At a similar function in Brickfields, Chong said police have identified
the Happy Garden, Taman Bukit Aman and Brem Park housing estates to focus
their efforts as these areas have the highest crime rate in the district.

Fire razes factory, two houses

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Fire destroyed a furniture factory and two squatter
houses in Kampung Michael Chen, off Km13 Jalan Puchong today.
  Factory owner, Chin Chong Yau, 40, said the fire, which broke out about
4.30pm, destroyed finished products worth about RM900,000.
  A Fire Services Department spokesman said the fire was believed to have
started at one of the squatter houses.
  "We have ruled out a short circuit as the houses do not have electricity
supply," the spokesman said.

Fire Services Department to get new name, responsibilities

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The Fire Services Department will be known as the
Fire and Rescue Services Department by the end of the year, under the
Government's plan to widen the scope of its duties.
  Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk Dr Ting Chew Peh said his
ministry was preparing a working paper on the change of name and would be
presenting it to the Cabinet soon.
  Ting said this was the first time the department would be changing its
name since its formation.
  "The ministry plans to enhance the emergency and rescue services of the
department. It must be multi-disciplined and multi-skilled to keep abreast
with the rapid pace of development.
  "In fact, the department already carries out rescue work, in instances
when a building collapses, when there are landslides, flash floods and
road accidents. The Pos Dipang incident was a good example where fire-
fighters also carried out search and rescue operations.
  "The department also does work which has absolutely nothing to do with
fighting fires like helping detain mentally ill persons and catching
snakes."
  The Minister was speaking after opening a two-day International
Convention of Chung Shan Associations at the Concorde Hotel today.
  There were about 600 participants at the convention, which brought
together people who originated from the Chung Shan province in Kwangtung,
China.
  Participants came from over 20 countries to the convention, held for the
first time to discuss investment opportunities in Malaysia and to renew
old ties.
  Ting said between 20 and 40 per cent of the duties carried out by the
Fire Services Department had nothing to do with fighting fires. Fire-
fighters accepted the duties out of a sense of humanity, he said.
  On training for fire-fighters, Ting said the curriculum would be
revamped in line with the name change.
  "To my knowledge, however, their present training already encompasses
things other than fire fighting."
  Ting said a change in uniform for fire-fighters was also being
considered. He added: "We are looking at a design which is smarter and
more functional."
  Ting also appealed to the younger generation to join the department. He
said it was a risky job with very few takers.
  "There are also very few Chinese and Indians who want to join the
department as the economic boom has given rise to a lot of other job
opportunities."

Call for more biographies to be written on past leaders

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 2

KOTA KINABALU, Sun. - Chief Minister Datuk Yong Teck Lee said more books
should be written about past leaders so that their contribution to the
State and nation could be remembered.
  He said such books would particularly help the younger generation
appreciate the role played by these leaders in developing the State and
promoting unity.
  "The struggle of our past leaders ought to be remembered and appreciated
by the people," he said when launching an autobiography of Yang di-Pertua
Negeri Tun Sakaran Dandai at the Shangri-La's Tanjung Aru Resort
yesterday.
  Yong said books on other Yang di-Pertua Negeri such as Tun Datu Mustapha
Datu Harun, Tun Pengiran Ahmad Raffae, Tun Fuad Stephens and Tun Hamdan
Abdullah should also be written.
  The autobiography, compiled by former Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka director
Ismail Abbas and DBP staff Nadin Salleh and Japar Ungki, will be launched
on Monday to coincide with Sakaran's 66th birthday.

Spectacular dance contest

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 18

By Loo Kian Boon

AMATEUR and professional dancers of both the Latin and modern dance
disciplines came together to put up a spectacular dance gala when they
competed with one another for honours and glory at the second Malaysian
International Dancesport Grand Prix 1996 at the Mahkota Ballroom of Hotel
Istana Kuala Lumpur recently.
  The competition saw 74 pairs of dancers from seven different countries
in the Asia Pacific region competing in 10 categories.
  It was organised by the William and Luisa Danceworld, a dance school
opened by the husband and wife team of six-time Southeast Asia amateur
Latin champion and current Malaysian Professional Latin champion William
and Luisa Lor.
  The competitors, who came from Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Thailand and Indonesia, were split into the Latin and modern
sections which both included the novice, pre-amateur, senior, amateur
Closed and amateur Open categories.
  Sixteen adjudicators from the seven competing countries were invited as
judges during the finals.
  The adjudicators, who were either former or current ballroom dancing
champions, were led by 14-time Australian professional Latin champion
Anthony Gauci and Tania McGuinness.
  Before the competition commenced, guests as well as the contestants had
the opportunity to purchase from an array of ballroom dancing shoes for
both males and females outside the dining hall.
  The competition then began with the senior modern section in which eight
pairs took to the floor in their smart tail jackets and elegant ballroom
dresses.
  After six finals had been completed, the dance floor was cleared for the
arrival of the guests-of-honour Tunku Dara Naquiah Tuanku Ja'afar and her
husband Tunku Mudzaffar Tunku Mustapha.
  The competition was then formally declared open by chief organisers
William and Luisa Lor, followed by the parade of the contestants according
to their countries.
  In his welcoming speech, Lor thanked all the supporters and sponsors who
had contributed tremendously to the success of the dance competition.
  "It is hoped that by hosting this championship, we would be able to
further raise the level of ballroom dancers in Asia and particularly in
Malaysia," he said.
  "This championship will feature some of the top professional dancers
from the Asia Pacific region, who will highlight this event with their
special performances."
  Prizes were then presented to the winners of the first six finals by the
organising committee patron Datin May Lee Leong.
  Among the winners were John Lim and Joanne Leong in the senior modern
section, Sharizal Zainal and Lynette Ow in the novice modern section, and
Ng Le-On with his partner Cheah Su-Ann in the novice Latin section.
  Talking about the victory in the novice Latin category, Cheah expressed
her joy of winning her first dancing title.
  She then admitted about being a little confused when she was announced
as the winner along with her partner Ng.
  "This win was never expected especially when the competition from our
rivals was so strong. It was difficult for us to anticipate victory."
  The win was especially sweet for Cheah because she almost didn't make it
to the final when she sprained her ankle two weeks earlier.
  "Let's just say God answered my prayers," she added.
  Ng, who was also the amateur Latin champion at the Kuala Lumpur
international ballroom dancing championships last year with Andrea Quah,
gave full credit to his partner who struck up a good understanding with
him despite dancing together with her for only three months before the
competition.
  As the dinner commenced, the competition continued with the amateur
Latin Closed and amateur Latin Open finals.
  Unlike the modern dance finals, the Latin sections saw a much a younger
set of dancers.
  Dresses worn by the female partners are more vibrant and sexy.
  Even their male counterparts discarded the jackets and instead went for
plain long-sleeve shirts.
  The tempo of the music was also switched from the tango, cha-cha and the
waltz to the hippier tune of jive, samba, ramba (the dance of the bull
fighter) and the romantic love dance.
  In between competition, guests were also treated to some rare
demonstrations of Latin and modern dance by some of the established
dancers in the region.
  Incidentally, most of them have been invited as judges in the
championships and they sportingly obliged by taking the dance floor with
their partners to give competitors a tip or two.
  Among them were undefeated Indonesian professional modern champions and
grand finalists in all Southeast Asia professional championships Soenarko
Josodihardjo and Jenny Indrawati, 12-time Taiwanese modern champions and
professional modern and Latin champions John and Jennifer Shih, and seven-
time undefeated Southeast Asia professional ballroom champions Melvin and
Nancy Low.
  The highlight of the night was the amateur Latin Open and amateur modern
Open, which saw international participation.
  The star attraction was the sole Australian pair of Adam Reeve and
Rebecca Allen, who amazed the judges with lightning quick movements and
synchronised routines.
  There was no doubt they were the true champions when they were announced
as the winners of both the Open categories.

MAS wins bid to stage road race

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

MALAYSIA Airlines won the bid to host the World Airlines Road Race or Warr
97 in Kuala Lumpur next year.
  Although Malaysia Airlines has been participating since 1990, it was
only last year that it won the bid against five other airlines at the
Durban WARR.
  WARR is the largest and the most popular airline sporting event in terms
of participants.
  Hosting the event is a honour for Malaysia as it is the first time WARR
will be held in an Asian country since its inauguration in San Francisco
in 1982.
  It is anticipated that about 100 airlines with an estimated 4,000
participants will converge in Kuala Lumpur.
  However, Malaysia Airlines will be working hard to create history with
the highest number of participants, about 4,500.
  Last Saturday, a team of 15 Malaysia Airlines athletes left for Atlanta
for the WARR five and 10km races.

New committee to hold meeting

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

THE Petaling District FA, under a new management council, will hold its
first meeting on Thursday.
  The meeting will be held at association (PDFA) president Megat Firdouz
Megat Junid's office in Kelana Jaya.
  Megat Firdouz, who at 27 became the youngest PDFA president, will chair
the meeting which is expected to discuss matters pertaining to the
adminstration of the association.
  But one man who is seen as livewire of PDFA is council member K.
Mukunthan, better known as Dass, who was largely responsible for Megat
Firdouz being at helm at the last biennial annual meeting.
  Mukunthan, a former FA of Selangor (FAS) staff and Selangor team
caretaker, is the link between the association and Megat Firdouz.
  He will be mainly responsible for the daily running of the association
with secretary S. Selearajan, a Fifa referee, and assistant secretary M.
Namasivayam.
  The meeting will see the appointment of the various sub-committee
chairmen.
  Megat Firdouz is expected to head the finance committee. Either Megat
Firdouz or vice-president K. Rajendran will take care of youth development
and rules, vice-president P. Mohan (competitions), vice-president Habibul
Rahman Kadir Shah (disciplinary) and senior council member Ismail Yaacob
(referees board).
  The PDFA is RM30,000 in the red and Megat Firdouz, who is also a Majlis
Daerah Petaling councillor, will shoulder the daunting task of putting the
association in the black in the next two years.
  The competitions committee will have to look into the three-division
league which has been poorly organised by the previous committee.
  It has to complete the league and start the FA Cup, which will involve
all 38 teams competing in the Super, Div One and Two Leagues.
  Besides this, the committee will also have to look at ways to raise
prize money for FA Cup champion and runner-up.
  Winners in tha PDFA League and FA Cup have not got their prize money in
the past but with the new council earlier promising to change that, the
association will have to start off with the current FA Cup.
  There has not been much development programmes for youths either. Though
PDFA has a team playing in the FAS Div Three, the team is in a shambles.
  It is time PDFA officials form a management committee for the handling
of the PDFA soccer team and participation in the FAS League.

Police urged to act fast against petrol bombers

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 4

By R. Sittamparam

JOHOR BARU, Sun. - The Information Ministry has urged police to urgently
apprehend those responsible for hurling petrol bombs at the Royal Museum
and the State's RTM complex to avert repeat attacks.
  Its Deputy Minister Datuk Suleiman Mohamed said the incident should be
interpreted as an attack against the Goverment and that it was a very
serious matter.
  In the incident last Thursday, a youth on a motorcycle hurled two petrol
bombs at the Istana Besar, which houses the Royal Museum at Jalan Tun Dr
Ismail at 4.15pm.
  The youth, who was followed by two others in a car, proceeded to the RTM
complex and threw a petrol bomb at a guard house at the Jalan Tasek Utara
entrance about 45 minutes later. None of the petrol bombs exploded.
  The three then made their way to another guard house in Jalan Kolam Air
and smashed the glass panes of the guard house.
  It is believed that an RTM staff had received an obscene telephone call
during one of their live phone-in programmes on Friday, prompting RTM to
cancel all live telephone programmes.
  Speaking to reporters after officiating at the Malaysian Ex-Policemen's
Association's 24th annual delegates meeting in Skudai today, Suleiman
said:
  "The culprits should be nabbed as soon as possible as there is always
the fear that they will repeat the attacks.
  "The Ministry has received an initial report on the incident and we are
liaising closely with the police to keep in touch with the progress in
investigations."
  Suleiman dismissed the idea that the attack was linked to RTM's pro-
Government stand and selective programming.
  "Those who are dissatisfied with RTM programmes or its allegiance to the
Government can use the proper channels such as writing in with their
views.
  "RTM is not purely a profit making organisation, rather it also has a
social responsibility to fulfil, hence it cannot function like other
private stations."
  Meanwhile, district police chief S. Divakaran said police were
intensifying the investigation into the arson attack and were considering
several possible motives.
  Asked about grafitti on RTM's signboard at the junction of Jalan Kolam
Air and Jalan Tasek Utara, he said it was probably not related to the
incident.
  The word "Ria" was spray painted on the signboard. Ria is believed to
refer to the Radio Corporation of Singapore's Malay station "Ria 89.7".
  "We have not managed to uncover any clues so far but we hope to get some
leads from the findings of the Chemistry Department.
  "The department is presently analysing the fragments of the petrol bomb
and its components."
  Meanwhile, the Johor Security Working Committee conducted a thorough
investigation of Thursday's incident at the RTM complex today.
  RTM southern region broadcasting director Norzihan Mohd Salleh said the
probe was to ensure the premises would not be subject to a similar attack.

Three JB council officers told to explain

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 4

JOHOR BARU, Sun. - Three Johor Baru City Council senior officers have been
given show-cause letters pertaining to the council's delay in settling a
debt with a production company.
  Datuk Bandar Datuk Hashim Yahaya said the three had been asked to
explain why action should not be taken against them for the delay of
payment, resulting in the sealing of the council's office on Sept 3.
  Speaking to reporters after closing a property exposition here, he said
the officers were from its legal, administrative and treasury departments.
  On Sept 3, Jojos Production Sdn Bhd obtained a court order to seal the
council's office following the council's failure to settle a debt of
RM100,000.
  The amount was part of the RM200,000 payment due for services rendered
by Jojos Production for an entertainment show organised by the council at
the Dataran Bandaraya here on Jan 3, 1994.
  "Show-cause letters were given to the officers concerned on Sept 12.
They have one week to reply.
  "The disciplinary board will then decide what form of action to be taken
against them," he said.

Rakan Muda `promotes a healthy lifestyle'

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 4

KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Youths in the country should be involved in
activities like Rakan Muda as it promotes a balanced and healthy
lifestyle, 4B Kampung Selayang Lama branch chief Mohamad Ali Mohamad Odin
said today.
  He said youths were the future of the country since they would determine
the direction of the country's development.
  "The Rakan Muda programme launched today is aimed at ensuring that
youths do not fall prey to social ills.
  "They must realise that they are the country's treasure and that they
have roles and responsibilities," he said.
  Mohamad Ali was speaking at the opening of the Kepong Parliamentary
division's Rakan Muda Day by Youth and Sport Ministry's Parliamentary
Secretary Shahrizat Abdul Jalil at Sekolah Menengah Raja Abdullah.
  He also urged government agencies and the private sector to co-operate
with Youth and Sports Department in the various Rakan Muda programmes that
would be organised.
  He said this would help to prevent youths from being involved in
negative activities such as drug abuse and playing truant.
  Mohamad Ali said the Youth and Sports Department had identified a few
shopping complexes where Rakan Muda programmes would be carried out.
  Shahrizat, who was also the patron for today's function, expressed her
hope that the Kampung Selayang Lama community would take the opportunity
to ensure closer rapport among themselves.
  She said the programme was not only meant to prevent youths from being
involved in negative activities but also for the families to get
acquainted.
  Earlier, Shahrizat joined several residents in a 20-minutes aerobics
workout which was part of today's Rakan Muda activities.

Getting students to study nature at park

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

SHAH ALAM, Sun. - A joint educational programme between the Malaysian
Agriculture Park and schools should be established to help students learn
to appreciate nature, Agriculture Minister Datuk Amar Dr Sulaiman Daud
said today.
  He said such programmes would be beneficial to students at all levels as
the park was not confined to the study of agriculture.
  "There are a number of other fields that can be explored, ranging from
ecology, topography, biology and agronomy," he said at a gotong-royong at
the park organised by Esso Production Malaysia Inc employees.
  He added these programmes could also be extended to institutes of higher
learning for research and development purposes.
  Sulaiman said this would not only make the park more popular but was
also in line with the Government's efforts to instil environmental-
consciousness at all levels of society.
  Situated at Bukit Cahaya Seri Alam, the 1,258ha park is the world's
first Agro-Forestry park.
  As part of the gotong-royong project, about 70 Esso employees and the
park's workers helped replace broken planks along the jungle pathways and
clean up the surrounding areas.
  Esso also donated five safety convex mirrors for placement at strategic
points to warn road-users of on-coming traffic and 10 cement-ferrous
permanent garbage bins.
  In his speech, Esso Exploration Manager David H. Lehman said the project
was part of their community support programme with safety as this year's
theme.
  He hoped Esso's contribution would help make the park safer for
visitors.

Pahang to woo more tourists

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

PETALING JAYA, Sun. - The Pahang Government will implement a "development
strategy" for several potential tourist destinations which are situated
along the proposed East-West expressway, Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohamad
Khalil Yaacob said today.
  "There are three main corridors which can be further developed and
provided with infrastructure and other facilities, to attract more
tourists to the State.
  "They are situated in the centre of the proposed East-West expressway
which will soon link Kuala Lumpur to Kuala Terengganu via Kuantan in
Pahang," he said in his speech, read by the State's cultural and tourism
committee chairman Datuk Law Kee Long, at the launch of Pahang Arts and
Cultural Festival here.
  The three corridors are:
  * Highlands Corridor which comprises Cameron Highlands, Bukit Fraser and
Genting Highlands;
  * Middle Corridor which includes eco-tourism and agro-tourism
destinations like Taman Negara, Endau-Rompin, limestone caves, lakes and
other natural attractions;
  * Coastal Corridor which covers the entire 208 kilometre stretch from
Cheating to Rompin; plus
  * Railway Corridor which includes its stopovers at Mentakab and Kuala
Lipis towns.
  Khalil said the first three corridors would be developed along the road
networks while development activities for the fourth corridor would be
conducted along the tracks between the railway stations.
  "This Three-plus-One Tourism Corridor package will enable the State
government to increase its number of tourist destinations.
  "It will also provide socio-economic opportunities for the local
residents especially in the services and tourism-related sectors," he
said.
  Besides its legendary attractions, Khalil said the State also retained
such natural resources like its mountainous terrains, tropical
rainforests, flora and fauna, 208 kilometre-long coastline and tropical
islands, as its other tourist attractions.
  "Pahang is popularly known as Peninsular Malaysia's State of
superlatives. It can offer you a cultural experience and a chance to
explore the State's natural wonders and marine life.
  "With over 60 per cent of the State still covered with forests, Pahang
is proud to be in the forefront of making Malaysia greener," he said.
  Khalil said the State government was also in the process of gazetting
the Endau-Rompin forest reserve as a State Park, as another addition to
the State's list of tourist destinations.

Knockout tournament set to kick off Sunday

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

THE 5th Milo Unity Cup Under-18 soccer knockout competition at Jalan Timur
ground, Petaling Jaya on Sunday is expected to draw a good response.
  Organising chairman Mohamed Ariffin Hamzah said they were happy with the
response for the competition so far.
  "The response for the competition is good and we hope the teams will
show up early for the competition."
  Mohamed Ariffin said more than 30 teams have made preliminary enquiries
and are expected to participate in the one-day competition.
  "The last four competitions have been successful and we will leave
nothing to chance in our effort to make this year's competition better
than the previous years'."
  The annual series offers RM300 to the champion, RM150 to the runnerup
and RM100 to third and fourth finishers.
  The best players in goalkeeping, defending, midfield, topscorer and man-
of-the-match in the final will receive special awards.
  Besides, there will also be tins of Milo, Milo T-shirts and free drinks
for the top four teams, all sponsored by Nestle.
  Mohamed Ariffin said they were thankful to Milo for giving its full
support in promoting the game among youths in the Klang Valley.
  "The youngsters have not much action as there is no league competition
for their age-group. Thus, this kind of competition will be much welcomed
by the youngsters and parents."
  Mohamed Ariffin said that the FA of Selangor (FAS) could also use the
competition to shortlist players for youth programmes.
  Besides, Kelab Sukan Sri Indah is also identifying players to start its
own youth development programme together with Majlis Perbandaran Petaling
Jaya (MPPJ).
  The entrance fees for a team is RM50. For details call Rosnani Wahid at
03-2226960 or Sree at 018-8203185.

Team's dismal performance

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 21

THE national women's participation in the Kuala Lumpur Hockey Association
Div Three League is drawing a big blank.
  After three outings, they are right at the bottom of the standings with
no points, having lost all three matches.
  Despite the disastrous performance, the team is also taking a break from
the league for training stints and test matches overseas.
  In the previous three matches, it lost 3-2 to Royal Selangor Club, 3-1
to Bangsar Residents and 6-2 to Stamford College.
  And now, it has been reported the national squad will leave for Germany
on Sept 26 for training and test matches.
  A KLHA official said the performance and calibre of the national squad
was in question.
  "If the players cannot put up a decent performance against the Div Three
opponents, I don't see how they can be prepared to play test matches
overseas," said the official.

RM100m request to buy `naltrexone'

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

KUANTAN, Sun. - The Health Ministry is seeking more than RM100 million
from the Federal Government so that it could implement the use of
addiction control pill "naltrexone" at the country's 28 dadah
rehabilitation centres.
  There are now 17,934 addicts being treated at the centres.
  Deputy Health Minister Datuk Dr Siti Zaharah Sulaiman said today:
"Curbing this social problem will top the ministry's main agenda until the
year 2000. We have to seek this allocation to reduce the number of
addicts."
  Siti Zaharah added that the allocation would be used in part to buy the
tablets. The rest would be for management expenses, she said after closing
the Paya Besar Innovative Day at a multi-purpose hall.
  From January to May, there were 1,022 cases of new addicts below the age
of 19. To date, 15,000 addicts had been tested positive for HIV and 40 per
cent of prisoners were found to be dadah abusers.
  The Government had to spend some RM517 million last year to curb the
abuse of dadah among youths and finance dadah rehabilitation programmes.
  Naltrexone is a narcotic antagonist, keeping heroin or other opiate
addicts off dadah. It works by blocking the opiate receptor sites on the
cell membranes, where the dadah takes effect. If a person on naltrexone
later takes in an opiate, it will have no addictive effect.
  Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said recently that the ministry had
conducted a one-year study on the use of the medicine on 176 addicts.
  The study, run by the Kuala Lumpur Hospital and Universiti Sains
Malaysia in Penang, showed encouraging results.
  Among others, addicts were able to stop their habit after a year of
treatment, he said.

Driving licence: Minimum age stays

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

LUMUT, Sun. - The Government has no immediate plans to raise the minimum
age of Malaysians to apply for driving licences as it is not an effective
solution to reduce road accidents, Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ling
Liong Sik said.
  Raising the age limit will only pose problems for working youths.
  "Some youths enter the job market when they are only 16 and it will be
unfair to them if we raise the age limit," Dr Ling said.
  The present minimum age to hold motorcycle licences is 16, 17 for cars
and 21 for heavy vehicles.
  He said an amendment to the Road Transport Act approved by Parliament
last month made it compulsory for all new drivers to undergo a probation
period.

Ling: Spend quality time with the family

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

By Vijayan Menon

RAWANG, Sun. - MCA president Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik today urged
party members to spend "quality time" with their families.
  Dr Ling, who is Transport Minister, said the family was the basic unit
of the nation and called on MCA leaders to spend more time with their
families despite their demanding schedules.
  "When people are involved in demanding careers and have to work long
hours, they should endeavour to spend quality time with their families."
  He said it was not the quantity but the quality of time that people
spent with their families that mattered.
  "Don't just spend time sleeping while with the family but engage in
wholesome discussions, sharing experiences and relating to one another,"
he said when opening the MCA national-level Family Day Carnival at Sekolah
Rendah Kebangsaan Sinaran Budi, Kuala Garing.
  The family day was organised by the party's Selayang division.
  He quoted a Chinese proverb "If the family is united even 10,000
problems can be solved," to illustrate the importance of nurturing strong
family ties.
  Dr Ling said the family was not only the basic unit of the nation but
also the fundamental unit of society and "it is also the fundamental unit
of the MCA".
  Later when asked how family units could be strengthened especially when
there were more cases of single parents and career-minded people delaying
marriages, he said this was not serious.
  "It involves only a tiny proportion of society. In general, people are
dating young and marrying early. I think only about five per cent of the
population are marrying late or do not believe in the institution."

     16 Sep 1996, page 21

SELANGOR edged Singapore 2-1 in a veterans' friendly soccer match at
Yayasan FAS ground in Kelana Jaya recently.
  Selangor was represented by FAS officials and former State players while
Singapore was led by the Majid Arif XI team.
  The visitors' line-up included former Singapore players Syed Ahmad,
Majid Arif, S. Rajagopal, Hasli Ibrahim, Nasir Jalil, Razali Alias and
former Malaysian internationals Ali Bakar and Zulkifli Norbit.
  Selangor was led by FAS president Datuk Mohd Aini Taib, deputy president
Tengku Ahmad Shah, vice-president Hamdan Abdul Rahman and council members.
  Former Selangor players include M. Chandran, Syed Harun Syed Jaafar,
Mohd Shah Norbit, Rashid Hassan, Reduan Abdullah and K. Rajagopal.
  FAS secretary Kudus Abdul Karim, 60, was the oldest player on the pitch
when he played in the second half as a leftback.
  Selangor went ahead in the 12th minute through Mohamed Ariffin Hamzah's
header while Harun Abdul Rahman's half-volley gave them a 2-0 halftime
lead.
  Midfielder Baharuddin Manan reduced the deficit for the Majid Arif side
when his grounder from just inside the box beat Rashid.
  Aini gave away prizes to both sides. The prizes and dinner were
sponsored by Mohd Ariffin Hamzah.

`Study wage disparity between expatriates and Malaysians'

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 6

RAWANG, Sun. - The Finance Ministry and the International Trade and
Industry Ministry should study the huge disparity in the wages earned by
expatriate profesionals and managers and Malaysians doing the same jobs,
Human Resources Minister Datuk Lim Ah Lek said today.
  Lim said some of the jobs currently done by expatriates could be handled
by Malaysians who he said were equally efficient.
  He said Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had once
expressed concern over the disparity in the wages paid to expatriates and
Malaysians.
  "On my part I feel there are certain jobs currently held by expatriates
which can be handled by Malaysians. I personally know cases where jobs
held by expatriates can easily be filled by Malaysians.
  "Locals are equally efficient and capable," he told reporters at the MCA
Family Day Carnival.

TO raise funds for its various ongoing community service projects, the Sri
Lanka Buddhist Temple in Sentul Pasar, Kuala Lumpur held a food fair at
the temple premises recently.
  As there was a sea of visitors, there was brisk business for all the 40
stalls set up by temple devotees and well-wishers.
  The fair, which was earlier launched by Bukit Bintang Member for
Parliament Dr Lee Chong Meng with a donation RM1,000, is expected to raise
about RM50,000 for projects like the Siri Jayanti free clinic, tuition for
poor children, annual food distribution to the poor, and visits to wards
and welfare centres with gifts.
  Lim Cheng Ean, president of the Siri Jayanti Welfare Organisation, said
the temple would use some of the money from the food fair to buy a kidney
dialysis machine and donate it to an institution.

Certain KL roads to have gazetted bus lanes

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 23

KUALA Lumpur City Hall is in the process of gazetting a few roads in the
city to have special lanes for buses.
  City Hall Urban Transport Department director Mahfix Omar said the
Federal Government had given its approval to the suggestion but City Hall
had yet to make the relevant changes to the infrastructure on the proposed
roads.
  The allocation of bus lanes will affect the current location of bus
stops, taxi stands, road signs and available space for road dividers.
  He said this after the 27th City Hall Directorate Day celebration at
Taman Tasik Titiwangsa on Saturday.
  As a trial, Mahfix said three roads would be gazetted to have bus lanes.
They are Jalan Raja Laut, Jalan Tun Razak and Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman.
  He said under the bus lane concept to be introduced, buses are not
allowed to go out of the designated lanes.
  "This is different from the concept used in other countries which allow
buses to go out of their lanes but not allowing other vehicles to go into
the bus lanes," he said.
  He said the concept was aimed at giving priority to buses to move faster
and also to discipline bus drivers.
  "The designated bus lanes are for the convenience of the buses to move
and also to discipline bus drivers from switching lanes or weaving in and
out of traffic as they like," he said.
  To avoid congestion in the designated bus lane, Mahfix said City Hall
planned to allocate one-and-a-half lanes for the buses.
  "It should be sufficient for the buses to overtake the buses that stop
to pick up or drop passengers."
  Mahfix said City Hall has received support from bus companies operating
in the city about the plan.
  Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Sharif was reported as saying the
public would be invited to comment on the bus lane proposal.
  The proposal for designated bus lanes in the city was proposed for the
first time in 1980 but was later scraped as the authorities found it
difficult to implement the system.
  There was a move by City Hall to revive the 1980 plan in 1994 but the
result has yet to be seen.

Low cost homes for villagers

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 23

THE Selangor Government, together with Bank Negara, will construct low
cost houses at Kampung Damansara Dalam in Petaling Jaya under the Projek
Perumahan Rakyat Termiskin scheme.
  State Executive Councillor Datuk Mohd Aini Taib said PPRT, a subsidiary
of Bank Negara, would acquire the land soon.
  He said the project would take off after minor details had been
finalised.
  "We are in the midst of finalising the terms and agreement of the joint
project. It is not easy as it involves villagers, the landowner and State
Government as well as PPRT," Mohd Aini said after launching the Petaling
Jaya Municipal Council's Bersih dan Indah campaign at the village
yesterday.
  He said the 10ha site housed more than 1,100 families, of whom a small
number were squatters.
  On the gotong-royong exercise, Mohd Aini said residents in the State
needed to play their part in ensuring their neighbourhood was clean and
beautiful.
  "Residents should work together to make gotong-royong a success. We want
to be aggressive in our effort to clean up areas, especially those which
are infested with illegal dumps."
  Mohd Aini said to further improve the rubbish collection system in
Petaling Jaya, it would have lorries collecting domestic waste and garden
refuse such as cut trees, twigs and plants.
  He said the council would provide the service which was chargable on a
fortnightly basis for residents.
  On the illegal video arcades, he said shopping complexes would also be
affected by the new ruling.
  "Our piority at the moment is to close down all illegal video arcades in
the State and concentrate on the legal arcades."
  He said the Government expected to shut down illegal arcades in the
State by the end of this month.

THE Petaling Jaya Municipal Council confiscated more than 30 video game
machines from an illegal video arcade in Section 5, Petaling Jaya.
  The operation was the first to be held by the council after the Selangor
Government gazetted the Entertainment Enactment 1995 on Sept 1.
  The joint operation between the Petaling Jaya police department and the
council's enforcement unit hit a snag after three of the nine illegal
video centres visited were closed at 11am on Saturday.
  Initially, it was presumed that the operators adhered to the one-week
notice which ended on Friday to wind up their business but it was
confirmed later that many of the centres opened later in the evening.
  However, there was a two-hour delay during which undercover officers
from the council's enforcement unit monitored the activities of the areas
where there were illegal video games operators.
  The operation, led by MPPJ health department director Dr Abdul Rahim
Ahmad, caught the owner of a centre at Jalan 5/59 at Section 5 by
surprise.
  The 30 video game machines were then loaded into the waiting MPPJ
enforcement truck.
  Abdul Rahim said the operator, Rapi Permai Sdn Bhd had, applied for a
licence last August but the council rejected his application.
  "We will call the owner to our headquarters for further discussion and
let our legal department take over for further action," he said.
  Abdul Rahim said the operator who owned another licensed outlet in
Subang Permai, USJ, will be charged under the newly gazeted by-law which
provided for unlicensed video operators to be fined up to RM20,000 or
jailed for a maximum of five years or both.
  The operator will be the first video arcade owner in Petaling Jaya to be
charged under the enactment.
  The by-law covers all forms of entertainment including plays,
demonstrations and public performances.
  Licensed video arcades found to be operating illegal gambling machines
in their premises or failing to comply with regulations can be fined up tp
RM10,000 or jailed a maximum of three years or both.
  The council has given five illegal video operators in Petaling Jaya
Selatan 1, 2, 10 and 11, two in SS2 and one in Section 5 a week's grace to
cease operations.
  The notice expired last Friday.
  Abdul Rahim, who was assisted by the deputy superintendent of health
Ahmad Jaffar, is also temporarily heading the newly set up Entertainment
Licensing Unit.
  Health inspector Ong Poo Soong, public relations officer Norhayati
Sulaiman and her assistant Norshalizawati Baharudin were also present.
  The operation will continue for two months or until all illegal video
arcades are shut down.
  Confisticated items will be placed in storage at Kelana Jaya.
  Enforcement will be carried out phase by phase at legal and illegal
video and karaoke outlets in the township.
  Enforcement officers will be visiting karaoke centres for regular
inspections to see that the new rules are being adhered to.
  Under the new regulations, guest relations officers are banned from
working in the centres while tinted glasses will have to be removed.
  The council plans to call karaoke and pub operators for a meeting soon
to brief them on the new rules.
  With the gazetting of the by-law, MPPJ has taken over the licensing of
entertainment centres such as karaoke centres, pubs and discotheques from
the district office from Sept 1.

Fines reflect indifference to City Hall regulations

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 23

By Rosnazura Idrus

THE huge number of fines and compounds issued by City Hall for various
offences for the first half of this year show that the public is still
indifferent towards the rules and regulations set by the authority, Kuala
Lumpur Datuk Bandar Tan Sri Kamaruzzaman Sharif said.
  Referring to the increase in the total of notices issued and collection
of compounds from January to July 1995 and 1996, he said awareness of the
rules and regulations among city dwellers was still low.
  The increase in the collection of compound was not a good sign though it
meant an increase in City Hall's revenue.
  "Our intention is not to collect as much money as we can but more
importantly, for the public to be aware of the rules and regulations and
abide by them," he said.
  From January to July this year, City Hall collected about RM6 million
from a total of 228,042 notices issued compared to RM5.6 million from
251,346 notices issued last year.
  Kamaruzzaman was speaking to reporters after the 27th City Hall
Directorate Day celebration at Taman Tasik Titiwangsa on Saturday.
  According to the statistics, compounds issued under the Road Transport
Ordinance (Metered Car Parks) Federal Territory 1984 recorded the highest
increase compared to last year.
  For the same period last year, City Hall collected about RM2.32 million
compared to RM2.79 million this year.
  The offences under this ordinance include indiscriminate parking,
parking outside the gazetted areas and causing road obstruction.
  "The figure shows the public's attitude of flouting the law," he
remarked.
  The second highest in collection this year was from offences under the
Street, Drainage and Building 1974 - RM1.26 million.
  But this showed a decrease from last year's RM1.58 million.
  The Earthworks by-law 1988 which was enforced in April this year
recorded a total of RM229,730 in collection for 1,479 compounds issued.
  Offences committed under this by-law cover dirtying of roads by lorries
carrying earth from construction site, carrying uncovered earth on lorries
and overloading.
  Kamaruzzaman said to date the Enforcement Directorate only has 1,200
enforcement officers.
  "We are still short of 400 enforcement officers and we plan to recruit
more.
  "But even with this number, we are still able to be effective in our
enforcement," he said.
  During the celebration last Saturday, a total of 82 officers were
awarded medals and certificates for various recommendations.
  The highest medals Pingat Khidmat Terpilih-Kelas 1 were given to two of
the horse unit advisers, Datuk A. Rahim Omar and Dr Bashir Fateh Mohamed.

Silently Yours reigns again

from NEW STRAITS TIMES, The News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     16 Sep 1996, page 43

By Go-Ram

SILENTLY Yours proved beyond doubt that she is the champion among the
mares and fillies in the Malayan Racing Association circuit when she gave
a repeat performance to score a back-to-back victory in the S$150,000 NSF
Breeders' Vase over 1200m (Race 5) at Bukit Timah yesterday.
  Partnered by Saimee Jumaat, the five-year-old New Zealand-bred by Clay
Hero jumped smartly and positioned herself in third spot early behind
Golden Eagle II and My Sweet Partner.
  Once the field swung for home, Silently Yours quickly headed off Golden
Eagle and pulled away from her rivals to win by 5 1/2 lengths from Fancy
Lady (Chavez). Third was Princess Fury (Lisa) third with Andy's Polly
(Yin) fourth.
  Prepared by Donald Baertschiger for Silent Stable, she returned S$12 and
S$5 (RM14 and RM6) for her fourth success.
  Yesterday's event was the seventh occasion that Perkhidmatan Usaha Tegas
Sendirian Berhad sponsored a race at Bukit Timah.
  PUT is a Malaysian-based company with a successful track record in
providing telecommunications and broadcasting services.
  Imperial Gold II, the likely favourite for the S$650,000 Singapore Gold
Cup on Sunday, gave a stunning performance to win his warm-up race for
Class 1 sprinters over 1200m in Race 9.
  Ridden by Oscar Chavez, the four-year-old French-bred by Funambule last
early made his move at the turn for home where he swept past his rivals to
win by a head.
  Imperial Gold, trained by Mohamed Yusof, paid S$73 and S$16 (RM70 and
RM22).
  The day's races started with a shock when Caro Lad upset all
calculations to clinch the Class 3, Div 2 event over 1600m.
  Prepared by Mohamed Ismail and ridden by Azhar Ismail, Caro Lad paid
thumping dividends of S$467 and S$67 (RM280 and RM45).
  Apprentices Lee Soo Hin and Brethem Tai were involved in a fall in Race
8 yesterday.
  Lee escape injuries while Tai has been sent to hospital for X-rays and
observation.
  The going was good for the first two races, changed to yielding for Race
3 and soft for the remaining seven races.
