PAPER CONTINUES TO PROLIFERATE
Users Disseminate, Then Print--Increasing Paper Use 

     Imaging is failing to produce the promised paperless office,
experts tell us.  Indeed, expanded use of information technologies,
such as imaging, combined with people's historic reliance on paper are
producing new mountains of documents to file.  "The misapplication of
imaging technology has fueled the use of paper," says Kerry Stackpole,
president of The Association for Work Process Improvement (TAWPI) of
Boston, Mass.  
     Information is easier to access electronically than ever before,
which makes it an easy target to print out constantly.  For instance,
by the year 2004, the pile of information available at the desktop
will come first in electronic form, compared to a 90 percent paper-
domination today, predicts Keith Davidson, executive director for
Xplor International, a Torrance, Calif.-based imaging educational
group.    
     There even is a laser printer paper shortage, according to
Davidson.  He predicts paper use will continue to grow at a rate of 10
percent annually.   
     Why does paper continue to proliferate, and what can you do about
it?  Electronic dissemination has confused users about how to best use
an imaging system.  The screens available on today's personal computer
(PC) monitors still make it hard to read a document.  Paper continues
to possess a very strong historical significance--both human and
legal.  Vendors suggest the following solutions:
     * View documents on screen only;
     * Print-on-demand;
     * Restrict paper use;
     * Use flat panel monitors; and
     * Employ in-bound faxes.

Electronic Dissemination Proliferates Paper

     Imaging systems were designed to reduce or eliminate paper use
across the enterprise--often by integrating images with an electronic
data interchange (EDI) system.  Documents were supposed to become a
digital representation of the paper version and move across the
enterprise easily, electronically.
     However, instead of using these systems to reduce the amount of
paper in the organization, users are continuing to print documents--
just at another stage in the process.  Where an imaging system could
provide essential workflow of images, users instead refuse to employ
this functionality of an imaging system, or use it "incorrectly," says
Stackpole.  
     The Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) also have made it much
easier to obtain information from universities, laboratories and
corporations around the world.
     "The new accessibility of documents, searching methods and
[electronic] filing systems are more efficient," says A.J. Rogers,
vice president of marketing for Wilsonville, Ore.-based Tektroniks, a
color printer manufacturer.   The point in the process where the
document becomes paper has shifted, says Richard Norton, analyst for
Norwell, Mass.-based BIS Strategic Decisions.  For example, instead of
printing the information and distributing it to real estate field
offices, the main office now is sending client information through E-
mail. However, when it arrives at the remote site, agents often print
out copies for themselves, the client and the office's files rather
than rely on the electronic imaging system to manage the document for
them.     
     "Rather than print at the source and distribute through mail or
fax, now information is disseminated digitally and printed at remote
locations," says Susan Hayes, manager of U.S. printer research, with
International Data Corp., a computer research firm in Framingham,
Mass.

Still Not Easy To View Images

    Another reason paper continues to proliferate is the poor quality
of computer screens.  
     While there are a few high-end monitors with very clear screens
available from vendors like San Jose, Calif.-based Cornerstone and
Ricoh Corp., also of San Jose, for the most part, it still is
difficult to read an image directly from a PC screen.  
     "[Screens] are still not the best way to view a document," says
Norton.  He said that most high-end computer monitors are expensive
and that their deployment in the enterprise tends to be low among
budget priorities.
    Wayne Buchar, platform business team manager for scanners with El
Segundo, Calif.-based Xerox, has been involved in the printing
business for 20 years.  He thinks paper use can be reduced, but that
it will take a much better, portable screen, easily visible in
sunlight to make it happen.  
    Xerox believes enough in the advancement of just such a screen
that its Palo Alto Research Center has been developing a prototype
computer screen based on flat panel technology.  This screen would
replace the typical glass screen monitor, says Buchar.  The new
display technology will have a 6.3-million pixel display, comparable
to a 600 dots-per-inch laser printed page, says Lois Wong, spokeswoman
for Xerox.  

Paper's History Makes it Popular

     There remains quite an historical attachment to paper, in part
for its tactile nature and its continuing utility to the U.S. legal
system, say the experts.  
    In fact, it is the older generation that often is unwilling to
adapt to an electronic imaging environment.  "It depends on the age of
the person whether [that person] will work on the document on the
screen or print it out," says Hayes.  "The need to have it in writing
is the law of the land," added Davidson. But, "imaging use is growing
within the courts," says Lynn Walker, analyst for the National Center
for State Courts, in Williamsburg, Va.  A few states have begun
allowing digital images in the courtroom, such as California and
Texas. 
    In fact, images are being used instead of paper in the courtroom
when tracking such information as witness lists and depositions, she
says.

Reducing Paper Still is Possible

    The worldwide installed printer base in 1995 equaled $22.7
billion, for a total of slightly less than 33 million printers,
including laser, ink jet and impact printers--such as dot matrix and
line character printers, says Hayes.  Laser printers made up $12.5
billion of that total, with ink jet printer sales $6.25 billion in
1995.  
    Davidson predicts that business executives may even restrict the
use of printing, including the number of interoffice mail messages.  
    Routine documents will shrink over the next 10 years as companies
begin to parallel the government's push to reduce paper use across
federal agencies, he adds.
    "We will continue to see fewer and fewer routine documents [on
paper], including interoffice memos," he said.  Davidson predicts the
last interoffice memo will say something like--"no more interoffice
memos."
    In the future, managers may restrict access to documents on local
area networks (LAN) unless they are viewed electronically.  
    "I wouldn't be surprised if people don't run reports that [the
user] can't print until after [the document] has been looked at,"
Davidson says.  
    In addition, print-on-demand is helping to reduce paper
consumption by encouraging users to print only what they need.  
    Also, in-bound fax has become more popular, with such companies
as San Diego-based Mitek Systems Inc. providing software that routes
in-bound faxes directly to the LAN.  
    "This may not do much to keep the paper off the [sender's] desk,
but it will help the [recipient]," says Stackpole. (Richard Norton,

Ways To Reduce Paper In An Imaging Enterprise

*  Determine ways components of your business can be reduced or
       eliminated.
*  Examine process relative to customers' needs--whether or not
       they are comfortable with or without paper.
*  Don't produce paper in the first place--view documents
       electronically.
*  Use modest solutions--they are available.
*  Look to long term success of imaging, not just short term.

WIRELESS MARKET EXPANDS ACCESS FOR E-MAIL USERS

    Companies moved closer to 100-percent wireless coverage for their
mobile E-mail users with the release recently of new services from San
Mateo, Calif.-based RadioMail Corp. and strategic announcements by
ARDIS and RAM Mobile Data.
    RadioMail is offering mobile E-mail users wireless access to
their "home" systems and the Internet.  The company's RadioMail
Message Center Services is being offered over ARDIS, RAM Mobile Data
and cellular digital packet data (CDPD) networks.  The company also
introduced RadioMail Remote Control, which adds dial-up access,
cellular access and message management to the Message Center Services.
    Woodbridge, N.J.-based RAM is teaming with Megahertz Corp., the
Mobile Communications Division of U.S. Robotics, to make available a
new wireless, Type II PC Card.  The AllPoints Wireless PC Card is
designed to operate on RAM's Mobitex-based wireless data
communications service.
    Meanwhile, ARDIS, of Lincolnshire, Ill., is providing wireless
data communications for Apple Computer Inc.'s MessagePad 120 using the
Newton 2.0 operating system.

Cellular and Paging

    Cellular carriers can contract with RadioMail's Message Center
Services to add two-way wireless messaging services to their current
cellular and paging operations.  The two-way messaging services are
compatible with circuit-switched cellular and cellular digital packet
data (CDPD) networks.  The services support numerous applications,
including Internet-compatible E-mail, faxing, pager notification of
new messages and many message management choices to control wireless
communications costs and delivery.
     Mark Elderkin, director of marketing for RadioMail, said that the
company is using "products that people are familiar with already, such
as cellular phones and pagers." 
    RadioMail also introduced RadioMail Remote Control, which adds
dial-up access, cellular access and message management to the
RadioMail wireless messaging services offered over numerous networks,
including ARDIS and RAM.

Personal RadioMailBox

    Remote Control provides individuals with a personal RadioMailBox
and a mobile Internet address that can be linked to their pagers or
through their cellular phones or wireless modems, to their portable
computers.  Users can exchange wireless messages with anybody who has
an Internet E-mail mailbox and send faxes, send messages to pagers,
and monitor news reports and customized stock portfolios, said
Elderkin.
    The Remote Control service has a base price of $9.95 per month,
with connect time charges of 20 cents per minute.
    With E-mail, the company's "thrust will be increasing the amount
of control users have on messages," he said.  Remote allows users to
store and forward certain large messages into their home mailboxes to
be read at another time, Elderkin said, saving air time.
    ARDIS also announced new Mobile Office rate structures last month
for E-mail applications for mobile professionals that start today at
$19.95 per month.  Applications supported in the Mobile Office program
are messaging and E-mail solutions for local area networks, including
ARDIS PersonalMessaging and AirMobile Wireless for Lotus cc:Mail from
Motorola Inc. and Mail-on-the-Run from Greenwich, Conn.-based River
Run Software Group.
    Dan Croft, senior vice president of marketing operations at
ARDIS, said that the combination of hardware, software and air-time
pricing will benefit individuals who want to take advantage of ARDIS
to "access their E-mail and to send and receive messages on their
laptops and wireless communications from virtually any location."
    Apple MessagePad users also can use the ARDIS network to send
wirelessly and receive electronic mail, send faxes and access
applications and information, enabling mobile computing. 
    Newton personal digital assistants, developed by Apple and
Motorola, now may be equipped with ARDIS communications software for
the Newton 2.0 operating system.  Used with Motorola's Personal
Messenger 100D PCMCIA wireless modem card, the ARDIS network provides
MessagePad users nationwide with automatic roaming, enabling them to
manage business from remote locations.
    Software developers creating wireless applications for the
MessagePad can take advantage of ARDIS' Wireless Software Developer
Program.    

RAM Focus

    RAM is focusing its resources on five areas:  field service,
sales, transportation and financial and utility markets.  RAM
currently offers 92 percent service coverage in U.S. cities and is
planning to raise its coverage soon to 100 percent through these five
areas.
    RAM's and Megahertz's AllPoints Wireless PC Card combines the
Type II format with RAM's Mobitex-based service.  
    The PC Card contains a two-watt, built-in radio, giving users
nationwide wireless coverage.
    Janet Boudris, senior vice president of strategic marketing for
RAM Mobile Data, said that the card "will have particular appeal for
sales and field management organizations that are already experiencing
the business benefits of using laptop and palmtop computers to conduct
business." 
    Boudris said that these organizations are "already a step ahead
of their competition.  Moving into the wireless environment is the
next logical step for visionary companies who desire a competitive
edge."
    The AllPoints Wireless PC Card "leverages the strength of RAM
service, delivers superior coverage and battery life and utilizes the
versatility of the Type II Format, said Steve Smith, senior vice
president of marketing for Megahertz.  The "card delivers on all these
goals, giving users a practical solution component they can use
immediately."
    The Type II PC Card is about the size of credit card and slides
into the side of the PC.  Its size--old modems were the size of a
brick--and the fact that it's Mobitex protocol, make the card
advantageous for mobile users, said a spokesman for RAM.  "The size is
a killer," he said.
    The battery saver protocol shuts down the modem automatically
when there is no traffic.  The battery lasts an average of 30 hours,
the spokesman said.  (RadioMail Corp., 800/597-6245; ARDIS, 617/252-

TIPS FOR SELECTING A WORKFLOW TOOL

    Develop criteria for evaluating workflow software before you
start looking for a product, says Bruce Silver, principal at Bruce
Silver Associates in Weston, Mass. 
    "Shopping for workflow is not easy," Silver said recently at the
Bank Administration Institute (BAI) image show.  "The basic problem is
that all of the workflow vendors are trying to solve the same problem: 
managing, organizing and automating a business process.  [All of the
vendors] give different names to the same concepts, [offer] unique
[product] architectures and tend to baffle, rather than inform, the
buyer."
    In addition, it's difficult for end users to compare the
functionality of various workflow tools, Silver said.  Some workflow
products have a lot of functionality built-in while other products
offer a "thin layer" of software and a lot of consulting and
application development services, he noted.
    Another problem when shopping for workflow software is that many
products are less than a year old with few reference sites. Products
can be demonstrated, Silver said, but "many are too new to have a
track record." 

Keep the `Human Factor' in Mind

    The first thing end users should consider when shopping for
workflow software is the "human factor," Silver suggested.  "Before
you start looking at the data sheets or the technical factors, you
need to look at your own organization and your users and developers,"
he explained.  
    Silver recommended that workflow customers keep in mind the
skills of their system operators when evaluating a product.  For
instance, if the system will be used largely by clerical workers, look
for software that is "built for speed" and has tight controls on how
work is presented to users, he suggested.  Choose products with "free-
form" environments for managers and professionals.
    Tip:  Decide whether you will use system integrators, in-house
technicians, or ad hoc tools built into the software to design and
update workflow applications.  "Each of these different types of
developers is the target audience of different workflow products,"
Silver said.
    End users also need to consider the track record of workflow
vendors.  Silver recommended users evaluate vendors based on their
market standing, company history, financial backing and experience in
the workflow market.   
    Silver noted that the best way to measure a vendor's success with
workflow is through its reference sites.  Have vendors provide you
with a list of reference sites in your industry, a breakdown of how
their products are working at each site and a contact at each site. 
Be sure to ask reference customers whether you should contract with
the vendor or a reseller for on-going support. 
    Tip:  Look for products that are supported by several third-
parties, such as consultants or resellers, who offer features that
"snap" into the vendor's framework.  "Besides [offering more
functionality], this implies the vendor may be a market leader because
it is attracting third-party support," Silver said.

Don't Be Confused by Scalability Claims

    Silver warns end users not to be confused by vendors claiming
that their workflow software is scalable.  "Every vendor will say [its
software is] enterprise-scalable," he said.  "It's a meaningless
buzzword at that level."
    Silver recommended customers look at how many concurrent users
each vendor has installed.  "Few workflow vendors can point to
customers with 1,000 seats, all doing workflow in a high-volume
transaction-processing mode," he noted.
    Also, ask vendors whether they plan to offer software that can
support multiple servers.  "The next frontier in workflow is
distributing the workflow server to support remote users in branch
offices, using dial-up lines," Silver predicted.  (Bruce Silver, Bruce
Silver Associates, 617/237-6879.) 

Features To Evaluate When Shopping for Workflow Software

* Graphical workflow maps.  
    Every workflow tool has a graphical map, a visual representation
of the workflow that helps users make changes in the process.
    Silver recommended users look for graphical maps that clearly
represent the workflow.  For example, the maps in some workflow
products have icons that users can click on to see every possible
routing path that can come out of a step.  Other maps have icons that
can be dragged and dropped to alter the workflow.

*User interfaces.  
    Look for products that provide the same interface for all of your
workflow applications if you want to build applications quickly and
easily, Silver suggested.  These interfaces generally feature point
and click tools that allow users to rearrange image windows, list
boxes, status bars, in-boxes and action buttons with relatively little
programming, he added.
    On the other hand, look for products that "hide" workflow
applications if you want to keep the interfaces for your legacy
applications, Silver said.  
The downside:  These products require extra time and money for
programming.

*Deadlines.  
    Users should ask vendors whether their product includes a program
that is triggered if the deadline expires for completing a task or
beginning an item, Silver said.  Some programs move work to another
queue.

*In-baskets.  
    "In a clerical application, you might want the workflow software
to shove the next piece of work to the processing clerk, no questions
asked," Silver said.  "But in other applications you might want to
present an in-basket, which is a list of items [the operator] can work
on."
    He said some workflow products have standard in-baskets that
present data to help users choose their next work item.  Accounts
payable applications, for example, might list each pending item's
invoice number, amount and vendor name.  However, most workflow
products require users to program their own in-boxes.

*Process modeling tools.  
    A growing number of workflow products offer tools for simulating
the effects of workflow changes on an operation's productivity,
resources, throughput, cycle time and costs, he said.  These programs,
which can be run on a laptop computer, also detail the duration of
each task, the location of potential bottlenecks and the number of
employees needed for each step.

*Work management.  
    "Work isn't typically routed to [a specific employee], it is
routed to a particular job category or skill set, which can change
depending on who's doing that task each day," he said.  Some products
allow organizational models to be built into the software so if an
item needs to be routed to a manager, for example, the system knows
which manager oversees that type of work.

*Work tracking.  
    "This is incredibly important, but poorly implemented in many
workflow products," Silver said.  End users should make certain that
the tracking privileges in workflow products are available to system
operators, such as customer representatives, and not just
administrators, he suggested.
    Users also should look for products that allow operators to
search for work items by keying in invoice numbers or customer names,
Silver said.  "Few products provide this type of tracking without
additional programming," he said.  

*Reusable tasks.  
    Ask vendors whether they plan to provide reusable tasks, which
are programs that can be used in more than one workflow application. 
    Also:  Consider each workflow product's server platform,
databases, exceptions handling, messaging infrastructure, programming
language, forms handling, document support and routing rules.  (Bruce
Silver, 617/237-6879.)

COMPANIES CAN SAVE MONEY WITH SPEECH AGENTS IN CALL CENTERS

    Companies will be able to hire fewer human customer service
representatives by incorporating a natural-sounding automated agent
into call centers.  Unisys Corp. of Blue Bell, Pa., demonstrated its
Natural Language Understanding technology at the Retail Delivery
Conference in Atlanta recently and to DC during an interview.
    "In the top 100 banks in the United States, there are 80,000 to
100,000 customer service representatives on the phone lines now and
call volumes are expected to double," said Joe Yaworski, general
manager of the natural language understanding program at Unisys.  "Are
they going to try and find a better way or hire twice as many people?"

Mortgage System Uses Natural Language 

    Unisys first is rolling out a mortgage loan application system
that uses the natural language engine to "speak" to callers. 
Huntington Bancshares of Columbus, Ohio, wants Unisys to use the
engine to custom-build a bill-paying application, said William Randle,
senior vice president of marketing and strategic planning at the bank.
      Unisys also is working with three as-yet-unidentified banks to
develop and deploy the mortgage application.  A commercial product
based on the natural language platform will be available this year. 
"We are targeting banking because of the growth in call centers,"
Yaworski said.
    In Unisys' first demonstration, potential mortgage loan
applicants call the system, which asks whether they would like to know
about fixed or adjustable rate loans.  Once the callers select the
types of loan, the system will ask about other details, such as how
much of a down payment they have and how many points they are willing
to pay.  
    Callers can ask to be transferred to an agent at any time during
the call or can ask the system questions that the automated agent will
answer.  Unisys expects its natural language engine to go into a wide
range of applications eventually, Yaworski said, from the
telemarketing to the credit card industries.  Third-party developers
who want to create applications using the engine can buy a developer's
kit from Unisys.  Unisys will gain revenues from sales of the engine
needed to run those applications.
    Natural Language Understanding technology emerged from funding
that Unisys received for the U.S. Department of Defense in the early
1980s for a project to create technology that could analyze text
documents.  
    Unisys sold off its defense business last year but kept the
speech technology to market it to banks.  (Unisys, 215/986-4788;
Huntington Bancshares, 614/480-8600.)

BIG THREE TRY TO WIN MESSAGING BATTLE IN '96
Lotus, Microsoft and Novell Struggling For Dominance

     Look for a shakeout in 1996 as Lotus Development Corp., Microsoft
Corp. and Novell Inc. tussle over which client-server messaging system
will win enterprise hearts and networks.  Companies also can expect
the Internet to play a bigger role in corporate messaging strategies.
     The large messaging companies repeatedly have set ship dates for
the three next-generation client-server products due--Lotus Notes,
Microsoft Exchange Server and Groupwise XTD--with all of them shipping
behind schedule.  Only Lotus Notes is close to delivering a product,
with Release 4 expected to ship Jan. 10 (see story, p. 8).  Exchange is
due out any time during the first quarter of 1996, and Groupwise XTD
will ship in the second quarter, a Novell spokeswoman said.

What Effect Will Delays Have?

     Analysts disagree over whether the delayed availability will hurt
the products' popularity.  One school of thought holds that one
platform's potential customer will get impatient and move to another
platform in order to meet corporate needs quicker.
     "Everyone in this next-generation offering is late," said Gary
Rowe, principal at Rowe Communications in Roswell, Ga.  "[And it] has
opened up the market for vendors like Hewlett-Packard who had its own
OpenMail.  
     "They said 'folks are clamoring for a client-
server environment.  We'll take Microsoft Mail and cc:Mail front-ends
and allow them to work with an OpenMail back-end server.'"
     "I think a substantial part of Hewlett-Packard's current business
is based on users that don't have the OpenMail client but use these
other clients--so it has opened up the market for other vendors,"
added Rowe.
     Palo Alto, Calif.-based Hewlett-Packard (HP) also is winning
clients due to its ability to put together an E-mail system for the
largest of enterprises--an OpenMail system can serve thousands of
users and unite many disparate platforms.
     Another school of thought says enterprises will be willing to
wait to get what they want.  Microsoft may have an added advantage
here because of its hold over corporate desktops.

Some Willing To Wait

     "In the case of many companies, Microsoft is in such a dominant
position in a lot of markets, just announced [Exchange] causes a lot
of corporate users to put the end decision on hold," Rowe said.  "They
kept going with their file-sharing [systems] and probably are
suffering some pain based on it."
     Consultant Dusty Sykes of Vanguard Communications Corp. in Morris
Plains, N.J., thinks the issue was of more concern to the news media
than to users.
     "If Exchange had been ready Jan. 1, 1995, most users would not
have been ready for it.  They hadn't done the analysis and had no firm
idea of their needs," Sykes said.  But some analysts think Redmond,
Wash.-based Microsoft may have lost business by delaying Exchange for
so long.
     "Microsoft's non-shipment of Exchange and ... the continual
redefinition of Exchange ... has really turned off a lot of customers
and [as a result] they have been uncertain about Exchange as a future
electronic platform," claims David Marshak, vice president and senior
consultant at the Patricia Seybold Group in Boston.
     The industry will have to wait and see as Microsoft has announced
only that it will ship Exchange Server sometime this first quarter. 
Microsoft did release the final beta version of Exchange in December
1995, however (EMN, Nov. 29, p. 6).

Eager To See Exchange

     Even considering Microsoft's delays, analysts still wanted to
talk about Exchange more than any other emerging client-server
offering.  Sykes picked the release of the Exchange server as one of
the most important events in messaging that will happen in 1996.  
     "Notes is no further along in infrastructure than Exchange," he
said, even though Cambridge, Mass.-based Lotus is releasing version 4
and Microsoft has yet to show a first-generation system.
     Other analysts agreed that Exchange was a good product, but also
acknowledged that it is a brand new architecture for Microsoft.
     "[Exchange] is a real new paradigm for Microsoft," Rowe said. 
"It's certainly an order of magnitude better in lots of respects than
Microsoft Mail."   People will be generally pleased with the overall
functionality--it's a pretty solid offering."
     But Rowe still felt that "no one can touch Lotus Notes."
     As for Groupwise, analysts agree that it is a good product, and
Rowe says Novell of Orem, Utah, is "probably the farthest ahead in the
universal mailbox arena."  But these analysts wonder whether Novell
will make it through 1996 intact as a company and whether a buyout is
possible that will undermine its ability to remain a messaging player.
     "With Novell ... shedding businesses and with rumors about them
being acquired, there's a question about [Novell's] long-term
viability and the business decision [for companies] to buy Groupwise,"
Marshak said.
     Analysts expect Novell to have an advantage when the company
releases Groupwise XTD, because of the way in which Groupwise XTD
leverages Novell's Netware operating system.

The Internet Card

     Even with the three-way struggle playing out all last year,
analysts had to give the Internet equal billing in their reviews of
the big three messaging companies for importance in 1995.
     "E-mail as a category became subsumed in Web activity," Seybold
Analyst Marshak said.
     In fact, the Internet and the World Wide Web became popular so
quickly last year that Lotus, Microsoft and Novell were forced to
scramble to create Internet strategies that kept their unreleased
products current with market demands.
     David Zimmer, president of Pennsylvania-based American Eagle
Corp., singled out Lotus for having the most competitive Internet
strategy.
     "[Notes] will be really large this year for two reasons:  Lotus
is interested in the Internet and the Web.  With its new pricing
structure, it is cost effective and InterNotes lets me have a nice
secure Web server with which I can control who has access to what."
     Zimmer does not think the Web will take over from Notes, because
of Notes' powerful publishing and collaboration features the Web
lacks, as well as Notes' strong security.
     "People, because of their fear of the Wild West culture of the
Internet, block [their Web-based internal networks] from external
access," Zimmer said.  "If you can have something that provides a dual
purpose, that's ... better."
     Companies using Notes only need one network, Zimmer said, because
Notes' security features more safely protects internal documents from
break-ins.
     In contrast, Zimmer thinks Microsoft's Internet strategy, just
announced last month (EMN, Dec. 13, 1995, p.1), could have an "adverse
effect" on the growing industry because companies will wait for
Microsoft's bundled Internet server without knowing what kind of
quality they will get from the product.
     Companies, focusing specifically on the Internet and the Web--
namely Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape Communications Corp.--also
will throw a twist into messaging, Marshak said.  "Netscape will
bundle E-mail services into its server.  If I were a large oil company
that had [Microsoft] Mail and cc:Mail, for example, should I migrate
it all to Netscape mail?"
     As a result of this type of enterprise thinking, different
applications are driving corporate decision-making, Marshak said. 
"Does E-mail stand alone--superseded by other decisions--or does the
Web drive these decisions?  Lotus and Microsoft are both companies
hoping that E-mail drives the decisions."

The Directory Question

     Analysts have the most difficulty predicting what might happen
with directories in 1996, although all agreed that directories remain
an area of concern.
     "The need for directory services gets more acute every year, and
the solutions get further away from being real," Marshak said.  "We
used to talk about directories that would find printers and gateways
and now we are talking about directory services which have to
encompass every individual in the world."
     X.500 is gaining popularity, but companies are not adopting it as
the answer to the directory dilemma at the pace the industry had
hoped.  Companies are not adhering to a strictly X.500 but building
proprietary look-alikes to solve the same problem:  how to simply
locate network information.
     "I think that before we think about the technology, we have to
think about what the model is we are looking at here.  We have to talk
about X.500 and look X.500 but I don't think they actually need to be
X.500," Marshak said.
     Several analysts cited Utah-based Banyan Corp.'s StreetTalk
product as one good and available solution, but weren't willing to go
much further than that.
     "[Banyan is] a player that people don't focus on as much as the
others," Rowe said.  "They are a major player in the LAN operating
system area.  They are probably somebody else that people should at
least look at if they are making a decision in 1996."
     Other companies analysts mentioned are Novell, which believes
that its Netware Directory Service is its "strategic advantage in the
X.500 space," according to Marshak.  Marshak also said that "IBM
[IBM], given that they now own Softswitch, will be a big player."
     Rose also mentioned some smaller companies that are building
standardized X.500 directories: Control Data Systems, Unisys Corp. of
Blue Bell Pa., Enterprise Solutions and U.K.-based Nexor.
     Until the major vendors seriously address this issue, however,
"there is going to be some slow progress," Rowe said.
     Although many efforts are under way, most do not think this year
will bring a solution to the directory dilemma.  "I am not optimistic
that it will be much clearer by the end of 1996 than it is now,"
Marshak said.

Public Policy Sticking Its Nose In

     Concern over public policy affecting electronic messaging also
prevailed in the E-mail community in 1995.  Organizations such as the
Arlington, Va.-based Electronic Messaging Association (EMA) spent a
great deal of time lobbying against legislation that would restrict
freedom over public networks and hold corporations responsible for any
offensive material individuals might transmit.
     "We got involved, not because we have any great desire to be any
great player, but because Washington became more aware of messaging
and other technologies," said Victor Parra, EMA president.
     The EMA's goal, with regard to messaging legislation currently
being considered as an amendment to the telecommunications bill (S.
652), is to protect children from obscene material and corporations
from having to take responsibility for what individuals post on
corporate networks.
     As the legislation now reads, any person who "initiates the
transmission of any suggestive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or
indecent message with the ability to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass
another person would be subject to a $100,000 fine or one year in
jail," according to Parra.
     Corporations have what Parra called a "safe harbor," because
anyone prosecuting them must prove that they willingly left such
material on their networks after knowing it was there.  Still, the EMA
wants the amendment's language rewritten to more narrowly define what
material would be considered offensive.  With the negotiations on the
bill now being finalized, the EMA is concerned that time this year is
short.  (The American Eagle Group, 215/482-3881; EMA, 703/524-5550;

ALISA SYSTEMS INTEGRATES CITY OF SAN JOSE E-MAIL

     E-mail is not just growing, it is growing in a million different
directions.  Departments are getting E-mail at such a rapid pace that
the systems they install are not compatible with anyone else in the
enterprise.  Therefore, enter the E-mail integrators.
     Alisa Systems of Pasadena, Calif., is the E-mail integrator out
connecting departments within organizations and making them accessible
to the Internet, as it has done with the City of San Jose.  
     Employees did not want to abandon the E-mail systems they were
working on just to become compatible, says Gary Zouzoulos, an employee
of San Jose, Calif.  So the city investigated several different
systems that could integrate all of the city's current E-mail systems
seamlessly. The city's management examined products from several
companies, and also briefly considered Maynard, Mass.-based Digital
Equipment Corp.'s product, but concluded that it was too expensive,
says Zouzoulos.
     The two reasons the city of San Jose chose Alisa over its
competitors, according to Zouzoulos were:
    * it was the only company which could integrate WordPerfect at
the time; and
    * they liked its database approach toward message conversion.
     Alisa's AlisaMail is designed to create a central location within
an enterprise and connect the disparate   E-mail systems using the
native protocol of each system.  This makes each E-mail package appear
to the user as the user's native E-mail system.For instance, AlisaMail
is able to detect when an E-mail message is sent from a Lotus cc:Mail
system to Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft packages without having to
generate an internal address, Alisa President Don Cole told EMN.

Alisa Systems at a Glance

                        221 East Walnut Street
                               Suite 175
                           Pasadena CA 91101
                             818/792-9474

Contact:  Don Cole, president, 818/792-9474
Founded:  1983
Product:  AlisaMail; an E-mail system integration product
Users:  Companies with 1,000 or more employees
Areas Served:  Commercial and government
Customers:  City of San Jose, University of Texas, Washington State
Department of Transportation, Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department
of Revenue, Hospital of Sick Children--Toronto
Status:  Privately held. 

Address File Helps Find Each Other

    In addition, AlisaMail's integration system includes a Master
Address file, which makes all users apparent to each other on the
system.  In other words, it is a sum of all the other directories in
all their unique formats, as well as the routes necessary to send the
message within the system.  
     This file is called OpenDirectory, Automatic Directory
Synchronization and Message Switch.
     OpenDirectory creates and maintains a master directory of all E-
mail users on the system by requesting directory updates from each
separate mail system.  When changes are made in one E-mail system,
such as adding a new person, modifying an address or deleting a
personal address, the information is transferred to the master
directory and used to update all the other directories, says Cole.
     Zouzoulos said, "OpenDirectory is still based on a proprietary
standard instead of an industry standard."

Integrator Preserves Unique Functionality

     AlisaMail utilizes a multi-port gateway which connects the
different E-mail systems to the AlisaMail Message Switch.  The gateway
and message switch act as a store-and-forward message hub, handling
the conversion of message formats as required by each individual
system.  The message switch preserves the functionality of each mail
system because it stores the message in its unaltered format.  
     This is particularly important when sending messages across the
Internet, Lou Sears, senior programming analyst with the city of San
Jose, told EMN.  The biggest challenge before getting AlisaMail was
lack of Internet access, says Sears.  "Each person would have had to
have their own gateway to the Internet, with individual administrators
for each, and the software to go along with it," he says.
    AlisaMail helps users to see each other as they actually are--
without having to communicate through multiple gateways and
complicated massaging protocols.  For instance, an E-mail messages
sent on the Reston, Va.-based America Online system might have a
"return receipt" attached to it.  If this message is sent to a Digital
VMX system, it cannot read "return receipt."  Therefore, the AlisaMail
would attach to the message the concept of "return receipt" so that
the user on the other end would know how to respond, says Cole.
    Alisa Systems gears its product toward companies with between
1,000 to 80,000 employees, says Cole.

City Just Had To Have E-mail

    When deciding whether or not to integrate its E-mail packages
across the entire city-wide enterprise, Zouzoulos says the decision
didn't turn on a cost/benefit analysis:  We just had to have it. 
"Before E-mail was just a curiosity and a luxury; now we depend upon
it."
    Other benefits to the integrated E-mail system include a
reduction in some paperwork.  "We are just at that curve where people
are using [E-mail] more to actually send electronic documents [to one
another] and not just messages," says Zouzoulos.
    Whenever the city is having problems, such as a complaint coming
in about a city function, "the phone rings off the hook," says
Zouzoulos.  "E-mail has helped to keep things running smoothly."  E-
mail is used mostly within the city organization, but people from the
outside can send in E-mail also, says Sears.  He considers the city's
E-mail system to be not only used as a "business to business" tool
within the enterprise, but also as a communication tool to the
outside, he says.  For example, people from the outside can send E-
mail directly to the mayor or other members of the council with
questions and comments, says Sears.

Issues Continued To Be Worked Out

    While the city of San Jose is satisfied with the work Alisa has
done for its E-mail systems, there still are a few things to be worked
out, according to Zouzoulos.  The city:
    * wants to be able to handle the new Microsoft Exchange E-mail
product and would like Alisa to support this along with its others;
    * would like the directory structure to be made X.500 compatible;
and  
    * wants smoother interface with the Internet.

EDIFY HELPS BUILD INTRANETS.  

Companies are using San Jose, Calif.-based Edify Corp.'s agent
software for the World Wide Web to build internal networks which
employees will access using computers, telephones, pagers or fax
machines.  Unisys Corp. last month purchased Electronic Workforce 4.0
to provide a self-service human resource application to its 36,000
employees worldwide.  Employees will access this information through
the "Intranet," or internal Web, that Unisys' human resources
department is building.  Telephone and fax access soon will be added
to the system.  Unisys is using Edify's software to allow resumes and
remaining vacation days, through the Intranet.  Electronic Workforce
4.0 will work with PeopleSoft's Human resources management System
(HRMS) to allow employees to update records either over the Web or via
telephone.  (Edify, http://www.edify.com, 408/982-2000.)

WITH INTERNET STRATEGY HERE, LOTUS SHIPS RELEASE VERSION 4

Lotus Development Corp. will be the first major messaging company to
market with its complete client-server messaging solution Notes
Release Version 4 which was expected to ship today.
    Notes Release 4 comes on the heels of Lotus' recent Internet
strategy announcement in December which tied Notes closely to the
World Wide Web.  Lotus will be bundling at no extra charge the
InterNotes World Wide Web server with Notes servers--InterNotes
formerly cost $2,995.  Lotus also added native support for Web
protocols such as hypertext markup language.

Notes Using Web To Its Advantage

    "This has shown that Lotus has embraced the Web," said Paula
Boyle, industry analyst at the GIGA Information Group in Norwell,
Mass.  "Its strategy now is more comprehensive than Microsoft's or
Netscape's.  Companies looking to upgrade to Notes 4 will find the Web
enhancements a major attraction.  Companies looking to adopt groupware
will find Notes the most comprehensive platform, compared to what
Exchange will have."
    Analysts said Release 4 will conquer one of Notes's biggest
challenges--its difficulty to administer.  
    Lotus is doing this by increasing the scalability of a Notes
server.  Whereby Notes Release 3 server could support up to 120 users
per server, Notes Release 4 can fit nearly 1,000 users on a symmetric
multiprocessing platform, said Larry Jones, group product manager for
client-server messaging at Lotus.
    "Clearly, if I can cut down on the number of servers on a mail
network it will be easier for me to administer and I will need fewer
administrators.  All of that cuts costs of maintaining and
administrating my network," Jones said.
    The Notes Release 4 server comes in single- and multi-processor
versions at respective prices of $495 and $2,295 and runs on IBM
Corp.'s OS/2 Warp and Microsoft Corp.'s [MSFT] Windows NT.  Support
for Microsoft Windows 95, IBM AIX, HP-UX, Sun Solaris and Orem, Utah-
based Novell Netware will follow.
    Lotus also rolled out Lotus Notes Mail, a stripped down messaging
client for Notes servers, last month.  The client costs $55 per seat,
and allows users to send and receive Notes Mail even if they do not
have full Notes capabilities.  The lower prices will make it easier
for companies to allow all employees Notes access.
    Users can choose two other clients as well: Notes Desktop, a run-
time version which costs $69, and can run any custom Notes
application, or full Notes which costs $275.  All Notes clients
include the InterNotes Navigator web browser, which allows users to
import web documents into Notes applications.  (Lotus,
http://www.lotus.com, 617/577-8500; GIGA Information Group, 617/792-
2572.)

SEARS STUDIES NETWORK
ALTERNATIVES FOR PCRADIO

  Sears Roebuck and Co.'s Product Services Division plans to
test the use of mobile data communications with a version of
IBM's new PCradio in about six months, says Stan Knipe,
executive vice president for product services at Sears in
Chicago. Knipe expects recommendations on how Sears should
conduct the tests, and what wireless network it should use,
from the division's systems people in about 60 days.

  Although Sears has stated its intentions to use the
portable computer from IBM, it can't begin hands-on work with
the product until it implements a new system to support its
field service operations, Knipe says. The system will allow
Sears to handle service requests through a small number of
regional centers, rather than through its 850 local service
centers.

  Call takers will schedule appointments with customers and
then transmit work orders to the local centers, from which
technicians are dispatched. "We have to have this software
system, and even the process changes that that drives, in
place before we're going to be able to feed and support the
remote access terminal type of thing," Knipe says. Sears
plans to roll out the new system nationally over the next 18
months.

  When the tests occur, they might or might not involve the
Ardis public mobile data network. In early 1990, soon after
IBM and Motorola announced their joint venture to form Ardis,
Knipe discussed imminent plans to test that technology for
field service applications (see our sister publication,
Mobile Data Report, February 12, 1990).

                    Tests Never Took Place

  The tests never took place, however, and now it's not clear
whether Sears will use Ardis, Knipe says. The company might
instead decide to use network facilities provided by Sears
Technology Services (STS) in Schaumburg, Ill.

  STS operates the data communications network for the Sears
family of corporations, including Dean Witter, Coldwell
Banker and Allstate Insurance as well as the retail
operation. It also operates three information processing
facilities -- in Schaumburg, Dallas and Columbus, Ohio --
which serve all the Sears companies except Allstate.

  The STS data network, which is based on IBM System Network
Architecture (SNA), uses special access circuits obtained
from local telephone companies to connect locations within a
local access and transport area (LATA) to a concentrator.
From the concentrator, data are transmitted to SNA boundary
nodes over 56,000 bit/second links, and from the boundary
nodes to host machines at the information processing
facilities at 56,000 bits/second or T-1. The processing
centers are linked by DS3 facilities.

  Knipe and a spokesperson at STS both decline to specify
what kind of radio frequency network STS could make available
to link the handheld terminals to host computer systems.
Neither will they discuss the details of the system that will
be used to link the regional service call taking centers, the
three information processing centers and the local service
centers.

  It's probably safe, however, to draw some analogies between
the product service system and the system Sears employs to
take catalog orders by phone. The 10 regional facilities
through which Sears will handle service calls are the same
ones at which it already operates its telecatalog service,
Knipe says.

  Telecatalog call-takers use "dumb" desktop terminals to
interact with host systems at the data centers. There is
considerable redundancy among systems at the three centers;
it is Sears' intention to be able to route applications
traffic to any of the three centers, depending on current
traffic, to maintain the fastest possible response time, says
the STS spokesperson.

  All data used in product service applications also resides
at the three central data facilities. Service representatives
use desktop terminals to access information such as history
of service on the appliance, whether the appliance is in
warranty and whether the customer has purchased an extended
service agreement. Under the new system, that function would
shift to the 10 regional centers.

  Adding portable terminals to the picture would allow the
local centers to dispatch technicians in the field to new
jobs. It would also allow technicians to close out jobs,
exchange messages with dispatchers, access technical
information about appliances and view schematic drawings. The
latter would not be transmitted over the network, but would
be stored on "a miniaturized CD-ROM," Knipe says.

  To handle data transmissions as economically as possible,
Sears expects to use a PCradio that can communicate over a
cellular network as well as over a public or private mobile
data network, Knipe says. Brief transactions would be routed
over the mobile data network. Large files would be
transmitted over cellular. (Of course, if Sears decides to
use privately-licensed frequencies rather than a public
network, it won't have to worry about paying by the packet
for transmitting large files, as it would on Ardis.)

                         In One Box?

  IBM is working on a version of the PCradio to meet Sears'
needs, Knipe says. But it's not possible to fit the hardware
for both cellular and mobile data network transmissions into
the same portable box, says Jim Robinson, the PCradio project
coordinator at Boca Raton, Fla.

  In August, IBM announced three versions of the PCradio.
Model 001 contains a 2,400 bits/second landline modem; model
002 contains a Motorola 400i packet assembler/disassembler
for use on Motorola radio networks, including Ardis; and
model 003 includes a cellular transceiver and a 2,400
bits/second modem for transmission over cellular. The
terminal can't accommodate both the 400i and a cellular
transceiver, Robinson says.

  A customer could, however, gain the ability to transmit
over two kinds of wireless networks by sacrificing some
degree of portability. For example, a customer could use an
RS-232 link to connect the cellular PCradio to an RF modem in
a vehicle, Robinson says. This would allow the user to
transmit over Ardis or a private network only while in the
vehicle, but over cellular from anywhere.

CONVERSION TO OMNITRACS
SIMPLE, SAYS U.S. XPRESS

  When Geostar Corp. declared bankruptcy this May, U.S.
Xpress, a full truckload (TL) carrier in Tunnel Hill, Ga.,
was left in the dark. But the firm isn't kicking itself over
the time it spent integrating the now-defunct vehicle
tracking and messaging system with its operations. Thanks to
development work it did with its Geostar vendor, Hughes
Network Systems in Germantown, Md., U.S. Xpress is now having
an easy time linking applications on its AS/400 network with
data from its new satellite communications system, says Jim
Clerc, data processing manager at the trucking company.

  U.S. Xpress signed a $5.3 million contract this summer with
San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc. for service on its Omnitracs
system. The trucking firm is currently installing Qualcomm's
vehicle tracking and two-way messaging system on its trucks
at the rate of 50/week. All 550 trucks should be equipped by
sometime in November, Clerc says.

  Under the contract, another 250 units will go to a sister
company, Southwest Motor Freight in Chattanooga, Tenn. Once
the Georgia company finishes its own implementation, it will
replace Southwest's current dispatching and management system
with its own software, including the Omnitracs interfaces.

  The contract also includes an option to purchase an
additional 1,000 Omnitracs units to install on newly-acquired
trucks in the future. U.S. Xpress used the Geostar network
for about 15 months before bankrupt Geostar pulled the plug
on its service. The trucking firm worked closely with Hughes
to provide interfaces to its own dispatching and management
software, which was developed in-house.

  U.S. Xpress uses vehicle position data to help automate
fuel tax reporting, watch for trucks that go out of route and
estimate fuel consumption, among other applications.

  If Geostar had not gone out of business, U.S. Xpress
probably would have been perfectly happy to continue using
the system from Hughes -- but no one at the company regrets
the relationship with Qualcomm either, Clerc says.

  During the weeks when the company was "dark" -- between
Geostar's death and the contract with Qualcomm -- the
advantages of vehicle tracking and satellite communications
became extremely clear, he says. The company has seen a 20
percent increase in productivity through the use of the
satellite systems, he says.

  Unlike many of Qualcomm's other customers, U.S. Xpress is
flying solo in providing links to Omnitracs. Usually,
Qualcomm gives new customers a shopping list of interfaces
and applications it can provide. Once the customer decides
what it wants, a software applications engineer employed by
Qualcomm writes the code needed to import data from the
satellite network into databases used by pre-existing
applications on the customer's host, says Jan Stevens,
manager of software engineering at Qualcomm.

  Qualcomm does a great deal of this "external applications"
work, but Clerc recently told her that U.S. Xpress wouldn't
need any outside programming help, Stevens says.

  Applications at U.S. Xpress run on a network of five IBM
AS/400s. One of the machines, whose main function is to
manage communications, is currently linked by a dial-up
connection to Qualcomm's network facilities in San Diego.
This will soon be replaced by a leased T-1 circuit, Clerc
says.

  U.S. Xpress dispatchers work on "dumb" terminals tied to
the mainframe network. The multi-session CRTs allow them to
work in three applications at once, moving from one screen to
the next without having to exit one program and enter
another.

                     Link to Southwestern

  One of the functions the dispatchers can perform is to
access Southwestern's dispatching program, running on an
AS/400 in Chattanooga. Although the two firms dispatch their
fleets separately, their computer systems are linked by high-
speed lines.

  A U.S. Xpress dispatcher with a new load to assign can
query the Southwestern database to determine whether that
company has a truck in the area that's better able to handle
the job than a truck in his own fleet. The link between the
two system leads to "better utilization of both companies'
equipment. We're competing against each other, but we're also
helping each other," Clerc says.

  As part of the integration with Omnitracs, the dispatchers'
terminals will soon give way to 80286-based IBM compatible
personal computers operating at 16 MHz, with 2 megabytes of
RAM and 50 megabyte hard disks. Having the PCs will allow
U.S. Xpress to use Qualcomm's Intracs software. Intracs
displays vehicle location data, downloaded from the host
computer to a PC, on computerized maps.

  Each dispatcher will use the map display to view the part
of the fleet for which he is responsible. Data will be
downloaded from the AS/400 at set intervals and when the
dispatcher requests an update. Ultimately, Clerc wants the
system to update positions in the PC each time they're
updated in the host. (Generally, Qualcomm transmits a
vehicle's position once each hour plus each time the driver
sends a message.)

  Although the advent of the PCs will put new processing
power on dispatchers' desks, U.S. Xpress doesn't plan to take
advantage of the added muscle when it designs applications.
The desktop machine, with its super-VGA screen, is basically
"a high-priced graphics display," Clerc says. "If the AS/400
could do it [run the map display program], we probably would
do that."

  Further enhancements to the system will follow when
Qualcomm provides U.S. Xpress with sensors, allowing it to
transmit data from engines over the satellite network. The
company currently gets some idea of how engines are
functioning by making calculations based on position data,
but that's "kind of guesswork," Clerc says.

  Eventually, rather than have its system simply display
engine conditions to dispatchers, U.S. Xpress would like the
computer to analyze the data and make decisions about how to
solve problems, Clerc says.

  Although U.S. Xpress will probably want to go its own way
in handling data from sensors, Qualcomm is preparing to
release a packaged application designed to make use of that
type of information. The Sensortracs program has been in beta
testing for some time now, says Stevens.

SYSTEMS LINK PLANNED ROUTES
WITH ACTUAL PERFORMANCE DATA

  Like the plans of mice and men, the best-laid plans for
delivery routes sometimes go awry. A firm might invest many
thousands of dollars in a routing and scheduling package that
uses sophisticated algorithms to analyze an information-
packed database. Overnight, that software might churn out
delivery plans designed to save fuel, use equipment
efficiently and keep customers delighted. But once the trucks
hit the road, real world problems -- like traffic jams,
overheated engines and errant drivers -- can play havoc with
ideal routes.

  To help bridge the gap between plan and performance, some
delivery organizations have been merging data from their
routing systems with data from trip recording computers. The
reports they obtain in this way at the end of each driver's
run can help them identify performance problems such as
unnecessary detours and missed delivery windows.

  In addition, at least two systems on the market today can
compare real-time data from automatic vehicle location (AVL)
systems with pre-determined routes to detect problems while
trucks are still on the road. These systems can calculate the
effect that a performance lag will have on deliveries later
in the day.

  They can then plan a new route to put things back on
track -- or at least to satisfy those customers with the most
stringent delivery requirements. Using a mobile data
communications network, they can automatically transmit
revised routes to computers or terminals in the delivery
trucks.

  Routing Technology Software, Inc. (RTSI) in Vienna, Va.
announced such a package this spring. The system uses the Ram
Mobile Data network to transmit location data from a Global
Positioning System (GPS) receiver mounted on a truck to a
host computer running RTSI's Roadshow routing and scheduling
package. For transmitting new routes and other messages to
drivers, RTSI is remarketing mobile data terminals from
Racotek in Burnsville, Md. and radio frequency modems from
Ericsson GE Mobile Data in Paramus, N.J.

  RTSI designed Roadshow primarily to address dense delivery
situations in metropolitan areas, although it also has
customers with trucks serving multiple states. The other
product that can re-route drivers on the fly, the Mobile
Communications System (MCS) from Rand McNally TDM in Skokie,
Ill., is aimed at over the road operations.

  MCS accepts location data transmitted over Qualcomm's
Omnitracs or Motorola's Coverage Plus systems (and formerly
from the now-defunct Geostar system). It compares current
locations with planned routes, alerts the dispatcher when a
truck is falling behind its estimated time of arrival (ETA)
and detects when a truck is out of route.

                       Visiting Shirley

  A driver on a long distance trip might go out of route --
using extra time and fuel -- because of road construction,
bad weather or "because he's visiting Shirley," says Henry
Feinberg, president at Rand McNally TDM. Once the problem
becomes evident, the dispatcher can have MCS produce new
instructions to put the the driver back on target. He then
transmits those directions to the mobile data terminal.

  The two systems seem to have tremendous potential for
certain delivery situations, but both are still unproven in
the marketplace. Although RTSI and Rand McNally are solidly
entrenched in the routing systems market, they're only now
starting to market their mobile communications products.
Neither has yet signed a customer for its new system.

  Are the benefits that result from comparing planned and
actual routes in real time worth the extra cost of using AVL
and mobile communications systems?

  Perhaps for some operations, but not for E & J Gallo, says
Monty Maglinte, an industrial engineer with the Modesto,
Calif. winery. Gallo is starting to explore how to combine
data from its routing and scheduling system with data from a
trip recorder. Gallo's distributorships, some of which are
corporate owned, use a routing package called Truckstops 2
from Microanalytics in Arlington, Va.

  Maglinte and his colleagues at Gallo serve as technology
consultants to the distributors. The firm is currently
investigating trip recorders they will recommend for various
functions, including comparisons of actual trips with routes
created by Truckstops 2. Like others who are combining the
two technologies, Gallo wants not only to measure how drivers
progress from stop to stop, but also to track other factors,
such as how long drivers spend at each account and how many
cases of product they unload per hour.

  If the software creates effective routes, there won't be a
lot of problems the dispatcher needs to address in real time,
Maglinte says. A truck might break down, or problems with an
account might cause a driver to spend an hour at a stop
instead of the expected 20 minutes. But those complications
don't arise often enough to merit great concern, he says.

  Technology that can produce and transmit revised routes to
drivers is great, but it's more costly than it's worth, says
Mark Whalley, transportation product manager at STSC in
Rockville, Md. STSC's routing and scheduling package, Trucks,
is designed for both local and long-haul fleets. Most of its
users are private carriers, Whalley says.

  Drivers who cover the same geographic areas day after day
know their territories well, he says. When they encounter
delays, they can figure out their own shortcuts and
alternative routes.

  There would be no extra value to getting performance data
in real time rather than at the end of a delivery run, says
Gary Strzelczyk, director of transportation at Bevaco Foods
in Pittston, Pa. Bevaco, a food service distributor, makes
runs to 13 states out of its central location. Drivers make
trips of one to four days, delivering to restaurants, health
care facilities and other institutions.

  Bevaco has used routing software from Roadnet Technologies
in Timonium, Md. for about 3-1/2 years. The firm has been
using trip recorders from Cadec Systems in Londonderry, N.H.
for the past two years. Roadnet is now working out the bugs
in an interface that allows the Roadnet system to accept data
from the Cadec and produce printed exception reports,
Strzelczyk says.

  At the end of each run, a Bevaco staffer extracts data from
the onboard computer by inserting a cartridge into the Cadec
and then uses the cartridge to upload the data to a personal
computer. Bevaco uses a floppy disk to transfer drivers' trip
reports, containing the times they arrived at and left each
stop, to a second PC running the Roadnet system.

  The customers that Roadnet serves don't need real time data
communications to monitor routes, says David Carp, national
sales manager at the Maryland firm. Unlike long-haul trucking
carriers, private delivery operations don't assign new stops
to drivers while they're on the road.

  "Usually if you're dealing with a beer distributor, wine
distributor, food service distributor, they're not getting
any orders during the day. It's all pack 'em up and send 'em
out and let 'em come back empty," he says.

                        Enough Hiccups

  For drivers who make many stops in a compact, congested
urban territory, however, the workday contains "enough
hiccups" that it pays to track their progress all the time,
says Donald Soults, president at RTSI. The routing
software/trip recorder combination is a good tool for
evaluating driver performance, but RTSI's real time system
can help companies anticipate and avoid customer service
problems, he says.

  Dispatchers can use the mobile data network to transmit
revised routes not only when drivers fall behind schedule,
but also when parts of the road system become unavailable. A
dispatcher who learns, for example, that a bridge has been
closed uses a mouse to click on the image of that bridge on
Roadshow's video map display.

  Once the bridge is selected and deleted, the software
calculates new instructions for any drivers whose routes are
affected by the change, Soults says. The dispatcher can then
transmit the changes to the drivers.

CUSTOMER GIVES THUMBS-UP
TO CLI'S FUEL DELIVERY SYSTEM

  Following a 90 day pilot on the Ram Mobile Data Network, MB
Trucking Co. in New York City is implementing mobile data
terminals in 20 of its fuel delivery trucks. MB is using the
terminals in connection with the Fueltronic 2000 dispatching
system from Carrier Logistics, Inc. (CLI) in Rye Brook, N.Y.
CLI used the recently-concluded pilot to refine the new
dispatching system before marketing it to other fuel delivery
companies.

  Fueltronic 2000 is based on the dispatching portion of
CLI's Routronic 2000 routing and dispatching package for
less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers, says Don Adams, president
at CLI. The new application, customized for fuel delivery,
was designed specifically to be used with a mobile data
network.

  MB Trucking delivers heating oil to private homes,
apartment buildings and commercial buildings in the New York
metropolitan area. Vendors that use its services include
large companies such as Texaco and Amerada Hess as well as
independent retailers. During the pilot, MB operated mobile
data terminals from Ericsson GE Mobile Data in eight of its
45 trucks. It has now decided to place terminals in the 20
trucks that do regular residential deliveries -- to one- and
two-family homes and small, brownstone-type apartment
buildings -- says Joseph Magnone, general manager at MB.

                   More Forgiving Schedules

  Because trucks servicing larger accounts make fewer stops
per day, they operate on more forgiving schedules, and MB
doesn't think they need terminals "just yet," says Magnone.
Also, because homeowners are less likely than commercial
landlords to plan for their fuel needs in advance, there are
more emergency calls for same-day service on the home
delivery side of the business, he says.

  MB has been using software from CLI for various aspects of
its operations since the mid-1970s. The trucking firm's
primary computer is a Unix-based IBM RT, which soon will be
upgraded to an IBM RS/6000, Adams says. Fueltronic is running
on an 80386-based personal computer in a multi-user Unix
environment.

  Customer orders entered on the RT are passed to the 386,
where Fueltronic routes deliveries, manages communications
with the mobile terminals and receives drivers' status
reports. When a driver reports that a delivery is complete,
the relevant data are passed back to applications on the RT.
The 386 is linked to Ram's local switch via leased line.

  MB expects to boost productivity and streamline operations
enough to make back its investment in the new system in a
year and a half, says Magnone. One area where it plans to
improve is in assigning deliveries for "will-calls" --
customers who call when they need oil, rather than scheduling
deliveries in advance.

  Using their mobile terminals, drivers will report the
amount of product dispensed at each delivery, and the system
will keep track of how much they have left. This means a
dispatcher receiving a call for same-day service will know
not only which drivers are closest to the account, but which
are carrying sufficient fuel. Based on those two factors, the
dispatcher can assign the job to the appropriate truck and,
if necessary, reassign one of that driver's other stops to a
different truck, Magnone says.

  By transmitting data on completed deliveries in real time,
MB also expects to eliminate many hours of data entry time on
the RT. Currently, with that information reaching the office
at the end of the day, during the firm's peak season the data
entry staff often must work until midnight or 1:00 a.m. to
update records. "We could be reducing our computer room time
by three or four hours per day," Magnone says.

                   More Announcements Soon

  CLI's Routronic 2000 package can be used with or without an
interface to a mobile data network. CLI is able to provide
interfaces to both the Ram and Ardis public mobile data
networks and soon expects to announce its first Routronic
customers on both, says Adams. AAA Cooper Transportation in
Dothan, Ala. implemented the system at its Atlanta terminal,
with a link via private network to Motorola terminals in its
trucks, in 1986.

  Since many of the functions in the LTL system apply to
other transportation situations as well, other specialized
products could follow Fueltronic 2000 to market. The company
recently completed a system for a client doing food
distribution and could sell that package to others, with or
without a mobile data interface, Adams says. Other niches
might include general warehousing and delivery, furniture or
appliance delivery and messenger services.

MELARD EXPANDS PORTFOLIO
WITH SERVICE ON RAM, ARDIS

  Melard Technologies Inc., a field service systems
integrator in Yonkers, N.Y., has added communications over
Ram Mobile Data to the list of services it will offer its
customers. Melard was recently appointed a systems integrator
for the Mobitex network operated by Ram, which is based in
New York City. Melard previously announced that it had signed
a joint marketing agreement with Ardis in Lincolnshire, Ill.,
This allows Melard to offer communications over Ardis'
nationwide mobile data network.

  The commitment to wireless communications is part of an
ongoing effort by Melard to reposition its business. The
company was established in 1983 to design, manufacture and
market handheld computers with communications capabilities.
More recently, its product line has included peripheral
hardware, such as barcode readers. Melard has carved a niche
for itself especially in the telecommunications industry.

  The firm has sold about 20,000 of its ruggedized handheld
computers, which use a proprietary operating system, says
Nick Scalera, Melard's director of market development.
Melard's current plan, however, is to provide turnkey mobile
information systems -- including hardware, software,
communications, training and support -- to a variety of field
service organizations.

  Offering communications over mobile data networks "is an
integral part of our business plan and always has been," says
Scalera. The right technologies at the right prices just
haven't been available until recently, he says.

                        Stymied by PBX

  Melard's product line has always included modems for
transmitting data over the public switched telephone network.
For many of its traditional customers, these have proven a
satisfactory solution. Technicians working for the regional
Bell operating companies (RBOCs) can always plug their modems
into outdoor equipment owned by their firms. But for
technicians working on other kinds of equipment, who might
have to ask a client's permission to use a phone, or might be
stymied by a client's PBX, landline modems pose a problem,
Scalera says.

  Melard's Access II product is a 2.4 lb., clamshell-style
handheld with 56K of internal memory allocated between RAM
and ROM and up to 512K of battery-backed RAM. The supertwist
LCD is available in either 8 lines x 40 characters or 16
lines x 80 characters. The 49-key QWERTY-style keyboard
includes 16 function keys. A 300/1,200 bits/second internal
modem is included. Melard uses a removable nicad power pack
to run the computer.

                      Engineers at Work

  Melard's engineers are working on how to integrate
Motorola's 400i radio packet modem into future products,
Scalera says. The 400i is compatible with Ardis as well as
with private networks using Motorola technology.

  Work on a handheld for the Ram network will have to wait
until a portable Mobitex RF modem reaches the market.
Ericsson Mobile Data in Paramus, N.J. is expected to release
an external model in the first quarter of 1992.

  In addition to its own terminals, Melard will also provide
other end-user devices, including DOS-based machines. If the
system that suits a customer's needs includes Melard's own
terminals, "that's fine; but if not, that's fine too,"
Scalera says.

  Scalera won't discuss whether Melard is working on its own
DOS-based handheld. But, "I would think at this point anyone
who would continue to develop proprietary kinds of systems
would have a very short-sighted view," he says.

  Although Melard has yet to sign a customer for service on
either Ram or Ardis, it has customers conducting feasibility
tests and has seen a great deal of interest. "All of the
people that we've been talking to, especially those that
don't have such ready access to tip and ring, have been
waiting for this kind of thing to happen," Scalera says.

  Melard isn't the only vendor of field service systems
that's convinced there's a big demand for wireless
communications. Although only the largest field service
organizations were looking at the technology in the past,
with the advent of public mobile data networks, smaller firms
are also showing interest, says Rebecca Weber, marketing
services manager at Service Automation, Inc. (SAI).

  The Houston-based firm provides management systems for
companies that service computer systems, residential
appliances, medical equipment, telecommunications equipment,
office machines and restaurant equipment.

                   Still Piloting Internally

  SAI announced a version of its Service Automation System
for use with Ardis in April. Although the company has begun
marketing the wireless application, it's still piloting the
system internally and has not yet signed a customer, Weber
says.

  SAI does have about 100 service technicians transmitting
data over Motorola's specialized mobile radio system, Privacy
Plus, which provides local communications. Although those
users will continue to be supported, SAI is no longer
marketing data over Privacy Plus because Motorola is no
longer offering it to new customers, Weber says.

  A third field service applications vendor, The Data Group
in Burlington, Mass., first developed the Remote-Plus
wireless communications module to its Field Watch system for
use with Motorola's Data Radio Network. That three-city
network was combined with IBM's nationwide Digital
Communications System -- which Motorola built -- to form
Ardis in 1990. Ardis is jointly owned by IBM and Motorola.

  Like its competitors, The Data Group has not yet signed a
customer onto Ardis. One customer has decided to use the
mobile data network but is still weighing the pros and cons
of various remote devices, says Robert Fogler, senior project
manager at The Data Group.

                 Non-"Bursty" Communications

  Some of the applications that interest field service
organizations, such as transmitting new job assignments,
closing out jobs and checking parts availability, are just
the sort of "bursty" communications for which Ram and Ardis
were designed. But other functions that service organizations
want to move into the field, such as accessing equipment and
customer history data and using expert systems to perform
diagnostics, could demand enough airtime to make public
mobile data networks an expensive choice.

  An applications designer can keep costs down by designing
data transactions that require as little network time as
possible, Fogler says. It also pays to use a computer, rather
than a "dumb" terminal, as the portable device, he says. This
allows the system to operate in a client/server mode; data
are downloaded over the network as needed, but most of the
processing occurs locally.

  Although paying by the packet to use an expert system may
be costly, a lot of customers say it's worth the price, Weber
says. "There may be enough value in what they can charge for
that [service] call that it's okay."

  Melard's tactic for dealing with large transactions will be
to provide more than one communications option in one device.
Customers using radio networks will still need landline
modems for moving large amounts of data, Scalera says. Melard
has also said it plans to offer data communications over
cellular networks.

BOSTON EDISON TO EVALUATE
STARTUP'S MOBILE DATA SYSTEM

  Boston Edison Co. is about to begin a small pilot to
evaluate the use of mobile data in maintaining its electrical
distribution network. After running this "prototype system"
for a few months, the utility will use the knowledge it gains
to write a detailed request for proposals (RFP) for a larger-
scale system, says Larry Dexter, senior electrical engineer
for communications, who works in Boston Edison's Waltham,
Mass. office.

  Using hardware and software from Metric Systems Corp., a
small startup in Acton, Mass., the utility will download work
orders overnight to Zenith laptop computers in trucks used by
line repair crews in Waltham. During the day, repair crews
will use the system to request more information about their
assignments, report on their status, close out completed jobs
and receive assignments for emergency work.

  Currently, field technicians spend 15-30 minutes each
morning picking up computer printouts that list their
assignments for the day. By having the assignments waiting
for crews on their laptops, Boston Edison hopes to get a jump
on the work day, Dexter says. Also, by automating the way in
which crews report on work they've completed, the utility
company hopes to cut the time they spend reporting verbally
to the supervisor at the end of the shift, he says.

  Boston Edison will be using Mavric 2000, a wireless data
communications system provided by Metric Systems. In its
basic form, Mavric 2000 consists of: 1. a base station
controller, containing a radio, an RF modem and interface
circuitry, 2. several remote controllers, which are similar
to the base station but are housed in more rugged boxes, and
3. communications software. Mavric permits both two-way
messaging (host-to-remote or remote-to-remote) and bulk file
transfer.

  "Messaging," in the vocabulary of Metric, includes
interacting in real time with a host system as well as
transmitting text messages, says William Brown, president of
the Acton firm. It also includes completing fill-in-the-blank
forms and transmitting the contents of those forms to another
computer on the network.

  In addition to providing the basic package, Metric is
working with Boston Edison to develop the utility's
application. One part of the project is designing forms the
supervisor will use to transmit work orders at night. Working
on an 80386 personal computer, the supervisor will obtain
data on pending jobs from the utility's work management
system, which is used to schedule jobs and control equipment
inventory. Metric uses a 3270 terminal interface to connect
the PC to the IBM mainframe running the management system,
Brown says.

  Once the supervisor sets priorities and assigns jobs to
work crews, the Mavric system will automatically "dial" into
the laptop on each truck and download the appropriate work
order file. The form describing each job will consist of a
section in fixed format and one in free text, Brown says.

  Data will be transmitted over privately-licensed channels
in the 484 MHz-487 MHz range, says Dexter. In addition to
detailing the work to be done, the forms will outline the
materials needed. Once they have their assignments, crews
will stop in the parts room to stock their trucks before
heading out.

  Boston Edison chose to download the large work order files
at night to help minimize daytime data traffic on the
channels, which are used for voice as well, Dexter says.
Crews will also use the radios in the Mavric system in place
of their regular voice radios during the pilot. Voice mode
automatically overrides data whenever a user picks up the
radio's microphone and starts talking, Dexter says.

  Concern about boosting traffic on voice channels will keep
Boston Edison from considering mobile data for dispatching
workers for another operation -- customer service -- in the
near future, Dexter says. Users of wireless data networks
often report that traffic drops when they replace voice
communications with more spectrally-efficient digital
messages. But since the channels are licensed primarily for
voice, there's a limit to how much data the Federal
Communications Commission will allow the utility to transmit,
he says.

  Boston Edison might consider the technology for customer
service, however, after it switches its mobile communications
to an 800 MHz trunked network in 1993 or 1994, Dexter says.
In addition to Metric, the utility plans to investigate
vendors of mobile data systems that can operate on trunked
networks.

  The pilot with Metric is Boston Edison's first time out
with a mobile data network, Dexter says. The company had
investigated the possible use of conventional mobile data
terminals in the past but found they didn't have enough
storage to handle the volume of data it wanted to transmit.
Boston Edison hasn't worked with any of the established
utility system vendors -- such as TTI Technologies and Dowty
Control Technologies -- that can provide dispatching systems
based on intelligent mobile computers, he says.

  Although the pilot won't begin for a couple of weeks, the
vendor and customer already anticipate a second stage that
would allow Boston Edison to attach diagrams to work orders,
Brown says. Computerized graphics representing sections of
the electrical grid would be stored locally on the laptop.
When a supervisor entered a work order on the PC, the system
would determine what diagrams the line worker needed. Then it
would remotely check the laptop to make sure it contained
current versions of the necessary graphics.

  If the laptop needed an update, the PC (now linked to
computer-aided design workstations as well as to the
mainframe and mobile data network) would obtain the necessary
graphics and transmit them along with the text portion of the
work order, Brown says. The details of how this would operate
have not all been worked out.

  Metric plans to use its work with Boston Edison, and with
other early clients, to develop a variety of customizable
hardware and software packages that could be sold to other
organizations. The firm is concentrating primarily on the
utility and public safety markets.

  Qualcomm, Inc. in San Diego has filed a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
proposing an initial public offering of 3,500,000 shares of
common stock. The company plans to offer 2,800,000 shares in
the United States and 700,000 shares internationally. The
offerings will be managed by Lehman Brothers; Bear, Stearns &
Co. Inc. and Alex. Brown and Sons Inc.

  Separately, Qualcomm announced a version of its Qtracs
software for IBM and IBM-compatible mainframe computers.
Qualcomm introduced Qtracs for IBM AS/400, System/36 and
System/38 machines last year. With Qtracs, trucking company
dispatchers can use Qualcomm's Omnitracs system to view
vehicle locations and communicate with drivers on terminals
linked to their regular host computers, rather than on a
personal computer dedicated to Omnitracs.

GOVERNMENT TIES TELSTRA TO DIGITALISATION TIMETABLE

Communications minister Michael Lee released on 17 January
details of network development undertakings negotiated with
Telstra which commit the carrier to six monthly milestones leading to
full digitisation of the network by 30 June 2000. The government
made a commitment to negotiating this network development deed
in September 1994, as a result of issues raised by the Casualties of
Telstra cases.

It commits Telstra to having 73.9 percent of lines in urban areas and
63.9 percent of rural lines digital by 30 June 1996. The number of
rural lines served by old ARK exchanges is to be reduced to 3.4
percent by the same date.

Calling line identification is to be available on all exchanges by 30
June 1997. CLI availability in rural areas is currently 89.8 percent
and in urban areas almost 100 percent.

Carrier preselection and itemised billing are to be available to all
customers by 30 June 1997, in time for the new competition regime
on 1 July 1997. Preselection availability is already a requirement of
Telstra's licence but the new undertakings provide a timetable to its
achievement. Preselection and itemised billing is available to
almost all urban users and will be available to 89.4 percent of rural
customers by mid 1996.

Telstra's compliance with its undertakings will be monitored by the
Department of Communications and the Arts in conjunction with
Austel and details will be tabled in Parliament.

On 28 November the Democrats communications spokesperson,
Senator Vicki Bourne, asked Senator Bob Collins, minister
representing the minister for communications and the arts, when the
government expected to release this network development deed of
agreement and why it had been delayed for over a year. Collins
concluded a long and rather vague answer by saying that "a
number of complex issues and detailed considerations have
needed to be dealt with in developing the undertakings. This has
been taking place in a rapidly changing environment that Telstra is
operating in which does have consequences for its business
strategies". According to Bourne's office he promised the deed
would be released "next week (ie early December). However the
Hansard record had it as "next month".

TELSTRA'S DISTRIBUTOR AND TARIFF PLANS FALL FOUL OF
AUSTEL

Tariff changes announced by Telstra early in December which
would have made non-value adding resale of basic telephone
service unviable have been blocked by Austel pending a detailed
investigation.

On 1 December Telstra announced its intention to withdraw the
Multisite Plan 1 (MSP1) and Callsaver 3 (CS3) tariffs. These had
been designed for large corporate users but formed the backbone
of many simple resellers' businesses and Telstra claimed this was
not commercially sustainable. Value adding resellers were offered
revised Service Provider 1 (SP1) and Service Provider 2 (SP2)
tariffs which Telstra claimed did not disadvantage genuine value
adding resellers. Callsaver 4 (CS4) and Callsaver 8 (CS8) tariffs
were also restructured.

The announcement provoked a strong reaction from the Service
Providers Action Network (Span) which, at a strategy meeting on 11
December, set up a fighting fund with $1000 from each member and
formed four committees to pursue its case: at the ministerial level,
with Austel, with the carriers and with the ACCC and on legal
grounds.

Austel announced on 22 December its initial decisions on the
filings. SP1, SP2 and the Freecall Flexiplan were disallowed.
Corporate Virtual Private Network (CVPN), CS4 and CS8, Business
Saver Plus, Corporate Centre Local and Long Distance tariffs were
not disallowed but without prejudice to subsequent Austel reviews.

On 9 January Austel chairman Neil Tuckwell wrote to Span saying it
had conducted a preliminary investigation of the CS8 tariff and the
result suggested that CS8 may be anticompetitive. It requested
submissions from Span members by 16 January to help it finalise its
determination.

Austel diasallowed SP1 because it bundled local and long distance
calls for discount purposes in a way which was not subject to
competition. It also offered no additional discount on local calls to
the retail CS10 tariff even though the SP1 user was required to take
responsibility for billing and bad debts. Austel also noted that SP1
discriminated against switched service providers, the entities most
likely to become competing carriers after July 1997.

Austel also expressed concern at the bundling of national and
international long distance services, fixed to mobile, 1800, 13 and
calling card services under CS4 and CS8 and said it would
examine these bundlings pursuant to clause 238A of the
Telecommunications Act.

Austel has also made a number of comments and
recommendations to Telstra and said it would pursue these matters
with Telstra early in 1996.

These include:

- recommending to Telstra that it give service providers reasonable
time to make adjustments to their businesses needed as a result of
future tariff changes, and that it should not use the intervening
period to compete unfairly.

- encouraging Telstra to develop a range of service provider
products which meet government policy objectives and the
requirements of service providers.

- encouraging Telstra to consider a wide area egress product for
switched operators "since there appears to be no operational
restrictions to this".

Span chairman Brian Perkins, in a letter to members on 22
December described the decision as "a great Christmas present
thanks to Santa Austel".

DRAFT TELECOMMS LEGISLATION RELEASED

The Department of Communications and the Arts made good on its
promise to deliver a draft of the post 1997 telecommunications
legislation, releasing it on 20 December as the Telecommunications
Bill (1996) and the Trade Practices Amendment
(Telecommunications) Bill 1996. The issued 148 page document
comprises the draft bills and commentary on each of them.

The drafts were based on 99 post 1997 proposals released on 1
August (Exc August 4, 1995). A new policy proposal provides for a
further full review of all telecommunications regulation "to be
completed in time for implementation in 2000".

The government also announced plans for technical self regulation
of the industry and simultaneously released an additional 38
proposals setting out its policy intentions (see below).
Communications minister Michael Lee said the new policy would
"align (Australia) more closely with international approaches to
technical regulation of telecommunications".

Not all provisions of the initial 99 proposals have been dealt with in
the draft legislation. It concentrates on licencing of carriers, codes of
practice, anticompetitive conduct and the access regime, saying
these are "likely to be the areas of most concern to industry and
where the earliest prior notification to industry is required to enable
preparation for further competition and self regulation".

The new Telecommunications Bill will remove almost all barriers to
entry into all telecommunications services but will limit the market
power of the incumbents by instituting access codes under which
they will be obliged to make their networks available to competitors.

The name Austel will be retained as the abbreviation for the
Australian Telecommunications and Spectrum Management
Agency which will be formed by merging the present Austel and the
Spectrum Management Agency. The SMA's responsibilities for
administering the Radio Communications Act 1992 will be taken
over largely unchanged by the new Austel. Telecommunications
competition policy responsibility will be transferred to the ACCC.
The new Austel will be responsible for carrier licensing, codes of
practice, assisting carriers to fulfil universal service obligations and
for oversight of technical regulation.

The Trade Practices (Telecommunications) Amendments Bill
includes a new part XIC of the Trade Practices Act which will
replace Part 8 (access by carriers to networks and services of other
carriers) and other relevant provisions of the Telecommunications
Act 1991. It also sets out a new part XIB of the TPC replacing part 9
(supply of basic carriage services by carriers) of the
Telecommunications Act 1991 to govern anticompetitive carrier
conduct .

Carriers will be required to join the Telecommunications Access
Forum (TAF) which will be required to produce a code of conduct for
access to carriers' facilities and resolution of disputes. The ACCC
will have a reserve power to override the TAF code.

However the draft bill has not fully defined the term access,
because, according to the commentary "the concept of access
covers a diverse range of things (such as) access to land, to
physical infrastructure, computer systems, billing services and
information, directory assistance and databases. Submissions are
invited on whether the legislation should include a precise definition
of the term access.

Separate legislative provisions will apply to service providers and
carriers. Anyone will be able to become a service provider but may
be declared a carrier by the ACCC against criteria set out in the
telecommunications bill. Any service provider with substantial
control over customers through its own switches is likely to be
declared a carrier, even if it does not own any transmission
infrastructure.

A carrier will be required to give undertakings to provide access to
its services and facilities in accordance with codes and standards.

As expected, pivotal to the new act is the distinction between
service provider and carrier. Carrier status is something that service
providers are likely to avoid rather than seek because it confers
considerable responsibilities and few benefits. Commentary to the
draft bill details the distinctions and the decision making process in
some detail.

A service provider will be anyone who supplies what is known in the
present Act as a telecommunications service, but has been
renamed a 'carriage service', or who uses a carriage service to
supply an online entertainment of information service.

A carrier will be someone who controls access to a network, ie can
prevent service providers from using that component for the
purposes of providing services".

The legislation also introduces the concept of a person's 'immediate
circle' to exclude what have been traditionally private networks from
being assigned carrier status. The term 'immediate circle' includes
state and federal government bodies, employees of business and
corporations and corporations related to another corporation "within
the meaning of the Corporations Law".

There is also a three dimensional geographic test applied to
communications networks. A point, whether fixed or mobile, is on a
network within Australia if it is on Australian territory, or in the
atmosphere below the stratosphere. Any point on a satellite and
above the stratosphere is outside Australia. The stratosphere
extends only to a height of 50 kms so all points on planned low
earth orbit satellites would be outside Australia.

The draft bills are open for comment until 16 February 1996.

TELECOMMS INDUSTRY TO BE SELF REGULATING

The government has proposed a regime of industry self regulation
of the technical aspects of communications and has issued an
addition 38 policy proposals setting out the new regime.

The additional proposals seek to harmonise technical regulation of
radio communications and telecommunications and minimise
government control over technical regulation which will be
"primarily addressed through industry self regulation involving
affected groups including consumers".

Interconnect standards will be developed by carriers and service
providers in conjunction with the Telecommunications Access
Forum.

Customer equipment and cabling standards will be industry
developed but "taking into account Austel/SMA's views on health
and safety aspects and on matters concerning the integrity of
telecommunications networks".

Carriers and service providers will be required to report on their
quality of service and performance against a code of practice
developed by the industry and registered with Austel.

Responsibility for accrediting conformance testing laboratories will
be transferred from Austel to a competent accreditation body such
as the National Association of Testing Authorities (Nata).

However Austel/SMA will have a reserve power to mandate
standards where appropriate or where self regulation fails.

Standards will be required to be based on international and
regional standards unless this is inappropriate. Carriers and service
providers will be free to develop their own network standards but
these must be co-ordinated with interconnection, customer
equipment and cabling standards.

The controversial Telecommunications National Code under which
the existing carriers enjoy protection from state and local
government planning requirements will be reviewed and carriers
will cease to have power to override planning rules.

TELSTRA OFFERS RADICAL SOLUTION TO USO PROBLEM

In the height of the traditional media 'silly season' (between
Christmas and New Year), major papers carried stories of a radical
proposal by Telstra to revamp the universal service obligation
(USO) scheme.

Telstra's proposals were submitted in November to the House of
Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and
Public Administration which was conducting an enquiry into aspects
of the national competition policy reform package. The terms of
reference for the enquiry included the impact of these reforms on
the efficient delivery of community service obligations.

Telstra's preferred option was for a radical reform under which
forward looking multi year 'contracts' for the provision of USOs
would be negotiated between a USO carrier and the relevant
government contracting agency. "The agency should be able to call
for expressions of interest in particular services in specified
geographic areas or markets after considering supply options,
demand for service and other market conditions...If the expression
of interest process indicated alternative supply options a
competitive tendering process would follow to determine the cost of
the USO (this) should be preferred as the most transparent
mechanism and the best means of encouraging efficiency in
delivery".

Telstra suggests that it should remain the carrier of last resort and,
failing the emergence of viable alternatives as a result of the tender,
the agency would enter into direct negotiations to produce an
explicit contract for the provision of services. Telstra recommends
that USO continue to be funded by a levy on other carriers.

The story was short-lived. The following day, communications
minister Michael Lee, in a radio interview, committed the
government to the present USO policy. Opposition communications
spokesman Richard Alston, normally very quick to fire off a press
release critical of any pronouncement by Lee, was also silent. The
issue is sensitive with rural communities and neither side wants to
risk upsetting rural voters in the run up to an election.

However in addition to the radical reforms highlighted in press
coverage, Telstra's 50 page submission to the enquiry listed a
number of issues which it said would need to be resolved if the
government preferred minimal reforms to the USO scheme. These
included:

- That the system creates market distortions which impact on service
pricing and delivery and which could hinder development of
competitive markets.

- That the USO system does not foster improvements in delivery of
services to rural areas and "there is very little incentive for other
carriers to examine alternative means of providing the USO".

- That the USO system does not recognise all Telstra's costs, there
are not direct links between carrier investment decisions and the
USO system thus limiting incentives for carriers to invest in USOs.

- Because auditors will not sign off on the contentious USO cost
modelling process Austel is required to finalise the cost "in
effect...audit the unauditable".

- Payments of USO contributions to Telstra have been delayed
because the system does not lead to timely closure of the costing
process. Telstra says it is working with Austel to improve the costing
process, but also calls for a dispute resolution process to enable it
to receive payment from other carriers more promptly.

Telstra also proposes a mechanism for evolving the definition of
USO in line with the growth of new services in other markets. It
submits that a service should be subject to USO provisions only
after it has become "widely used and socially significant in a freely
operating competitive market".

Even where an extension to the USO is merited on this test Telstra
argues that there should also be a formal evaluation of the
alternative uses to which the community's resources might be put if
the USO changes did not proceed.

FOXTEL/AUSTRALIS MERGER UNDER ACCC SCRUTINY

Australis and Foxtel hoped to close 1995 with the way clear to
completing the merger announced in September. However delays
in preparing the documentation for the deal and, more importantly,
the close scrutiny to which it has been subjected by the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) leave the future of
the merger in the balance with legal action threatened if the ACCC
does veto it.

When the deal was announced the two companies said they
expected to put it to a meeting of Australis shareholders in
December and the ACCC had also initially indicated it would reach
a decision before Christmas.

A key factor in the ACCC's decision making process is whether it
decides that pay TV is a separate market or whether pay TV and
free-to-air TV should be considered as a single market. Optus
Vision has also argued that the merger would lessen competition in
the market for local telephony even though Telstra (50 percent
owner of Foxtel) has given no indication of plans to use the Foxtel
network for telephony and continues to cast doubts on Optus'
announced intention of offering telephony on its network in 1996
(Exc December1, 1995).

COUNCILS SCORE FIRST VICTORY AGAINST OPTUS CABLE
ROLLOUT

City councils opposing the installation of Optus Vision's cable TV
network from power poles in residential streets scored their first
victory with the Supreme Court in Victoria on 21 December granting
the council of Boroondara an injunction restraining Optus Vision
from further installations in the area until the case can be heard in
full.

Judge Barry Beach found that Optus had a serious case to answer
on possible breaches of the Telecommunications National Code
and also found that the exemptions granted by the
Telecommunications Act 1991 were so wide as to create
widespread uncertainty on their application. Council lawyers had
earlier argued that the code could even be used to exempt Optus
employees from road speed limits.

In NSW 16 councils are now participating in a joint action against
Optus Vision. Their application for an injunction will be heard on 12
March.

TELSTRA AND OPTUS TO LOSE PLANNING EXEMPTIONS

Telstra and Optus Communications will lose their exemptions from
state and local government planning regulations after July 1997. In
a statement issued on 20 December communications minister
Michael Lee said it would be wrong to allow an unlimited number of
telephone companies to be exempt from planning laws.

Austel's report on the Telecommunications National Code which
governs the carriers' conduct of their exempt operations was due to
be received by the minister at the end of 1995 and will be released
early in 1996.

The minister's statement gave no indication of any changes to the
code before July 1997 but with local government action against
Optus Vision's overhead cables starting to bite (see story above)
commentators have said that the minister should act sooner in order
to prevent Optus from being disadvantaged against Telstra's
unimpeded underground cable rollout programme.

Under the present legislation the planning exemption is conferred
by the Telecommunications Act 1991 with carriers required to
exercise their exemption in accordance with the National
Telecommunications Code. In the new legislation, clause 2207 of
the draft Telecommunications Bill 1996 ensures that all carriers will
have to fully comply with state and territory planning laws. It states
that "A power conferred by this Act must not be exercised in such a
way as to prevent the exercise of the powers or the performance of
the functions of government of a State, the Northern Territory, the
Australian Capital Territory or Norfolk Island".

This approach has also been criticisedby ATUG because it would
give local councils control over nationally important infrastructure.

JNA AND AUSDOC FORM MESSAGING JOINT VENTURE

Listed Australian companies JNA Telecommunications and Ausdoc
Pty Ltd have announced the formation of a joint venture company to
develop and deliver electronic messaging services. JNA will initially
take about 60 percent equity in the company which will be formed
from Ausdoc's recently established electronic messaging business
EDX.

The technical platform underpinning the EDX service was
developed by Ausdoc in conjunction with Digital Equipment
Corporation. According to EDX's chief executive Bob White, Ausdoc
has "an exclusive and perpetual licence to use the technology" with
Digital receiving royalties. JNA will merge the electronic messaging
resources of its Network Services division with EDX, to bring
"experience, products and technical strength" to the joint venture.

The two companies say they are looking for an additional investor
which could either be an institutional investor or value adding
partner. They aim to hold 40 percent equity each, with the new
partner taking 20 percent. Further down the track the two partners
say they plan to explore export markets for the service.

JNA became involved with Ausdoc initially by providing technical
and consulting services in Canberra. According to Ausdoc
managing director, Peter Reilly, the company identified a need for a
partner with expertise in electronic messaging which it lacked and
the joint venture evolved.

Ausdoc operates the DX document exchange service widely used
throughout the legal profession. It had $85 million sales in 1995 and
employs 780 staff and 250 contract owner drivers. It has two major
clients for its recently established EDX business: The South
Australian Courts Administration Authority and the Queensland
Government. The Queensland Government service is provided by
EDX under contract to Pacific Star Communications' subsidiary,
Sunnet Pty Ltd. It will link around 40,000 Government department
and agency users over the next three years via an X.400 backbone
linking existing mainframe and LAN based email systems. The
system is seen as critical to the success of EDX. It is estimated to
require about $2.5 million in capital funding before becoming
cashflow positive in 1996/97.

According to Reilly, EDX is able to offer a more focussed approach
to the electronic messaging needs of clients than competitors such
as AT&T and Telstra because large carriers lack the focus on
messaging which is only a small component of their business. The
company sees creation of communities of interest as a key to
success and aims to make services affordable and accessible for
small members of such communities, charging fixed usage fees
rather than per message charges and tailoring its service to the
specific needs of each community.

SPECTRUM NETWORKS ACQUIRES RESELLER, CONFIRMS
SWITCH PLANS

Spectrum Network Systems Ltd has announced plans to acquire,
subject to due diligence, the fixed network resale business of
Australian Wholesale Communications Pty Ltd (AWC), based in
Melbourne. Spectrum will pay approximately $1.5 million for AWC's
30,000 customers with total annual billings of $A50 million.

AWC will continue to act as Spectrum's exclusive agent for three
years and will provide Spectrum with administrative and
management services at a rate of approximately $130,000 per
month. According to Spectrum, AWC's customer base includes
"nine key trade organisations" and there are "further prospects for
significant billings and sales growth".

Spectrum also confirmed plans for the installation of its own
switched network "initially along the east coast of Australia".

The acquisition is likely to be only one of many which will rationalise
the service provider industry and in particular eliminate
organisations which add little value to the basic service. Spectrum
appears well placed to absorb these organisations because it has
installed a sophisticated billing system obtained from its strategic
partner in the US, the inter-exchange carrier Capital Network
Systems Inc (Exchange November 3, 1995). During December it
was promoting its billing service for other service providers with
large press advertisements.

EXPORT EFFORTS PUT STANILITE INTO THE RED

Listed telecommunications company Stanilite Pacific Limited
became the subject of takeover speculation at the end of the year in
the wake of reporting on 16 December that it was projecting a $11.7
million loss for the half year to 31 December 1995.

The company advised the Stock Exchange that it had revised down
its October 1995 prediction of $75 million first half revenues to $30
million, mostly as a result of delays in finalising export contracts in
North Asia, Europe, the Pacific and Middle East. Delays in issuing
licences in India have also delayed an anticipated $6.5 million in
revenue into the second half of this financial year. Difficulties in
Russia with telecommunications infrastructure have led to the loss
of an anticipated $10 million in follow on orders.

The company retrenched 86 'non-essential' staff in November (Exc
November 24, 1995) following a restructuring into three separate
divisions (Exc November 3, 1995). In spite of its problems Stanilite
says it will continue with its major R&D programmes and is pursuing
two R&D syndication projects. An $11.6 million rights issue to
shareholders made in November 1995 closed with all but 6.3
percent of the shares being taken up by existing shareholders.

COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES CLUSTER FOR SYNERGY

Ausindustry announced on 20 December its support for a coalition
of Australian communications manufacturers formed to exploit
synergies between them. Communications Cluster of Australia Pty
Ltd (CCA) is a joint venture comprising Mitec, Stanilite, Scitec, TCG
Computer Aided Engineering Pty Ltd and Techcom Ltd.

The company has been in operation informally for three years but
with assistance from Ausindustry network broker Anthony Jarrett,
managing director of Mitchellsearch, has increased the scope of its
operations.

Jarrett said a marketing plan had been developed to promote the
cluster as "a single source, diverse capability one stop shop for
large and small customers, here and overseas...Indications from
their informal networking in the past suggest that CCA can produce
growth for each of its members beyond their individual capabilities".

Associated organisations include: Telstra, the TCG Group, the
Radiophysics Division of the CSIRO, Swiss Banking Corporation, R
Barel and Associates (accountants) and Creative Planning Centre
Pty Ltd (business planners).

In December, Exchange reported plans to form another
communications industry network under Ausindustry auspices.
Details of the network, Baltel are to be announced later this year
(Exc December 15, 1995).

WA DEMANDS MOBILE NUMBER PORTABILITY

According to a report in the West Australian last month (19
December) the West Australian government has specified that
number portability between carriers for mobile services will be
mandatory. The government has called tenders for provision of
mobile services through its telecommunications manager,
Commswest.

Austel said last year, in its report on number portability, that it was
committed to having portability available for digital mobile, 1800, 13
and 1300, 1900, 1901 and 1902 numbers by July 1997 (Exc July
28, 1995) but statements made by communications minister Michael
Lee in answer to Parliamentary questions later in the year did not
confirm this commitment (Exc December 8, 1995).

* In the UK the telecommunications industry has welcomed a report
by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission which says that
number portability is necessary for a competitive telephone market
and that BT and other operators should split the cost 70/30.
According to Telecomeuropa's Communications Newsletter, BT had
earlier rejected an Oftel ruling that it should bear the full cost of
implementing portability. According to TCN, BT has been
conducting portability trials since mid 1995 and has reduced cost
estimates for introducing portability as a result. BT says other
operators should be able to offer portability to new customers from
early 1996.

TELSTRA TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE INDIAN INVESTMENT
STRATEGY

Telstra is among foreign telecommunication companies which have
decided to alter their investment strategy in India following the
debacle over the awarding of licences to run basic services in 20
regional telecommunication circles.

On 1 January Telstra, along with significant industry players such as
AT&T and US West, failed to re-submit bids for basic service
licences. Only six consortia submitted bids for licences in five
circles. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had earlier
re-opened the tender for 13 licences following the notification of
minimum bids prices.

Telstra spokesman Paul Rea, told Exchange that although India
remains a priority area for investment, DoT's minimum price of
$A3.2 billion for the Tamil Nadu circle was too much. Also, the
present uncertainties discouraged a resubmission for a basic
services licence. Rea said that "Telstra was not prepared to seek the
licence at any price". So instead Telstra would pursue alternative
investment strategies.

Telstra's alternative strategies include joining other international
carriers, with majority Indian partners, in managing basic regional
telecommunication services. Rea confirmed that Telstra has been
approached by foreign telcos to join them in partnerships; he was
not prepared to say which companies. Rea did point out that Telstra
has appointed a senior executive, Dr Sanjay Modak, to head up its
New Delhi office. Modak's appointment indicates that Telstra
considers India one of its most important overseas investment
areas, according to Rea.

Other investment strategies open to Telstra include building its
technology transfer relationship with India's centre for
telecommunications research, C-Dot, and focusing more on cellular
services.

The uncertainties referred to by Rea include the threat to cancel
government awarded licences by India's largest opposition party,
the Bharatiaya Janata Party which - not withstanding the 17 January
arrest of its parliamentary leader on corruption charges - has been
widely tipped to win April general elections, and eight separate
Supreme Court petitions which seek to invalidate the DoT's
authority to award licences. The petitions relate to the failure of the
Congress government to establish a telecommunications regulatory
body before opening the telecommunications sector to foreign
investment.

Meanwhile, Telstra looks set to replace the US' Vanguard Cellular
as an equity partner to Modicom Networks Ltd to run cellular
services in Karnataka and Punjab. The proposal comes after DoT
announced on 12 December that it had awarded 18 licences to run
cellular services in regional areas. If Modicom's proposal is
accepted it will likely encourage other Indian-led consortia to swap
foreign partners in equity arrangements for both cellular and basic
service licences.

OPTUS SHAREHOLDERS TIP IN ANOTHER $200 MILLION

Optus Communications announced on 15 December 1995 that it
had completed a $200 million rights issue to its shareholders.
Bellsouth, Cable and Wireless and Optus Pty Ltd in proportion to
their existing shareholdings of 24.5, 24.5 and 52.1 percent.
Shareholding in Optus Pty Ltd remains unchanged at Mayne
Nickless (49 percent), AMP Society (20 percent) AIDC and other
institutions (19 percent) and National Mutual (12 percent).

The rights issue brings total shareholder equity and loan
contributions to in excess of $2 billion. An attempt to raise $800
million from shareholder equity earlier in the year was rejected by
shareholders.

Optus had planned to disband Optus Pty Ltd in 1994 and make its
shareholders direct shareholders in Optus Communications when
the Nine Network was to take a stake in the company. It announced
in November 1994 that it had been given a Tax Office ruling to be
able to do so without shareholders incurring capital gains tax, but
this latest announcement shows that the move was never made.

TELECOM NZ PAY TV PLAN STYMIED BY LEGAL ACTION

The battle between New Zealand carriers Clear Communications
and Telecom New Zealand over pay TV escalated in late December
when Clear successfully gained an injunction preventing Telecom
New Zealand from proceeding on plans to conclude a pay TV
programming agreement with Sky Television.

Telecom NZ is planning to wire 6000 homes in the country's two
largest cities, Auckland and Wellington to deliver pay TV and
broadband services and has tried to gain programming through the
agreement with Sky. Clear had earlier challenged Telecom NZ's
plan to acquire the 25 percent of Sky shares held by its own major
shareholders, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech. Clear argued that such
an acquisition would create a dominant player in the telephony and
pay TV industries. Clear has not indicated any intention to enter the
pay TV or local loop telephony markets.

Clear lawyers were granted access to the confidential programming
agreement and claimed that it constituted a serious breach of the
country's fair trading legislation, the Commerce Act.

The injunction preventing the agreement proceeding until a further
hearing was granted on 21 December. Telecom NZ says it will
defend the action. Its share acquisition plan is dependent on the
programme sharing agreement, and so has also been put on hold.

ABA RELEASES ISSUES PAPER, INVITES COMMENT ON
ONLINE SERVICES

The Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) released on 22
December an issues paper as part of its enquiry into content and
conduct of online information services. The ABA was instructed in
August 1995 by the minister for communications and the arts
Michael Lee to "explore strategies to encourage online service
providers and users to meet community needs, including the
development of codes, options for complaints handling, educational
programmes, devices for blocking and filtering certain material and
offence provisions" (Exc August 18. 1995). The 50 page paper
summarises community concerns garnered as a result of
consultative meetings with industry, government and community
organisations.

The ABA says that its consultative process revealed concerns far
more wide ranging than those about adult material and
pornography which have received widespread media coverage.
They included:

- the potential to widely disseminate material that vilifies people on
the basis of race, gender, sexual preference or disability;

- the intrusion of online services into people's privacy,

- the improper use or disclosure of personal information;

- the potential for defamatory material to be widely disseminated;

- the potential for infringement of intellectual property rights;

- the need to ensure that consumer interests are adequately
protected;

- the need to promote a better understanding of gender issues and
gender equality in the on-line environment;

- the need to ensure that Australian content is available and
promoted in an online environment to the same extent that it is in
other media.

The Office of Film and Literature Classification also undertook for
the ABA 27 hours of research searching the Internet for material that
would, in other forms, be restricted by its classification scheme. It
found such material to be less widely and easily available than has
been suggested by recent press coverage of the Internet.

Even after a seven hour search the OFLC was unable to find
material for downloading which would have been covered the
OFLC's category 1 and category 2 classifications governing
depictions of sex and violence in publications.

A copy of the issues paper (approximately 100kb) is available from
http://www.dca.gov.au/aba/hpcov.htm. Deadline for submissions is
16 February.

APRIL LAUNCH FOR TELECOM NZ INTERNET SERVICE

Telecom New Zealand is understood to have set April for the launch
of its Internet service. That service will also see Telecom NZ
become an Internet service access provider and it is also working
on content provision.

Telecom NZ is understood to be primarily targeting the business
market where it believes it can make money. It will try to lure
business customers by offering value added content such as news
services. It also believes that it has a unique differentiator in that
customers can be billed for Internet services on their Telecom
accounts.

Telecom NZ will also offer an access service to the consumer
market but believes the pay-off will take much longer.

The company is buying at least a dozen servers from Silicon
Graphics and is understood to have done a deal with Netscape so
that it can offer a customised version of the Netscape Internet
software.

Reports vary as to how much Telecom NZ is spending on the project
but $NZ50 million is seen by many observers as accurate. It is
understood that more effort is going into this project than into pay TV
moves.

This month Telecom NZ is taking over management of Waikato
University Internet gateway which connects to the USA via links
supplied by AT&T and Sprint. Clear Communications is also
offering services to domestic access providers through a BT link.
Clear will also offer separate frame relay links direct to MCI in the
USA. Adrienne Perry

ASTEC FORECASTS THE FUTURE OF THE CUSTOMER
ACCESS NETWORK

The Australian Science and Technology Council (Astec) has
released a customer access network foresighting study Surf's up:
alternative futures for full service networks in Australia. The study
was undertaken by Astec in conjunction with the Australian National
Training Authority and the Australian Photonics Cooperative
Research Centre.

The term full service network (FSN) is one that has only recently
entered the industry vocabulary. The report defines the FSN as the
successor of today's telecommunications customer access network
which will "integrate entertainment and switched communications
each with multimedia capabilities based on digital technologies. It is
only one component of the future network.

The 70 page report identifies "plausible alternative paths of network
development and the specific science and technology requirements
for such development. It looks at a time horizon up to 2010.

The report sees government initiatives as the major factor in
producing the favourable development of future broadband
networks and services and it makes 10 recommendations almost all
of which call for government action: to facilitate standards
development, market acceptance, lead the way in usage of new
services, commission further study into industry, security and access
issues, continue Astec's foresighting work and generally plan for the
growth of future services.

The report discusses at some length the most suitable technologies
for implementing the FSN. These include: hybrid fibre coax, fibre to
the home, fibre to the curb and ADSL. It lists a number of critical
variables that will affect the deployment of FSNs and attempts to
assess their relative degree of importance and uncertainty. Ranking
highest on both counts are the issues of consumer value and
consumer trust. Industry structure and human interface factors also
rank highly.

The report explores four scenarios:

- Widespread takeup of broadband and narrowband interactive
services by business and industry, but much lower penetration in
the residential sector.

- Widespread takeup by all sectors of the community, leading to
"significant changes in social behaviour, ways of doing business
and attitudes to use of computers".

- Slow take up in all sectors with conflict and confusion about a
multitude of standards and services.

- a disaster scenario in which a series of difficulties prevent the
rollout of a widespread full service network.

STANDARDS' DIGITAL VIDEO REPORT RELEASED

The Digital Video Services Task Group (DVSTG) set up jointly by
Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand to investigate and
recommend on standards development strategies needed for the
delivery of open access digital video services has released its final
recommendations

An earlier draft of the report caused considerable controversy
because it identified a clear need for standards in consumer
equipment for use on future broadband services and called on the
Government to mandate standards "where clear community benefit
is identified" (Exc June 30, 1995). At the time Standards Australia
played down the force of the recommendations saying the
document was only an interim for-comment draft directed at industry
and any 'recommendations' would not have such status until
comments have been received and a final report produced.

The final document, Strategies for the Development of Standards
for Digital Video and Associated Services identifies standards
urgently needed "to ensure that (pay TV) and future services can be
harmoniously introduced". It lists these most critical of these, in
order of importance as:

(1) Standards for customer access interfaces for both broadcast and
interactive digital video services with priority given to hybrid fibre
coaxial cables and satellite, MDS and digital terrestrial delivery.

(2) A standard for baseband analogue video/audio connection to
television receivers, consistent with international standards.

(3) Standards for baseband digital interfaces. These would apply to
digital televisions, multimedia personal computers with plug in
MPEG-2 decoders and digital video recorders. A digital interface
standard for remote control units with optional one-way control, or
two way interactive communications is also required.

The report recommends that all standards be based on an agreed
international digital video and associated services reference model
and it notes that the model developed by the task group maps
closely to that produced by the Digital Audio Visual Council which
was not finalised and not available to the group at the time it
developed the model.

Other recommendations of the report are:

- for a common scrambling algorithm

- a standard application programming interface

- a single customer identification addressing scheme, irrespective of
the service provider

- all existing Australian and New Zealand standards bodies,
technical committees and fora continue with their primary
standardisation and specification efforts under the unified co-
ordination of a single standards body with wide industry
representation.

Copies of the report, catalogue number SAA/SNZMP74-1996 can
be obtained from Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand
sales offices.

US OPENS THE DOOR TO MAJOR TELECOMMS REFORMS

Under a compromise deal brokered by US president Bill Clinton,
the House-Senate conference committee has agreed to deregulate
the US telecommunications sector agreeing to Democrats'
demands that industry concentration is countered.

Despite Republican claims that the proposed deregulation bill does
not go far enough, the legislation will see sweeping reforms that will
essentially end government barriers to the tie-up between long-
distance telephony, local telephony and cable television.

Analysts predict a series of mergers as the US telecommunications
industry becomes free to offer seamless information services. Nynex
and Bell Atlantic are already said to be discussing merger plans in
preparation for the deregulation.

Republicans accepted limits on the size of broadcasting companies,
but insisted on provisioning to slow the elimination of cable TV price
controls and make it more difficult for Baby Bells to enter long
distance enterprises. Price controls on cable TV companies will
remain only to 1999 and will end sooner if a competitor enters a
market.

In towns with fewer than 50,000 inhabitants, cable TV operators can
immediately raise rates.

Nynex will be especially favoured in the new laws and Bell Atlantic
and Pacific Telesis will do well because those closest to meeting
tougher requirements to get into long distance will have
advantages. The broadcasters, and especially News Corp will not
be happy. A single TV company will be allowed to reach 35 percent
of the US population but the FCC can cancel waivers letting Fox
Broadcasting go beyond 35 percent.

Rules forbidding a TV broadcaster owning a local newspaper or a
second station in one market still are on the books and the FCC still
will be overseeing Baby Bells (with input from the Justice
Department) as they seek to go into long-distance telephony
services

* The Federal Communications Commission said that the partial
government shutdown and bad weather along much of the US east
coast this week had forced the agency to postpone its 18 January
open meeting. The FCC has tentatively set 31 January as the new
meeting date to discuss president Bill Clinton's brokered changes to
the 1934 Communications Act.

HARVEY PARKER LEAVES TELSTRA

In a surprise move Harvey Parker, one of Telstra's most senior
executives, left at the end of 1995 to head United Energy,
Australia's first privatised electricity company. Parker joined Telstra
three years ago from a position as head of New Zealand Post. Less
than two months ago he was appointed to a new position as
general manager Retail Products Group with responsibility for all
products and services sold to end users whether corporate or
residential.

Parker had been tipped as a successor to Telstra CEO Frank Blount
but Blount recently signed a second three year contract and Telstra
insiders have suggested that the lure of a chief executive's role
prompted Parker's departure. (5/1/96)

NEW COO FOR OPTUS

Phil Jacobs, formerly president of Bellsouth Business Systems has
replaced Ian Boatman as chief operating officer of Optus
Communications. Boatman, who has been with Optus since its
foundation will return to Cable and Wireless in the UK early in 1996.
Bellsouth Business Systems is the arm of Bellsouth which serves
large business customers: a sector of the market which many in the
industry believe Optus has seriously neglected. (17/12/95).

ICO has also appointed Ms Millie Banerjee as vice president for
programme management. She was formerly with BT where she
held responsibility for a major restructuring of the company's billing
system. (8/1/96).

SEARCH FOR OPTUS CEO CONTINUES

There was speculation just before Christmas that Optus
Communications would appoint a senior Australian
telecommunications executive who had recently returned to
Australia as its new CEO. A prime candidate surfaced in Greg Crew,
a former Telstra executive recently returned to Australia after 12
years with C&W including chief operating officer of Mercury and
managing director of Hongkong Telephone. Asked in an interview
in Australian Communications if he would be interested in the chief
executive position at Optus he replied: It would be very interesting to
contemplate but no-one has made an offer"..

CORRECTION

Last month (Exc December 8, 1995) we reported a trial of a user-
pays paging service being carried out by Link Telecommunications
using a 1900 number to collect messages and revenue from callers.
Link has asked us to point out that callers to this service hear the
standard preamble which is required by Austel in accordance with
TISSC guidelines.

NEWS BRIEFS

* Prices for international telephone calls continue to fall with
Worldxchange announcing cuts on 8 January, in response to
Telstra's cuts announced on 1 December which come into effect on
1 February. Optus is also expected to announce substantial price
cuts before the end of January. Worldxchange, which has a flat rate
24 hours per day, now offers discounts of up to 50 percent on
Telstra's peak STD rate to the UK, USA and Japan, 41.5 percent to
Taiwan and Switzerland and 37.5 percent to Germany. Figures are
based on a call of less than three minutes. The company has
announced an additional special discount to Asian countries during
Ramadan (1-20 February) and Chinese New Year (18-28
February).

* Austel has released a for-comment draft of its technical standard
on end-to-end network performance (TS27). The standard will
ensure that all public and private telecommunications networks
carrying public traffic within Australia can support text, telephone,
fax and popular dial up modem applications at data rates up to
2400 bits/sec. It also specifies performance of low to medium rate
data applications such as telephone typewriters for the hearing
impaired. The standard was first issued in June 1994, but
addressed only performance standards for voice calls. Comments
are required by 28 February 1996. Copies of the draft can be
obtained from Standards Australia sales offices. (14/12/95)

* Plans to hold the first International Telecommunications Users
Group conference and exhibition in Asia, in Shanghai in 1996, have
fallen through. The exhibition and conference was to have been
organised on Intug's behalf by Total Concept Exhibitions of Sydney.
Total Concept wrote to interested parties at the end of November
1995 saying that the planned location in Shanghai would be
unavailable in time. Peter Braun of TCE told Exchange this week
that the company was now looking to work with the Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade to participate in the New Horizons event
in New Delhi in November and was looking to have the conference
sponsored by the Asia Oceania Electronic Messaging Association
instead of Intug.

* Austel's Technical Standard 002 has been altered to require all
incoming voice calls on a PABX to be either answered by a
recorded voice announcement, or else not connected. The
amendment follows a consumer complaint which found callers have
been charged for dialling an engaged signal on PABXs (12/95).

* A voluntary standard to inform consumers about the government's
policy on the phaseout of analogue mobile services by 1 January
2000 has been agreed by Austel and mobile telephone industry
representatives. Austel member, Sue Harlow, said that Austel would
monitor the effectiveness of the voluntary standard and would
consider mandatory standards if it is not successful. (11/1/96)

* Telecommunications reseller First Netcomm Pty Ltd has been
instructed by the ACCC to make refunds to customers because it
had given them misleading advice about the savings they would
make if they transferred their telephone service to First Netcomm.
The company was using multilevel marketing techniques to sell its
services and the ACCC also found that it had mislead its distributors
about the amount of income they could earn. They were told they
could earn up to $20,000 per month but "by the end of October
1995, the most that had been made by any distributor in one month
was $411".

* Austel has released a for-comment draft of a technical standard
(TS29) covering telecommunications charging and billing. It sets
minimum performance levels for both carrier and service provider
billing systems and "is intended to provide a framework for
monitoring the quality of those systems. For digital networks using
software billing it proposes maximum errors of no more than 22
calls in 100,000 to be charged incorrectly and no more than one
charge for an unmade call for every 200,000 calls. Errors in call
duration are limited to six in 100,000 calls. Submissions are due by
28 February. Copies of the draft can be obtained from Standards
Australia sales offices. (20/12/95)

* Telstra has awarded a major contract to Boston Technology of the
US to supply messaging systems for the GSM and analogue mobile
networks. Boston said it would supply "numerous" Access TP
network services platforms to Mobilenet to support a range of
services for Messagebank customers including call answering,
voice messaging, fax messaging, short message service and
paging alert. "Additional enhanced services will be offered via these
platforms in the future", according to Boston. Telstra will retain its
supply agreements with other vendors.

* In the National Business Bulletin's 1995 Corporate Image Survey
Ericsson improved its ranking in the telecommunications and
telephone systems categories. It came in third in the
telecommunications and telephone systems categories after Telstra
and Optus and ahead of NEC (4) and Vodafone (5). Alcatel fell from
sixth to tenth position. In telephone systems Ericsson pushed NEC
into third position coming in second after Telstra. However it failed
to make the top 10 in mobile phones, where the top five ranking
from one to five was: Motorola, NEC, Nokia, Telstra and Optus.
Nokia, the magazine reported, was the big surprise rising from fifth
position and pushing Telstra and Optus down.

* Inmarsat has appointed UK advertising agency Publicis as its
global advertising agency charged with establishing Inmarsat as a
brand among target audiences internationally. The head of Publicis'
international division, Joanna Baldwin, described the project as
"converting one of the world's best kept secrets into a global brand".

* The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)
has released a guide to Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act, which
covers access to essential services. "Part IIIA introduces a new field
of regulatory responsibilities and access rights which will have
significant impact on the provision of services that are critical to
competition in related areas", according to ACCC chairman, Allan
Fels. Phone (06) 264 2808 for details (19/12/95).

* Low-orbit communications satellites will be launched from
Woomera in South Australia within 18 months after an agreement
between STC Complex of Russia and the engineering division of
the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC), according to Senator
Chris Schacht. Schacht said on 13 January that ASC had signed a
letter of intent with STC Complex to set down a business plan for a
commercial Australian space launch service in which ASC
Engineering will manufacture satellite launch support equipment
and provide project management and systems integration with the
Russian company supplying the START family launch vehicles.
STC Complex was established by the Moscow Institute of Heat
Technology, the company which developed three generations of
Russian mobile rockets.

* Vodafone claims that it now offers the world's largest global
roaming network with 38 participating countries, including 18
countries with automatic global roaming facilities. Vodafone's
managing director, John Rohan, said that New Zealand was the
latest addition to the global network and that several more countries
would be added to the network during 1996. (12/1/96)

* Vodac and Apple Computer have released an integrated package
for mobile access to office databases and the Internet. The Vodac
Data Solution ties Apple's Newton Messagepad 120 GSM
connectivity to Vodafone's mobile digital network using a Nokia
2110 mobile phone, a Nokia cellular data card, Winfax Pro 4.0
communications software and a PCMCIA slot for a portable
computer. (9/1/96)

* Datacraft Ltd's Latin American subsidiary has received $7 million
worth of orders from Columbia, Mexico and Brazil in the first half of
the current fiscal year, according to George Kepper, executive chair
of Datacraft Ltd. Kepper said that major projects which Datacraft is
now supplying include a national paging network in Mexico, high-
speed network access and switching systems for two
telecommunication companies in Brazil and supply contracts to
Telecom Columbia. (8/1/96)

* Link Telecommunications and the South Australian Economic
Development Authority have jointly announced plans for Link's fifth
call centre. The Adelaide centre will employ 400 people and is
expected to handle over 12 million calls in its first year, according to
Terry Winters, the managing director of Link. Winters said that Link's
messaging business is currently growing at 35 percent per year and
that during 1995 the company handled around 50 million calls and
a further 20 million from direct access clients.

* New standards for the global information highway have been
approved by the ITU. A revised text of Recommendation G.707,
which includes G.708 and G.709 has been approved at the study
group level. Recommendations include setting standards for:
transport networks, including bit-rates, frame structure for SDH
networks and network management; audiovisual systems, including
protocols and coding for visual telephony; and for ATM equipment.
(5/1/96)

* The Telecommunications Development Advisory Board (TDAB) of
the ITU has called for clear strategies to attract more partners to the
development activities of the telecommunications sector and the
development of a strategy for the application of interactive television
in developing countries. The Director of the Telecommunications
Development Bureau, Ahmed Laouyane, told a December meeting
of the TDAB that strategic partnership and mobilisation of resources
were crucial to the success of the telecommunications sector.
(5/1/96)

* Mobile service provider Digicall Group claims a 75 percent rise in
subscriber numbers in the December quarter to more than 61,000,
from about 35,000 in the previous three months. This is an increase
of over 26,000 for the three month period, compared to just 2,956
net additions for the same quarter last year, or 16,000 net additions
for 1995. However, billing revenues grew by only 62 percent over
the final quarter to $9.7 million. Digicall's profit before interest, tax,
depreciation, amortisation and exceptionals increased by 200
percent on the previous quarter to $1.32 million. Digicall opened 30
shops during December and plans to open another 15 early in
1996.

* Telstra and Bay Networks Australia have signed an enhanced
distribution channel (EDC) partnership which will provide a joint
commercial venture for a tightly-integrated set of products and
services to specific vertical markets, according to Steve Wood,
regional director for Bay Networks. Under the EDC Bay Networks
will provide products for Telstra's networking and data services,
WAN and remote access. (8/1/96)

* Advance Bank has claimed an Australian first by offering its
customers access to their accounts through the Internet. All
customer information is encrypted for transmission in both directions
using Techway locally built software. In November Exchange
foreshadowed that Web Australia, a division of Techway, would
soon announce the first customer for its Catalogue Server using
RSA and IDEA v2.2 software (Exc November 24, 1995).

* The Telecommunications Ombudsman, John Pinnock, has
announced the resolution of another casualty of Telstra (COT)
claimant's case. However, because the COT arbitration cases are
confidential Pinnock did not release further details. (23/12/95)

FROM 281 TO FOUR PAGES, FCC REPORT DIGESTS NEW TELECOM BILL

The differences of House- and Senate-passed telecom legislation
have been reconciled by a House-Senate conference committee into
a compromise bill - a "conference report" - that largely hews to
the House version of the bill, but incorporates Senate language
on such key issues as universal service. The report still only
is being circulated on Capitol Hill and among key lobbyists, but
a copy of the 281-page measure obtained by FCC Report shows it
is full-scale legislation, ready to be passed by each chamber -
if key leaders give their go-ahead.  But while the legislation
looks like the stuff of future law, will anyone but lawyers be
able to read it?  FCC Report offers this condensed version.

TITLE I:  Telecommunication Services

In Part II, "The Development of Competitive Markets," the bill
gets down to the nitty-gritty, detailing the interconnection and
universal service requirements and eliminating federal and state
barriers to local-market entry.  This section includes the
checklist of services that all telcos, except some rural ones,
must make available to competitors.  They must offer
interconnection and unbundled access to network elements "at any
technically feasible point within the carrier's network" and on
"just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory" terms.  They must also
provide nondiscriminatory resale, number portability, dialing
parity, access to their right of way and reciprocal compensation
arrangements.

Regarding resale, the bill requires all services the telco
retails to also be offered at wholesale, but lets state
regulators ban competitors from reselling a telco's local
services to business customers if the regulators choose.  The
telco must also offer the competitor on-site colocation unless
the state regulators allow the telco to provide virtual, or
offsite, colocation.

The FCC is given six months to write these rules.  It also gets
to preempt state rules if those rules violate the bill's local
competition requirements.

The states, meanwhile, are allowed to set their own rules,
provided they do not "substantially prevent implementation" of
this part of the bill.  They also can issue exemptions to small
telcos (those with less than 2 percent of the nation's access
lines) if compliance with a part of the law would be "unduly
economically burdensome" or not technically feasible.  (But
rural cable TV operators offering telephony don't qualify for
this.)

States also get to review interconnection agreements - they can
reject them if they violate the public interest, among other
grounds - and they must act within 90 days or the agreement goes
into effect.  The bill also lets the FCC step in and take charge
of any proceeding if it is advised or otherwise learns that the
state is not carrying out its job under the new law.

States also get to review the terms and conditions offered by
their Bell company - they must act on the tariff in 60 days -
and they get to set the wholesale rates for a telco's telecom
services.  The bill defines "wholesale" as the retail rate,
minus the telco's "avoidable" costs such as billing, marketing,
collection.  (This resolves a long-standing dispute over what
terms should govern resale.)

All negotiations with competitors must be in good faith and the
resulting agreements, with prices, are to be submitted to state
regulators, who also can be called on to mediate negotiations.

If they don't get an agreement 135 days after their request, a
competitors may call on state regulators to impose compulsory
arbitration on the telco.  The state can then set the rates and
implementation schedule for a telco to provide the requested
service.  But, in setting those rates, the state cannot use
rate-of-return regulation and "may include a reasonable profit."
Charges for transport and termination of traffic must allow each
carrier to recover its costs.

The opposite side of the coin, for state regulators, is that
they must remove all barriers to entry to both the interstate
and intrastate telecom markets.  But they still get to impose
their own universal service and public safety requirements and
they and local governments get to manage their rights of way,
provided they don't discriminate among carriers.

On universal service, the bill requires all carriers to
contribute to universal service, but only allows eligible
carriers - common carriers selected by their state - to withdraw
from that fund.  Otherwise, it follows the route taken on that
topic by the House legislation by giving the job of setting the
universal service rules to a federal-state board.  The board and
the FCC, which will implement those rules, will act under a set
of principles, including a mission to ensure that comparable
rates and services are available in urban and rural areas.  The
definition of universal service can be expanded by the FCC, the
bill says.

On the other hand, the bill also requires that discounted
service be offered to  public elementary and secondary schools
and to libraries.  The FCC will set the discount.  Rural health
care providers - medical schools, county health departments -
also cannot be charged more for service than their urban
counterparts.

Unlike resale, sharing allows a telco, typically a smaller one,
to rely on the facilities of the larger telco, say a specialized
switch, to offer services in the small telco's own region. Thus,
the bill says qualifying carriers "lack economies of scale or
scope" but also says telco A cannot require telco B to share
facilities if telco A will use them in telco B's territory; a
different section of the bill governs local competition.

The bill also lets the nation's 14 utility companies that are
regulated by a 1935 federal law provide telecom services, but
requires those companies to first apply to the FCC and to abide
by several rules.  For instance, the parent company may not sell
its facilities to its telecom subsidiary without state approval
and the subsidiary may neither offer its own stock or bonds.
Even the parent company cannot mortgage its operation to finance
its telecom operation.  And the parent must file reports with
the FCC concerning its capitalization of its telecom venture and
states may audit the books of the subsidiary or the parent.

Part III, "Special Provisions Concerning Bell Operating
Companies," gives the particulars on the incentive - entry into
new markets - that the bill offers the Bells in return for
opening their networks.  The bill lets a Bell into out-of-region
long-distance immediately and lets a Bell company immediately
apply to the FCC to offer in-region long-distance.  It also lets
a Bell offer "incidental" long-distance immediately, meaning the
use of long-distance to carry its video or alarm monitoring
traffic or cellular calls.

The FCC, which must act within 90 days, will grant permission on
a state-by-state basis after reviewing the application and
consulting with the Department of Justice (DOJ).  The FCC must
give "substantial weight" to the DOJ's view, but that view need
not preclude the FCC from reaching a differing decision. Once
the FCC gives its OK on long-distance, that Bell is also
automatically allowed to enter the once-proscribed business of
manufacturing network and customer premises equipment.

If the Bell violates the terms of its approval to enter long-
distance, the FCC can also revoke its approval or impose fines.

To win FCC approval, the Bell company must meet the bill's
special checklist of open access conditions and have in each
state a local competitor that is predominately facilities-based.
The list requires interconnection be made available and that the
Bell offer nondiscriminatory access to poles, ducts and right-
of-way elements.  It also must offer these items on an unbundled
basis:

*  local loop transmission from central offices to customer
premises,

*  local transport from the trunk side of the switch and

*  local switching.

The Bell must be willing to resell its services, provide
reciprocal compensation and offer competitors access to "911"
and "E911" services, directory assistance, operator call
completion service, White pages listings of its competitor's
customers, interim number portability (via call forwarding), and
full number portability (when the FCC issues the rules ).

If the Bell has submitted its terms and conditions to a state
and gotten no takers after 10 months, or gotten a taker who
negotiated in bad faith, a Bell can "self certify" compliance
for that state.

A Bell also is required to offer dialing parity, but not for
three years, unless it enters long-distance or is in a state
that is all of one LATA or has required that service as of Dec.
19, 1995.

Hewing to the Senate bill's language, a Bell in long-distance or
manufacturing must house those businesses in separate
subsidiaries involving separate books and offices and a federal-
state audit every two years.  But, taking the language of the
House bill, the bill lets a Bell eliminate these separate
subsidiaries three years after it it wins entry into the long-
distance business.

On manufacturing, the bill requires each Bell company to
maintain a separate manufacturing subsidiary that does not
discriminate in favor of its parent.  Nor can the parent
discriminate in favor of that affiliate in terms of certifying
equipment for network use or by giving it information on its
competitors that the competitors haven't allowed.

When buying equipment, a Bell cannot discriminate in favor of
its manufacturing unit and must consider other makers' hardware
as well.

The Bell also must file with the FCC full information on the
protocols and technical requirements of its network and to keep
that information up to date.  The Bell also must keep
interconnected competitors posted on changes the Bell plans to
its network.  As for Bellcore, the Bell's research operation, it
continues to be banned from manufacturing until it is no longer
affiliated with more than one Bell company.

On electronic publishing by the Bells, the bill again requires a
separate subsidiary, one that can hold no property in common
with its parent nor use the parent's name or trademark.  The
Bell cannot engage in joint activities with this affiliate other
than to jointly do telemarketing or operate a "teaming
arrangement."  Such an arrangement, says the bill, could involve
the Bell providing its facilities or basic phone service to the
affiliate.

But this separate subsidiary is no longer required four years
after the parent Bell is allowed into long-distance.

On alarm monitoring, the bill bans the Bell companies from
entering that line of business for five year after enactment,
except for Ameritech, which already owns an alarm monitoring
company.  However, Ameritech cannot acquire other alarm
monitoring companies for five years.

TITLE II: Broadcast Services deals with changes that aim to
speed the renewal of broadcast licenses and to give broadcasters
more flexibility.  Presently, the bill tells the FCC to give new
digital "advanced television (ATV)" spectrum only to
broadcasters and not to auction it.  (If the broadcaster uses
ATV for for-pay services, the FCC gets the right to assess fees
on that service.)

This is the section of the bill most in flux.  Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., would rather have the FCC auction that
spectrum to raise revenue to reduce the federal debt.  An
agreement on this could help solve the continuing dispute over
the federal budget.

This section of the bill also loosens current limits on how many
radio and TV stations may be owned per market.  TV station
owners, though, are still subject to the one station per market
rule, but now can seek FCC waivers of the rule in any of the top
50 markets.

Broadcasters also now are able to buy cable TV networks and
their licenses will run for eight years, not 10.  However,
renewal has been speeded since the FCC cannot ask for any
information that already has been supplied to it earlier by the
applicant, nor can it consider competing applicants' claims to
provide better uses of the licensee's license.

In fact, the FCC can only turn down a renewal application if
there was a pattern of violations of the law, a serious
violation or a failure to serve the public interest.

TITLE IV: Cable Services aims to give cable TV the flexibility
and the profitability to compete with local telcos.  It does so
by lifting cable TV rate regulation "upper tier" services in
markets where there is "effective competition."  For instance,
if a local telco offers video programming on its network.

Small operators, those with less than 1 percent of all U.S.
subscribers, are rate-deregulated immediately. And all cable
operators escape rate regulation of service packages, other than
the locally-regulated basic tier, as of March 1999.

Presently, complaints about cable TV rates can be filed by any
person with the FCC, which then launches an examination of
whether the rate meets the national "benchmark" of fairness.  If
not, the rate must fall.

Under the bill, the FCC will regulate rates until competition or
the "sunset date" arrives, but rate complaints will only be
allowed from the cable operator's local franchise authority.
And the franchiser can't complain unless it receives citizen
complaints within 90 days of the rate increase. Turning to
telco-provided video, the bill retains current Title III
regulation for wireless cable systems, Title II rules for pure
common carrier systems and Title VI rules for telco-owned cable
TV systems.  But the bill also creates a new category called
"open video systems" that are like a common carrier network, but
on which the carrier can own some of the programming. Those
systems may program up to two-thirds of their systems with their
own content, but have to leave the remaining third open to other
content providers - if "demand exceeds channel capacity..."

The FCC must write the rules for such system within six months
and then will sit in judgment on the applications of telcos that
want this form of streamlined regulation.  The category  exempts
operators from franchise fees, although the bill states that a
fee may be paid by the operator in lieu of the franchise fee.

Telcos, under the bill can own no more than 10 percent of the
cable system in their territory unless the cable system serves a
rural area of under 35,000 population or the telco has under
$100 million revenues and the cable system has under 20,000
subscribers (and no more than 12,000 are in an urban area).  Two
other conditions that allow such mergers are if the cable system
serves fewer than 10 percent of the households in the telco's
service area or the FCC issues a waiver.

Title V: Broadcast Obscenity and Violence is perhaps the most
controversial part of the bill, the part best known to the
general public and also the part most likely to face immediate
court challenge.  In general, it calls for TV set makers to
begin including a "V chip" in their sets so that parents can
program the sets to block shows that carry high violence content
ratings.

FCC REPORT via NewsNet
JANUARY 3, 1996

DEMOCRATS, BELLS SCORE ON TELECOM BILL - IF THIS VERSION FLIES

Casey Stengel would be proud.  Turns out Stengel's axiom "it
ain't over till it's over" applies as aptly to telecom reform
legislation as it does to baseball games.

Late last month, Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., chairman of the
House-Senate conference committee on the bill, thought he and
key committee members had struck a compromise that gave
concessions to the Clinton administration in order to avert a
threatened veto.  But when conservative Republicans heard about
the terms, they rebelled, forcing Pressler to call his deal just
a "framework agreement" and scuttling plans to bring the bill to
a pre-Christmas vote.

The new uncertainty left the bill vulnerable to more changes.
The latest draft of the bill is not public but a copy obtained
by FCC Report shows changes already have been made to Pressler's
framework deal.  One of them is the removal of language that
would have kept the Bell companies from joint-marketing long-
distance and local service until a year after their local
competitors were doing so.

There's still some uncertainty whether this version will do the
trick.  Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole says he has some
disagreements with the bill.  He and House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., will meet this week.

Gingrich called "time out" last month, advising House
Republicans to hold off on

voting on the report until after Congress returns to session
this week.  His staff said the speaker had not yet reviewed the
new language to see if it was sufficiently deregulatory.

On the other hand, Pressler and Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va.,
support the bill.

Perhaps recognizing that only the fine details of the bill
remain to be ironed-out, all sides in the yearlong battle appear
to be pulling back their forces.  Jim Smith, president of the
Competitive Telecommunications Association (CompTel), told FCC
Report his group of local competitors doubts it will get the
conference committee to reverse itself and toughen a condition
on Bell long-distance entry.

At the United States Telephone Association (USTA), chief
lobbyist Larry Clinton, said his group has given up hope of
getting the conference to undo a change to the bill that lets
states use rate-of-return regulation for competitive services.
The provision was excised early last month by the conference
committee, which is producing a compromise version of the
telecom bills passed this summer by the House and Senate.

Another measure of how the deal is jelling:  Key factions are
releasing statements endorsing the new draft bill, even though
it has not been released.  Supporters include the
Telecommunications Industry Association, the Alliance for
Competitive Communications - the Bell's lobbying group - and the
National Association of Broadcasters.

The USTA and CompTel haven't issued statements, but Clinton said
he expects the USTA "will be OK" on the bill and Smith said his
group will find the bill "minimally acceptable" as long as it's
not changed more.

A similar view was expressed by a long-distance industry source,
who warned that the game is not over.  If the bill remains
unchanged, he said, long-distance will grudgingly support it.
However, he noted that, "The ball has already been pulled out
from under us once" this year when a "manager's amendment" in
the House undid the pro-long-distance language of that chamber's
bill just before passage.

The heavy-hitters are checking their swings because they've
chalked up plenty of runs in the last inning of the bill's ball
game.  In recent days, the Bells have won the right to keep one
of their brethren, Ameritech, from expanding its alarm-
monitoring operations beyond the company's current holdings.

Ameritech, the only Bell the bill lets into alarm monitoring -
by "grandfathering" the company's current holdings - now cannot
expand its alarm monitoring presence until after the five-year
wait that the bill imposes on all of the Bells seeking to get
into that line of business.

Ameritech's next alarm monitoring move was expected to be
outside of its territory.

The nation's 14 largest utility companies also scored by
convincing the conferees to let them offer telecom services.
But the latest draft of the conference report - in effect, the
new telecom bill - shows that the biggest runs were scored by
the Democrats, including the addition of a role for the
Department of Justice (DOJ) in assessing the long-distance entry
applications of the Bell companies.

Though the role is only advisory, as the Senate bill originally
offered, the change was one of three called for by the White
House when the administration was threatening a veto.

Another recent change is adoption of the House bill's 35 percent
cap on the size of the national audience that any one TV station
chain may accumulate.  The cap, a part of the House telecom bill
added by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., addresses the "media
concentration" aspect of the bill, another prime White House
worry.

Those and other changes were added to the bill after a meeting
Dec. 13 between Pressler and Bliley and the two top Democrats on
the conference committee, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan and Sen.
Ernest Hollings of South Carolina.

For his part, sources say Hollings was able to convince Pressler
to remove from the bill entirely all language that would have
lifted the current 25 percent cap on foreign investment in FCC
licensees.

The next day, Pressler and Bliley were set to sell their deal to
House and Senate Republicans.  But that morning's newspapers
reported that Vice President Al Gore had endorsed the bill on
behalf of the Clinton administration, the entity most
conservative Republicans despise.

The error cost Pressler his run.  He was forced to call his deal
a "framework" - not an agreement - when key conferees, including
Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, the chairman of the House telecom
subcommittee and a key drafter of the House bill, rebelled.
Fields released a statement saying, "There was no deal" with the
White House, and then left to spend the holidays with his family
in Texas.

The Senate returned to session yesterday and House returns
today, but it's still uncertain when Congress will to take up
the telecom bill.  The chief item on the agenda remains federal
budget legislation and, if no new compromise is available for a
vote, some members may call for another recess so that they can
tend to their re-election campaigns.

Therefore, the best that can be expected is for the conference
report to be voted on by the conferees and released this week.
More likely, the report will be held back.

Besides the new role for the DOJ in deciding Bell entry into
long-distance, other key aspects of the draft version of the
report are:

*     "Grandfathering" states that, as of Dec. 1995, require the
Bells to offer dialing parity,

*     Expedited judicial review of the bill's "cyberporn"
restrictions, and

*     Inclusion of the Senate bill's requirement that discounted
telecom service be offered to schools and libraries.  Now,
however, the requirement is part of the definition of universal
service itself, meaning that providers can seek compensation for
their loss via the universal service subsidy.

The DOJ's role on Bell long-distance entry will come as part of
the FCC's imposition of a public-interest test on Bell long-
distance applications, a concept taken from the Senate telecom
bill.  The FCC must give "substantial weight" to the DOJ's
assessment, but that assessment will not be decisive in itself,
the new version of the bill states.

The Pressler compromise also requires a Bell to first have a
facilities-based competitor in place, as the House wanted,

and give the FCC the power to test whether there is "actual and
demonstrable" local competition in the Bell's local market.  But
the Pressler framework agreement eliminates language adopted by
the conferees just days before that would have required Bell
long-distance entry to be predicated on the Bell facing
competition throughout each of its states, not just in one city
in each state.

The bill does not require the Bells to provide dialing parity
until they enter the long-distance business, unless they operate
in a state that has only one LATA or which required the service
as of December 1995.  Dialing parity, already available in long-
distance, means the ability to place a local call on a competing
carrier's network by dialing the same number of digits as needed
by the local carrier's network.

The bill bans making indecent material available over electronic
networks, a hewing to the Senate bill's approach.  The bill's
penalties for sending "cyberporn" - a fine up to $100,000 and up
to 10 years in jail - are also the same as the Senate bill's,
but the draft bill uses the test of whether such material is
indecent, not the "harmful to minors" standard that has been
upheld by federal courts.

As a concession to opponents, the bill calls for expedited
judicial review of this provision, meaning that legal challenges
to the law will, if appealed, go directly from the federal
district court to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Contrary to the House version of the telecom bill, the draft
agreement has no language banning the FCC from regulating the
Internet or letting the FCC selectively lift the 25 percent cap
on foreign ownership of FCC licensees.  But these changes may be
subject to change.  The Senate appears willing to accept
Pressler's view that the latter matter should be dealt with via
separate legislation - he says a bill will be introduced this
spring - but some in the House still are pressing their fight to
return their foreign ownership language to the bill.

In the Senate, Pressler believes he has "a good majority" but
his compromise has won an ardent foe, fellow conferee Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz.  A source with McCain's office told FCC Report,
"My boss and others were beside themselves" when they heard
about the framework agreement.  The deal, he said, was worked
out behind closed doors, with Hollings, the ranking Democratic
senator on the conference committee, carrying water for the
White House.

McCain voted against the Senate bill when it came to the floor
and now his staff hints he will use his considerable power as a
senator to slow the conference report's progress in the Senate
until he wins his revisions.

FCC STILL CLOSED, BUT LICENSE AUCTIONS ROLL ON - NETTING $1.5B

The FCC's offices have been closed since Dec. 22, but that
hasn't kept the money from rolling in.  Since that date, the FCC
has netted nearly $1.5 billion for the U.S. Treasury from three
auctions of operating licenses.

The auctions were suspended for the holidays and resume this
week -which is more than can be said for the operations of the
commission itself.  Only a skeleton crew, most of them involved
with the auctions, is working at FCC headquarters.  The nearly
2,000 other FCC employees have been furloughed and won't return
until funding for the commission and other government agencies
is restored.

The shutdown of the FCC so far has had only limited impact on
telecom regulation - most of the action right now is on Capitol
Hill - but it has postponed release of the FCC's report and
order on the investment of Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom
in Sprint.  A Sprint source said the company cannot be sure of
how to proceed regarding the $4 billion investment until the FCC
releases its full report on the matter, which was decided at the
FCC's Dec. 15 meeting.

Also delayed will be the planned Jan. 18 meeting and any action
on proposed rulemakings, such as that regarding GTE's recent
request to deaverage its switched access rates and offer volume
discounts in five states.  Comments on the plan, which resembles
the Nynex Universal Service Preservation Plan the commission
adopted in 1995, were due yesterday, but the FCC is not
accepting filings during the shutdown.  Instead, all comments
due during the shutdown are due the day the FCC re-opens.

This means the FCC also may have to postpone its planned day-
long enbanc hearing on spectrum policy.  More likely, it will
hold that hearing, scheduled for Jan. 31, in lieu of its January
meeting.  However requests to participate in the hearing were
due Dec. 22.

While some actions have been delayed, the three license auctions
the FCC began in December were not.  Of these, the auction of 30
megahertz (MHz) personal communications service (PCS) licenses
has generated the most revenue.  The auction, which began Dec.
15 and is open only to small businesses, posted $1.2 billion of
the $1.45 billion earned so far in all three December auctions -
after just four rounds of bidding.

The top bidders in the PCS auction, which resumes Jan. 5, are
PCS 2000 LP, which bid $443 million and is high bidder in 124
markets; GWI PCS Inc., which bid $257 million and is high bidder
in 10 markets; and NextWave Personal Communications, which bid
$162 million and is high bidder in six markets.

The PCS auction involves the nation's 493 metropolitan trading
areas (MTA), as defined by the Rand McNally Business Atlas.  Of
these, PCS 2000 holds the top bid ($203 million) for any MTA,
that of New York City.  Next in the ranking are GWI PCS, which
bid $113 million for Los Angeles, and DCR PCS Inc., which bid
$70 million for Chicago.

The second auction, which resumes Jan. 4, involves specialized
mobile radio  (SMR) licenses and has netted $167 million in
revenue, a figure that  includes the fines assessed against
those that withdrew bids.  Without those fines, which surely
will be disputed, the figure is $100 million less.

In the SMR auction, Paging Network of America, Ram Mobile Data
and Geotek Communications are among the most prevalent bidders
for the regional licenses at stake.  Paging Network holds the
highest bid so far, the $925 million it offered for the New York
license, which also includes much of Northern New Jersey.

The third auction, which resumes today, involves a form of
wireless cable TV service called multipoint distribution service
(MDS).  The auction has generated $73 million after 37 rounds of
bidding.

Among the leading bidders is CAI Wireless Systems, a wireless
cable company jointly owned by Nynex and Bell Atlantic.  CAI
Wireless has the top bids in New York and Washington, D.C.,
which so far have generated the highest bids.  In those markets,
it has offered $3.1 million and $2 million respectively.

SMALL CARRIERS NET BIG COMPLAINT TOTALS, FCC STUDY FINDS

Some of the nation's smallest carriers have garnered the highest
number of customer complaints, according to recent FCC data.
The data, contained in a "Common Carrier Scorecard," shows three
companies - Oncor Communications, Value Added Communications and
Zero Plus Dialing Inc. (ZPDI) - far exceeding the nation's
multibillion-dollar carriers, when all carriers are compared on
the basis of their annual revenue.

For instance, ZDPI garnered 9 complaints per million dollars in
revenue, while Bell Atlantic netted .03 complaints per million
dollars in revenue.

Other small companies leading the list of complaint recipients
include Operator Assistance Network (275), Sonic Communications
(130) and Matrix Telecom (114).  Matrix last month was fined
$40,000 for slamming, the unauthorized transfer of customers
from one long-distance carrier to another.

Slamming was one of the top three reasons for the customer
complaints, which routinely pour into the FCC.  The other
reasons were operator services and "800-" number information
services.

Oncor, an operator services provider (OSP), was a leader in this
type of complaint.  Other top complaint-receiving OSPs:  Polar
Communications and Cleartel.

But the FCC said a key finding of the study, which used 1994's
complaint totals, was how few companies were netting complaints,
when companies were equalized for size.  Of the total 11,350
complaints, only 67 companies received more than 10.

In fact, 20 companies were responsible for 73 percent of all
complaints, the FCC said.

Compared on a per-line basis, small companies lead the list of
complaint recipients, even though their total complaints were
sometimes smaller than those filed against major carriers.  For
instance, Oncor's 590 complaints equaled 1,140 per million lines
while Bell Atlantic's 385 complaints equaled 21 per million
lines.

The report found that some carriers have complaint rates 100
times greater than the rates held by large carriers, the FCC
charged.

The FCC also ranked the nation's largest local carriers on the
basis of their complaints (see chart), but noted that complaints
made about those carriers often involve services the customer
reached via that carrier and not the local carrier itself.

The commission said carriers can reduce their complaint levels
by improving customer service, maintaining better billing and
service records and resolving complaints quickly.

'TOWER' OF 214S SHRINKS AS CARRIERS GIVE UP, LOOK TO CONGRESS

The towering pile of Section 214 applications that once loomed
over the FCC's Common Carrier Bureau is fast becoming a mole-
hill, partly because of industry reluctance to continue pursuing
the applications - which will be done away with under the
congressional telecom bill.

Last month, Ameritech became the latest Bell company to pull out
of the Section 214 process, which a phone company now must
follow in order to build a video dialtone (VDT) network.  It
acted just weeks before its applications were to expire under
the FCC rule that a permit holder must act on its application
within 12 months.

In December 1994, the FCC approved Ameritech's five applications
to construct VDT networks that would serve 1.2 million homes in
its service region.  But the telco has since shifted strategy
toward becoming a franchise cable operator.

"There were two main reasons for the withdrawal," Ameritech
spokesman Dave Onak said.  "We have been getting increasing
community support for us to operate as a cable franchise
operator.  And the FCC still has not finalized their VDT rules."

Ironically, the chief reason the commission has failed to act is
that it first must see what rules Congress sets for VDT in the
telecom legislation.

Ameritech currently has eight franchise agreements with the
local authorities, primarily in the outlying areas of Detroit.

Onak said Ameritech continues with its brisk construction pace
despite the fact that the FCC has yet to approve the
applications.  Additionally, Illinois cable operators are suing
the telco and the authorities in Glendale Heights.

Nevertheless, Ameritech intends to begin offering programming
service during the first half of 1996, Onak said.  "We've got a
court ruling that said we can do so, so why not?"

Ameritech is in engaged in franchise discussions with an
additional 40 communities across the Midwest, Onak said.  The
telco has no plans to attempt to provide cable service outside
of its five-state region.  "We've got enough to keep us busy in
our own backyard," he said.

During the past year a handful of telcos - including Bell
Atlantic and U S West -  have amended, and then outright pulled
their applications for commercial VDT before they ever got to
the approval stage at the commission.  Of concern is the rapidly
changing technological landscape and the commission's lack of
clarity on just how, when and where the telcos can operate VDT
service.

Bell Atlantic in the late spring withdrew two of its Section
214s and currently has only one 214 application pending, which
seeks to provide VDT service over a switched digital video
network in Florham, N.J.  The application was filed nearly three
years ago and spokesman Harry Mitchell said the telco is letting
it sit because it includes up-to-date technology.  Bell Atlantic
has no plans to file any other Section 214s in the near future.

"The wild card is the federal legislation," Mitchell said.  "We
are prepared to make the filings if necessary but we are not
going to tip our hand if we don't have to."

The FCC said it will finalize its VDT regulations by early 1996
if the federal government does not pass telecom reform
legislation making it a moot point.

THE POST-BILL WORLD: MORE LAWSUITS, NEED FOR WELL-CRAFTED RULES

Now that the congressional telecom bill appears on track to
enactment, several industry experts say the bill will promote
litigation and that regulators have their work cut out for them.

That's because Congress can give a general statement of what it
wants but the rules must be detailed to get that view to work.
Augie Ros, adviser to the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC)
chairman, noted how, recalled how, as part of its adoption of
the Ameritech Customers First plan, the ICC set a formula for
the cost of a loop.  Thus, Ameritech's tariff for loop costs
included at least one no-cost loop.   Yet, said Ros, the move
was completely within the new rules.

There's aspects of new rules "you can't even begin to think
about," he warned.

Attorney Jon Canis, of the Washington firm of Swidler & Berlin,
agreed and pointed to the FCC's efforts to produce rules on
colocation, virtual or physical.  He advised the FCC to turn to
states like Illinois for advice on how to proceed with some of
the ground-breaking rules the bill will require.

"Whether this [legislation] will work will depend on whether
[the FCC] will cooperate" with the states, said Joseph DiBella,
a federal regulatory attorney in Nynex's governmental affairs
unit.

Ros, Canis and DiBella all spoke at a December conference
sponsored by the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche and
Business Research Publications.

There, DiBella and Canis warned that another outgrowth of the
bill's passage will be litigation.  Calling the new law "a boon
to regulatory lawyers," DiBella said the FCC and state boards
can avoid litigation by setting up step-by-step routes to
compliance - and offering carriers incentives along the way.

That's the idea behind giving the Bells a shot at the long-
distance market once they meet the bill's checklist of open
access and unbundling requirements.

Canis said the bill's passage is essential - because of lawyers,
who otherwise drive up the cost of any company trying to enter
local competition on a state-by-state basis.  It can cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars to mount these cases before
each state board, he said, because of the lawyers and expert
witnesses involved.

CABLEVISION SYSTEMS ANNOUNCES $300 MILLION FIBER BUILD

     Cablevision Systems Corp. has announced it will invest $300
million in northeastern Ohio to build a fiber optic telecommunications
system.  The company already has begun constructing the 750 MHz
system, which Cablevision says will provide a platform for programming
choices and advanced two-way communications services.
     "The new telecommunications network will initially provide 77
analog channels with future digital capacity," says Lawrence Drake,
senior vice president and general manager for Cablevision's midwest
region.  
     "In the near future, those programming choices will be joined by
the exciting new capabilities that our fiber optic telecommunications
system allows, including video-on-demand, interactive services and
high-speed computer connections," Drake says.
     Cablevision anticipates the $300 million investment will create
an estimated 100 new jobs.  Cablevision of Ohio now employs 670.  
     The company recently applied with the Public Utilities Commission
of Ohio to provide telephone service there as part of its attempts to
broaden its market impact.  (James Evangelista, 216/696-0229.)

DSC-BELL ATLANTIC FIBER EQUIPMENT DEAL SEEN WORTH $150 MILLION

     DSC Communications Corp. has signed a two-year agreement with
Bell Atlantic Corp. to supply DSC's Next Generation Digital Loop
Carrier equipment. An industry source says the deal is worth
approximately $150 million during that period.  The deal primarily
involves DSC's Litespan-2000 product, this source told us.
     The agreement is part of an ongoing relationship that DSC has had
with the regional holding company, which continues to be a major
customer as it packs more fiber into its network. For example, Bell
Atlantic contracts with DSC accounted for 10 percent of DSC's annual
revenues in 1992 and 11 percent in 1993.
     Bell Atlantic actually has been deploying the Litespan product
since 1990, according to DSC.  DSC characterizes Litespan as the fiber
optics industry's first integrated, synchronous optical network-based,
optical loop carrier system.

AMP'S GLENN MOORE NAMED SPECTRAN'S PRESIDENT, CEO

     Recently reorganized SpecTran Corp. has named Glenn Moore to be its
president and CEO.  Raymond Jaeger remains chairman of the board of the
Sturbridge, Mass.-based company.
     Moore, 44, comes from outside the company.  He was general manager
of the Optical Connectors and Assemblies Division at Amp, where he spent
20 years.
     "The experience and success Glenn Moore achieved in developing
Amp's Optical Connector business will be a major asset in the execution
of SpecTran's aggressive growth plan," commented Jaeger.  "[The move]
will allow me to concentrate more on longer term corporate development
issues and pursue strategic alliance opportunities that will further
strengthen and diversify the company."
     Reporting to Moore will be the heads of SpecTran's three subsidiary
companies, which were created as part of the reorganization.  These
subsidiaries include SpecTran Communication Fiber Technologies Inc.;
SpecTran Specialty Optics Co.; and Applied Photonic Devices.
     Bruce Cannon, SpecTran's chief financial officer, also will report
to Moore.

ANDREW TO MARKET HYBRID FIBER/COAX CABLE

     As part of its positioning in both the cellular and fiber worlds,
Andrew Corp. is introducing premise composite fiber optic and copper
cable assemblies for use in cellular and emerging personal
communications systems.
     The assemblies connect RF antennas that provide coverage throughout
a building with cellular or PCS base stations via an RF analog fiber
optic link which includes the electrical conductors that power the
remotely located antennas.  These composite cables may also be
integrated with an uninterruptible power supply so that a building power
outage will not affect wireless services.
     The cable assembly is composed of two Andrew-manufactured
Microcables, including optical connectors and two standard insulated
copper wires.  Single-mode fiber--which can be dispersion-shifted--is
incorporated.  The company notes that such cables eliminate the need for
"bulky ductwork" because the company's optical fiber cables employ a
unique sheathing design that protects the cable.     The composite design
allows electrical power and fiber to run together, making expensive
conduit, outlets or transformers unnecessary, Andrew says.

1996: MAJOR GROWTH SPURRED BY DEREGULATION, HYBRIDIZATION, THE INTERNET

     The year 1996 will be a strong one for fiber optics both in the
United States and throughout the world, according to extensive
interviews we have conducted with fiber optics industry experts.
     Global telecom deregulation, and particularly the potential for
opening markets in the United States, will continue to accelerate the
growth of fiber optics.  Because of its amazing properties, fiber
continues to find its way into operating networks, whether it is pushing
closer to the home as the result of cable TV overbuilds in hybrid fiber
coax networks, via a new product that Andrew Corp. is announcing that
packs both fiber and copper into the same cable, or as part of the new
hybrid fiber wireless architecture.
     When we asked James Crowe, chairman and CEO of MFS Communications
Co. Inc., what general business trends in fiber he anticipates will
occur in the coming year, he responded, "The Internet, the Internet and
the Internet."  It is cheaper by over a factor of 100 to move
information over the Internet versus the circuit switched voice network,
said Crowe.  That kind of economic advantage is unstoppable over the
longer term.
     The paradigm shift in many companies to the Internet suggests an
opportunity to many of our interviewees for fiber.  Forget the video-on-
demand market dream that simply has not driven bandwidth to this level,
we were told; right under our noses people are demanding more bandwidth
on the Internet--and there is no doubt that fiber optics will deliver
it.

  ...All Agree: A Solid U.S. Market, Especially With Telecom Reform

     1996 very well may be the most explosive year that we have seen in
the industry, says Craig Young, president of Brooks Fiber.  "We will see
a lot of folks that are new players in new markets that will be building
infrastructure in new fiber markets," Young tells us.  "You are probably
going to see an explosion of fiber going into the ground."
     The only limitations to U.S. fiber growth are going to be the fiber
manufacturing capabilities of Corning and Alcatel, says Gary Glick,
business unit manager of fiber optic cable at  Andrew Corp..
     Crowe believes 1996 will be "an excellent year," noting that the
focus may shift a little from more traditional voice-oriented telco
services to methods of broadband interconnect with the Internet.  "If
the local loop was considered a bottleneck for voice-grade service, it
becomes a real restriction as people demand more broadband access to the
Internet," says Crowe.
     Brian McFadden, assistant vice president of high capacity
applications for the SONET networks group at Nortel, believes "the
demand for bandwidth across the network is increasing and therefore
fiber deployment should be strong in 1996."  McFadden believes it still
is "an elastic market for bandwidth" as prices come down and new
applications are invented. 
     "In the area of high-speed, trunked telecommunications, 1996 is
going to be the year that 10 Gbps OC-192 networks come into play and at
the same time the first [large commercial] deployments of
multiwavelength WDM times OC-48," says John Ryan, principal at the
California consulting firm of Ryan, Hankin and Kent. "The next step in
high capacity telecom gear is going to happen in 1996 and that will push
the state of development of both TDM and dense WDM."  With regard to
high speed TDM and WDM, "its very clear that at least for the first
several years, they have to co-exist," says Ryan. 
     Stephen Montgomery, vice president of Electronicast Corp., a
competitor to Ryan, Hankin also based in California, believes strong
markets will continue for premises data and broadband communications. 
"We see prices remaining very stable, although going up in [a few] fiber
optic cable components."
     The market for fiber to support cable TV also is expected to
continue strong in the coming year.  "We feel it will be a very good
year," says Ron Coppock, vice president of international sales and
marketing for Texscan. How good, Coppock adds, depends on whether
telecom reform legislation is passed into law.  Still, "in terms of HFC
architecture we build products for, we see an increased evolution toward
that type of architecture and the market is significant."  There are a
number of 350 MHz or 550 MHz architectures that need to be rebuilt and
Coppock does not see that happening without some fiber infrastructure
going in as part of it.
     Andy Meyer, Scientific-Atlanta Inc.'s director of marketing for
transmissions, believes there "will be a lot more activity on the MSO
side continuing in fiber for 1996."  Meyer believes a lot of that is
driven by the concept of narrowcasting, which he defines as the ability
of cable companies to segment their markets into smaller sections. 
"They have done infrastructure changes that allow them to go to smaller
pockets of nodes and they can target those nodes with a specific
advertising using data modems," continues Meyer.  "Fiber optics to allow
them to do that."
     Scientific-Atlanta also is pretty optimistic about the products it
makes for the telecom market, says Tim Wilk, director of strategic
planning. The regional holding companies (RHCs) have been trying
unsuccessfully to get into the video market for a number of years, he
observes.  "As we start 1996, there are a number of RHCs that are ready
to start rolling out HFC networks. With Pacific Bell and SNET we see the
integrated networks," he continues.  "We are really excited about some
of the telcos that are starting to build a video-only system."  It is a
trend that Wilk believes will "really kick into high gear" in 1996 as
the telcos see that fiber to the curb is not living up to its
capabilities and not hitting the target availability and cost targets.
     "Emerging technologies can only run on fiber," says one
interviewee, who works for an RHC and who asked not to be identified. 
"That is where the growth is going to come," this source adds.  "You are
going to see major market growth in the United States."
     Drew Zogby, director of strategic marketing for ADC
Telecommunications Broadband Connectivity Division, believes 1996 will
be a very strong year for U.S. fiber optics deployment. 
     Otto Szentisi, vice president and director of hardware and
equipment technology at Siecor Corp., says the company expects to see
continued growth, "very similar to 1995."
      Optelecom Chairman William Culver predicts "market revenues will
continue their inevitable growth in spite of decreasing prices."
     David Maack, vice president for research, development and
engineering at Porta Systems, believes telecom reform legislation will
be made law and "it is going to spur people to add plant equipment."
     Michael Mattei, vice president of technology for TII-Ditel, says
there is the potential for large increase in the number of fiber miles
installed in 1996, depending on whether telecom reform legislation is
approved.  If not, the industry will go through its normal increase, he
reasons. 
     Joe Chisholm, a manager of network infrastructure planning and
technology at BellSouth, says that all he has heard "internally and
externally leads me to believe that [the fiber optics market] should
continue to grow." BellSouth's Greg Mims, who has the same title,
believes there will be a continuing upward fiber optics trend across all
of the regions in the U.S.

  ...Diverging Views Mark Undersea Fiber Forecast

     There were widely divergent viewpoints among experts with regard to
undersea growth in fiber.
     "1996 is going to be the busiest year in the history of the world
with regard to the installation of undersea fiber optic cable," says
Clifton Lundberg, president and CEO of General Offshore Corp. (GOC),
which installs optical fiber cable up to depths of 50 meters throughout
the world.  The company recently has been deploying new tools, such as
the Gator, to help get the cable in the mud and out of the way of
anchors and trawling nets.
     GOC's Lundberg cites FLAG, as well as installations in such diverse
places as Ukraine and Thailand as helping to fuel an accelerating
market.  Based in Alexandria, Va., but with offices throughout the
world, GOC is 60 percent owned by Hannon, Armstrong and Co. and 40
percent owned by Cable & Wireless.
     While believing that the terrestrial market in the United States
will remain strong, Konnie Schaefer, president of K. Schaefer &
Associates, believes the market for undersea fiber optic systems "is
going to be slow." That is because, Schaefer reasons, a number of
systems are going to become operational and fulfill demand for 1996.
     "I think there is going to be a significant slowdown from the
standpoint of undersea fiber optic sales," Schaefer says.  One case in
point: Schaefer believes the sweeping SEA-WE-ME-3 network will not go
forward.  He attributes this to changes in the organizational structure
of France Telecom, the governing partner, which have led to questions
raised by the new management as to whether the resulting capacity will
be there to justify the very substantial capital investment.  Officials
from France Telecom would not comment when asked what the current status
of the project is.
     Ando Corp.'s Michael Griffin believes 1996 will be "a strong year"
for fiber optic test instrumentation equipment.

  ...Worldwide Growth Strong: But Know Thine Area

     The global fiber market is "going to be a very positive one in
1996," says Ryan.  "Many nations are building out fiber-rich
infrastructures for telephony and cable TV and in a lot of cases a
combination of the two," he observes. 
     "The southern edge of South America--including Argentina, Chile and
Peru--have become perhaps the most deregulated telecommunications
markets on earth with a resulting upsurge of infrastructure buildout,"
says Ryan.  "I would expect to see a lot more of that occurring in
various different regions."
     In order to take advantage of that, most of the major vendors have
"beefed up their ability" to provide for this market, says Ryan.  "There
are terrific global opportunities," he adds.
     "Most nations outside of a small club of advanced nations have
relatively little telecommunications infrastructure," says Ryan.  The
gap between developing nations and wealthier nations will increase
substantially if these poorer nations do not put in new infrastructure. 
And that translates into more fiber in the ground, Ryan believes.
     Texscan's Coppock sees continuing strong markets in Europe and
Latin America.  While the market for cable TV in the United Kingdom is
consolidating, Coppock sees "a continuing build there that's all
upside."  That's because, they have just turned on their 1 millionth
subscriber in a nation of 48 million people.  "Clearly, there is a lot
of cable passing to be done." 
     Italy is going to be a huge market for cable TV if the nation
approves Socrates, Telecom Italia's vast cable TV project, Coppock says. 
Spain and Portugal also represent opportunities for cable TV
infrastructure incorporating fiber.
     With regard to Latin America, Coppock notes that "there has been a
consolidation in Chile.  Last year there were maybe 10 players, next
year there will be two or three."  He identifies Argentina as a
continuing strong market. 
     Zogby believes that "international growth will continue to be
robust."  He identifies Germany, Chile and Australia as nations that
will continue to  aggressively install fiber.  China, India and other
Asian nations are accelerating fiber optic deployments.  Zogby
identifies Japan as a strong market and believes that Argentina and
Mexico also will grow substantially.  Middle East fiber optics activity
also is up.
     "We see much higher growth, particularly in Asia," says Montgomery. 
For some components, Electronicast predicts growth of 100 percent per
year or higher; in others, it predicts growth of 30 percent.
     International growth is being spurred to some extent by AT&T and
MCI hoping to assume a global presence, says Mattei.  One example is MCI
in Mexico. He believes the amount of fiber going in during 1996 will
represent a larger increase than it did in 1995. 
     "The country that is the most advanced in the use of fiber is
France," says the RHC source requesting anonymity.  "France has us
beaten hands down in the use of fiber.  They are the most advanced in
terms of nuclear power at around 85 percent; they are the most advanced
in terms of fiber at around 65 percent." The nation is very active in
using fiber to deploy smart cars and smart highways.
     Andrew Corp. is involved in joint ventures in Russia, says Glick. 
"We see opportunities in Russia," he notes, particularly as the
situation stabilizes there.  "There is also major activity in China and
India, particularly Shanghai and the coastal areas," Glick believes.
     "In Europe, things are happening a little more rapidly on the
regulatory front than perhaps people had thought," says Crowe of MFS
Communications.  There may be as many as five consortia in Germany who
could put fiber in the ground, he adds.  With regard to deregulation of
Europe's PTTs on Jan. 1, 1997, Crowe believes that "we may see something
similar to what we saw in the United States after equal access where we
saw an explosion of fiber capacity being put in," although he notes that
such developments are subject to regulatory developments that are
"perilous to try to forecast."

  ...1996 Drivers: Telecom Reform, Cable-Telco, Internet, Technology
Improvement 

     Interviewees identified a variety of factors that will propel
market growth in 1996, including telecom reform legislation, the
struggle between cable TV companies and telephone companies to gain
larger market share, increased capacity requirements resulting from
demands for Internet access and technology improvements that will drive
new installations.
     ADC's Zogby lists drivers for growth as including cable TV fiber-
to-the-feeder and two-way network upgrades; regional Bell operating
company cable TV overbuilds; second-tier competitive access provider
growth; overall fiber optics-based, high-capacity-service demands;
increased local competition and the advent of local exchange carriers in
the inter-exchange carrier market; and more aggressive fiber optics
deployment by utilities.
     BellSouth's Mims sees increasing levels of fiber going into the
telco regions as "a natural evolution."  As you deploy more of a
particular technology, such as fiber, the cost structures come down as
the costs to your vendors come down.  Chisholm notes that the increased
functionality that fiber can provide is a major plus as telcos study
their networks.
     "It is clear that the line between local and long distance is going
to disappear," says MFS' Crowe.  Indeed, it has been clear for some time
that customers don't buy local and long-distance services because they
want to.  When the interexchange carriers move into the local exchange
that is going to mean additional construction and a good portion of that
will be fiber. 
     AT&T Corp.'s plans to enter the local exchange represents wonderful
news for consumers and the economy, Crowe believes.  From the point of
view of AT&T and the Bell operating companies, he believes it was
inevitable.  "From MFS's perspective it is great, in the short-to-medium
term it is a customer for us," says Crowe.  "It will be quite a while
before AT&T is able to deploy enough switches to carry all of its own
traffic," he predicts.
     Rick Jones, executive vice president of Broadband Technologies
Inc., believes telecom reform in the United States will be a big driver
that will cause telephone companies to build facilities in a variety of
spots.  "There will be quite a bit of attention in the local exchange
but also elsewhere," adds Jones.  "While 1996 will not be the year for
huge shipments, it will be the year people sort out what is going on and
make large orders," Jones believes.
     The Internet is having an impact, says Nortel's McFadden.  "A lot
of companies are putting people on the Internet on a day-to-day basis as
part of doing their job and that certainly is a dramatic shift from
three years ago." McFadden believes that deregulation and privatizations
are going to drive the number of second, third and fourth operators in a
lot of countries and competitive access providers are going to get even
stronger. 
     "The boom of the Internet will drive fiber optic deployment,"
predicts Sunil Tewarson, manager of new business development for AT&T
Network Systems. Tewarson notes that the U.S. government is going to be
handing over the network to private companies, that the performance is
going down below acceptable levels.  "For it to perform at the level
people accept, it will require higher speeds and that will drive fiber
deployment," says Tewarson. 
     Technology improvements will also play a role in accelerating
fiber, says Tewarson.  "In Bell Labs, we have tested the same fiber up
to speeds of 80 Gbps, 2000 channels of broadcast TV," he notes.  "There
is definitely a big technology push."

  ...Wireless Seen As Representing An Opportunity 

     Like it or not, wireless communications is having a growing impact
throughout the world.  While that will detrimentally affect fiber's
growth in some instances, it also may be an opportunity.
     Electronicast's Montgomery notes that some Asian nations deploying
wireless or personal communications require wireless antennas every 300-
400 feet that will be linked to fiber. 
     "Copper-based systems can't provide the bandwidth required to
handle all the PCS volume," says Glick.  "You need fiber." 
     As the result, Andrew Corp. is developing products that include
both fiber and copper in the same cable to the antenna (see related
information, p. 2).
     "Instead of pulling two separate cables, you can install one cable
and solve the problem of powering the antenna from the local bay
station," says Pat Estenes, senior product manager at Andrew Corp.

  ...1996 Business: Partnering to Continue, Growth of CAPs, (Re)-
Empowering AT&T

     It was clear from the learned responses of our interviewees that
much thought has been given to what business moves will be undertaken in
the coming year.  Much of that depends on, as Ryan defines it, on "the
minutiae" contained in telecom reform legislation, if it does become
law.
     There seems to be no question that roles will be changing rapidly
as shown in this anecdote from Ando's Griffin about two companies doing
business in 1996: "Today, I am your competitor; tomorrow, I am your co-
marketing partner; the week after next, one of us will buy the other;
and we will divest next month."      
     The general consensus was that there will continue to be
partnerings, such as the Sprint-Deutsche Telekom-France Telecom
partnering and the rumored alliance between Nynex and Bell Atlantic.
     "Companies such as ourselves don't have all the resources to get to
every customer," says Nortel's McFadden.  "It is very hard for one
company to cover the whole waterfront on technology developments.  You
can't afford to be limited by your own internal technological
capabilities.  There are going to be a lot more partnerships and a lot
more strategic use of these partnerships."     
     Our anonymous RHC source predicts there eventually will be an
implosion where only a few carriers eventually will be left standing. 
That jibes with comments from BBT's Jones, who says "the shaking will
begin in 1996, but the shake out will come later."
     Jones analogizes the situation to airline deregulation, "where
there were a number of mergers and a few companies that went out of
business as the landscape changed."  One common partnership will
probably be interexchange carriers and cable TV operators.  He also
believes there will be more partnering among the RHCs.
     AT&T will be a formidable foe as it enters the local exchange was
another consensus view. "I don't know if it is scary or provides an
opportunity," says Scientific-Atlanta's Wilk.  "AT&T recognition is
tremendous. If they can partner with the right providers, they are in an
absolutely tremendous position to capture a significant share not only
of the interactive data market but also of local telephony.  I think
AT&T is really something to watch next year."
     Officials from the AT&T systems and technology company--which has
about $20 billion in annual revenues--generally refused to comment for
this report, claiming they are in a quiet period until after the company
become public, expected about March 15.  AT&T Services, with about $50
billion in annual revenues, will remain a public company.  The third
company, GIS, the so-called computer company, also will not have a
public offering.   
     The systems and technology company--which includes Network Systems,
Microelectronics, Global Systems, Bell labs and Consumer Products--has
decided to create Network Cable Systems, which will combine its optical
fiber, fiber cabling, copper cables and fiber optic apparatus products
into one unit.  Units will include Norcross, Ga.; AT&T of Shanghai Fiber
Optic Co. Ltd.; Litespec Inc.; LYCOM A/S; AT&T Finolex Fiber Optic
Cables Ltd.; AT&T of Beijing Fiber Optic Cable Co. Ltd.; AT&T Fitel Co.;
AT&T Yakazi Fiber Optic Cable Co. Ltd.; AT&T Network Systems Deutschland
GmbH; AT&T Network Technologies Co. Ltd. (Bangkok, Thailand); Access
Network Technologies (Fuquay-Varina, N.C., a joint venture with
Raychem); AT&T ELECON Telesistemas C.A. (copper facility located in
Venezuela); AT&T of Tianjin, China; AT&T Network Systems Australia; and
AT&T Network Cable Systems Ireland. 

  ...Strong CAPs Seen Consolidating By Acquisition

     The competitive access providers (CAPs) are expected to continue to
aggressively plow fiber into the ground--and to consolidate for further
strength.
     Brooks Fiber President Young said his company will announce an
acquisition in coming weeks.  "Even though 1996 will not be a gangbuster
year in revenues, it will be a gangbuster year in capital expenditures,
because all of us are going to be putting in switches to go after the
biggest piece of the local dialtone market," Young confides.  Brooks
Fiber will install 8 to 10 switches in 1996 because that is all the
states will allow them to install. The company has the capability to
install 20 switches next year. 
     As we went to press, Brooks announced that it intends to invest
more than $20 million in building and operating two new fiber optic
networks in Stockton, Calif., and Jackson, Miss.  The company now will
serve 20 cities.
     "MFS is eating up other little CAPs," says Electronicast's
Montgomery.  CAPs are going to be very aggressive to position themselves
against the cable TV companies.  "They are doing this with fiber optics
deployment such as OC-3 and OC-12 SONET equipment."
     1996 will be an important year for software, several sources
observed.  "You are going to see more integration of fiber optic
products into large scale network-management, software-driven systems,"
Coppock believes.  "Software is going to be a big component."
     In the undersea market, Schaefer predicts there may be further
consolidations, such as Alcatel's earlier purchase of STC's undersea
unit.  Siemens also is trying to break into the fiber optics undersea
business--with limited success to this point.  It is also questionable
what happens to AT&T's underwater unit, known as SSI, which Schaefer
says has been the subject of industry gossip that it may be sold.
     [This is part one of a two-part series on forecasts and trends
anticipated in the fiber optics industry in the coming year.  FIBER
OPTICS NEWS interviewed more than 20 industry leaders to compile
information for this report.  Part two will run in our next issue, dated
Jan. 8, 1996.]

FIBVER OPTICS DIGEST

     Colombia's national telecommunications company has announced that
it has signed contracts with Mitsui & Co., Sirti SpA, Alcatel Cable SA
and Siemens AG as part of its fiber optics build.  The contracts are
worth a total of $112 million.

     Columbus, Ohio-based utility contractor Gudenkauf Corp. is
installing optical fiber cable together with the city.  The network will
offer high-bandwidth for power users and providers, supplying voice,
video and data.  The second phase of the network will entail
installation of 48-strand fiber cable traveling 6.62 miles and
connecting City Hall with Ohio State University and the Greater Columbus
Convention Center.  (Jeff Gudenkauf, 614/488-1776.)

     NTT has unveiled two fiber-related Track II procurements.  These
include "Optical Fiber Cables and Fiber Jointing for Aerial Access
Distribution Network" with filing deadline of Jan. 26, and "Optical
Fiber Cables and Fiber Jointing for User Distribution Network," with
filing deadline of Jan. 25.  (NTT America, Shingo Ieda, 212/808-2232.)

     Net sales of fiber optic products continue to increase for ADC
Telecommunications.  It announced that fiber sales represented 41.3
percent of total sales for the quarter ending Oct. 31, up from 35.6
percent for the year earlier period.  The company reported net income of
$18.7 million, compared to $12.8 million last year.  (Aimee Gallogly,
612/946-3338.)

     C-COR Electronics Chairman and CEO Richard Perry has announced that
the company's second quarter financial results will not meet expected
levels. It still does not have a corporate president, following the
departure of Daniel Finch. The company has received an order to supply
equipment to Titus Communications Corp. as part of a 1,050 mile hybrid-
fiber coax build in Japan.   
     Fiberguide Industries unveiled a new line of custom, single-fiber,
high-powered assemblies that are custom made.  The high-powered
assemblies are avail-able in a variety of sheathings and lengths. 
(Richard Landreth, 908/647-6601.)

     Hanh Lu has joined Lasertron as senior staff engineer for
distributed feedback lasers.  He formerly had worked at Bell Northern
Research Ltd.

     Stephanie Marshall has been named to the board of Tellabs Inc.  She
served as executive director of the Illinois Mathematics and Science
Academy.

     Brian McCann has joined the board of directors of Super Vision
International Inc..  He has spent more than eight years at 3M, where he
has been employed in the fiber optic division. 

     The New Orleans City Council has voted to let LeveeComm of
Louisiana build a perimeter fiber optics network for the city.  The
would-be carrier is still attempting to raise revenues for that purpose,
according to reports. 

     Galileo Electro-Optics Corp. gained a net profit for the first time
in the last five years, the company says in its 1995 annual report. It
had a profit of $1.1 million compared to a loss of similar value the
year before. Galileo also had the greatest commercial sales as opposed
to military sales for the period and the best productivity, as measured
by sales per employee.

     Luxtec Corp., a maker of fiber optic lighting and optical systems,
lost $6.1 million in the last quarter of fiscal 1995, compared to a net
income of $36,281 last year.  Primary reason for the loss was completion
of the CardioDyne acquisition, which involved a $5.1 million write-off.

AT&T SCORES $10 MILLION OPTICAL FIBER CONTRACT WITH DEUTSCHE TELECOM

     AT&T Corp. has received its largest contract involving optical
fiber yet from Deutsche Telekom, a $10 million deal in which the cable
will be used largely to upgrade east German infrastructure.  Roughly 90
percent of the cable will be installed in what was formerly East German,
according to AT&T.
     AT&T Network Systems fiber cable manufacturing facility in
Augsburg, Germany, will produce fiber optic cables to fill the order.
     Denmark-based LYCOM A/S, an AT&T subsidiary, will manufacture and
supply single-mode fiber to the Augsburg facility.  AT&T's Norcross,
Ga., facility also will supply single-mode fiber for the project.

ALCATEL GETS APPROVAL FOR SONET MULTIPLEXER FROM AT&T

     AT&T has approved Alcatel's 1603/12 SM synchronous optical network
multiplexer with AT&T's ACCUNET T155 service.  The Alcatel multiplexer
is one of the first tested by AT&T operating at the OC-3 rate, according
to Alcatel.
     While it unclear how much business the approval will generate,
Alcatel spokesman Mike Newsom told us the approval "is a major deal. 
They can't deny us anymore," said Newsom.
     The multiplexer offers carriers the option of an OC-3 or OC-12
configuration in a single, compact shelf, says Joe Bass, Alcatel's vice
president and general manager of lightwave products.  "The 1603/12 SM
can even operate as an OC-3 and OC-12 system at the same time,
interfacing an OC-12 line rate through one high-speed direction and OC-3
through the other high-speed direction of the same shelf."
     Test results showed that the unit can operate as a terminal
multiplexer, an add/drop multiplexer in either a linear or ring
configuration, an optical hub and a repeater as defined by the Accunet
T155 service specifications.

Cable Modems and the Future of Broadband


The hot topic at the recent Western Cable show was cable modems.  Building on
RF-to-Ethernet technology that has been around in one form or another since
the days of so-called broadband LANs, these modems, from a variety of vendors,
promise to provide residential users with access to the Internet and on-line
services at speeds in the tens of Megabits per second.  This is a quantum leap
up from the ISDN "modems" that are becoming popular among the most devoted
fans of the Net and an even bigger leap from the conventional modems that most
of us having been using to access online services for the last decade and a
half.

Cable Modems - The State of the Art?

The cable industry sees cable modems as a way that they can compete with the
telephone companies in the burgeoning Internet market.  But not quite yet.
ISDN terminal adaptors are here now and are getting cheaper by the day.  Cable
modems are only just beginning to appear, with many not slated to be on the
market until the middle of this year.  The exhibit on page 2 lists many of the
vendors that have - or will soon have - cable modem products.

At the same time, cable modems are only marginally standardized.  Most such
devices use IEEE 802.3/Ethernet MACs and 10Base-T between the PC and the
modem.  In addition, first-generation modem equipment appears to be
standardizing on 64-constellation QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)
receivers, combined with QPSK (Quadrature Phase-Shift Keyed) transmitters.
This means that, for the most part, cable modems can be used only in cable
networks that are adapted for specific modem products, while you can move your
ISDN adaptor from one ISDN service to another - although sometimes not without
difficulty.

Various groups are promising standards for cable modems before the end of this
year.  Among the standards makers for modems are CableLabs, the DAVIC group,
IEEE 802.14 and an industry group called the Broadband Link Team, which
consists of AT&T Network Systems, Hewlett-Packard Company, Hybrid Networks,
Inc., and Intel Corporation.  But for the time being, if you want high-speed
access to the Net or to AOL, Prodigy or CompuServe, buy an ISDN terminal
adaptor!

Cable Modems - the Killer App for ATM?

As the exhibit on page 3 shows, despite the fact that cable modems are early
technology, a significant number of trials are already underway for cable
modems, with some of the largest MSOs actively involved.  From the perspective
of someone interested in high-speed networking, however, the most important
trial may be that of at home, which has grasped an important truth about cable
modems.  If thousands of residential users are going to access the Net as
multi-megabit speeds, there is going to be an immediate demand for a
specialized high-speed backbone to support them.  The old slow and steady IP
routers will just not cut it.

Essentially the objective of @Home is to help cable companies around the
country to build revenues based on data services access using cable modems.
Its activities include systems integration and business process reengineering
- for example, to retrain customer support staff to handle new kinds of
digital services.

At the core of the @Home program is @Home's intention to build a national
backbone which enable operators to supply multimedia services to cable modems.
@Home would therefore function as one of the major Internet backbone
facilities, but one which was optimized for the requirements and capabilities
of cable modem users.  Facilities on this backbone would, however, be
accessible to all Internet users to the degree that this was possible using
dial-up POTS or ISDN facilities.

The @Home architecture is designed to provide a strong distribution of
resources, so that there is not too much demand on the Internet backbone.
This distribution is achieved through a hierarchy of regional data centers,
hubs and headends.  Since most modern cable network architectures are based on
a series of hubs, the architecture is not in itself unique.  However, the
@Home architecture is more geographically spread out than that envisioned by
the typical local operator and specifically incorporates ATM.  This ultimately
reflects the belief of @Home management that future multimedia services using
cable modems could overwhelm the Internet as currently constructed.

The @Home backbone will connect users to multiple sources of content.  @Home
is not directly involved in supplying content, although it is known to have
supplied advice to those developing specialized content for cable-based data
services.  Nor is @Home committed to any particular modem supplier.  However,
as noted above it is using Motorola modems in a trial and we were told that it
would also support LANCity and telephone modems.  Eventually, as standards are
developed, @Home hopes to be able to support any and all modem products.

In order to access the @Home backbone, cable systems will have to comply with
certain requirements.  These are:

- 6 MHz channel capacity - this is now standard for most cable systems

- HFC (hybrid fiber/coax) architecture - this is emerging as the
architecture-of-choice for advanced cable systems, but it is by no means
common yet.  Nor has HFC entirely eclipsed its rivals - fiber-to-curb and ADSL

- Two-way capability - this is still a rarity in the cable world

- Special headend equipment determined by modem type.

@Home believes that it will provide backbone service for about one million
homes by 1997.  @Home's economic calculations are also interesting in
understanding the market aspects of cable modem service.  According to these
calculations, it would cost cable operators about $500 to provide a
connection, from which they would receive payment of approximately $30 per
month of which $10 per month would go to @Home.  @Home would also charge
information providers for storing information on the @Home servers.

The two major financial backers of @Home are TCI and Kleiner Perkins, Caufield
and Byers, venture capitalists who have previously been involved with
financing for Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems.  With that kind of
backing, @Home should clearly be treated seriously.  For the cable industry,
the success of its new high-speed cable modems will depend on timing.  Can the
MSOs come to market with offerings based on their HFC architectures, before
the telcos also deploy HFC and similar modems.

But from the point of view of high-speed networking, it will be difficult to
put the cable modem genie back into the bottle.  These new products could be
what drives ATM into the core of cable networks and also what makes ATM the
key technology for the Internet backbone of the future.

FVC Offers New Networking Products


First Virtual Corp.  (FVC) is offering products allowing business users to
participate in enhanced desktop multimedia collaboration (DMC).  Using PCs
equipped with videoconferencing equipment and FVC's products, users can
collaborate on projects as though they were in the same room.  Examples of
DMC:

- A New York City advertising executive shows her clients a final cut of their
television commercial.  She is sitting at her PC in New York while her clients
use a PictureTel room-based videoconferencing system in Dallas.  Each party,
using four separate on-screen windows, can simultaneously view each other,
collaborate on the media schedule created as an Excel spreadsheet (passing
editing control back and forth) and view the actual video commercial, without
any degradation of audio or video quality.

- A doctor in Denver consults with a pediatric oncologist in Boston about a
patient's diagnosis.  He shows the specialist the child's test results,
patient record and X-rays, while discussing a course of treatment.  Each party
can review this information in concert, with all of the multimedia windows
open and running concurrently.

- An international retailer's facilities team based in Chicago views a video
taped store site with their team in Beijing.  Both parties can simultaneously
annotate construction estimates and review blueprint drawings while viewing a
realtime video tour of the new facility.  This application brings the Beijing
site to the retailer's desktop in Chicago.

FVC's products all operate in conjunction with its Multimedia Operating
Software (MOS), an ATM-Forum standards-based "middleware" that enables
out-of-the-box Windows applications to transparently leverage ATM's QoS
capabilities.  MOS guarantees high-speed access to applications, resulting in
multiple streams of voice, video, text, graphics and images on desktop.

FVC's new FIRST-Multimedia switches deliver ATM to the desktop at switched
Ethernet prices.  They are built with a stackable/modular architecture
allowing for a variety of scalable configurations and can scale to support
eight to 24 users per switch, 120 users per stack, and can further provide
scalability through the backbone.  The FIRST-Multimedia switches cost $300 per
25 Mbps ATM port.  They are available now and can support multimedia through
modular options including 25 Mbps ATM for the desktop, Ethernet, token-ring
for LAN access, and 155 ATM OC-3 for server of backbone switch access.
Additional modules will be available in the first half of this year to support
Fast Ethernet, SCSI, ISDN/T1 connections and NTSC for live video feeds.

The FIRST-Multimedia switch complies with ATM Forum UNI 3.0 and 3.1 switched
virtual circuit signaling and LAN emulation standards to ensure
interoperability with existing LAN data applications and other vendors' ATM
products.  These include switches and adaptors from IBM, Cisco, Bay, FORE, UB
Networks, AT&T, Adaptec, Efficient and Sun.  Because the switch is
software-based, users are assured of an easy migration path as standards
evolve.

The FIRST-Multimedia Gateway server has been enhanced to include PRI/T1
support.  The Gateway server is an ATM-Telecom Gateway that distributes remote
H.320 videoconferencing streams for the Telco WAN to the desktop over a local
ATM network.  It adds ISDN PRI and T1 WAN rates, enabling room-system quality
wide-area videoconferencing and greater capacity for multimedia traffic and
users.  The FIRST-Multimedia Gateway server enables desktop videoconferencing
clients to communicate through the server instead of a direct ISDN line for
local and WAN conferencing.  This allows ISDN lines to be shared among PCs,
eliminating the need and cost of running a separate ISDN line to each desktop.

The FIRST-WWW server enables Internet users to cache data, graphics and video
streams off of the Web in the FIRST-Multimedia storage server. This storage
cache helps facilitate fast access and playback by any users on the ATM or LAN
network. Users can now store and share commonly-used video streams, as well as
documents that incorporate video, data and images using standard Internet
browsers.

In addition to being QoS manager for out-of-the-box applications running over
ATM, MOS now enables live video streams to be encoded into MPEG-1 realtime and
then distributes them to various desktops within the organization using ATM's
point-to-multipoint features.  PC users can receive broadcast video while
performing any network activity.

FIRST-H.320 introduces development capabilities via a software developer's
tool kit for store and forward of H.320 streams.  This will allow applications
such as video mail and video session storage.  Videoconferencing users will
enjoy the same benefits as voice mail users and be able to leave a video
message.

PictureTel and FVC's partnership have allowed incorporation of room systems
into the network.  Multiple room systems, such as PictureTel's Venue*2000
systems can be connected to each other or to desktop systems through an ATM
network.

The family of FIRST-Multimedia switches is available this month and range from
$7,000 to $16,000 based on configuration options. The Gateway server will also
be available this month for $12,000. FVC's other new products and pricing will
be available in the first quarter of this year.

StrataCom Offers SVC Switching


To address increasing user requirements for more robust ATM networks,
StrataCom today announced the availability and full support of switched
virtual circuit (SVC) switching to automate connection setup and
configuration.  ATM SVCs provide three key benefits for carriers and end
users:  scalability, flexibility and ease of use.  StrataCom expects to
commence beta-testing of ATM SVCs with select customers in the first quarter
of this year.  In addition, StrataCom has unveiled ATM signaling and security
features that give users more flexibility and control across their ATM
wide-area networks.  These new features give companies the ability to prevent
unauthorized access among users.

Available as a system software upgrade, StrataCom's ATM SVCs will support ATM
user-to-network (UNI) interfaces ranging from T1/E1 (1.544/2.0 Mbps) and T3/E3
(45/34 Mbps) to OC-3/STM-1 (155 Mbps).  StrataCom ATM SVC signaling also
includes compliance with both ATM UNI 3.0 and 3.1 with translation between
these standards.  The company also said it will support ATM SVC signaling for
ATM Frame UNI and ATM Inverse Multiplexed interfaces with the delivery of
these products in the first quarter of 1996.  StrataCom also announced support
for the Interim Inter-Switch Signaling Protocol that provides interoperability
with other vendor's ATM switches and the Interim Local Management Interface
protocol for ATM connection management.

While permanent virtual circuits or PVCs must be pre-established and manually
configured, SVCs make use of ATM signaling information within each ATM cell
allowing connections to be automatically setup on-demand by switches as ATM
calls are requested by the user.  While router architectures aggregate many
users' traffic, the use of ATM SVCs permits a separate connection for each
pair of users and each application.  This allows quality of service guarantees
which are essential for multimedia communications.  Though PVCs remain
attractive for customers with a limited number of interconnected devices, as
many more users come online - as is evidenced by the growth of the Internet -
SVCs become a critical requirement.  SVCs significantly reduce network
administration by eliminating manual configuration of connections while
increasing the flexibility by which devices can be added to the network
providing quicker connectivity to all other devices.

New ATM Security Features.  Through the use of address screening (source and
destination), customers will now be able to specify, by port, a list of ATM
addresses from which users are allowed (or not allowed) to receive or initiate
SVC calls.  This feature will become a mandatory requirement in public
networking environments where large numbers of users from different companies
are connected into the same ATM service having access to all other ATM
connected devices.  StrataCom will also implement additional ATM security
mechanisms specified by the ATM Forum's new Security Working Group.

high-speed (100 Mbps) FDDI networks.  The Sun FDDI adaptors offer direct
connectivity to FDDI networks through NPI's wire-speed architecture.  Two
adaptor types are being introduced:  a single-attach and dual-attach SBus
card.  Dual-attach versions protect against network failures with FDDI's dual
ring topology.  The adaptors support Solaris 2.3 and later releases of the
operating system, as well as Solaris 1.1 and later 1.x releases.  The adaptors
include the SunNet Manager software proxy agent for FDDI management for Sun
networks and use the FDDI SMT standard for monitoring FDDI nodes.  Protocols
supported include OSL, X.25 and TCP/IP.  Conformance to ANSI FDDI standards
ensures interoperability with products from multiple vendors.

NPI offers FDDI adaptors for popular bus architectures including EISA, ISA,
MCA and PCI, as well as SBus.  When the adaptors are used with NPI's
concentrators and EIFO workgroup switching hubs, shared servers can be
clustered on an FDDI backbone to optimize server-to-server communications over
FDDI while simultaneously providing Ethernet clients high-speed access to all
FDDI servers.  The EIFO+ switching hub implements an IP fragmentation scheme
(4,500-byte FDDI packets fragmented into multiple 1,500-byte Ethernet packets)

Special Effects Company Buys NetStar's GigaRouter


Digital Domain, a special effects company, has purchased a NetStar Inc.'s
(NASDAQ:  NTSR) GigaRouter to accommodate its large computer storage and
bandwidth requirements.  The GigaRouter is a media-independent, high-speed
network router.  Its unique architecture allows up to 16 simultaneous
transfers at a data rate of up to 800 Mbps for each of 16 ports.  Digital
Domain - creator of special effects for such motion pictures as True Lies,
Interview with the Vampire, and Apollo 13 - has installed the GigaRouter to
provide dynamic routing and improve the performance of its network, which
involves numerous photographic, computer graphic and other intermediate
elements.  As the centerpiece of the Digital Domain network, the GigaRouter is
being used to connect Silicon Graphics Power Challenge and Onyx workstations
to FDDI rings.  HIPPI to FDDI and ATM routing with the GigaRouter will be
tested later as Digital Domain moves to adopt ATM as an integral part of its
connection to off-site computer servers and clients.  More information about

SMC Intends to Sell Business Unit to Cabletron


Standard Microsystems Corp.  (SMC) (NASDAQ:  SMSC) has signed a letter of
intent for the sale of its Enterprise Networks Business Unit to Cabletron
Systems.  Under the terms of the agreement, Cabletron Systems would acquire
the business unit, including its products and technologies, for $77.5 million
in cash.  Over the past few years, the company's difficulties in delivering
and supporting the products from the Enterprise Networks Business Unit have
adversely affected SMC's overall operating results.  Thus, the company
anticipates that the successful completion of this transaction with Cabletron
Systems will have an immediate beneficial effect on SMC's profitability, while
simultaneously helping Cabletron Systems achieve its business goals.  SMC
plans to use the proceeds from this transaction to take advantage of the
rapidly growing demand for the semiconductor integrated circuit products of
the company's Component Products Division and to continue to grow the
company's other two System Products' business units.  The Component Products
Division is manufacturing capacity-limited, and the proceeds from this
transaction will allow SMC to significantly increase the levels of production
from its semiconductor wafer foundry suppliers.  As a further result of this
transaction, the System Products Division will be able to amplify its new
product development efforts and strengthen its sales and marketing channels in
the expanding market for advanced desktop and workgroup networking solutions.
The closing of this transaction is subject to the execution of the definitive
agreement and the receipt of regulatory approvals.

N.E.T. and Cisco Announce Agreements


N.E.T.  and Cisco Systems Inc.  have announced two agreements - one to extend
the N.E.T.  license to the full suite of Cisco Internetwork Operating System
(Cisco IOS) software, and a reseller agreement whereby N.E.T.  will resell and
support Cisco's full line of enterprise-level internetworking products.  Cisco
and N.E.T.  currently have a successful router software license agreement
dating since 1989 focusing on delivering internetworking expertise to both
companies' customers.  The N.E.T.  IDNX multiservice bandwidth manager
equipped with the N.E.T.  LAN/WAN Exchange (LWX) module is a wide-area
multiservice platform featuring a fully integrated router based on Cisco
software.  This high degree of integration gives IDNX customers
internetworking connectivity to Cisco router networks for WAN applications.

The relationship between Cisco and N.E.T.  now includes a reseller agreement
whereby N.E.T.  will sell and distribute the entire family of Cisco
internetworking products offered to enterprise-level customers.  N.E.T.  will
add value by helping customers design and integrate Cisco internetworking
products directly into IDNX multiservice backbone networks and offer contract
service direct from N.E.T.  The N.E.T.  LWX module optimizes internetwork
traffic for the WAN to give N.E.T.  IDNX customers the added benefit of
intelligent bandwidth management of router traffic for maximum trunk
utilization.  While being transported over the WAN, the router traffic can be
mixed with frame relay traffic, other types of cell or packetized traffic and
conventional circuit-switched traffic such as voice and video traffic to help
organizations save on long distance charges.  This attribute benefits
enterprise customers and global carrier/network service provider customers
alike.  As a result, Cisco networks concentrating large volumes of LAN-based
traffic can interconnect with intelligent N.E.T.  IDNX networks that carry WAN
traffic on high-capacity T1/E1 or T3/E3 digital service links.  In particular,
LAN traffic can be carried on the same trunks as voice traffic, frame relay
traffic and ISDN traffic for network optimization, efficiency, and cost
savings.

The Cisco enterprise-level internetworking products include the Cisco 7000
series of multiprotocol routers.  It also includes Cisco's access product
family, which offers an extensive selection of platforms and software sets for
regional offices, remote branch offices, and individual users.  The N.E.T.
IDNX family of multiservice bandwidth managers consists of five models with
networking functions that combine efficient multiplexing, intelligent
call-routing, LAN internetworking and routing, frame relay switching, ISDN
signaling and network management.  The IDNX systems are part of the N.E.T.
Vista Architecture, a multiservice architecture for broadband and narrowband
wide area networks.  See N.E.T.'s Web site:  http://www.net.com for further
information.

Digital Link Releases Lower than Expected Fourth Quarter Results


Digital Link Corp.  (NASDAQ:  DLNK) has released lower than expected operating
results for the fourth quarter ending Dec.  31, 1995.  The company attributed
the decline in net sales and net income to a weaker than expected demand from
certain domestic carrier customers and to a worsening of the previously
announced slowdown in its SMDS and ATM product lines, which are sold
predominately internationally.  Based on information currently available, the
company expects to report net sales of approximately $10.0 million and net
income of approximately $500,000 for its fourth quarter.  These results
represent decreases from the comparable results in the third quarter ended
Sept.  30, 1995, and the fourth quarter ended Dec.  31, 1994.  These continued
uncertainties internationally, especially in the SMDS marketplace, and weaker
carrier demand are expected to adversely effect the company's operating
results for at least the next two quarters.  Digital Link will report fourth
quarter earnings on or about Jan.  24, 1996.

BELLCORE REFINES VIDEOCONFERENCING TOOLS

CHICAGO -- Bellcore, the research arm of the Bell companies, last
week revealed two technologies under development in its labs that
will enhance videoconferencing.

One, called the "Video Window," is a special video room with
lifelike audio and a curved wide screen, for displaying life-size
images of groups of from six to 12 people.

The other is a computer program called Rendezvous, designed to
create the "conversational props" that Bellcore believes
videoconferees must have in order to exchange graphic
information.

The two technologies, demonstrated here at the National
Communications Forum earlier this month, both arise from what
Bellcore researchers say is a psychological assessment of
videoconferencing user needs.

Referring to the Video Window, Eric Addeo, Bellcore's district
manager for visual services research, said researchers found that
videoconferees "want to be able to see the person and have a
sense of eye contact."

The Bellcore researchers emphasized that neither technology is
far from commercialization.  According to Addeo, the Video Window
can run at speeds from 45 megabits per second to 384 kilobit per
second, a quarter of a T1 line.  Video Window, he added, is based
on the CCITT H.261 standard, codecs for which will be available
by late next year.

Video Window's 64 Kbps voice channel, meanwhile, offers full-
duplex audio that is unaffected by increases in volume, he added.

In his presentation on Rendezvous, Bellcore's Louis Gomez
demonstrated the software in a application where two children in
separate homes connected their computers over phone lines and
played the card game "fish."  Rendezvous allowed each player to
have a personalized display that showed only the faces of their
own cards, while also giving them a view of the common "pool,"
where they discarded cards.

In business videoconferencing, Gomez elaborated, Rendezvous could
be used to create a conversational prop such as a shared "white
board," a part of each party's viewing screen where they could
make real-time drawings or notes.

The use of conversational props will lengthen telephone calls and
increase demand for broadband service, predicted Gomez, a manager
in human-computer systems research.

Addeo, meanwhile, emphasized the user friendliness of a Video
Window room, which automatically connects with its remote
counterpart the minute its door is opened.

Bellcore tests, he elaborated, showed users pleased with Video
Window -- and willing to buy it.  Since Bellcore cannot
manufacture products, Addeo said the organization hopes it can
induce a telecommunications company to bring the technology to
market.  To that end, Bellcore will hold a seminar on Video
Window Oct. 10.

VIDEOCONFERENCING INTEGRATOR DESIGNS FOR WIDE RANGE OF USERS

While TV news crews in Kuwait broadcast live reports on the Iraqi
invasion, General Norman Schwarzkopf was using satellite-based
video to ready American armed forces for the coming war.

Schwarzkopf was using the live video link -- essentially, a
videoconference -- to command American military forces during a
computerized war game, in which generals fought against a
software "enemy" and no troops were deployed.

The war game -- done strictly on computers to keep costs and
personal risks low -- involved commanders at three U.S. Air Force
bases in northern Florida, one of them Schwarzkopf's command
post.

When Iraq invaded, the general ordered his personal staff of
commanders, located "behind the lines" at a Tampa, Fla., airbase,
to give him the "real stuff," according to Kenneth Lucas, senior
program manager at CAE Link, a designer of military training
systems.  A secure satellite link was set up between Tampa and
the general's field headquarters to feed maps and other graphic
information to Schwarzkopf.

CAE Link, whose name is more frequently associated with flight
simulators, designed that videoconferencing system -- the first,
Lucas believes, to be used in a combat simulation.

In the aftermath of the war game, Col. Dennis Foggy, chief of the
support division of the Joint Warfare Center, which organized the
event, said he found "videoconferencing works well conjunction
with war game simulation because exercize participants can see
and share data and information in real time, in color and without
delay."

The videoconferenced portion of the war game was carried at 384
kilobits per second and ran non-stop for 10 days with no
problems, the Joint Warfare Center said.  More recently, the
system was run at a low 256 Kbps for a second simulated war game
"with only minimum sacrifice to video quality," Foggy says.

The American subsidiary of a Canadian aerospace firm, CAE Link
designs training systems, mainly for the military, and assembles
custom videoconferencing systems, largely for use in "distance
learning."  Distance learning uses videoconferencing technology
to link a teacher in one classroom with students in remote
classrooms, often in areas too sparsely settled to have such
instruction.

Schools Via Satellite

Among its distance learning clients are the Western Kentucky
Educational Consortium, universities in Alabama, Tennessee and
Florida and the Nebraska State Telecommunications and Education
Commission, whose 11-site system is the largest the company has
installed to date and involves satellite broadcasts to some
remote areas of the state.

Another system put together by Binghamton, N.Y.-based CAE Link
lets anyone anywhere in the United States study for a masters
degree in instructional technology at Boise State University --
without relocating to Idaho.  Students attend classes in their
homes via computer conferencing.

Systems integration is especially important in distance learning
because off-the-shelf videoconferencing products usually are
designed for corporate meetings, Lucas says.

The equipment is often built into a roll-about cart and cannot
provide coverage to an entire classroom, where anyone may
suddenly ask a question, Lucas said.  A particularly thorny
problem in those settings is audio, since some students may
speak-out too quietly or be located too far from a microphone,
adds Operations Manager Rich Grace.

CAE Link's distance learning systems are composed of equipment
from various suppliers, including PictureTel and VideoTelecom.
The hardware is in turn matched with the right telecommunications
medium for the job, from T1 to switched 56 kilobit lines, or
whatever the customer already has in place.

While educational institutions can design distance learning
systems themselves, Lucas said "the problem [for customers] is
knowing what to buy -- we've been through that via trial and
error."

Because of its training systems business, CAE Link employs
instructional designers, who can advise first-time distance
learning buyers on how to teach remotely, Lucas said.  One tip:
have instructors teaching a classroom of students at the
broadcast site.

To assist the activities of the company's training side,
meanwhile, it hosts a videoconferencing room on the Sprint
Meeting Channel at the Alexandria, Va., headquarters of its
Training Systems Division.

In another intra-company synergy, CAE Link's national network of
flight simulator support centers also support its
videoconferencing systems.

A typical distance learning network put together by the company
is its first installation, which which links a Navy classroom in
Newport News, Va., with seven other classrooms in the East from
Rhode Island to Florida.

Switched Video Signals

Using a "video PBX," which switches the signal to the appropriate
sites, an instructor in one classroom can simultaneously teach at
other sites, with cameras at each site giving him visual contact
with his students once a minute.  The satellite-based network
itself is encrypted and can link up to three classes
simultaneously, Lucas noted.

The network, which provides instruction to sailors and
videoconferencing for officers, last year made its first
broadcast to a Navy ship, albeit one in port at the Norfolk, Va.,
naval base.  There the signal went, via cable, from a dish on the
dock to a classroom three stories below deck.

In its final stages of preparation, though, is a new system that
will take the company from the education into the medical sector.
That system, which is expected to make headlines late this month,
will use videoconferencing technology to let doctors to do a
"remote diagnosis," a benefit to rural areas and other locales
where there are few physicians.

VIDEOCONFERENCING APPLICATIONS CREATE VERTICAL MARKET SEGMENTS

As it matures, the videoconferencing market has become more
segmented, with vendors targetting specific industries from
education and government to pharmaceuticals.

Market segmentation is "just starting to happen in
videoconferencing, where different vendors' strengths in
different market areas are becoming apparent..." observes Jim
Posko, marketing manager at AT&T Business Video.

One supplier, Compression Labs Inc. (CLI), says in its latest
annual report that its "base business has benefitted
substantially from major thrusts made by CLI into selected
vertical markets such as government and education."

What are the hot vertical markets?  Henry Grove III, vice
president of the audio/video systems division of Peirce-Phelps
Inc., a well-known systems integrator, cites pharmaceuticals,
defense, finance, insurance and aerospace.

Greg Cline, an analyst with Information Strategies Group in
Vienna, Va., sees vertical markets in government, executive
communications, project management, distance learning, strategic
defense, comand and control, emergency management and law
enforcement.  And Dataquest Inc., the San Jose, Calif., market
research firm, cites retailing, transportation, electronics and
communications.

The university and distance learning markets are hot, and state
government is about to heat up, says Gail Cisel, a product
manager in charge of the state government, university and
correctional facility markets for US Sprint.

Sprint is about to announce videoconferencing support over the
State Interconnected Government Network (SIGN), a program of
discounts on customer premise equipment and usage time, and guest
speakers with applications background that targets government.

Market-Watching From Afar

Within a vertical market, videoconferencing is often used to
maintain contact with branch offices and across time zones.
AT&T's Posko, for instance, notes that one investment house makes
"morning video calls to London, where it gets updated on how the
Far Eastern and European stock exchanges fared during the night.
That analysis allows it to determine how to react as the Wall
Street exchanges open."

Insurance companies "being decentralized ... saw the usefulness
of videoconferencing to introduce new products and policies to
take them to the field [offices]," Grove elaborates.  American
General and Aetna, he says, have videoconferencing in over 40
locations.

Segmenting the market is not only done by industry, Grove
explains.  "There are applications that cross industries, such as
legal applications," he observes.  "You can find these
applications in corporate legal departments, in law firms and in
courts."

Another way the market is segmented is by bandwidth.  Kathleen
Flaherty, vice president of large accounts at MCI Communications
Corp., says PictureTel's products and MCI's Switched 56 service
are positioned to support the fastest growing market segment:
meetings using videoconferencing speeds of 384 kilobits per
second and slower.

Factors Of Size, Speed

AT&T's Posko also sees the market as segmented by bandwidth.
"There's group conferencing with a single screen used for small
groups of one to four people that are highly interactive and
spontaneous meetings, but use 112 Kbps.  Next is the departmental
level with three to six people at each end.  It's more formal,
used for project overviews, staff meetings and this type of
meeting would be a bit higher bandwidth and probably include a
dual-screen setup.

"Corporate conferencing is next.  It's more expensive, uses dual
or triple screens, is for up to 12 people and uses higher
bandwidths too," he says.

Other suppliers are pointing to a different advantage:
application-specific public video rooms.  "A unique network has
sprung up," says Todd Clayton, vice president of marketing for
VideoTelecom.

"Depositions are usually taken by lawyers getting on planes with
court reporters to visit witnesses in person for testimonies.
But court reporter firms have set up a network called LINC [Legal
Image Network Communications] to take video depositions," says
Clayton, who envisions similar networks serving personnel
recruiters or real-estate brokers.

(The Miami-based LINC network uses VideoTelecom codecs and
consists of rooms installed in the offices of about 20 different
independent court reporters.)

Another product differentiator, high resolution graphics, cuts
across markets horizontally, says Grove.  High-resolution
graphics, he elaborates, are important to any industry "that
conducts meetings with a lot of spreadsheets, wants to display
hard copies, or looks at documentation of any sort ... ."  This
includes the Defense Department, insurance industry, and even
NASA, which has been using high-resolution graphics systems
before any launch, he says.

NASA has had "interactive sign-offs with any top officials since
the Challenger disaster," he adds.

Tim McElgunn, an analyst at market researcher Datapro, says
videoconferencing suppliers are increasingly making other
companies partners in their vertical market strategy, seeking out
those with compatible corporate cultures.  "VideoTelecom, for
instance, is PC LAN- [and] data communications-oriented and
therefore goes after firms with the same mindset of technology
implementation -- smaller firms with a PC orientation," he
observes.

One set of partners with a key role are resellers, some of whom
are doing the actual vertical marketing themselves.  "None of the
vendors are huge," explains McElgunn, "so they rely on their Bell
[company] contacts who jointly market their products to Bell
accounts.  Feedback from these resellers will tell vendors what
specific features an individual industry wants."

System Matches Application

VideoTelecom's Clayton, meanwhile, credits resellers with his
firm's success in the education market.  "We have designed a user
interface that's tailored to instructor training," he explains.
"We were able to create a solution for their particular needs."

One systems integrator Videoconferencing Systems, Inc. (VSI), of
Norcross, Ga., says it is targeting markets by exhibiting at
trade shows, including the Computer and Office Systems Show in
Atlanta.  According to Marketing Coordinator Norah Sowa, the
company is aiming for the legal, state governments,
pharmaceutical, medical and education vertical markets.

Another partner in vertical marketing can be a helpful trade
association.  For instance, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association, "helped the industry embrace [videoconferencing]
technology several years ago," says Peirce-Phelps' Grove.
"Merck, Ciba-Geigy and a few others saw videoconferencing relate
to the product development cycle [by] shortening it.  And if that
cycle is cut by even a week, these firms save a million dollars."

For the future, Dataquest sees an expanded vertical market for
videoconferencing among more small and midsize organizations, who
will be attracted as the prices of these products decline and
lower  speed transmission becomes more available.

Reduced transmission costs can only expand the market said a
spokesman for PictureTel, which is based in Peabody, Mass.  "When
you can sell videoconferencing to customers using two telephone
lines that cost only $20 an hour from coast to coast at 112 Kbps,
then you can sell lower down the line to [departmental]
managers," the spokesman says.

"And distance learning applies here as well," he adds.  "We're
finding that 112 Kbps is great for educational systems that don't
have a whole lot of money to burn."

INSURER'S VIDEOCONFERENCING CUTS TRAVEL TIME, BOOSTS TRAINING

In the last three years, John Hancock Financial Services of
Boston has relied on first one, then two business television
(BTV) networks to bring its 17,000 employees closer together.

This company -- whose insurance business alone has $32 billion in
assets -- has used an in-house television studio for more than 20
years.  Yet by upgrading its equipment to handle live
transmissions, John Hancock's group and retail insurance
companies and some of its other businesses have realized BTV's
advantages -- savings in travel costs, reaching 30 times as many
people for each class, and a decreasing need to take seminars on
the road to regional locations for weeks at a time.

With its point-to-multipoint system, the company uses two
satellite networks for product update meetings, field sales
training, sales contest updates, recruiting and a wide variety of
corporate communications events.  The company has held about 70
broadcasts since 1988.

This one-way video, two-way audio system can delivery full-motion
video from corporate headquarters to 42 field offices.  Several
hundred people watching a broadcast can ask questions, even
though they can't be seen on screen.

John Hancock rents satellites by the hour or the half-day only
when needed.  The company owns neither a satellite or an uplink
transmitter.  Field offices have been equipped with satellite
dishes on the roof or in a parking lot and electronics that
descramble the picture and allow them to select the right
channel.

Usually 25 or 30 people at each office can watch a live
presentation on a 25-inch color TV, or tape it off the satellite
on a VCR.

"The typical format is about 80 percent live material, which
usually means [having] people in our studio talking," said Frank
King, John Hancock's general director of corporate
communications, who manages the two satellite networks.

"People in the field can talk via a special telephone hookup from
their offices," he said.  "We also have pre-taped news segments
or information about a new computer application, for example.
Almost every broadcast has a live question and answer period at
the end."

The company invested in BTV network equipment rather than two-way
interactive videoconferencing because it was more economical, and
it was a natural fit for linking its distant locations.  The
company is also adding about 100 new satellites in the
continental United States to the system.

"We have a single headquarters in Boston and our 17,000 employees
and retail sales organizations are spread over great distances,
which dictated a point-to-multipoint set up," King said.  "In the
vast majority of cases, we don't need to see the field people; we
just need to hear them."

John Hancock management currently is weighing the pros and cons
of having videoconferencing rooms that could accommodate two-way
video as well.

"Since we do not have regional headquarters organizations,
there's no crying need for an interactive video system.  Even if
we decide to do it, we wouldn't do away with BTV," King said.
"The difference would still be the ability to hold two-way
meetings with fewer people as opposed to bringing a broadcast to
several hundred in more than 100 locations."

MID-SIZED OFFICE BUILDINGS NEXT STEP IN BELL CANADA FIBER ROLL-
OUT

CHICAGO -- If a telco has deployed fiber to large office
buildings -- a typical first step -- its next step should be to
focus on medium-sized office buildings, rather than homes.  At
least, that is the conclusion of Bell Canada, which expects to
begin deploying fiber to mid-sized office buildings in major
Canadian cities later this year.

In the long term, Bell Canada wants to bring fiber to homes,
rather than just to the curb, even though it expects this to be
the more costly strategy, said Bernard Chenevert, the company's
associate director of network systems research.

Bell Canada, however, lacks a major incentive that could promote
the deployment of fiber to homes.  For instance, it cannot
broadcast video, said Chenevert, who spoke at a panel
presentation on fiber implementation at the National
Communications Forum here last week.

Were telcos not constrained by such regulation, Chenevert said it
might make technical and economic sense for a telco to use its
fiber network to distribute a cable TV operator's signals to
homes.

Last year the company put its fiber-to-the-home plans on
indefinite hold, aiming instead for mid-sized buildings having
1,500 to 3,000 lines.  Tests have since shown the company can
bring fiber to a mid-sized building for nearly the cost of using
copper wire, he said.

Besides supplying telephone service, the fiber Bell Canada is
running to office buildings will be used to support
videoconferencing, DS-1 services and data services, Chenevert
said.  After it brings fiber to mid-sized office buildings, the
next step in Bell Canada's fiber deployment plan is to aim for
large and medium-sized apartment buildings, he said.

NTT DEBUTS 3-D TV AT TELECOM '91 -- SANS GLASSES

GENEVA -- I have seen the future and it nearly hit me in the
face.  Well, it seemed to.

Dancers writhed, flower arrangements twirled, swordsmen menaced
me with their weapons.  All on television -- jumping out of the
screen.

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) is showing off three-
dimensional television here at Telecom '91, the world's largest
telecom trade show.

In two small booths, reminiscent of  the alcoves where AT&T's
Picturephone was demonstrated at the 1964 New York World's Fair,
NTT displayed a three-dimensional, full-color, full-motion
television picture that can be viewed without special glasses.

The screen is roughly the size of a 14-inch personal computer
monitor turned on end, 15 inches diagonally to be exact.  The
whole package, minus the electronics hidden behind the display,
is about the size of a large carry-on airline bag.

Don't look for this television in stores.  "This is only a
prototype.  We think we can do much better," said Nobuji
Tetsutani, senior research engineer in NTT's Visual Media
Laboratory in Kanagawa, Japan.  The required 4 megaHertz analog
signal, received by the TV via cable, requires too much bandwidth
and has other limitations that now make it impractical as a
consumer product.

The viewer must stand about three feet to four feet from the
screen.  Outside that range, the 3-D effect is lost.  The
television's picture is bright and clear with approximately the
resolution of a fair-quality home TV.

Separate sets of pixels -- one for each eye -- and an unusual,
full-length lenticular lens appear to release the dancers,
flowers and swordsmen from the screen's bounds.  The lens
surfaces bend the light from the pixels so that each eye sees a
different set of pixels.

NTT says an infrared sensor detects head movements and adjusts
the images left  or right to compensate for head movement.  In
practice, this works poorly.  When I moved, portions of the
screen dimmed momentarily.  When I moved two feet to the right of
the screen, still sitting about three feet in front of it, the
mirage collapsed into a flat picture.

The picture need not be viewed in darkness.  NTT said the device
produces  "compelling images in a bright room," although the
booths were dimly lit.

CONSUMER ONLINE AUDIENCE TOPS 11.3 MILLION USERS, UP 79% DURING
1995

By Gary H. Arlen, Senior Contributing Editor

     Expanded marketing campaigns by the leading consumer online
services during the fourth quarter, plus brisk response to the
launch of the Microsoft Network (MSN), brought the consumer online
audience to 11,304,200 customers at the end of 1995 - a staggering
78.9 percent increase above the 6,320,650 tally at the end of 1994. 
During the fourth quarter of 1995, for the second consecutive
period, the subscriber base grew at a rate of 15 percent.

     As the biggest online services get bigger, smaller ventures
(mostly ones with regional or specialty focus) continue to survive,
validating that niche services with unique content and reasonable
prices can survive, if not thrive.  The six largest national/global
online services now represent 96.9 percent of the customer base, up
from 92 percent three months ago.  The three largest operators
alone reach 10.1 million users, or 89.3 percent of the total
audience.

     America Online Inc. (AOL) continued to fuel the growth at an
18 percent pace; the company expects to pass the 5 million user
mark by early February - benefiting (as are all the major
operators) from the sign-ups by consumers who got new computers or
modems during the recent holiday season.  MSN jumped 200 percent in
the October-November-December period, to 600,000 users.

     Not only has the subscriber base grown, so has the usage.  AOL
last month marked the first time its single-day accesses exceeded
1 million hours - a benchmark accompanied by denied log-ons and
slow processing, as many users have noted.

     CompuServe Inc.'s growth was boosted by strong overseas
increases, especially in Europe, where its subscriber base climbed
by 25 percent.  AOL is expected to begin registering offshore users
this year, either directly or through its alliances in Europe,
Australia and other regions.

     Among the largest systems, Prodigy Services Co. dropped
slightly, amid reports by IISR sources that its parent companies
are seeking to sell (or possibly give away) the operation.  GEnie,
which has been unable to attract a buyer in the last several
months, continues to limp along at about 70,000 users.

Dramatic Changes On the Way

     The year-end tally comes just as the nature and direction of
online services is about to change dramatically.  The online
industry's relationship to Internet services (beyond offering World
Wide Web and Internet access) still is being refined.  In addition,
existing operations will be overhauled, starting with this month's
migration of Delphi Internet Services Corp. into parent company
News Corp./MCI Online Venture's Web-based "iGuide" service.

     Online newspapers and banking services also are showing
increasing vitality.  Several publishers are abandoning or cutting
back their traditional online services (notably the Los Angeles
Times backing off from Prodigy) to concentrate on Web sites.  Other
major publishers, notably The New York Times, are preparing for
their imminent Web debuts while maintaining online presence (such
as @Times on AOL, in this case).

     USA Today stopped charging for its proprietary service as it
concentrates on its Web site.  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch's
PostLink system, one of the earliest online newspaper services,
closed at the end of December to be replaced by a Web site during
the next few months.

     Nearly 40 major banks are just starting to roll out services
based on the software deals made last year to build home banking
systems based on Microsoft Corp.'s "Money," Intuit Corp.'s
"Quicken" or Meca Software LLC's "Managing Your Money" financial
programs.  The pioneering banks still are leery about revealing
initial sign-up responses.

Around the Online Circuit

     Delphi Internet (which has existed in various incarnations
since 1982), officially will be absorbed this month by "iGuide,"
the Web-based service that has been developed by News Corp./MCI
Online Ventures.  Existing customers have been invited to
participate in a beta test of the new service.  Since Delphi itself
has done no promotion since early 1995, attrition has lowered the
user base.

     Prodigy's 7 percent drop in users comes despite a new
marketing campaign aimed at finding younger, hipper customers; the
decline indicates that customers are churning off at a faster pace
than new ones are signing on.  Part of the problem with measuring
Prodigy's precise audience is the company's acknowledgment that it
reaches about 1.6 million homes; Prodigy also contends that each
household has about two users, up slightly from the 1.8 average of
the past few years.  A company spokesman insists that the company's
"official" tally is "more than 2 million users," even though the
data suggest that just over 3 million customers (1.6 million homes
with two users each) access the service.

     Prodigy officials also decline to discuss the company's future
ownership status.  Independent sources indicate that IBM Corp. and
Sears, Roebuck & Co. have been unable to find any buyers for
Prodigy.  Sears even attempted to unload its interest to IBM. 
There even have been indications that the broker representing
IBM/Sears has offered to "give away" the service to another online
company if a suitable arrangement could be developed for IBM/Sears
to own a share of the acquiring entity.  None of the companies
involved will discuss the 1996 outlook for Prodigy.

     GEnie's fate is similarly fuzzy, although parent General
Electric Information Services Co. is trying to spruce up the
operation before a sale.  Connection speeds of up to 28.8 kilobits
per second (Kbps) were introduced in late 1995, and full Internet
access has been implemented.  Earlier in the year, GEnie introduced
a new graphical user interface and eliminated prime-time
surcharges.  The company claims it has the "biggest group of loyal
members" among the nationwide online services - a selling point in
its effort to find a buyer.

     CompuServe is adding 200,000 subscribers per month and now has
reached 4,000,000 subscribers.  Of these, 200,000 are in the United
Kingdom and 300,000 elsewhere in Europe.  The company said it
"plans to double" the United Kingdom figure in the next 12 months,
and has added machine translation capabilities to translate
electronic mail, forum messages and other documents between
English, French, Spanish and German at the user's request.

     ImagiNation Network (INN) has been testing lower weekday rates
from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. for its subscribers who do not use preferred
access nodes of parent company AT&T Corp.  The special rates, which
began Nov. 22, 1995, are scheduled to expire Jan. 15.  INN is
evaluating whether to continue the lower rates or adopt another
marketing incentive.

     Reuters Money Network will introduce several new services
during the coming months as part of an overall upgrade of the
service; details are not yet available.

     New York Online has stopped promoting its current online
service as it makes the transition to a Web site, due to debut at
the end of January.  Web content will be updated daily.  The
company now calls its 2-year-old online service "an intermediate
step" to the Web and "more of a brochure."

     Mnematics Videotex Inc. has added points of presence in
Rockland and Orange counties, New York, expanding the reach of its
metropolitan New York City service.

     In addition to operating its own stand-alone service, MPGNet
provides interactive multiplayer games on the MSN; the company said
there are other providers of games to MSN but that only MPGNet has
interactive games.

     SeniorNet has 78 centers across the country and currently
serves about 5,000 subscribers.  The service, long available via
America Online Inc. (AOL), now also is accessible on the MSN and
via its Web site at www.seniornet.org.

     PSINet Inc., which recently launched a regional radio
advertising campaign for its consumer Internet access service, is
compiling an aggregate subscriber total for its three systems -
Pipeline USA, Pipeline New York and PSI InterRamp.  The company
will not break that count into each component service.

Community Services Grow Slowly

     Although the big push toward the Internet has not hindered the
creation of new regional and local services, most are including
Internet access in their offerings.

     The Well has put its conferencing system on its Web site,
which can be accessed at www.well.com.

     Hawaii FYI is "renovating" its service and logs about 160,000
minutes of use per month.  It has created a Web site, and bridged
the service with its Internet server Jan. 2.  Its subscriber base
of 15,000 "has been stable for about a year."

     Greater New Orleans Free-Net, which began in 1994 under the
aegis of the University of New Orleans, has become an independent
nonprofit organization and now reaches more than 12,000
subscribers.  Three major groups fund the organization:  the
Chamber of Commerce of New Orleans and the River Region, the New
Orleans Public Library and nine parish school boards.  The service
is text-based only; graphics are available only for content
providers that must also be nonprofit organizations.

     Heartland Regional Net (which has dropped its "free-net
appellation) now counts 8,500 subscribers, of whom 1,900 log on
each day.  It offers an enhanced level of service for users who
contribute $35 per year.  That fee covers two-thirds of its user
budget; 69 percent of those using the enhanced service sign up
again in succeeding years.

     National Capital Freenet of Ottawa celebrated reaching the
50,000-subscriber mark with a ceremony attended by the mayor of
Ottawa and other government officials.  The service expects to have
a Web site in operation by the end of the second quarter.

     Toronto Free-Net is developing a Web site through Lynx and
Gopher; it will be available in the first quarter.

Newspapers Finding More Web Homes

     USA Today Online has dropped all charges for its online
service, and it no longer main-tains a subscriber count.  Its Web
site (www.usatoday.com) contains 15,000 pages and is designed to be
supported by advertising revenues.  The Web site is averaging 1.6
million hits per day.

     TimesLink, the online service of the Los Angeles Times,
dropped its presence on the Prodigy platform Dec. 31.  TimesLink
will offer its current base of about 17,000 subscribers the
opportunity to participate in a beta test of its new Web site, now
under development and due to be available to the public late in the
first quarter.

     Houston Chronicle Interactive (HCI), the cyberarm of the
Houston Chronicle, unveiled a partnership with Prodigy in November
in an attempt to leverage the best of both the online and Web
worlds.  HCI, a Web-based service, promotes Prodigy as the
preferred method to access its Web site, and receives a bounty for
each new Prodigy subscriber it generates.  For its part, Prodigy
maintains an HCI-branded area on its service, allowing its members
to access the HCI Web site and providing the Texas newspaper with
a higher profile than possible on the Web alone.  The two companies
will share revenue based on traffic in the HCI Web site and the
HCI-branded area on Prodigy.

     Mercury Center, the online service of the San Jose Mercury
News, uses as its subscriber number the figure for all AOL
subscribers in the Mercury News circulation area.  The service
declines to disclose the number of hits on its own Web site.

     Electronic Trib, the online service of the Albuquerque
Tribune, has added business news from Financial Times.  The service
features prices of the 1,600 most active stocks on the New York
Stock Exchange and 3,000 of the largest mutual funds.

     Access Atlanta is redesigning its 1996 Olympics Web site and
developing new home pages, the first of which will go online by
March.

     PostLink, the online service of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
closed Dec. 31.  It is to be replaced by a Web site during the next
few months.

     StarText, the online service of the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram,
started its Web site in December (www.startext.net).  Rates are
$19.95 if StarText is the sole Internet provider and $4.95 for
readers who use another Internet provider.

     Tampa Bay Online developed a College Bowl Game package
covering all the New Year's weekend bowl activities.  It also
launched a Web site at www.tampatrib.com.

     Fred the Computer, the online service of the Middlesex News,
has 2,200 subscribers to its free service.  That figure represents
readers who have logged on through any of the six newspapers in the
Massachusetts region served by the parent Community Newspaper
Company.  The service has doubled the number of news groups
requested by local customers, and it currently is developing
Internet projects.  Content includes news, Usenet and e-mail
Internet access.

Telebanking Services Added in Some Regions

     Citibank on the PC, the free online banking service of
Citibank, quietly rolled out in Florida; service is being promoted
to customers in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties and the
cities of Clearwater and Madeira Beach.  Heavy promotion is slated
for the coming months after a low-key, unpromoted "live test" that
began last fall.

     Bank of America's "HomeBanking" online service is being
updated to integrate into commercial online and Internet services. 
The Internet package can be reached at www.bankamerica.com.  An
AOL-accessible version will debut by March; when that occurs, the
proprietary service, which has not been marketed for years, will be
restructured and promoted.

     Chase Direct, the heavily promoted online banking service of
Chase Manhattan Bank, has received 110,000 telephone queries and
7,400 e-mail inquiries about the service, and has mailed out 31,000
information kits.

     US Order has teamed with Colonial Data Technologies Corp. to
introduce Telesmart 4000, an analog display services interface
(ADSI) telephone with several advanced functions.  The phone can be
used to send e-mail via the Internet, pay bills and bank
electronically, type and send messages directly to pagers, shop
from catalogs electronically and receive advanced new forms of
Caller ID from telephone companies.  It can access electronic
directory assistance to search national databases and visually
display telephone numbers and addresses.

Outlook for 1996

     Aside from the fate of GEnie or Prodigy and or the shifting
status of the MSN, there is no reason to believe that the industry
will not continue to grow and its market presence expand in 1996.

     The largest services - AOL and Compuserve in particular - will
remain strong even as they try to weigh the trend toward Internet
and Web-based services and cement their relationships with content
suppliers and customers.

     At the same time, content suppliers are trying to determine
the best - and most valuable - outlets for their material.  The
generally small fees paid by commercial online operators may exceed
the pittance generated via the Web's current financial structure. 
Hence, some information providers may choose to stay with and
support online ventures because of the known (albeit small) revenue
they generate.

     And meanwhile, although brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont agreed
to drop its $200 million libel suit against Prodigy (see story, p.
8) for remarks made about the company on one of the company's
bulletin boards, the judge handling the case rejected Prodigy's
attempt to reargue his finding that Prodigy is a publisher and thus
responsible for all content on its bulletin boards, so the suit
technically is still alive.  However, the telecommunications reform
bill pending in Congress contains a clause that protects online
services from libel suits such as that filed by Stratton Oakmont,
and, if passed, that effectively would nullify the judge's attempt
to set a dangerous and expensive precedent for the online industry.

     This also will be the year the heavy hand of government will
be felt by the online services.  There has been a well-publicized
yearlong battle on the part of some members of Congress to curb
allegedly obscene material online.  But also looming are efforts by
federal lawmakers and regulators to control online shopping
services and ban online gambling outright.  Moreover, a number of
states are considering levying taxes on users of online services,
a move that could turn operators into tax collectors and dampen
consumer demand for online services.

INTERCHANGE OFFLINE NETWORK? 

      AT&T Corp. plans to take its Interchange Online Network, an
elegant, albeit it woefully undersubscrib-ed proprietary publishing
platform, offline.  AT&T's New Media Services division will instead
redirect its online efforts at developing Web-based services.

     "The Interchange Online Network as we know it today will phase
out over the course of the next year," said Michael Kolowich,
president of AT&T New Media Services.  By that time, he said, "the
Web will be a superior environment to online services." 

     Kolowich's comments were made during a teleconference to
announce that AT&T's fledgling online service for professionals,
AT&T Business Network, will be available as a Web-based service by
midyear.  By the close of 1996, Kolowich said, the Web will replace
the company's Interchange Online Network as the principle means of
distribution for the service, which will be known as AT&T Business
Network Version 2.

Business Network Moves to Web

     Exactly how much access to "Version 2" will cost has not been
disclosed, nor is it clear how much of Interchange's look and feel
will be retained in cyberspace.  The current Interchange-based
service costs $39.95 a month for 10 hours of use, and $2.95 for
each additional hour.  The Business Network offers Internet access,
the Netscape Navigator Web browser, and content from the likes of
Dow Jones & Co. Inc., Dun & Bradstreet Corp., Cable News Network
and others.  

     Whether New Media Services will charge for full access to its
pending Web-based service or adopt a pay-as-you-go approach also
has yet to be determined.  Although "Version 2" will be available
to anyone with Internet access and a Web browser, Kolowich said,
New Media Services plans to market the new Business Network service
together with AT&T's WorldNet Internet access service.

     Although the Jan. 4 announcement was designed to center around
the migration of the Business Network to the Web and all its
inherent advantages, the real news was the fact that Ma Bell
effectively has given Interchange the kiss of death.  Along with
Interchange, New Media Services also has abandoned its
much-explained-yet-much-misunderstood strategy of acting as a
proprietary publishing platform for other online services, a
business model that failed to bear much fruit, or attract many
subscribers.

     Indeed, since Interchange was launched last June, the combined
subscriber base of its various services that include  Ziff-Davis
Interactive, The Gartner Group, the Washington Post's Digital Ink
and Star-Tribune Online only numbers in the several tens of
thousands (AT&T won't say exactly how many), which is about as many
customers as America Online Inc. signs up in a good week.

     Kolowich said all of Interchange's "publishing partners" also
plan to launch Web-based services, and added that AT&T is
supporting their endeavors to that end.  The Gartner Group, for
one, announced just such a move earlier last week, and the
Star-Tribune released a similar statement hours after the AT&T
announcement (see story, p. 4).  When all AT&T and its "partners"
have abandoned ship for the Web, AT&T will pull the plug on
Interchange, a bleeding-edge product before the advent of the Web.

Taking a Write-Off

     Although New Media Services repeatedly has stressed its
commitment to open standards and Web-based products since its
inception little more than a year ago, the unit was in fact built
on a proprietary foundation - Interchange's software - for which
AT&T now is paying the price.  Kolowich acknowledged AT&T will be
taking an undisclosed write-off for Interchange, which the company
purchased from Ziff Communications Inc. for a reported $50 million
in late 1994. 

     An AT&T spokeswoman, however, stressed that New Media Services
will not be affected by the massive round of layoffs announced by
AT&T last week.

     New Media Services will release what is likely to be
Interchange's final upgrade later this quarter, and an upbeat
Kolowich claimed the division has received more than 100,000
requests for Business Network software in the past several weeks.

     With the announcement, AT&T joins an expanding club of online
service providers whose best-laid proprietary plans were undermined
by the phenomenal rise of the World Wide Web during the past year. 

      In December, Microsoft Corp. announced its intention to
reposition its Microsoft Network as a Web-based service.  In late
November, Europe Online, which had planned to launch a service
based on AT&T's software platform, prefigured its partner (and 9.8
percent shareholder) by abandoning Interchange in the 11th hour and
launching a Web-based service Dec. 15.  And in September, Apple
Computer Inc. announced that its eWorld online service will become
an Internet-based service by midyear.

     Although the "Big Three" proprietary online services continue
to add subscribers at a dizzying pace, some industry watchers
predict they eventually may be relegated to a role as gatekeepers
for the Web, packing and selling easy access to a greater wealth of
information than they ever could hope to assemble on their own.

INTERCHANGE PARTNERS PREPARE TO MOVE THEIR CONTENT TO WEB

      Once a captain announces he is abandoning ship, it's only
natural that his passengers won't be far behind.  So when AT&T New
Media Services announced it would move its AT&T Business Network
online service from its AT&T Interchange Online Network to the
World Wide Web, it was not surprising to learn that its "publishing
partners" are plotting similar moves.

     The Gartner Group Inc. unveiled plans last week - two days
prior to the AT&T announcement - to roll out a Web-based version of
its online service, @vantage, an online service offering analysis
and advice for information technology executives, by the second
quarter of this year.  Although Gartner said it has no plans to
abandon its presence on Interchange, at least while it exists, it
made clear that the future of the online world belongs to the Web.

     "While AT&T Interchange Online Network, the platform on which
@vantage was launched, is superior today, we expect the Internet to
become the pre-eminent platform from a functionality perspective,"
said Bruce Barlag, executive vice president of The Gartner Group's
Interactive Services.  "By the end of 1997, the Internet will be
the primary channel for the delivery of corporate information,
ranging from research reports to marketing literature," added Dave
Taylor, Garter's research area director for business operations.

Related Announcements Follow

     Another Interchange partner, The Star-Tribune Online, issued
a press release just hours after AT&T's announcement.  "The
Star-Tribune announced two weeks ago that it would develop a World
Wide Web version of Star-Tribune Online as a companion to the
Interchange version.  In response to AT&T's announcement, the
Star-Tribune will speed the development of its World Wide Web
edition."

     Star-Tribune said the first version of its Web edition will be
available in early February, while it maintains its presence on
Interchange.  When the Star-Tribune no longer is available on
Interchange, the Minneapolis-based service added, it will offer
members Internet access so they can connect to its new home on the
Web.

     While the Washington Post's Digital Ink service issued no
formal statement, vice president Fred Singer acknowledged that the
service is planning a shift to the Web as well.  Singer said the
Interchange announcement was not a surprise.

     "We see this as a natural evolution," he said, adding that
Digital Ink has been developing its Internet capabilities for
several months and will continue to publish on Interchange until
its Web-based service is ready.  Singer would not say when exactly
Digital Ink will be available on the Web, adding that an
announcement will be issued when the time arrives. 

     In related news, on the same day AT&T dropped the bomb on
Interchange, the Washington Post reported that Digital Ink editor
and publisher Don Brazeal had resigned but said his departure was
unrelated to the AT&T announcement.

     The Gartner Group is at (203) 316-6793; Star-Tribune Online,
at (612) 673-4818; Digital Ink, at (202) 334-5310.

MUSCULAR ENTRANT INVADES INTERNET ACCESS MARKET 

      Whenever Internet executives gather to contemplate potential
new competitors, the discussion invariably dwells on the dreaded
Baby Bells, the seven local phone companies created when Uncle Sam
dismembered Ma Bell, a.k.a. AT&T Corp.

     However, what many often overlook is the fact that America's
largest local phone company is not Bell.  Gee.  No, GTE.  And the
$20 billion GTE Corp. just announced its intention to enter the
Internet access business with its new cyberarm, GTE.net.

     GTE's Intelligent Network Services (GTEINS) division will
begin offering GTE.net service to residential and business
customers in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area early this
year.  GTE.net, which will be rolled out to additional U.S. markets
throughout 1996, will offer World Wide Web access via Netscape
Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser, which GTEINS just
licensed.

More Than Just Internet Access

     GTE.net services will be available for $24.95 per month for
unlimited access, or $8.95 per month for five hours, with $1.95 for
each additional hour.  Business customers also can purchase
dedicated Internet access and a number of other options, including
Web site, firewall, electronic mail, encryption and transaction
processing services.  Access speeds will vary from 14.4 and 28.8 to
dedicated line speeds up to 45 megabits per second (Mbps) (T3) and
integrated services digital network (ISDN) lines at 128 kilobits
per second (Kbps).

     "Entering the Internet access business is the first step GTE
is taking to build a nationwide data network infrastructure that
will allow us to enter new markets and develop new products and
services," said Bill Wall, general manager of GTE.net.  "These new
services will include virtual private business networks, specific
business Internet applications focused on education, law
enforcement and government plus other market segments under
development.  Long term, we believe these services will become part
of a broader integrated service offering that includes voice, data
and video services."

     GTE is at (203) 965-2853.

MICROSOFT AND NBC UNVEIL MULTIMEDIA ALLIANCE 

      Microsoft Corp. and NBC deepened their corporate commitment
to one another last month, but fell short of exchanging vows, as
some had predicted.  The media and software giants announced the
formation of a joint venture to deliver news via broadcast, cable
and the Internet.  Microsoft and NBC each will commit approximately
$200 million over the next five years to fund the venture, which
includes a new online service, MSNBC Online.

     In addition, Microsoft will pony up an additional $220 million
for a 50 percent interest in NBC's "America's Talking" cable
network, which is being repurposed as a 24-hours-a-day news network
and renamed MSNBC Cable.

     The alliance is designed to leverage NBC's news gathering
operation, broadcast and cable television outlets, and brand-name
awareness with Microsoft's software expertise, online service and
"connection to the PC [personal computer] user."

     The three-pronged approach apparently is aimed at consumers
with plenty of time on their hands, since the partners clearly
expect viewers/subscribers to avail themselves of all three media
to stay informed.

     The companies intend for viewers to look to NBC News for
headlines from around the world, tune in to the cable channel for
in-depth analysis and click into the Microsoft Network (MSN) for
comprehensive information customized to the viewers' preferences.

     "We are excited by the opportunity to work together in global
commerce with the proven entrepreneurial capabilities of Microsoft,
the most exciting company of this decade," said Jack Welch, chief
executive officer of General Electric Co., NBC's corporate parent.

     "We will be working with NBC to create innovative interactive
news content and an integrated media experience," said Bill Gates,
chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft.  "Advances in
digital technology will give people new control over news and
information.  They will be able to watch breaking news on TV and
then be able to get more in-depth information on things of interest
to them online." 

All Things to All Media?

     NBC News, MSNBC Cable and MSNBC Online will work in unison,
share content and cross-promote one another in an attempt to become
the "leading source for news" in each of their respective media. 
The  MSNBC news services will be international in reach, due both
to the nature of the Internet and NBC's outright ownership or
partial interest in a number of broadcast and cable properties in
Europe, Asia and Latin America.

     MSNBC Cable will feature NBC News correspondents, live
coverage of world events and local coverage from NBC affiliates. 
MSNBC Online, which will be accessible through the MSN, will
repackage NBC and MSNBC content "to offer the ability to get a very
broad online view of news."  MSNBC Online also will be distributed
by cable operators when high-speed cable modems become available.

     "By linking the local, national and international 
newsgathering capability of NBC and its affiliates, as well as NBC
News archives, with Microsoft's technological leadership in
software development and commitment to Internet online services,
MSNBC will create a continuum of news delivery that meets viewer
needs at all levels," said Bob Wright, chief executive officer of
NBC.

     MSNBC Cable will be managed by NBC News, while MSNBC Online
will be jointly managed by NBC and Microsoft.  The partners,
however, took pains to emphasize the fact that NBC News will retain
"complete editorial control and integrity" of news content in
either service.

     So presumably, if the Justice Department forces Microsoft to
"unbundle" MSN from Windows 95, or if NBC News suffers another
"Dateline" scandal, viewers can turn on MSNBC Cable or log onto
MSNBC Online for all the unexpurgated, unburied and unwhitewashed
details.

BELLCORE HEADS TO THE WEB TO EXPAND NEW MEDIA REACH 

      After 18 months of searching for new opportunities to expand
its business beyond the Baby Bells, Bell Communications Research
Inc. (Bellcore) finally settled on the Internet as one ticket into
the new media market.  Leveraging its networking strength, Bellcore
is offering an in-house product line called Adapt/X, services and
third-party products to get companies into business on the World
Wide Web.

     Bellcore announced its Internet focus and new applications at
the December World Wide Web Consortium conference in Boston.  The
Adapt/X products include online publishing, transaction, back-end
infrastructure and security components, and Bellcore will offer
integration and support services with these products, although they
can be purchased as stand-alone applications.

     Bellcore also signed letters of intent with Sun Microsystems
Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp. to cooperate on software and
consulting services.  "We see a market window where we can put our
network knowledge to work," Ken Branson, Bellcore spokesman, said.

     These are the first of many alliances Bellcore hopes to make
with leaders in the Internet market to exchange technology and
establish reseller arrangements.  Aside from its Adapt/X line,
Bellcore wants to offer a wide range of products and services for
large corporations that wish to create commercial Web sites for
selling products and conducting business-to-business transactions
on the Web.

     As part of its arrangement with Sun, Bellcore will join the
company's Independent Software Vendor program to receive advance
information on new technologies such as Java.  Bellcore also may
act as a system integrator for Sun in the future.

     As part of its effort to go after high-end customers, Bellcore
partnered with marketing and advertising firm Adler Boschetto
Peebles & Partners to handle design and content-creation services. 
The firm's ABP Interactive unit will work with Bellcore to offer
package services to clients.

     Bellcore is at (201) 829-2165.

PRODIGY FACES SURPRISING SETBACK  

      Although Prodigy Services Co. believed it finally settled the
troubling Stratton Oakmont lawsuit last October, the presiding
judge had other ideas.

     In late December, New York Supreme Court Judge Stuart Ain
rejected an attempt by Prodigy to reargue his May decision that
found the online service liable as the publisher of defamatory
remarks directed at Stratton Oakmont, a New York brokerage firm,
posted on one of the Prodigy bulletin boards.

     The two parties were reconciled in October when Prodigy
expressed its regret at the remarks and Stratton Oakmont agreed to
drop its $200 million libel suit (IISR, Nov. 3, 1995, p. 3). 
Further, Stratton Oakmont agreed to not oppose Prodigy's effort to
reargue Ain's decision with additional evidence in an attempt to
convince the judge that it is not a publisher and thus not
responsible for the content of its bulletin boards.

Former Policy Created Problems

     Prodigy originally got itself into trouble over its
since-discarded but much-publicized policy of policing its bulletin
boards.  Although the online service did once employ staffers to
read every single piece of e-mail on its boards, that practice was
abandoned as unworkable in 1992 when the volume of mail began to
hit 60,000 to 75,000 messages a day.  It was this change of policy
(i.e., a conscious decision to not exercise complete editorial
control over its bulletin boards) that Prodigy hoped would change
Ain's mind.

     But in an unexpected turn of events, despite the fact Stratton
Oakmont dropped its suit, Ain rebuffed Prodigy's arguments.  "The
court finds that this is a developing area of the law, so that
there is a real need for a precedent," Ain said, according to a
Reuters report.

     If Ain's ruling stands, it may well set an expensive precedent
for the industry that could make the original $200 million suit
seem like chump change by comparison.  For online services may now
be held liable for every message posted by their subscribers, the
number of whom varies by service but can total in the millions.

     "The fact he views Prodigy as a publisher is a potentially
troubling precedent for the entire industry," said Bob Smith,
executive director of the Interactive Services Association.  "If
any commercial online operator is responsible for all content, even
if it has no control over it, then that's a huge problem."

     According to Brian Ek, Prodigy's vice president for government
affairs, the company has two options:  appeal Ain's decision or do
nothing.  And depending on what trans-pires in Congress on the
telecommunications reform bill, the latter may be the more
attractive option.

     Although "it's pretty clear there is not much point in going
back to this particular court," Ek said, Prodigy's luck might
change in appeals court.  For one thing, he said, the case involves
two parties that no longer are involved in litigation.  Further, Ek
asserted, Ain's denial had more to do with technicalities than the
validity of the new facts presented.

     "It is more of a procedural issue than anything," Ek said. 
"The judge admitted the facts were different, which certainly puts
us in a better position."

Waiting for Gingrich

     However, doing nothing may be the best course and, as far as
Prodigy's legal fees are concerned, the cheapest.  The "do nothing"
option is a gamble based on the final shape of telecommunications
reform legislation crawling through Congress.

     Ek said the legislation contains what he calls a "Stratton
Oakmont clause" that specifically removes liability for services
that make a good faith effort to apply rudimentary control over
content.

     "If this bill goes through, Stratton Oakmont will become a
footnote," Ek said, noting that such a law would pre-empt any state
legislation to the contrary.

     However, that's a big "if," especially given the fact that
telecommunications reform has taken a back seat to the budget
battle in recent weeks.  And time is a luxury Prodigy can ill
afford, since the clock is running on the opportunity to file an
appeal.  Ek said Prodigy probably will reach a decision within the
next week, adding that the rest of the industry hopes it will opt
to do nothing.

     "None of the other services are anxious for us to throw more
dollars at this one," Ek said.  "Everybody is looking at the
legislation going forward."

CompuServe SELF-CENSORS AFTER GERMAN OFFICIALS COMPLAIN 

      CompuServe Inc. continues scrambling to devise a
technological fix that will allow its almost 4 million non-German
members to regain access to more than 200 sexually explicit
Internet news groups.

     On Dec. 28, in response to an order by the government of
Germany, CompuServe suspended access through its service to the
controversial news groups, according to spokeswoman Daphne Kent. 
Bavarian law enforcement officials, Kent said, told the world's
second-largest online service that the content of the news groups
was illegal under German law.

     Since then, CompuServe officials and the public prosecutor's
office in Munich have traded denials in the media about who said
what.

Just Following Orders?

     Last week, authorities in Bavaria, Germany's most conservative
state, issued a statement claiming that they only had asked
CompuServe to "scrutinize" a list of potentially troublesome news
groups, and that it was the online service's decision alone to deny
access to the groups.  CompuServe maintains it was merely following
orders from Bavarian prosecutors who specified exactly which news
groups were illegal and therefore to be blocked.

     However, given the fact that under German law executives are
held personally responsible for the actions of their companies,
CompuServe may well be playing it safe in order to prevent its top
management from spending any time in a Bavarian cellblock.

     Complying with the German order forced CompuServe to deny its
entire worldwide customer base of more than 4 million users access
to the smut-based news groups, prompting an outcry among both
subscribers and the entire Internet community at large, which
accused the service of cybercensorship.

     CompuServe meanwhile is trying to devise a method of blocking
access to questionable content on a country-by-country basis, but
cannot say when such a solution will be ready.  Kent would not
speculate as to when, or even if, access would be restored, but
said the company is "always concerned" that blocking access to
information could cost the company customers.  Kent said no other
online service was similarly restricted and said "we were likely
targeted because of our size." 

No Other Service Targeted

     Although somewhat smaller than its chief competitor, America
Online Inc. (AOL), CompuServe has the greatest overseas presence of
any consumer online service.  In Germany it claims 100,000 members. 
The number is insignificant, however, in comparison to the more
than 1.8 million individuals who use the Internet in Germany and
whose access to the same news groups is harder to restrict,
depending upon their method of access.

     AOL, which recently launched a German online service with
German publisher Bertelsmann AG that relies heavily on
Internet-based content, has yet to encounter any similar
difficulties.  AOL spokeswoman Pam McGraw said the company is
investigating the CompuServe issue, but has yet to receive any
notification from the German authorities.

     "To the best of our knowledge, we have not received any
requests from the German government," she said.

     However, McGraw added, AOL offers users the ability to block
access to news groups, which may be its saving grace.  Although
CompuServe's Internet division offers Internet access software with
the ability to block access to adult content, the company's
flagship online service does not offer the same capability.

CAMELOT CORP. CUTS NORDIC INTERNET PHONE DEAL 

      Camelot Corp., a holding company whose subsidiary, Third
Plant Publishing, "publishes" DigiPhone, a software product that
allows users to place phone calls over the Internet, is trying to
establish a presence in what is arguably Europe's most
Internet-centric region, Scandinavia.

     Camelot has penned a deal with Copenhagen-based Telepartner
A/S to distribute its DigiPhone and DigiPhone Deluxe software
throughout Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

     In exchange for exclusive distribution rights, Telepartner has
agreed to pay Camelot $1 million in the form of 2.7 percent of its
share capital.  Camelot also secured the right to acquire a further
7.3 percent of Telepartner for approximately $2.7 million. 
Telepartner, which is valued at $37 million based on these
transactions, intends to offers its shares to the public on the
Copenhagen Stock Exchange by March 1997.  Should this proposed
initial public offering (IPO) fail to take place, Camelot has the
right to request that Telepartner buy back its 2.7 percent stake
for $1 million in cash.

     In addition, Camelot Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Danny Wettreich also was appointed a director of Telepartner, a
telephone database services firm with more than 500,000 companies
on file.  "Telepartner's marketing expertise in Scandinavia and its
access to corporate clientele will ensure a speedy market
penetration in this very important European region," Wettreich
said.

Other Camelot News

     In other Camelot-based news, the company reported growing
revenues for its quarter ended Oct. 31, even as losses increased
slightly.  Revenues rose to $527,144 from $350,479 one year ago,
while the company reported a loss of $798,693 for the quarter,
compared to $644,787 during the same period in 1994.  Camelot
attributed its results to start-up costs for its various divisions.

     Camelot's Third Planet Publishing began shipping DigiPhone
into retail stores, and expects to record larger sales in the next
quarter.  By the end of October, Camelot had opened five Mr. CD-ROM
Stores as part of its goal to launch 100 of the specialty retail
outlets by the end of 1996.  Camelot Distributing also is in the
building stages, as the company hired personnel and explored
relationships with retailers.

     Camelot is at (214) 733-3005.

Will 1996 Turn Out to be the YEAR OF THE GHOST SITE? 

      Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates has been known to be
right on the money, and in his latest book, "The Road Ahead," his
analogy that compares the Internet and multimedia feeding frenzy to
the American gold rush may be a harbinger of things to come.

     Unfortunately, as a new study by International Data Corp.
(IDC) notes, after the gold ran dry in the 1800s, ghost towns were
left behind.  The research and consulting firm predicts that 1996
will be a "year of disappointment" for investors and corporations
in the online marketplace, reflecting sluggish development of a
significant consumer base.  In addition, 20 percent of the Fortune
500 companies that have commercial Web sites will close or stop
maintaining them, resulting in "ghost sites."

Lots of Interest, Not Much Content

     IDC also said the leading online information service providers
such as CompuServe Inc., America Online Inc., Prodigy Services Co.
and the Microsoft Network will realize more than 50 percent of
their revenues from offering access to the World Wide Web by the
middle of 1997, and that two of the four services will struggle for
survival.

     "Though we predict the overall growth in online subscribers
will continue to be very strong, we expect 1996 will show a high
turnover rate as users underwhelmed by the content on the Web
cancel their subscriptions and turn on their TVs," said Frank Gens,
senior vice president of research at IDC.  "Still, 1996 will be a
strategic investment year for businesses that expect to compete in
the growing electronic marketplace, because during the next five
years, the number of wired (i.e., online) users will rise to more
than 200 million, and by 2010, it will exceed 1 billion."

     Financial services companies, retailers and publishers will
bail out in the initial "hangover" period, Gens said, leaving the
door wide open for new leadership and the downfall of current
giants.  However, IDC predicts Microsoft will have a great 1996,
and its revenue will not be affected by potentially weaker holds on
the industry it may have with technology such as object linking and
embedding (OLE) and Visual Basic.

     Gens also forecasts that manufacturers of Internet appliances,
which allow users to access online information, will slash prices
in half by the end of 1996.  "The game console crowd is already
slicing away at the pricing for simple Web surfing devices," he
said.  "Within two years, Internet appliances will emerge as
giveaways - [from] less than $100 to free - by businesses that want
customers to access their online services."

GE TAKING INTERNET CONTRACT BIDS 

      Seeking to streamline its operations, General Electric Co.
launched the GE Trading Process Network (TPN) last week to let
suppliers bid for GE contracts over the Internet.  TPN primarily
will use electronic mail to solicit bids from outside contractors,
and GE hopes to conduct about $1 billion in transactions over the
network this year.

     This would quadruple the amount of online business-to-business
transactions GE already handles through a private electronic data
interchange (EDI) network run by subsidiary GE Information Services
(GEIS), which was roughly $250 million last year.

     GE will distribute the TPN software to suppliers that will be
able to receive information from the World Wide Web and submit bids
for projects through e-mail.  The GEIS unit has been promoting this
brand of electronic commerce for online trading between companies
as part of the International Business Exchange (IBEX) project,
officially launched last September with AT&T Corp., Dun &
Bradstreet Corp., the Global Business Alliance, the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, Chase Manhattan Bank and other partners.

     IBEX is promoting an electronic mail-based service for
companies to solicit and bid on contracts online.  While GEIS is
involved in this effort, its parent company opted for a proprietary
solution instead of IBEX for handling its in-house suppliers.  

     GE is at (203) 373-2039.

CONCENTRIC ROUNDS UP $25 MILLION 

      Internet access provider Concentric Network Corp. has secured
a $25 million private offering though Montgomery Securities, an
investment bank specializing in high-tech firms.  Proceeds from the
offering, which were raised through a group of institutional
investors, will be used to expand Concentric's network throughout
North America and to fund further sales and marketing efforts. 
With a frame relay network encompassing 214 points-of-presence,
Concentric enjoys alliances with Netscape Communications Corp.,
Intuit Inc. and Ameritech Corp.

     "We believe the key to success in the Internet access business
is to align the business with unique content and to offer 'virtual
private networks' that provide affordable access to the content
while maximizing reliability, performance and security," said Todd
Dagres, senior technology analyst for Montgomery Securities.  "We
believe Concentric is pursuing such a strategy as evidenced by its
relationships with Intuit, Sirius Publishing and others."

     Concentric is at (408) 342-2808.

PRODIGY TARGETS GENERATION X 

      Prodigy Services Co. apparently is trying to shed its image
as the leading family-based online service by broadening its appeal
to attract a more tragically hip audience.  Prodigy has acquired an
undisclosed interest in SonicNet, a Sunshine Interactive Network
division and producer of a World Wide Web site devoted to
alternative music and other cultural content for the nose-ring set.

     The move marks Prodigy's first investment in a Web-based
content provider, and was carried out under the aegis of its new
"Wildflower Partners" division, which, like America Online Inc.'s
"Greehouse" program, supports promising content providers with
money and distribution.  Under the agreement,  SonicNet will
provide Prodigy with original and exclusive content, including
celebrity chat sessions, marketing and a seamless link to
SonicNet's home page.  Prodigy will finance SonicNet's effort to
develop content, enlarge its staff and expand into new areas. 
SonicNet content includes chat areas with alternative rock
anti-heroes, the "Loser's Guide to New York" and links to "rockin'
sites on the Web."  

     In other Prodigy-based news, the service recently won the
Information Industry Association's Online Access 1995 HotShots
Award for the Best Consumer Web access.

     Prodigy is at (914) 448-8000; SonicNet, at (212) 741-5106.

GET A VIRTUAL LIFE 

      Internet addicts who do the lion's share of their socializing
online soon may have even less reason to pry themselves away from
their machines and venture outdoors.  PSINet Inc. and Worlds Inc.

     Details of the deal, which the companies claim is "pushing
forward the future of online social interaction," were not
disclosed.  

     PSINet can be reached at (703) 904-4100; Worlds Inc., at (415)

Just Bits

     Breaking News...

     ...  Sit tight and sell high.  Top executives at America
Online Inc. enriched themselves late last year with an insider
selling spree, unloading approximately 415,000 options after a
six-month lull, The Wall Street Journal reported.  According to
tracking firm CDA/Invest, AOL executives including Chairman Steve
Case (95,000 options), President of AOL Services Ted Leonsis
(40,000 options) and Chief Financial Officer Len Leader (40,000
options) cashed in their shares at prices from $38.45 to $40.13,
taking advantage of the 83 percent rise in AOL's share price since
the last round of insider selling six months ago.  Some analysts
speculated that the sell-off represented a hedge against the
not-too-distant future, when AOL and other online services will be
forced to compete with the World Wide Web rather than each other. 
Whether or not that's the case, they've certainly socked away
enough for a few rainy days.  You do the math....

     ...  More Web-based casualties?  Following the axing of
Interchange (see story, p. 3), other changes may be in store for
AT&T Corp.'s other online ventures.  Although a spokesman said no
alterations were planned for the company's Imagination Network, he
said AT&T and General Magic Inc. were investigating the feasibility
of transforming the proprietary Personal Link messaging service
into an Internet-based product....  Angry over the budget impasse? 
President Clinton, the nation's first cyber-savvy leader, has
received a death threat via the Internet, according to a Reuters
report.  An e-mail message originating from a university in
southern Taiwan reportedly said:  "President Clinton, when you are
out for a visit, we will assassinate you."  As if he didn't already
have enough problems here in Washington.

New & Noteworthy...

     ...  A kinder, gentler Internet?  The McKinley Group said it
intends to flag Web sites devoid of adult-based or X-rated content
though its Magellan Internet directory (http://www.mckinley.com). 
McKinley intends to place a "green light" icon in the listing of
Web sites it reviews as a sort of seal of approval to steer uses to
"safe sites."  If nothing else, McKinley's approach should help
Internet surfers in search of smut avoid wasting time in fruitless
sites....  Dow Jones & Co. Inc. and the New York Times Information
Services Group have reached a content-sharing agreement.  As of
Jan. 1, subscribers to the Dow Jones News/Retrieval online service
will be able to access full-text archives of The New York Times as
far back as 1981....  Microsoft Corp. and NBC (see story, p. 6) are
teaming to cash in on the Super Bowl advertising frenzy with a
World Wide Web site that will sell interactive ads and offer Super
Bowl-based content.  The only announced advertiser to date is, um,
Microsoft, but executives hoping to drum up interest from other
advertisers at a press conference said they expect the site will
generate "millions and millions" of hits.  Maybe during the
commercials?  Point your beer-soaked, salsa-stained mouse at
http://www.superbowl.com.

Over the Transom...

     ...  Germany, which has suffered more than its share of bad
press this century, has managed to alienate much of cyberspace as
well by ordering CompuServe Inc. to block access to questionable
news groups on the Internet (see story, p. 9).  And to add to the
Sturm und Drang, a San Francisco gay rights group said it has
called for a boycott of two German-brewed beers to protest the
Internet censorship.  The blocked discussion groups include topics
such as homosexuality and AIDS....  Need to know the relative troop
strength of Myanmar vis-a-vis Burkina Faso?  Check out the CIA's
World Factbook 1995, now available for the first time on CD-ROM. 
The Windows- and Macintosh-compatible CD-ROM boasts current
geographic, political, socioeconomic, cultural and military
information on more than 250 countries, and is available for $30 at
http://www.fedworld.gov/ntis/ntishome.html.

ZERO-IN ON COMPANY NEWS FROM NEW JERSEY

For business researchers, one of the major boons of the World Wide Web 
is easy and quick access to the electronic pages of local newspapers.  
For the first time, they're as accessible as the best-known national 
and international dailies and weeklies.
 
For company information, they often scoop their larger-circulation 
relatives and as a rule provide more in-depth coverage.
 
One recent addition to the growing Web collection of locals is BUSINESS 
News New Jersey.  Its electronic home is at "http://www.njbiz.com/" and 
provides the full text of highly focused articles on specific companies 
in that state and many other business-related news and feature items.

A NOTE ABOUT GUEST BOOKS

An increasing number of sites are requiring users to provide 
information in "guest books" before linking to the information 
provided.  There's generally nothing apparently wrong with this.
 
But IFR readers should be aware that in many cases this is a prelude 
to soliciting paid subscriptions.  Some sites will start by offering 
free access then-after an adequate user base is achieved-contact 
registrants to indicate that future access will require an annual 
subscription fee.

IT'S A ZOO OUT THERE

Spring hasn't quite sprung yet in many parts of the country.  But 
after surviving what for many has been a cabin-fever-filled winter, 
folks are itching to take advantage of the first Spring-like days.
 
A popular early Spring mini-outing is a trip to the zoo.  And you can 
get a taste of it and plan your itinerary via the World Wide Web.
 
A first stop could be the San Diego Zoo.  It's located at 
"http://www.sandiegozoo.org/", and its home page features 
descriptions and photos from many of its attractions.
 
Another western must is Portland, Oregon's Metro Washington Park Zoo.  
You'll find its photo gallery packed with pictures of some 50 
attractions.  Click on over to 
"http://www.caboose.com/a1topics/portland_zoo/".
 
Moving East, drop in at the Pittsburgh Zoo for an excellent section on 
wildlife and information on its "Kids Kingdom," especially designed for 
youth-and the young at heart, too.  It's at 
"http://keyselections.lm.com/info.html".
 
If your taste leans toward the aquatic, don't miss Sea World at Busch 
Gardens.  In addition to an extensive photo index, this electronic zoo 
boasts a wealth of educational material.  It's at 
"http://www.bev.net/education/SeaWorld/homepage.html".

CONGRESS TO CONSIDER CALLER ID BLOCKING BILL

A U.S. senator has proposed a bill that would require telephone companies to
offer subscribers the ability to block display of their telephone numbers to
subscribers of caller ID, one of the custom local area signaling services
(CLASS).

Sen. Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., said the Telephone Privacy Act of 1990 "balances
the privacy interests of callers and call recipients."  Hearings on the bill
are expected this spring before the Senate Subcommittee on Technology and the
Law, chaired by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.  Kohl is a member of that
subcommittee.

"The underlying principle of my bill is simple:  The caller should continue to
have a choice about whether to disclose the caller's own phone number and
address," Kohl told reporters last week.  He said a provision of the bill
would exempt caller ID blocking of originating numbers on calls to "911" or
other emergency services.

A freshman senator who a staffer said has a "personal interest" in
telecommunications technologies, Kohl expressed his views on caller ID
recently in a letter to the editor of the Washington Post and in an op-ed
piece in Newsday, the Long Island, N.Y., newspaper.

A spokesman for Bell Atlantic, which has introduced caller ID in New Jersey,
Maryland and Virginia, called the blocking requirement "inappropriate."  "The
service loses its value with blocking," he said.

But Kohl's bill was endorsed by Pennsylvania's Consumer Advocate, David
Barasch, who is leading the fight for caller ID blocking in an appeals court
challenge to a Bell of Pennsylvania tariff.  The tariff was approved by state
regulators in November and stayed by a state appeals court judge in late
December.  (See story on page 11)

The measure also won the support of Gary Leonard, chief of the Alexandria,
Va., Police Department, who said he represents an association of police chiefs
in northern Virginia.  While acknowledging the service's public safety
benefits, Leonard said caller ID impairs his police department's ability to
operate.

Leonard, whose suburban Washington, D.C., community has a pervasive problem
with illegal drug dealers, said he is aware of more than one undercover
operation that was "blown" because tipsters were afraid a telephone call would
reveal their identities.

Many police departments have programs that "work on the basis of anonymity,"
said Leonard, adding that caller ID is "a big turn-off to this kind of
support."  He said an offer by C&P Telephone of Virginia to make call blocking
available to the police would be counterproductive, since the special
treatment would tip off suspects with caller ID that the police are involved.

In other developments on the caller ID front, New York regulators in
mid-January ordered Rochester Telephone to offer per-call or subscription
blocking to caller ID as part of an upcoming three-month experimental trial of
custom local area signaling services (CLASS).

"Customer privacy is very important," Peter Bradford, chairman of the New York
State Public Service Commission, said in approving the trial with a per-call
or all-call blocking provision.  Callers in the 12,000 line exchange where
caller ID is being trialed may punch in one of two codes; one to block number
display on an individual call, and another to block display on all calls.

A Rochester Tel spokeswoman said the telco agreed to offer the two "privacy
options" after being urged to do so by state regulators.  "Our intention was
to be able to test this feature to the fullest," she said, adding that the
blocking requirement "certainly is going to impact the test results."

The spokewoman said Rochester Tel will evaluate the test before filing an
actual CLASS tariff later this year.

In a related development, Florida regulators on Jan. 30 ordered Southern Bell
to provide caller ID blocking on a limited basis to law enforcement and
domestic abuse agencies.  The BOC's CLASS tariff took effect Feb. 1.

PAC TEL SEEKS INTER-LATA MESSAGING WAIVER

Bidding to gain parity with existing messaging providers, Pacific Telesis has
requested a Consent Decree waiver allowing Pacific Bell to provide voice and
electronic messaging services between LATAs in California.

Pac Tel's "limited waiver request" would permit its BOC to select carriers to
handle messaging traffic among California's 10 LATAs and incorporate long
distance charges in bills issued to end users.

Pac Bell now offers voice messaging to business customers in the Sacramento,
San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego LATAs, and residential voice
messaging in Milpitas and San Pedro.  After customer-specific trials, the BOC
expects to roll  out electronic messaging in September.

"It is critical to the success of these new services that Pacific receive a
waiver of the decree to allow it to select interexchange carriers associated
with Pacific's provision of messaging services and to include the cost of
(long distance) services in Pacific's prices," Pac Tel said.

"Without this waiver, existing and potential customers of Pacific's messaging
services will soon determine that Pacific's services are not easily accessible
and usable," the Bell regional holding company (RHC) said.

Pac Tel said the decree "may be interpreted as imposing two practical
obstacles to providing efficient service": 1) equal access provisions require
customers to select carriers for long distance communications, and 2) the long
distance carrier is permitted to bill its customers directly and separately.

"Without relief from these requirements, a user outside his or her home LATA
trying to retrieve or deposit voice messages will incur costly per-minute long
distance charges," the RHC said.  "And users trying to retrieve or deposit
electronic messages from outside their LATA must learn a nine-step set of
procedures that will be very difficult for most consumers to master."

Pac Tel's filing expresses particular concern that the decree's
carrier-selection and billing requirements may impose higher costs on users of
its messaging services than on users of competing services.


No One-Number Solution


The RHC notes that many voice messaging providers allow their customers to
avoid long distance charges by offering access to messaging systems through a
single "800" number.      "However, since the decree may be read to prohibit
Pacific from selecting a single (carrier) to provide 800-number interexchange
access, without a waiver Pacific will have to connect its messaging equipment
with all (carrier) 800-number providers that Pacific's customers may select,"
the RHC said.

While an equitable solution, the use of multiple long distance carriers would
boost Pac Tel's costs by requiring development of new billing software and
procedures, as well as the purchase of enough messaging equipment to
interconnect all possible 800 providers, the RHC said.

"These incremental costs, when added to the prices for Pacific's messaging
services, can be expected to severely dampen customer demand," Pac Tel said.
For instance, the RHC said, a two-minute inter-LATA call to Pac Bell's voice
messaging service would cost 50 percent more than a similar call to "two major
providers."

Addressing electronic messaging, Pac Tel said students at Santa Clara
University normally used a five-step procedure to gain access to Pac Bell's
electronic messaging service in the San Francisco LATA, but had to go through
nine steps to send or receive messages from outside the LATA.

"Experienced computer users with sophisticated portable personal computers may
not be daunted by the complications (carrier) selection poses for use of
Pacific's electronic messaging services," the RHC said. "However, the average
consumer will find it difficult to deal with these complications."

Pac Tel went on to explain how carrier selection would increase the company's
costs when electronic messages are forwarded from one LATA to another, and how
additional costs are incurred in the usage of voice or electronic
store-and-forward technology.

Blocking Not Feasible


Simply blocking subscriber access to long distance messaging would avoid the
problems raised by carrier selection, the RHC said, "but it would also block
the potential for success and widespread public adoption of Pacific's
messaging services."  Pac Tel estimates that 13 percent to 14 percent of its
customers' messaging would cross LATA boundaries.

"These boundaries should not arbitrarily and unnecessarily affect and distort
the evolution of competition in the market for messaging services," the
company said.

"Denial of Pacific's request may not kill these services," the RHC said in
conclusion.  "However, it will result in higher-priced, less-functional,
less-convenient messaging services that fail to adequately serve the customers
the court hoped would benefit from these new services."

ALABAMA APPROVES LIMITED TRIAL OF TWO-WAY LMS

The Alabama Public Service Commission (PSC) has allowed South Central Bell to
offer an experimental two-way measured service tied to certain network calling
features used by enhanced service providers (ESP) such as telephone answering
services.

Florida regulators approved a similar tariff filed by Southern Bell in
November 1988 (ESO December 1988).

The Alabama decision (docket 21071) came in response to the BOC's petition to
introduce two-way measured service as a condition for subscribing to five
unbundled basic service elements (BSE).  An ESP wanting to purchase one or
more of the BSEs would be required to purchase a two-way measured local access
line that measured incoming calls as well as outgoing calls.

South Central Bell initially will offer the services in the Huntsville, Ala.,
area with expansion to other Alabama communities as demand develops.

The BSEs provide specialized forwarding, message relaying and
call-transferring capabilities for voice messaging providers.  The PSC noted
that South Central Bell and ESPs were at odds over the need for tying the BSEs
to two-way measured service.

South Central Bell contend that without two-way measured service, the advent
of new voice messaging services will cause increased usage over its local
network and create costs that won't be recovered through the rates paid by the
ESPs.

The ESPs, supported by MCI,  claimed the opposite.  They said two-way measured
service will increase their network access costs by 100 percent to 800
percent, killing off many providers.  They also said the two-way measured
service is unnecessary because voice messaging will make the local network
more efficient, because a far higher proportion of calls will be completed on
the first attempt and average holding times will be reduced.

Smaller ESPs said volume discounts in the proposed two-way measured tariffs
give South Central Bell's own voice messaging services an advantage over the
services of non-affiliated providers, and give other large voice messaging
companies an advantage over all the small fry.

The PSC concluded that neither side produced sufficient evidence to prove
their claims.

Regulators also noted that a number of state-federal jurisdictional issues
remain unresolved in the FCC's open network architecture (ONA) proceeding on
the BOCs' obligations to provide equality of access for all affiliated and
non-affiliated ESPs. The final decisions on these issues, the PSC said, could
have an impact on the South Central Bell's proposal.

While the BSEs South Central Bell proposes might be beneficial for ESPs, they
are optional.  Voice messaging companies, the PSC said, can continue to use
their present access arrangements if they do not want to pay the bidirectional
measured rates.

The regulators concluded that, given the jurisdictional uncertainties about
ONA and the total divergence of views on the tariff, a market trial is the
only sensible course.

The one-year trial will be limited to exchanges in the Huntsville area and
will run until mid-January 1991; the rates proposed in the BOC's filing  will
be the rates for the trial.  The PSC said it "is hopeful that the trial will
provide data to help both the company and this commission determine the proper
tariff treatment of services that support the provision of enhanced services."

PRODIGY: POTENTIAL ROADBLOCKS MAY IMPEDE SUCCESS

After spending untold hundreds of millions of dollars to get their Prodigy
videotex venture off the ground, IBM and Sears can expect to see operating
profits from Prodigy within a few years and their investment paid off by the
late 1990s, company officials told reporters at a Washington, D.C., briefing.

Membership and usage levels have surpassed Prodigy's initial expectations,
with 200,000 members out of a potential universe of 8 million to 10 million
households equipped with personal computers having 512 kilobytes of memory.

Prodigy projects that its computer universe will exceed 35 million homes by
1996, making its $9.95 a month (or $89.95 a year) service a huge hit with a
baby boomer generation too busy to get out of the house.

Membership fees are just the tip of their revenue base, officials say, noting
that "the lion's share" of their money will be made from transaction and
advertising fees provided by over 200 advertisers, merchandisers and direct
marketers. Prodigy is currently running over more than 750 different programs
on its menu.

Sales of Prodigy kits, many outfitted with 1200-or 2400-baud modems, also is a
substantial, albeit short-term, source of revenue.  The kits have become the
top item in most computer software stores, retailers report.

Company officials are recommending the 2400-baud modem for better graphics and
reasonable program speeds, but continue to offer a  sizeable number of
1200-baud modem kits still in retail stores.

Prodigy's blue sky projections as a profitable, state-of-the-art service may
be threatened by the FCC's open network architecture plan, officials say.
Even more daunting to Prodigy, these officials said, are telco ambitions to
force enhanced service providers (ESP) to pay measured rates for both incoming
and outgoing calls, the officials added.

"From our perspective, there's a fundamental problem with ONA," said Sandra G.
Weis, Prodigy's director of government affairs.  "It doesn't pave the way to
equal access, or even try to approximate equal access.  Instead of achieving
modularity, the FCC has chosen a model that continues the bottleneck."

Safeguards For Equal Access


That's a big problem for Prodigy, Weis says, because Prodigy wants to serve
customers over an ever-more-powerful, transparent network.  "We need
safeguards that would relieve the bottleneck over time, with approximate
here-and-now equal access," she says.  "We need to prevent cross-subsidies,
and protect against discrimination."

Although  many ESPs have focused on co-location of their equipment in telco
central offices,  Weis thinks such an emphasis is at least partly misguided.
"Co-location is just one tool to approximate equal access," she says.  "We are
going to need stronger safeguards."

While ONA is of prime concern to Prodigy, a bigger threat to Prodigy's success
is perceived to be inherent in telco pricing, particularly exemplified by
Southern Bell's bi-directional message rates approved in Florida and Alabama,
and pending in Georgia.

"It's a fundamental tension between ESPs and telcos," acknowledges Allison
Lash, Prodigy's program manager for state government affairs. Noting that
Prodigy's flat fee is largely based on customers using their computer's
intelligence to complete transactions rather than a Prodigy mainframe, Lash
says the Southern Bell proposals would probably sink the pricing concept,
while impeding a network evolution to higher transmission speeds.

Higher transmission speeds are a key part of Prodigy's game plan. According to
Sirajul Islam, Prodigy's manager of communications technology, the company
hopes to transmit at 9600 kilobits per second, a speed that would allow higher
quality graphics and sound.  With such features, Prodigy could become "like a
radio that would be left on all day," he says.

"Affordable pricing is a key goal," says Weis.  "Right now, our average  line
costs $35.  But the proposal by Southern Bell would cost about $200 for the
same service.  We recognize that Southern Bell wants to solve its problem with
voice technologies.  But we can see this as being used for new technologies.

"The telco doesn't just want to  move in an evolutionary pattern," she adds.
"We feel it wants to break out of the gate."

"The company has to spend tremendous resources worrying about access charges,"
adds Islam.

But a Southern Bell spokesman doubts that the company's tariff would ever be
applied to anything but voice messaging.  "It's not necessary.  We don't
foresee that," he said when asked about the bi-directional measured rate being
applied to data services.

The spokesman said Prodigy's main concern appears to be Southern Bell's
transition to measured service in certain areas.  Prodigy denies that, saying
"measured service was not a problem per se."

Even while telcos are the source of Prodigy's greatest worries, they are also
the source of Prodigy's greatest hopes.  The company is hoping that recent
deals with Rochester Telephone and Nynex to provide transmission and
maintenance facilities (and marketing in the Rochester Tel deal) will convince
other telcos to help spread the service faster, and also to save money.

"Since the Nynex agreement, we've had additional contacts with other telephone
companies," said Islam, who declined to elaborate.  He dismissed Nynex's
concern that it might be limited in the degree of marketing activities it
could do for Prodigy.

"Everything that Rochester is doing a Bell operating company could do," he
said.

U S WEST ANSWERS CRITICS OF ELECTRONIC WHITE PAGES WAIVER

U S West has answered critics of its request for a Consent Decree
clarification or waiver to offer on-line directory assistance information as
an "exchange access" service throughout its 14-state region.

U S West sought the clarification last month in response to a request from an
unnamed long distance carrier.   Since then, AT&T, which supported U S West's
efforts, filed a tariff to provide electronic directory assistance service
starting Jan. 18.

Information available through U S West's electronic white pages, including the
subscriber's name, address, telephone number, ZIP and area codes, would be
"obtained and updated daily from the same databases the company's BOCs use to
provide directory assistance, U S West said.

To CompuServe's objection that the database includes ZIP codes and permits
address and telephone number searches, U S West replied that Judge Harold
Greene already has approved the company's waiver to provide subscriber
information when the caller provides either the address or telephone number.

"The only question raised by U S West's (electronic white pages) request is
whether the same information, using the same search categories, can be
divulged by a U S West computer rather than by a U S West operator (using a
computer)," the company said (emphasis in original).

As for CompuServe's objection to the inclusion of ZIP codes, U S West
questions "why ZIP code information, an integral part of a person's address,
should not be included with a person's address."

U S West dismissed Dun & Bradstreet's contention that delivery of formatted
directory assistance data requires a waiver as "mistaken."  The company said
formatting "is a function U S West must perform" to provide electronic white
pages, and one that may be required by the decree.

To ADAPSO and CompuServe's point that electronic white pages is an information
service, U S West answers that it may be one or the other.  "If the caller
uses the directory information to make a call, the service is a
telecommunications service; if the caller uses the information for other
purposes (e.g., to verify an address), the service is an information service."

Finally, Dun & Bradstreet's concern that provision of electronic white pages
"not cross the line" to electronic yellow pages is misplaced, U S West said.
"U S West's (electronic white pages) service will involve only directory
information ... classified advertising and other information will not be
available," the company said.

AT&T UNVEILS 'VOICEMARK' NATIONAL MESSAGE DELIVERY SERVICE

Beating its long distance competitors to the Touch-Tone punch, AT&T has raised
the veil on the first nationwide public voice messaging service.

VoiceMark, which for now is being marketed only in the Southeast, gives anyone
with a telephone and a Visa, MasterCard or AT&T charge card the ability to
send a recorded message to a direct-dialed number across the city or around
the world.

Callers to a toll-free number follow step-by-step instructions to record and
send a one-minute personal message.  The message can be delivered
automatically to any telephone number or person-to-person, with an attendant
introducing the recording.

AT&T charges $1.75 for automatic message delivery or $2.50 for
person-to-person service, including toll  charges.  Callers do not have to
subscribe to the service or buy any special equipment.

In fact, AT&T clearly expects most VoiceMark users to be "impulse" buyers:
people whose tight schedules and urgent need to exchange information requires
that they convey messages quickly and conveniently.

"You no longer have to endure the frustration and time delays associated with
a telephone that's busy, friends and associates who aren't home, or time-zone
differences," said Karen Antonucci, AT&T's marketing manager for VoiceMark.

However, users of the service do have to endure a complicated eight-step
procedure lasting at least two minutes in order to send a one-minute message.
(For sophisticated users, AT&T provides the option of skipping over
instructional messages by pressing the "#" sign.)

A VoiceMark call to the toll-free number (800 562-MARK) is greeted by an
automated female voice, which instructs the caller to dial a code (*H) to
obtain information on pricing and conditions.  The same code also summons an
attendant.

The user then is instructed to enter a Visa, MasterCard or AT&T card number.
After a pause, the VoiceMark system requests the card's expiration date,
explaining that a January 1990 date should be entered "190."

After verifying the billing information, VoiceMark inquires whether the caller
wants to humanize the message's introduction by recording the caller's name,
or leave the message anonymous.  If the caller wants his name included in the
message, the system replays the name and asks whether the caller would like to
re-record it.

VoiceMark then asks for the area code and number of the recipient, then
repeats it for verification. The system asks whether the caller would like a
reply message, and whether the caller's message should be delivered
automatically or person-to-person.  The caller then is prompted to record the
message after a "beep."

If the caller selects automatic delivery, the VoiceMark system will dial the
intended recipient repeatedly over the next two hours, an AT&T spokesman said.
Algorithms designed by AT&T Bell Labs and built into the  equipment will cause
VoiceMark to dial more frequently if the number is busy than if there is no
answer, he said.

The caller also can designate a delivery day and time, and whether VoiceMark
should continue delivery attempts for one, two, three or four hours, the
spokesman said.  If the caller selects person-to-person delivery, an attendant
will personally introduce the message to the recipient specified.

One flaw revealed during a test of VoiceMark by Enhanced Services Outlook was
that at no time did the automated system explain how a user was to retrieve a
reply message.  A VoiceMark attendant told a reporter he would have to dial
the "800" number, enter his credit card number and request information on the
status of previous messages.

The AT&T spokesman said VoiceMark was subjected to numerous "customer trials"
before its rollout in Atlanta.  "We feel like what we've got out there is what
we want," he said.

During the initial marketing period, only AT&T customers associated with
BellSouth's BOCs, Southern Bell and South Central Bell, are permitted to
charge their calls to their AT&T telephone calling card, according to a
VoiceMark attendant.  There are no geographic restrictions for callers wishing
to charge the service to their Visa or MasterCard numbers.

The spokesman declined "for competitive reasons" to say when AT&T might market
the service nationally.

CONSUMER GROUPS COUNTER RHC CLAIMS ABOUT INFORMATION SERVICES

Challenging claims that the Bell regional holding companies (RHC) must be
freed to "jump-start" the Information Age, two powerful consumer organizations
say ratepayers would pay a heavy price for RHC participation in a
"centralized" information services infrastructure.


The Consumer Federation of America (CFA) and the American Association of
Retired Persons (AARP) say information services are developing rapidly and
should continue to grow as more the personal computer (PC) becomes a common
residential appliance.


"Lifting (Consent Decree or telco/cable cross-ownership) barriers on local
telcos ... would not provide any significant new services," Gene Kimmelman,
CFA's legislative director, told reporters last week in Washington, D.C.

But permitting the telcos to develop a fiber-optic-based network -- including
fiber to the home -- in order to deliver video services will cost ratepayers
at least $250 billion, or $5 a month per subscriber more on average over the
next 33 years, according to a CFA/AARP study. The report, called "Expanding
the Information Age for the 1990s: A Pragmatic Consumer Analysis," was
prepared by Mark Cooper of the Citizens Research public interest group.

The report criticizes the centralized, single-wire system based on
fiber-optics often suggested by the RHCs as the ideal infrastructure for
delivering voice, data and video information.  Such a system would concentrate
computing power within the network and allow users to access information
through low-cost terminals, similar to Frances Minitel.

"We don't think the Information Age is broke," said Kimmelman.  "If it were
broke, centralizing wouldn't fix it."

Southwestern Bell and U S West already have adopted such a strategy in their
deployment of videotex gateway terminals in Houston and Omaha, Neb.,
respectively.

The CFA/AARP report favors a "decentralized" system with more than one network
delivering information services to the home.

"With the price of (PCs) falling, consumer demand growing and computer
literacy increasing, U.S. investment in centralized network-based intelligence
and dumb terminals would be a costly waste of resources," the study concludes.

In either a centralized or decentralized environment, low-income, rural and
non-profit groups will not be able to afford information services without
programs designed to subsidize the costs, according to CFA.

The CFA/AARP study was quickly criticized by BellSouth and the Alliance for
Public Technology (APT), a non-profit group "concerned with making
communication and information services more affordable and available to the
public."

BellSouth criticized the study as containing "a number of blatant
misstatements.  It is just plain wrong to suggest that the information
services now enjoyed by countries such as France also are available in the
United States.  It is inaccurate to claim that installing fiber optics -- a
process BellSouth began before 1980 -- will drive up local phone bills."

APT said the "so-called study" by CFA and AARP "condemns 60 percent of the
consumers who they recognize will not have PCs by the end of the century to
second-class status in the new information age....

"Such an approach is anything but pragmatic," APT said.  "It is inherently
elitist and will exclude most consumers from the benefits of the information
age."

PENNSYLVANIA COURT TO REVIEW BELL OF PA.'s CALLER ID TARIFF

A Pennsylvania judge has issued a partial stay of Bell of Pennsylvania's
caller ID tariff, saying legal and public policy issues raised by the state
Consumer Advocate and other groups require resolution before the service
becomes available.

In postponing the Jan. 9 effective  date of the BOC's tariff, Commonwealth
Court Judge James Crumlish Jr. said petitioners had made a "substantial
showing" that caller ID falls within the state Wiretap Act's definition of a
"trap and trace device."

Crumlish added that petitioners had met the legal burden of showing caller ID
may cause "irreparable injury" without the stay, and that the stay will not
adversely affect the public interest.  The partial stay permits Bell of Pa. to
offer caller ID to "emergency service providers."

Oral arguments in the case are set for Feb. 7.  In a brief filed with the
court, however, Bell of Pa. countered that the appeal would "create a new
legal right to make anonymous phone calls."

BOC: Reject Claims


"The (petitioners') claims under the Pennsylvania Wiretap Act should be
rejected because they are contrary to the plain language of the statute and
the opinion of the Attorney General. ...  All that the act requires to
provider caller ID service is the consent of the called party who purchases
the service."

Caller ID permits the called party to view the caller's originating telephone
number on a display unit before answering the phone.  Opponents of the service
in Pennsylvania say it is illegal, or not in the public interest, for Bell of
Pa. to offer caller ID without giving callers the option of blocking display
of their numbers by punching a code before dialing a call.

An administrative law judge (ALJ) at the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission (PUC) in September recommended caller ID with per-call blocking,
saying the service appears to violate the Wiretap Act's prohibition on
recording telephone numbers without the consent of both the calling and called
parties.

On a 3-1 vote, the PUC approved caller ID in November, but withheld the
general availability of per-call blocking.  State regulators ordered Bell of
Pa. to make blocking available to law enforcement authorities and
domestic-violence agencies, as well as individuals associated with such
agencies who are certified by authorities.

In approving the partial stay, Crumlish said the petitioners "have made a
substantial showing that caller ID service falls within the Wiretap Act's
definition of a 'trap and trace device.'"  An exception in the law does permit
recording of "electronic communication" but, as Crumlish notes, "that
exception specifically limits this privilege to a 'provider of electronic or
wire communication service.'"

Crumlish further notes that "irreparable harm" may result to such individuals.
"The record is entirely devoid of evidence suggesting the most minimal
guidelines, such as who might qualify for certification and how much time
would be necessary to effect certification," he said.

"Moreover, the commission's order failes to set forth basic provisions of
notice, hearing and appeal," Crumlish said.  "Thus, individuals who are to be
protected must rely on the unfettered discretion of law enforcement officials
in order to obtain protections that the commission acknowledges are
necessary."

Arguments 'Persuasive'


Although his opinion addresses the stay alone, the judge's view of caller ID
closely parallels that of the ALJ.  Crumlish said he "finds persuasive" the
ALJ's opinion that "other Bell services currently available on a per-call
basis -- such as Call*Trace, Call*Block or Call*Return (Bell Atlantic's
service marks) -- used in conjunction with local Message Unit Detailed
Billing, offer harassed customers essentially the same ability to remedy
abusive calls.

"Thus, because the pervasive nature of the intrusion here -- the dissemination
of one's telephone number without his consent to the general public -- is out
of proportion to the marginal benefits caller ID provides, this (judge) finds
that applicants' request presents no harm to the public interest," Crumlish
said.

Led by Consumer Advocate David Barasch, these groups argue that the general
availability of unrestricted caller ID would violate Pennsylvania's
anti-wiretap law and state constitution, as well as harm the public interest.

The availability of a blocking option and the caller's decision not to punch
in the blocking code would amount to "consent," according to the petitioners
-- Barasch, the American

Civil Liberties Union, the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence
and the Consumer Education and Protective Association.

A Bell of Pa. spokesman said the BOC is "confident" the Commonwealth Court
will permit the introduction of caller ID without the blocking feature.  "The
justice system works, and after it's over we're going to offer caller ID," the
spokesman said.

U S WEST TESTS OCTEL's MADE-FOR-TELCO VOICE MESSAGING SYSTEM

About 500 employees at U S West's Advanced Technology Center in Englewood,
Colo., are trying out a voice-message system said to be the first expressly
designed to allow local telcos to serve residences and small businesses.

Previous and competing products are designed for private use on customers'
premises or by answering services, according to the manufacturer, Octel
Communications of Milpitas, Calif.

Octel is one of four vendors of voice messaging technology now being used in
trials and commercial applications by BOCs around the country. U S West and
BellSouth have chosen the company for their commercial products.

Southwestern Bell and Bell Atlantic have chosen Boston Technology as their
primary vendor of voice messaging products.  Nynex is using equipment produced
by Centrigram, in addition to Octel gear, in its voice messaging rollout in
Boston.  Pacific Telesis is using Octel in its residential applications, but
Digital Sound equipment for business offerings.

Octel's Sierra system ultimately will be able to accommodate 2,304 ports and
serve half a million customers, Octel says.  An interim version with 72 ports
will be ready for delivery to the general market in April, and a 144-port
model will be produced in the third quarter of 1990,  said Dan Patyk, Octel's
general manager of telephone company business development.

The product's chief attractions are low initial cost, allowing telcos to test
the service before investing heavily; simplified voice prompts, and rugged
design suited to telco central offices, Patyk said.

He noted that voice mail systems made for businesses offer a variety of
features such as listening to the message before it's sent, confirmation that
it has been sent and marking for delivery only to the person to whom it is
addressed.

By comparison, although the Sierra can add features, its initial offerings
have been kept deliberately simple.  And customers can dial help lines if they
have trouble.

U S West has tested other Octel systems in Denver, Phoenix, Omaha, and Boise,
Idaho.  The Bell regional holding company (RHC) received a comparably
efficient interconnection waiver for those trials in December 1988.

As one example of custom design for telco use, Patyk noted that the many disk
drives used to store information in the Sierra are modular.  When one develops
faults --  as all disk drives eventually do -- a technician simply pulls out
the old drive and inserts a new one.

Sierra adheres "to the Bellcore Network Equipment-Building Systems
guidelines," said Robert Cohn, Octel president and chief executive officer.
In addition, the hardware can be monitored remotely from a central
network-management center.

One secret to Sierra's capacity is the inclusion of up to 18 Intel 80386
computer processing chips in each 144-port unit.  Another is the capacity to
link modules with a 100 megabits-per-second fiber-optic link. In addition, the
2,304-port version will be able to store 10,750 hours of messages, the maker
claims.

Components, including line cards and telephone interface cards, can be
replaced without shutting down power to the system, Octel said.

The equipment works with both analog and digital trunks, and can service as
many as 144 central offices, Octel said.

Prices start at $370,000 for the 72-port model.  The base price of the
144-port version is $545,000.

BELL ATLANTIC REQUESTS MASSIVE PROTOCOL-CONVERSION WAIVER

Bell Atlantic has asked the Justice Department for a Consent Decree waiver
that would allow it to offer computer protocol conversion independent of its
videotex gateway.  Buyers could choose the service they need for private
networks.

"Bell Atlantic does not concede that the conversions at issue here are
information services," the Bell regional holding company (RHC) said. "Bell
Atlantic believes that all these conversions are already permitted because
they simply allow a wide variety of terminals and computer systems to
communicate with each other over the telephone network.

"As such, they are used 'for the management, control or operation of a
telecommunications system ... or service' and are, therefore explicitly
excluded from the decree's definition of information services," the RHC said.

Specifically, the RHC wants the waiver to allow it to convert electronic mail
messages into printed form.  "For example, such a conversion could allow an
asynchronous terminal in a store that sells lottery tickets to communicate
efficiently with the central computer that runs the lottery system," Bell
Atlantic said.

In all, the RHC wants to convert messages among 17 different data transmission
formats:  1) asynchronous protocols used by personal computers and many other
office devices, 2) X.25  packet switching, the basis of Bell Atlantic's Public
Data Network, 3) X.75, which permits communication between two packet switched
networks, 4) high-level data link control, allowing synchronous data
transmission over point-to-point, multi-point, switched or unswitched
facilities, 5) IBM 3270 binary synchronous protocol, between IBM computers and
IBM terminal cluster controllers, 6) IBM System Network Architecture/
Synchronous Data Link Control, which would allow communication between IBM
computers in multiple remote locations, 7) IBM 2780/3780, an old synchronous
protocol used for batch communications, 8) Burroughs Data Link Control, the
Burroughs version of number 4, above, 9) Digital Equipment Corp.'s Data
Communications protocol, 10) Sperry Universal Data Link Control, the same as
4, 8, and 9, 11) X.400 electronic mail, the international standard for
electronic mail, 12) transmission control protocol/ internet protocol, 13)
Ethernet, a popular variety of local area network protocol, 14) token ring,
also a LAN protocol, 15) dual-queue, dual-bus, metropolitan area network,  16)
Fiber Distributed Data Interface, a 100 megabits-per-second, fiber optic,
token-ring LAN, and 17) electronic mail to fax hard copy.

Comments are to be directed to the Justice Department by Feb. 7.

Pac Bell Drops Voice Mail Prices

Pacific Bell says tests of residential voice messaging services in two
California cities have been rousing successes, but have convinced the company
to lower service prices.

"More than 95 percent of our trial customers have been very happy with the
Pacific Bell Message Center," said Kris Kenworthy, Pac Bell product manager.
But customers said the price is too high: $7.50 a month in Milpitas, near San
Jose, and $6 a month in San Pedro, near Los Angeles.


Pac Bell set the price of voice messaging at $4.95 a month.

The company has been testing  residential voice mail service since March.  It
received approval of its comparably efficient interconnection plan from the
FCC in February 1989. Pac Bell says it will offer the service in San
Francisco, San Jose and other Bay-area towns by the end of the year.

BellSouth To Sell Voice Mail Gear

BellSouth has renewed for two years its existing contract to sell a full range
of voice processing equipment made by Digital Sound Corp. of Santa Barbara,
Calif., the two companies announced recently.

BellSouth's two BOCs, Southern Bell and South Central Bell has been selling
Digital Sound's equipment since 1986.  "The VoiceServer product line is now
serving many BellSouth customers and we expect significant expansion of this
base over the next two years," said Robert Kelly, Digital Sound's senior vice
president of sales.

Digital Sound's product line includes voice mail, automated attendant, voice
bulletin board and interactive voice response products for businesses.

Ameritech Expands VoiceQuest

Ameritech Audiotex Services will add audiotex processing facilities using its
VoiceQuest system in Milwaukee, Indianapolis and Detroit by mid-April, the
company announced recently.  The company already operates a Chicago gateway.

The unregulated Ameritech subsidiary will process calls to sponsor-paid "800"
numbers and caller-paid intra-LATA "900" numbers.  The company had been
awaiting approval of intra-LATA 900 tariffs before starting up the "specialty
gateways," according to an Audiotex Services spokeswoman.

In a related development, Audiotex Services is promoting its Chicago "976"
audiotex service by offering information providers who sign up by April 1 a
1-ounce gold coin and waiving the monthly minimum usage charge for six months.

Common Carrier Rules Approved

The New York Public Service Commission has approved a set of generic rules
defining the obligations of telephone companies and other common carriers.

The new rules require telcos to provide their publicly offered voice and data
transmission services on demand and on similar terms to similarly situated
customers.  The rules require that telephone companies must provide
interconnections for other private and public networks.

On the subject of video transmission, the rules provide that if telcos begin
to offer common carrier video services, the telcos must have enough capacity
available for any video content provider who wants to buy video transmission
service.  The rules also require that the telcos treat all video content
providers equally.

The rules require that the component functions and elements making up a
transmission service be "segregable" to the fullest practical extent.

The rules declare that telecommunications common carriers have no control over
the content of lawful communications and cannot impose unreasonable
restrictions on network use solely because of content.  In return, the rules
absolve telecom common carriers from any legal liability for damages caused by
the content of messages they carry.

But when carriers learn of content controversies, they are obligated to inform
the content providers and complaining parties about the appropriate complaint
mechanisms.

Where laws require restrictions because of message content, the law is to be
administered by carriers in the least restrictive manner the law allows.  The
rules require that end-users be given the capability to block services when
they find the content to be objectionable, unless such blocking is technically
impossible or prohibitively expensive.

The decision to adopt these rules was not unanimous.  Commissioner Gail
Schwartz, in a dissenting opinion, said the rules were too vague to be of
value and offered the potential for conflict with other proceedings such as
the commission's ongoing activity on open network architecture.

Letters: Surf's Down


In response to your request for predictions of what will be
hot in '96, I offer the following: The Internet hasn't peaked
yet, but you can almost hear the sound of the firewalls slamming
shut as companies find out that surfing is about as productive
inside a company as it is on the beach.

Big corporations will abandon the Net in droves as they figure
out the economic benefits of creating a non-public, more secure
backbone of their own.

Watch for some big players to figure this out early. Also, CompuServe
and Prodigy will merge. Or will Delphi buy one or both?

Letters: Intelligent Choice


I see interest in topics traditionally associated with artificial
intelligence experiencing a resurgence in 1996 as people try
to get more value out of their data warehouses. The urge to
experiment with data mining will be the primary spark behind
this resurgence.

However, more people will experiment with agents, case-based
reasoning, fuzzy math, genetic algorithms, and neural networks
as they try to better understand what they have stored in their
warehouses.

Rather than one or two products benefiting from this increased
interest, a variety of technologies will see a modest upswing
in sales.

Letters: Development Made Easy



In 1996, I see applicational development in HTML taking off,
removing one of the biggest problems that all businesses have
in developing for hybrid networks.

Products such as Next's Web-Objects will sell tremendously as
corporations realize that age-old problems like remote administration
and remote software distribution are no longer needed on such
a scale, as only servers need to be updated. Also, finished
apps will be viewed by management or any person interested
in the product by simply installing Netscape.

Editor's Note: Prognostications -- Looking Ahead

By:
Joel Dreyfuss

I'm not sure when journalists were first asked to put down their
notepads and gaze into a crystal ball; maybe they were never
asked at all. I suspect that the ritual of predicting the big
developments of the New Year began when some people in my profession
started taking themselves much too seriously. Somehow, predicting
is in danger of becoming an annual event even in our offices,
where we work hard to keep journalistic egos tightly leashed.

But there's no danger that you'll confuse the editors of InformationWeek
with traveling-sideshow fortune tellers. Our prognostications
are based on solid research and knowledge of the industry.
And we made them for two reasons: The first is that everyone
enjoys reading somebody else's predictions, if only to reinforce
their own feelings of intellectual superiority. But there's
also a second, practical concern: All of us spend so much time
running just to stand still that a look forward can help us
put things in perspective. Our list may even spur you to alter
your technology implementation plans for 1996.

What's Inside

This special issue spotlights the technologies and products
we believe will be making news in 1996. As senior editor Joseph
C. Panettieri points out in his introduction, many of the products
featured will help bring us closer to the idea of the virtual
corporation.

Directory services, advanced network operating systems, groupware,
and Java, among others, all help make geographic location irrelevant
in today's business world. The concept of corporate headquarters
may soon be obsolete. The Internet-that unavoidable, dislocated
entity-may connect us wherever we are, and even whether or
not we want to be connected.

This issue of InformationWeek is unique in several ways. We've
created some nifty interactive links with our Web site (http
//techweb.cmp.com/iwk). Each hot technology listed here will
have a Web resource center to bring together stories we've
done on the subject, and links to related sites. There will
also be some threaded chats and ballots seeking your opinion.
Finally, all the illustrations are by the renowned artist,
Gahan Wilson, His peculiar view of the world seemed just right
for our flight of fancy into the very near future.

Introduction: The New High-Tech Landscape --Tools for building powerful virtual
enterprise networks are now on the horizon

By:
Joseph C. Panettieri

Looking for 1996's hottest information technology trends and
products? The view starts here. Today's technology landscape
is littered with tools for building tomorrow's virtual enterprise
networks. Technologies that were still being tested last year
such as visual development tools and groupware-will be the
basis for crafting the new enterprise structure.

The means are at hand to build communications systems that span
multiple companies, ease information retrieval, and foster
electronic commerce.

For instance, all eyes are on SunSoft's Java scripting language,
which promises a new generation of Internet applications.

After anemic starts, Microsoft's Windows NT and Novell's NetWare
Directory Services should finally provide the needed infrastructure
for distributed network systems. A new version of Lotus Notes
will ratchet up expectations for groupware and could make or
break IBM's $3.5 billion takeover of Lotus Development.

A new generation of client-server development tools will give
technology managers plenty of muscle to build new systems.
Among the products to watch are Borland International's Delphi
and Microsoft's Visual Basic.

Multimedia-ready desktops will provide the delivery vehicle
for applications built using these tools.

Given the hardware demands of such sophisticated client-server
systems, many corporations will turn to robust multiprocessor
servers. Also, the testing cycle will begin on systems using
next-generation 64-bit chips.

There is a plethora of new products on the technology landscape.
The destination is clear: virtual networks that offer anywhere,
anytime information access within and among companies.

The following pages of this special issue suggest how best to
get there.

Online Transactions: Pouring Cash Into The Internet -- In 1995, companies 
learned what they could gain by doing business online. Now they're
ready to make investments

By:
Clinton Wilder

Predicting that electronic commerce will be hot in 1996 is a
bit like predicting that the Super Bowl will be this month's
big media event. To anyone even remotely familiar with the
topic, it's obvious.

If 1995 was the year that the Internet and the World Wide Web
became household words, 1996 is the year that those words will
become gospel to thousands of business and technology managers
around the world. The Web, no longer the sole province of academicians
and Generation X Net surfers, is fast becoming a viable medium
for companies in all industries to post information and take
orders. In addition, 1996 will see technology advances that
will make businesses more comfortable conducting financial
transactions online.

"In terms of absolute growth, business-to-business commerce
online will grow faster this year than business-to-consumer,"
says Torrey Byles, director of electronic commerce for BIS
Strategic Decisions, a market research firm in Santa Clara,
Calif. "As corporate procurement managers get more familiar
with the Net, that will really drive electronic commerce activity.
Because the Net is global, they're beginning to realize the
whole world is their oyster in terms of sourcing."

Several technology areas hold the key to enabling and spurring
the growth of electronic commerce, and all will get significant
attention from vendors in 1996.  That attention will result in
new products and services, new alliances, and, undoubtedly, new
initial public stock offerings.  Among the hot technologies will
be:  Sun's Java scripting language, groupware p.  18), electronic
data interchange (EDI) on the Internet, security, and a new
hardware platform commonly called the Internet PC.

EDI could be the "killer" application that drives more businesses
onto the Internet. That's why Net vendors are seeking to cash
in. Premenos Corp. in Concord, Calif., led the way in 1995
with its Templar software that protects EDI packets on the
Net. And competition looms. Larger EDI players such as IBM,
General Electric Information Services, Sterling Software, and
Harbinger have announced major Internet initiatives or formed
new Internet divisions. "1996 will be a good year for EDI and
the Internet to get married," says Byles of BIS Strategic Decisions.

Of course, electronic commerce won't catch fire unless security
standards are in place. Security experts expect to see more
news reports about obscure flaws discovered in standard encryption
algorithms. There will be continued squabbling between the
Visa-Microsoft and MasterCard-Netscape-IBM alliances over secure
credit-card transaction standards. But experts also expect
to see real advances toward industrial-strength security that
will enable commerce. "Security is still the bugaboo, but a
lot more people now perceive the viability of electronic commerce,"
says David Sims, technical manager of IT at Schlumberger Inc.
in Sugar Land, Texas. "Now that MasterCard and Visa are on
board, you'll see a lot of progress."

Despite the current lack of security and infrastructure to ensure
the safety of large-scale financial transactions on the Internet,
hundreds of companies are moving quickly to make online commerce
a reality. On Jan. 11, AMP Inc. in Harrisburg, Pa., a $4 billion
maker of electronic components, will go live on its Web site
(http://www.connect.amp.com) with an online catalog of 35,000
parts. Using a search engine called Step Search from Saqqara
Systems Inc. in Sunnyvale, Calif., the site will let customers
search in five languages against AMP's Oracle7 database for
specs, prices, and availability of electric connectors, sockets,
and hundreds of other parts in the AMP catalog. Customers will
be able to order samples or place complete orders, then track
the status of those orders on the Web.

AMP's decision was strictly a business investment. "Our executives
are very conservative here," says Jim Kessler, director of
global electronic commerce at AMP. "A lot of what's out there
on the Web today was motivated by emotion; we weren't going
to do that. We looked at hard dollar savings, and there was
more than enough justification." AMP is banking on its Web
site to put a significant dent in its annual $6 million to
$10 million catalog print production costs, increase the productivity
of its sales force, and reach new markets.

Companies such as AMP, General Electric's plastics division,
and National Semiconductor have elected to host their online
parts catalogs on their own Web sites using third-party technology.
In Nat Semi's case, the technology is Java, making it one of
the first significant business applications written in the
Sun language. Nat Semi, in Santa Clara, Calif., developed a
parametric search engine to let its customers find the chips
they need online.

But other large companies have chosen a different route: using
a Web hosting service to deliver product data to their customers
and distributors. Honeywell, Rockwell International's Allen
Bradley unit, and Square D are among 4,000 companies that have
posted home pages on Industry.Net (http://www.industry.net),
a Pittsburgh service that intends to be a one-stop shop for
buyers seeking manufacturing components.

Tom Jones, Industry.Net's VP of marketing, sees the service
as a way for firms to get started in online commerce. He predicts
big changes in attitudes over the next 12 months. "I don't
think [business has] the confidence at this point that the
Internet is a place to do millions of dollars in secure transactions,"
says Jones. "But that will change. As companies put their public
domain information on the Net, and see the type of traffic
and the types of quality customers they get, they'll get much
more comfortable."

Electronic commerce also represents a huge opportunity for large
corporations to blur the lines between being a user and a vendor
of information technology. That often involves partnerships
with large vendors or systems integrators. The Walgreen drugstore
chain, for example, sells its network technology for automatic
filling of doctors' prescriptions to IBM, which in turn sells
the network capability to other customers. "We have a whole
new breed of partners that are also our customers," says Dennie
Welsh, general manager of global services at IBM.

On the consumer side, use of the Web for information will continue
to expand in 1996 but actual purchases over the Net will grow
more slowly and be more niche-oriented. The best bets for growth
will be information-based products. Heading the list are online
publications and software; the latter already enjoys solid
growth on Web sites such as the Internet Shopping Network and
CyberSource's software.net. "The best consumer products to
sell online are [those] that can be investigated, purchased,
and delivered over the Net," says Mike Homer, Netscape's VP
of marketing.

Another boost to online consumer activity this year will be
thousands of new customers choosing to bank electronically.
Although Microsoft and Intuit called off their blockbuster
merger in 1995, they're being just as aggressive in going after
the electronic banking market separately (IW, Dec. 18, p. 14).
Once customers are comfortable with electronic banking, they'll
be more inclined to pay for products and services electronically."In
1996, we'll see electronic banking laying the groundwork for
a comfort level for electronic payments," says Richard Crone,
senior VP and co-director of electronic banking at Home Savings
of America in Irwindale, Calif. "People will first get the
degree of comfort and familiarity by electronic bill-paying."

But brace yourself: The electronic commerce era is still new.
Twelve months from now, 1995 will seem calm by comparison.

Lotus Notes: Sharing The Workload -- Notes put Lotus Development ahead of
the field in groupware. Will Notes 4 keep Lotus in front?

By:
Stephanie Stahl

When Lotus Notes 4, the 1996 release of the innovative Lotus
Development groupware product, was demonstrated a year ago,
a number of the software's loyal, almost cult-like users stood
up and applauded for more than 10 minutes.

There's no question Notes 4 is hot-and much more than an incremental
upgrade. It includes dramatic improvements in scalability,
ease of use, programmability, Internet access, management,
and more. But Notes 4 also will face much more competition
than its predecessors did.

Lotus-now a unit of IBM-began selling Notes in 1989, and singlehandedly
created a new category of computing called groupware. It took
the market and rival vendors a few years to truly understand
what groupware is all about, allowing Lotus to fly solo.

Now, however, corporate America's desire to collaborate on documents
and share information across networks has other vendors angling
for a piece of the action. Software giants such as Microsoft
and Novell, as well as a slew of small, nimble companies, are
breathing down Lotus' neck with their own groupware products.

While none can claim to do exactly what Notes does-with its
application development, replication, and other sophisticated
features-many products provide some of the collaborative features
users are thirsting for.

The numbers speak for themselves: By 1997, the groupware market
is expected to grow to nearly $4 billion, up from $1.3 billion
in 1994, according to First Albany Corp., a research and investment
banking firm in New York. With increasing competition in the
groupware market and sluggish sales of its other products,
Notes 4 could very well be the most important product ever
for Lotus.

"Release 4 is Lotus' only product," says Giles McNamee, an analyst
with First Albany, which is also a Notes user. "Everything
else is decaying. It's just a question of time before they
finish shoveling the dirt over the other products."

But for Lotus to continue to reign in the groupware market,
it must push Notes deeper into the mainstream. The company
is banking on Notes 4, which will make its official debut at
Lotus' annual user group meeting in January, to help it stay
ahead of the pack.

"It's the most important thing they've got," says Jeff Held,
managing partner for the Center For Technology Enablement at
Ernst & Young in New York, a large Notes user. "Notes 4 could
put them way ahead of any competitor if they have a successful
rollout."

For starters, Notes 4 has a much-improved user interface. It
includes drag-and-drop icons, the ability to open multiple
windows, a multipane screen, and more.

"There is nothing intuitive about using Notes Release 3.x,"
says McNamee. "Everything must be learned. The menus are confusing
and deeply hierarchical. It may be a DOS lover's idea of a
cool application, but for a Mac-trained person, the interface
is nothing short of lame."

Lotus agrees there's ample room for improvement. "We are on
a mission to make Notes applications more accessible to a broad
range of people," says Tim Dempsey, director of Notes product
marketing at Lotus.

More Users, Less Space

As Notes becomes a foundation for critical, enterprise-wide
applications, users will require improvements in scalability
and manageability. With Notes 4, Lotus has come up with ways
to host more users per server, take up less network bandwidth
per user, and have fewer administrators watching the network.

Lotus claims that Notes 4 running on multiprocessor platforms
can support up to 1,000 active, concurrent users per server
compared to approximately 100 to 200 users per server on Notes
3.x platforms.

Notes 4 is based on a 32-bit multithreaded architecture that
exploits symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) and increases processor
support to six from two. This SMP support means more simultaneous
sessions per server and increased replication capability.

"With a multiprocessing, high-speed architecture, we will be
able to get many more users on a server," says Held. Ernst
& Young, which has about 100 users per Notes server, has deployed
about 200 servers throughout the enterprise, and is only about
halfway finished. The fewer servers the firm will have to manage
in the future, the better, Held says.

Lotus also has included some new management tools in Notes 4
to allow centralized administration of the Notes network. One
provides a common graphical interface for simultaneously managing
several servers from a single console. Another allows administrators
to centralize policymaking and to delegate specific administration
tasks. A third tool lets administrators make changes to any
server, regardless of its location.

Lotus developers also have made big strides in making Notes
more flexible for travelers. "Some of the [biggest payoffs
in] applications involve mobile users," says Dempsey. "Life
needs to be made easier for them."

To that end, Lotus has made managing location profiles easier
in Notes 4. Users can create multiple location configurations,
such as "home" or "hotel," each with information on dialing
rules, home servers, replication, and more.

After that, all they need to do is pick one of the locations
from a status bar and Notes accommodates that environment.

Users also can determine how they want to replicate information
and decide whether they want to receive all new documents or
E-mail messages or just a certain subset. "This provides users
with a much higher degree of control over how they want to
get information back and forth," says Dempsey.

Replication also has been improved to include field-level capability.
With Notes 4, when a user goes to replicate a document, only
new changes are transmitted. Previously, the entire document
had to be transmitted on the network, taking up valuable bandwidth.
"Even if one letter had changed in a document, the whole thing
would have to be replicated," says Held. "[Field-level replication]
will be a great improvement for a large Notes network."

Notes 4 also has a function called "Server PassThrough" that
enables users to make only one call to access multiple Notes
servers. With earlier releases of Notes, users might have to
make multiple calls just to get all the information they need.
Server PassThrough also allows Notes clients on a LAN to connect
to servers running different network protocols.

Noting The Net

In addition, Notes 4 helps users take advantage of one of the
industry's hottest new developments-the Internet. The software's
server version performs as both a Notes server and a Web server.
It includes native support for key Internet protocols, including
HTML, HTTP, and Java. The groupware also includes the InterNotes
Web Navigator, a feature that enables users to incorporate
Internet-based information into their core Notes applications.
Unlike simple Web browsers, which provide access to the Web,
InterNotes Web Navigator allows users to import Web documents
directly into Notes.

Users can take advantage of all of the inherent capabilities
in Notes for getting information off the Net. For example,
they could use Notes' searching and retrieval capabilities
and agent technology to find and import data from the Web.
An agent-software that performs a rule-based function on the
user's behalf-could be built to automatically retrieve information
from a competitor's Web site and import the data into a Notes
database containing competitive information. Notes could then
distribute the information to the company sales force.

InterNotes Web Navigator translates standard Web HTML documents,
including forms, tables, photos, graphics, hyperlinks, and
URLs into Notes. Once a document is pulled into Notes, the
Web links are still live.

"Today, when you pull information from the Web and put it into
a document, its life as a part of the Web is over," says Dempsey.
"With [InterNotes Web Navigator], all of the links are still
available when you open up a document in Notes." So, from a
Notes document, users can jump to Web sites with the click
of a mouse.

Notes users can also pull FTP, Gopher, Usenet, and other Internet
information that exists beyond the Web into Notes applications.
The Navigator resides on the Notes server, eliminating a need
for TCP/IP

on every client. Administrators can deny access to specific
sites.

While some pundits see the Web's global reach and information
access capabilities as a significant threat to Notes, Lotus
insists there is a market for both.

Products such as InterNotes are examples of how the two can
complement each other, Lotus says. "Notes is tailored for the
business user," says Ray Ozzie, the mastermind behind Notes.
"We don't see a direct threat today. We see nothing but opportunities
from the Internet."

For developers, Notes 4 includes Lotus-Script, a cross-platform,
Basic-compatible, object-oriented programming language. "Notes
is really an elaborate development environment in which users
can build workflow and groupware," says First Albany's McNamee.
"Currently, the scripting is so complicated and arduous that
only well-trained, fully dedicated developers can build applications,
says Held. "LotusScript should greatly expand the number of
people who will write applications for Notes."

It's In The (E-)Mail

As the line between groupware and messaging blurs, Lotus is
improving the E-mail capabilities in Notes. Notes 4 has an
integrated client-server messaging engine with a more intuitive
interface based on cc:Mail, Lotus' hot-selling E-mail system.
This provides dramatic improvement over current mail capabilities,
users say. Adds Lotus' Dempsey: "We want to make it a mindless
experience to do Notes mail." Like previous releases of Notes,
Notes 4 runs on a wide variety of operating systems, including
NT, Unix, and OS/2, as well as on Digital Equipment's Alpha
platform. Lotus enters 1996 with slightly more than 3 million
Notes users-a far cry from the 20 million that Lotus' former
CEO, Jim Manzi, set as a goal for 1997.

But even if the company can't achieve that target-and despite
fears about how well historically bureaucratic IBM will develop
the software-one thing appears certain: Notes 4 will be hot
enough to help Lotus maintain its reputation as the premier
groupware vendor and compete against the toughest competition
it's ever faced. Upgrade: Lotus Notes Navigators (top) allow
users to instantly access graphical Notes data or other apps
by clicking on text or a picture. Developers can use workflow
applications (bottom) to build formula-based options into the
design of Notes forms.

Net gains: Notes' Ozzie sees 'nothing but opportunities from
the Internet.'

Directory Services: Finding The Way -- Directory services will help 
guide technology managers through an enterprise filled with important 
information

By:
Caryn Gillooly

Most information technology managers have a data center full
of technologies that are used almost every day, technologies
they can't imagine living without-E-mail and antivirus software,
for example. In 1996, IT managers are going to add a new technology
to that list: directory services.

Actually, directory services are not so new. Novell included
NetWare Directory Services in its release of NetWare 4.1 operating
system more than a year ago, and Banyan Systems Inc. has offered
its directory service for close to 10 years. Outside the network
operating system market, more than a half-dozen other vendors
have offered directory services for almost as long.

But it's only recently that computer vendors and users have
started to understand directory services.

With Novell still encompassing more than half of the LAN market,
its directory service seems to have gotten more attention than
all other products combined.

"Novell has helped educate the market on the importance of a
directory service," wrote Charles Phillips, an analyst at New
York brokerage Morgan Stanley & Co., in a recent report.

Yet many customers still don't understand what directory services
are and how they can benefit organizations. But 1996 just may
be the time to learn: It's the year Novell's directory service
will become widely deployed, as well as the year in which Microsoft
will come on strong with its own directory service.

Before defining what a directory service is, it's necessary
to define the term directory. A directory is a collection of
information-a repository-that usually is specific to one particular
application. It holds all the information relating to that
application, such as user-login data and user-access rights.
Just about every application on a network has its own directory.
The trick is to make the directories work together, which is
where directory services come in.

With a directory service, all applications can share the same
database of user and network information, and it is unnecessary
to replicate the data throughout the network. "Customers have
a whole gamut of directories, from crude to sophisticated.
Something has to manage those directories," says Jay Seaton,
director of worldwide product marketing for the directory solutions
business unit at Banyan in Westboro, Mass. "The directory service
should be viewed as a common service that makes things easy
to find when you have hundreds of thousands of objects on your
network."

All-In-One

Users agree that getting all that information in one place is
essential. "A comprehensive directory service is what companies
need to get all the data under one structure-that's where the
key is," says John Bullivant, systems manager at J.P. Morgan
& Co., a brokerage in New York.

The larger the network, the more important a single structure
becomes. "Any company that wants to have an enterprise solution
has to get into directory services," says Robert Anderson,
a marketing and communications executive at Control Data Systems,
a systems integrator in Minneapolis. "Directory services are
key to any kind of information tracking."

While many directories exist in the largest companies, few such
companies have implemented any sort of directory service, primarily
because the choice of products is still small and the technology
relatively immature.

The market today is segmented into two types of offerings: LAN
based directory services and enterprise directory services,
says David Cappuccio, VP and research director at Garter Group
Inc., an information technology advisory firm in Stamford,
Conn.

On the enterprise side, there are companies such as Control
Data, Unisys, and ICL Ltd. On the LAN side, the leaders are
Novell with NDS and Banyan with its StreetTalk directory service.
IBM, despite its mainframe heritage, also competes in this
market with its Directory and Security Services for OS/2 LAN
Server and Warp Server. Traditionally, LAN-based directory
services have come bundled with the network operating system
and, consequently, have done little more than provide services
for one particular network operating system.

But things are starting to open up. Banyan set the stage in
early 1993 when it announced its Enterprise Network Service
product line. ENS is a separate package made up of Banyan's
messaging, security, and directory services unbundled from
its Vines network operating system. ENS already is available
on NetWare, several different Unix platforms including IBM's
AIX, and Microsoft's Windows NT.

Banyan took the idea a step further by announcing Universal
StreetTalk. The company will make its directory services code
available to anyone who wants to implement it."This is not
just a set of APIs [application programming interfaces]," says
Seaton. "This is literally giving them the directory."

Novell followed suit in September by saying it will publish
a set of APIs that would let NDS act as the directory not only
for NetWare networks, but also for those based on Microsoft's
Windows NT, IBM's OS/2, and others. "We're going to put NDS
on all other platforms that make sense," says David Clare,
a product manager at Novell.

Even Microsoft has decided to get into the directory services
game. Today, Microsoft doesn't really have a directory service.
There are domain-based services included in NT, but they don't
compare with an industrial-strength directory services such
as NDS. Microsoft says it will ship a true directory service
sometime in 1997 with Cairo, a major upgrade of NT. But it
won't be Microsoft's sole directory; a different one-but upwardly
compatible with Cairo's directory-is expected in Exchange,
the company's messaging and groupware product that is slated
to ship in the first quarter of 1996.

To resolve any potential application conflicts, Microsoft in
September announced the Open Directory Services Interface-its
own directory services API. With ODSI, applications developers
can write to a single API, and their application can access
any directory service that also interfaces with ODSI. That
way, applications can be written independently from any specific
directory service and developers won't have to choose a winner.
Other vendors such as Novell initially agreed to support it,
but they now seem to be backing away from their commitments.

Standards bodies also play a significant role in directory services.
The Open Software Foundation's Distributed Computing Environment
(DCE) includes specifications for building an enterprisewide,
distributed directory service, along with specifications for
distributed security, distributed mail services, remote communications,
and more. While Novell says it will make its directory interoperate
with DCE systems, IBM's directory is based on the DCE specifications.

The advantage: DCE can run on all platforms, from the lowest
end PCs to the highest-end mainframes-all of which IBM offer.
"The one thing IS really wants is a name service that deals
with the whole IS structure-scalability to all platforms,"
says Gary Gunnerson, technology chief at USA Today's Information
Network in Arlington, Va.

DCE also can bring its other services-in addition to directory
services-across such a range of platforms. "DCE provides one
secure logon to all systems, including mainframes and Unix
machines," says Lisa Laing, a network systems analyst at McGill
University in Montreal. IBM's DCE directory service is expected
to be available soon.

This cross-platform view is where the enterprise offerings have
the advantage. Companies such as Control Data Systems, ICL,
and Unisys offer directory service products based on X.500,
the International Standards Organisation's framework for developing
an enterprise directory service. Like DCE, X.500 spans platforms.
But X.500 has become more of a gateway solution, a common way
to connect other directory services. "X.500 has the opportunity
and is the only standard out there to be the Esperanto of the
directory world," says Tim Sloane, director of electronic messaging
at the Aberdeen Group Inc., a consulting firm in Boston.

Until recently, the LAN- and enterprise-based directory service
markets were separate. But the two are starting to come together
as LANs become more enterprisewide, and as enterprise-based
products begin to reach down into individual network segments.
Also fueling this convergence is the introduction of directory
service tools specifically designed to bridge that gap.

A Leg Up

The merging of the two markets will get an added boost when
applications begin to stretch from LAN to enterprise networks.
"Directory services has always been behind-the-scenes infrastructure
technology," says Banyan's Seaton. "But as it starts to be
integrated into the applications, the value becomes much more
significant."

Many customers already understand the significance of directory
services. "For our purposes, we needed one place for all the
network information," says Niraj Patel, network and telecommunication
manager at GMAC Mortgage, a NetWare 4 customer in Elkins Park,
Pa. "We went to NetWare 4 because of NDS. It's great to have
a central NDS server to do all of the management."

Until two years ago, W.R. Grace & Co. used Digital Equipment's
PathWorks network operating system. But PathWorks didn't have
a directory service, so the company decided to look for something
else, according to Jonathan Prigot, supervisor of technical
support at the Boca Raton, Fla., chemical company. Grace chose
NetWare 4. "Since we were looking at a corporate network operating
system to bind the company locations into a cohesive whole,
directory services was high on our list," Prigot says.

With the system in place for more than a year, Prigot says he
now appreciates the full benefits of NDS: "It organizes my
resources wonderfully. I get a complete diagram, including
who's on what server and what resources are being used." Grace
still has Hewlett-Packard OpenMail E-mail boxes for employees,
but Prigot says he plans to bring even those mailboxes under
NDS. "We plan to integrate in as much as possible," he says.
"Our ultimate plan is to have one massive directory structure
based on NetWare." But most companies don't have the benefits
of a directory service. For many, installing one is simply
too daunting a task. "It's imposing," says John Miller, a former
data communications specialist at HealthCare Compare Corp.
in Downers Grove, Ill. "[Our] people are comfortable with NetWare

3.11 and 3.12. They're taking classes [on NetWare 4], but that's
about all they're doing."

Some customers see it differently. "For four years we had to
figure out how to manage 100 NetWare servers without a directory,"
says Chuck Rush, global networking manager at fast-food franchiser
McDonald's Corp. in Oak Brook, Ill. "What we have works now.
Since nothing's broken and nobody's screaming, we're going
to wait."

Yet even companies that don't yet have directory services see
the benefit. "It's worth moving to directory services. It's
got a lot to offer," says Miller of HealthCare. "You have to
take a long view. The short view says everything is working
fine. But with a long view, you're no longer managing one server,
you're managing one network."

Even more compelling is the potential for what directory services
can do once the technology and market has matured. "You'll
use directory services to store electronic forms and use it
as an information database for calendaring, scheduling, and
even workflow processes," says Control Data's Anderson. Novell's
Clare agrees: "Directory services is going to be the heart
of the network, from the departmental LAN to global networks."

Windows NT: Bringing In The Best Windows -- Disdained when it first came
out, NT gets second looks

By:
Joseph C. Panettieri

Flash back to the summer of 1993: jurassic Park was smashing
box-office records.

A new First Lady was trying to reinvent the American health
care system. And technology managers were scratching their
heads over Microsoft's 32-bit operating system, Windows NT.

Microsoft chairman and CEO Bill Gates was bullish on his new
product, boldly predicting NT would sell 1 million copies in
its first year.

But the brash Mr. Gates would be proved wrong. Corporations
simply weren't willing to deploy an unproven operating system
that required loads of memory and lacked networking and application
support. Insiders say Windows NT sold less than 400,000 copies
its first year.

Zoom forward to today. While millions of consumers just unwrapped
PCs employing Microsoft's Windows 95, corporate America is
set to ring in the new year with a new look at the 30-month
old NT. "Just about every company we've spoken with has spent
the last two years piloting NT," says Bob Sakakeeny, an analyst
at Boston consulting firm Aberdeen Group Inc. "Those pilots
will turn into deployments this year."

Microsoft won't disclose NT's installed base, but observers
peg it at between 2 million and 4 million units. One by one,
corporations are entrusting their department workstations and
servers to NT, betting that there's life for Microsoft beyond
the traditional desktop PC.

According to more than one market research firm, monthly NT
Server sales have topped 30,000 units since last summer. Those
taking the NT plunge read like a Who's Who of corporate America
 the Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa), Charles Schwab, Chevron,
General Electric, J.C. Penney, Kmart, MCI, and Sprint, among
others.

Experts say NT is enjoying success especially in three key vertical
markets: retail, finance, and energy. For example, "Chevron,
Pennzoil, and Lyondell are moving to NT with a vengeance,"
says Mike Brule, president of Technomation Systems Inc., a
systems integrator in Houston that works closely with oil companies
and helped Amoco Corp. install an NT network. Amoco is using
NT for a custom application that helps company engineers estimate
the cost of potential oil explorations.

Getting Focused

Computer hardware vendors have not lost sight of this trend.
Digital Equipment is training hundreds of engineers to support
Windows NT on systems employing both its Alpha RISC (reduced
instruction set computing) microprocessors and those from Intel
Corp. Says Tim Miller, strategic marketing manager for Alpha
at Digital, "Our long-term operating system strategy is one
that's processor-independent, driven by NT moving down into
the mainstream."

Late last year, NetFrame Systems Inc., a leading maker of servers
running Novell NetWare, hedged its bets and began shipping
fault-tolerant four-way multiprocessor servers preloaded with
NT. Likewise, NEC is preparing multiprocessor NT Servers powered
by Silicon Graphics Inc.'s forthcoming MIPS R10000 chip.

While Microsoft's most recent iteration of Windows, Windows
95, is expected to become the mainstream desktop operating
system, adoption has been slow on the corporate side. Instead,
NT may represent Microsoft's best shot at securing a seat in
enterprise networks. That's because the 32-bit NT supports
symmetric multiprocessing, pre-emptive multitasking, and multiple
hardware architectures, including Intel and several RISC chips
 the PowerPC from Apple, IBM, and Motorola; Silicon Graphics'
MIPS line; and Digital's Alpha series.

Windows NT may have been slow out of the gate, but it always
showed promise. For example, NT's initial release was stable
and contained few "showstopper" bugs capable of crashing an
entire server. That allowed NT to survive until its first upgrade,
version 3.5 (code-named Daytona), shipped in September 1994.
NT 3.5 quickly won praise from corporate testers, who cited
its enhanced connectivity to TCP/IP and NetWare networks, extended
dial-up features, and a growing catalog of application support.
Microsoft followed in mid-1995 with the release of NT 3.51,
the first version of NT to run on the PowerPC.

This year, Microsoft will upgrade NT with the Windows 95 user
interface, an enhanced E-mail inbox known as Exchange Client,
and support for TAPI, a programming interface for building
applications that are integrated with telephone systems.

In 1997, Microsoft hopes to ship the long-delayed NT upgrade
known as Cairo. That upgrade will support an object-oriented
architecture in the form of Network OLE and a new object file
system that will enable information retrieval across distributed
networks. After Cairo, there may be a 64-bit version of NT,
sources say.

Two Systems In One

Windows NT, like Unix and OS/2, can serve two operating system
functions. Its 32-bit engine and graphical interface make it
appropriate as a standalone workstation operating system. Because
it is a stable, multiprocessing, networking system, it also
performs well as a server. In fact, NT has had its best success
so far as a departmental network server. Many companies are
using Windows NT for simple file and print services, as a database
server, or as an applications server.

"NT is clearly gaining momentum," says Larry Shaw, a client
server architect at Seattle retail giant Nordstrom, which has
more than 170 NT Servers. "NT has taken off," says Bob McDowell,
VP of Microsoft's enterprise customer unit. As a result, some
companies are making the switch from older, established operating
systems to NT.

Countrywide Mortgage of Pasadena recently migrated more than
40 servers running Lotus Notes and supporting more than 3,000
users to NT. Those servers had run Notes on top of OS/2. But
Notes scales better on the Microsoft operating system, say
insiders at Countrywide.

NT offers several distinct advantages as a server, including
system and management add-ons Microsoft has developed to work
with it. Pennzoil this year plans to deploy the popular R/3
client-server software from SAP AG on NT and SQL Server, Microsoft's
enterprise database system. "Using NT and SQL Server is a great
way to avoid integration headaches," says Britt Mayo, director
of information technology at Pennzoil in Houston.

Microsoft has found success marketing NT and SQL Server together
because SQL Server leverages the familiar Windows interface
and uses setup routines that are similar to Microsoft's desktop
applications. In fact, International Data Corp., a market research
firm in Framingham, Mass., says annual sales of NT database
servers surpassed those of IBM OS/2 database servers in 1995,
and predicts that NT will surpass NetWare in that category
this year, making NT the No. 2 database server behind Unix.
"Microsoft has successfully targeted the database server market
with NT," declares Dan Kusnetzky, research manager for Unix
and advanced operating environments at IDC.

Just ask Nordstrom, which uses NT and SQL Server to route clothing
to its nationwide stores. Also, Alliant Food Service, formerly
a division of Kraft Foods, is using Microsoft's Systems Management
Server along with NT and SQL Server to distribute software
electronically across its network.

Reaching Out

NT's appeal has begun to extend beyond database servers. A handful
of enterprise applications is finally available for the operating
system, including Computer Associates' Unicenter management
platform, Lotus' Notes groupware, IBM's CICS transaction processor,
and Microsoft's own BackOffice, a suite of server applications
for NT that includes database, messaging, mainframe gateway,
and systems management software.

This year may see NT proliferate on the desktop as a powerful
alternative to Unix as a workstation operating system. More
than 40 companies, including MCI and Hewlett-Packard, each
plan to deploy NT Workstation on more than 10,000 PCs. That
proliferation will be helped by an outpouring of 32-bit productivity
applications for Windows 95, including programs from Microsoft,
Starfish Software, and Lotus, many of which have been certified
to run on NT. "NT is gaining more and more applications support,"
says Kusnetzky.

FirePower Inc. of Menlo Park, Calif., is among the first vendors
to sell NT-based PowerPCs, and more hardware support-from RISC
and Intel system vendors-is on the way. Compaq Computer, Dell,
and others this year are expected to introduce NT systems powered
by Intel's latest chip, the Pentium Pro.

NT is expected to be more widely used than Windows 95 on the
Pentium Pro, because the chip is optimized for operating systems
that are fully 32-bit. Windows 95 contains some 16-bit code
to ensure compatibility with Windows 3.x applications.

In addition to new NT hardware platforms, significant software
for NT from Microsoft also will hit the market this year. First
up is Gibraltar, Microsoft's just-released Internet server
software for NT. Gibraltar is causing a stir among NT users,
and aims to challenge Unix's popularity as a doorway to the
Internet. "I can't wait to get my hands on Gibraltar for testing,"
says NT user Matt Merrick, VP of information systems at Merrick
Printing Co. of Louisville, Ky.

Incoming Upgrade

Also coming is the long-delayed Exchange Server, Microsoft's
NT-based messaging and groupware upgrade to MS Mail Server.
Exchange Server isn't expected to match the groupware capabilities
of Lotus Notes, but it does promise to relieve the scalability
headaches companies encounter with MS Mail.

Analysts say NT's momentum should carry throughout the year,
but the competition is not sitting still.

Novell shipped the first SMP version of NetWare 4.1 in December,
and IBM this quarter is expected to release OS/2 Warp Server,
which will combine its LAN Server network operating system
with the easy-to-use Warp operating system. "Warp Server technology
is strong, and its systems management features are powerful,"
says IDC's Kusnetzky. "But its superior technology could be
considered a moot point; OS/2 is lagging in corporate mindshare
because of Microsoft's marketing expertise with NT."

One place Microsoft clearly trails IBM is in the area of enterprise
services and support. In an effort to compensate, Microsoft
late last year opened NT support centers in Europe and in Asia,
allowing the software giant to offer global 24-hour support
for multinational companies. Microsoft has more than 1,000
employees trained on NT, and has recruited AT&T Global Information
Solutions, Digital Equipment, and Hewlett-Packard to help support
NT globally. These developments indicate NT is poised to establish
itself on corporate America's department workstations and servers.

Multiprocessor Systems: PC Multiplier -- Windows NT teams with fast PC 
servers to bring symmetric multiprocessing into the corporate mainstream

By:
Brian Gillooly

How can symmetric multiprocessing, a technology that's been
around for years, be hot for 1996? Because, thanks to the proliferation
of Microsoft's Windows NT and the raw power of Intel's Pentium
Pro processor, low-cost, high-performance, reliable PC-based
multiprocessing servers will finally become a familiar component
of the corporate enterprise.

For years, technology managers shunned SMP servers because of
unreliable operating systems, high cost, and unproven promises
in performance. But according to vendors and industry market
research firms, 1996 will see an explosion of SMP server sales,
outpacing even the huge expansion of the overall server market.

Customers like USAir Group Inc.'s operations research division
seek to leverage the price-performance advantages of x86-based
SMP servers. Lloyd Blauen, Unix LAN administrator for USAir
in Arlington, Va., says the company has begun installing several
SMP-based IBM PC servers and plans to add more across the operations
research division once the SMP version of IBM's OS/2 Warp is
available early in January. "Warp SMP is pretty robust," says
Blauen, "and there are applications we're writing that definitely
require SMP power."

Like USAir, many companies kicked the SMP tires in 1995. James
McDonnell, marketing manager for Hewlett-Packard's Network
Server division, says it's significant that customers now seem
to be less skittish about SMP technology moving into the new
year. "1995 was the year for pouring the foundation, and in
1996, the studs go up," McDonnell says.

Ready To Roll

PC makers say the crucial testing stage for SMP servers is nearly
complete, and pent-up demand is about to be satisfied. "A lot
of large corporate customers have deployed servers in a pilot
environment and are now ready to blast it across the enterprise,"
says John Thompson, director of systems platform marketing
for Compaq's systems division.

That paints a bright future for this technology. Dave Ellenberger,
VP of corporate marketing for Data General Corp. in Westboro,
Mass., anticipates at least 30% growth in the low-end SMP server
market this year.

Gene Austin, VP of marketing for Compaq's systems division in
Houston, is even more bullish. He believes the overall x86
based server market will grow about 50% this year, while the
SMP segment will balloon 60% to 75%

"The Pentium Pro will drive a lot of it because you get multiprocessing
systems in the $15,000-to-$20,000 range in powerful boxes,"
says Austin. "It's cheap horsepower."

Price point aside, Austin says information technology managers
are more willing to install SMP servers because the operating
systems are "a lot stronger."

Compaq should know. Out of 600 sites that have installed SAP's
R/3 client-server financial system on Windows NT-based SMP
servers, about half are using the Houston manufacturer's hardware.

David House, general manager of Intel's enterprise computing
group in Santa Clara, Calif., agrees that today's more robust
operating systems will help speed adoption of SMP. "The operating
system, where the rubber meets the road, is much better at
handling

SMP today," he notes.

Compaq says users are responding in kind. "We're not having
to do too much convincing on NT being robust enough," says
Compaq's Thompson.

Customers are finding that the performance, security, and reliability
of the 32-bit software are adequate for running many enterprise
level applications, Thompson says. "Any SAP site is a bet-your
business site," he adds.

There will be 2.4 million SMP servers-both x86 and RISC (reduced
instruction set computing)-shipped worldwide this year, according
to International Data Corp., a market research firm in Framingham,
Mass.

But it is the low-cost, high-volume equation that Intel is pushing
with its Pentium Pro chip and motherboard strategy that will
expand the x86 SMP server market.

The high-end SMP server industry is "largely still proprietary
and still fragmented," says Steve Smith, an analyst with brokerage
PaineWebber in New York. But Intel's approach will change that.
"If you take the volume side of the equation and leverage that
for the entire industry, that's what is different now," he
says.

Also, for the first time, servers are being optimized for multiprocessing.
"The hardware and software are being designed to do a specific
function, and when you add Lotus Notes or some other workgroup
application, you get a machine designed top-to-bottom as a
whole solution," says Michael Coleman, general manager for
the IBM PC Co.'s server business. "That's what people are getting
excited about."

Fred DeBoer, network services director for Advanced Technology
Labs, a Bothell, Wash., manufacturer of diagnostic ultrasound
equipment, says his company plans to roll out an SMP version
of Novell's GroupWise messaging system, known as GroupWise
XTD, on low-cost NetFrame 8540 servers by the mid 1996.

"Businesses are realizing that SMP isn't technology we should
be into, but rather technology we better be into," says DeBoer.

NT's Role

Corporate customers also are becoming more comfortable with
running enterprise-level applications on PC-based SMP servers
as they see more successful deployments by their peers.

"Four years ago, less than 10% of x86-based servers were running
Oracle. Now it's more than 40%," says Larry Ellison, CEO of
Oracle in Redwood Shores, Calif.

The advancement of Windows NT is crucial for the expansion of
the low-cost x86-based SMP server market-and vendors say corporate
America is responding. Kevin Roberts, product manager for high
performance PC workstations at Advanced Logic Research Inc.
in Irvine, Calif., says about 15% of all machines Advanced
Logic ships are loaded with Windows NT. That figure is expected
to grow to 40% by mid-1996 and to nearly 50% near year's end.

Financial firms, comforted by the security features they find
in Windows NT, are among the early adopters of the operating
system.

Combined with what HP's McDonnell calls "the midyear kicker"
of the Windows 95 interface being built into Windows NT, SMP
servers will become more popular in general business-productivity
environments. "That helps because it adds more [support] to
the message," McDonnell says.

Compaq's Thompson says the company ended 1994 with several Windows
NT Server installations in the 50-unit range. Now, he says,
Compaq is logging orders for 1,000 or more NT Servers, about
70% of which are two-way or four-way SMP servers.

One of the clear advantages Windows NT has over Unix in an SMP
server environment is its lack of complexity. "Unix could use
a friendlier interface," says ALR's Roberts. "Unity among all
the different flavors of Unix would be a nice start."

The Pentium Factor

But just as the acceptance of new, robust software will help
expand the SMP server market, hardware factors in heavily.

HP's McDonnell refers to Intel's Pentium Pro processor as "a
pivotal product," not only because it is a high-performance
chip at a relatively low cost, but because it will help drive
x86-based SMP servers higher into the enterprise. So the foundation
for moving upscale has been set. Pentium servers such as HP's
NetServer LS and Compaq's ProLiant 4500 are solid platforms
from which corporate America can now migrate upward to two
way and four-way servers.

Data General, which for years has focused on SMP servers on
the Motorola 88000 platform, made a wholesale conversion to
Intel's Pentium and Pentium Pro to capitalize on high-volume
sales opportunities in the future. "We expect the low end of
server computing to be defined by the Intel architecture,"
says VP Ellenberger. He adds that while the Unix-versus-Windows
NT debate continues, Data General will offer its DG-UX operating
system as well as NT.

"One of the desirables in the SMP space has always been lots
of shrink-wrapped applications," says Ellenberger. "Unix has
never lived up to this, and probably never will. But as [a
shift to Intel's high-volume SMP motherboard] concept occurs,
software vendors see more volume for a port."

PC makers for years have fought the characterization of PC-based
servers as weak and unmanageable. Most have been used as no
more than file-and-print servers, where the need for multiprocessing
is minimal.

But beginning early in 1995, vendors began paying more attention
to the management side of server technology, and software like
IBM's NetFinity, Compaq's Insight Manager, and HP's NetManager
became the competitive selling point for the servers.

"This brought about a change in the use of PC servers," says
IBM PC Co.'s Coleman. IBM plans to create an end-to-end enterprise
security blanket for its server line in 1996 by integrating
NetFinity server-management software with NetView systems-management
technology. "Right now, it's not seamless, tightly integrated,
or fully functional," adds Coleman. "We'll integrate several
products in stage one into a workgroup product."

Coleman says products like IBM's SystemView, which provide fully
integrated system management, enable customers to eliminate
some of the middle layers of management software to save money
and give the system administrator greater control over the
entire corporate enterprise.

With this higher level of management and availability, customers
now have more confidence in the ability of SMP servers to handle
vital business applications. Frank DeVito, information systems
manager for Rogers and Wells, a large New York law firm, says
that with real estate at a premium and a small network administration
staff, it's now crucial to be able to consolidate servers into
larger SMP models and have iron-clad server-management tools.

"We can run more NLMs [NetWare Loadable Modules] on the same
box without it taking a toll on the horsepower of the CPU,"
says DeVito.

Rogers and Wells already has deployed several Compaq ProLiant
4500 servers in an SMP configuration running Windows NT SQL
Server, and it plans to take the rest of its half-dozen or
so ProLiants to SMP when NetWare is boosted to that level.

"We're looking forward to more multiprocessing database applications
in NetWare once we're able to scale beyond a single processor,"
says DeVito.

With the robustness and reliability of Windows NT and the cheap
horsepower supplied by the Pentium Pro, IT managers are finding
single-processor systems fast becoming an arcane and expensive
way to approach client-server computing in the corporate enterprise.
In simple terms, that means 1996 is shaping up to be a blockbuster
year for low-cost SMP servers.

High-Speed Processors: Plugging In 64-Bit Chips -- Systems based on superfast 
processors are on the horizon

By:
John Foley

If you consider yourself leading edge because you just upgraded
to 32-bit software and left the 16-bit world behind, think
again. An entirely new generation of systems, based on superfast
64-bit microprocessors, is about to hit the streets.

Power users can expect to see big advances in microprocessor
performance in 1996. Two giants in the world of RISC (reduced
instruction set computing) processors, Sun Microsystems Inc.
and Hewlett-Packard, introduced their first 64-bit chips late
in 1995-and systems based on those chips will be rolled out
this year. IBM and Motorola plan a midyear release of the PowerPC
620, a 64-bit version of their jointly developed microprocessor
line.

Two veterans of 64-bit computing, Digital Equipment and Silicon
Graphics' Mips Technologies subsidiary, also plan upgrades
that will significantly boost their already powerful devices.

"Users are very hungry for them," says John Logan, a VP with
the Aberdeen Group, a research and consulting firm in Boston.
"We can already see the advantages with Digital's Alpha." The
new chips aren't for the timid. They offer raw speed, huge
memory cache, and support for very large file systems-and cost
up to 50% more than 32-bit chips. Initially, Sun and HP will
offer their chips-the UltraSparc I and the PA-8000, respectively
only in their top-of-the-line workstations and servers.

By the year 2000, however, 64-bit chips will become the norm.
"The move to 64-bit processing is as inevitable as night following
day," says Mike Lambert, VP of technical strategy with X/Open,
the independent standards organization in Menlo Park, Calif.
Is 64-bit-ness worth the migration headaches-applications need
to be rewritten or recompiled to reap maximum benefit-and the
extra cost? If sales of Digital's 64-bit Alpha chip are any
indication, a growing number of users think so: Digital's Alpha
business grew by 77% in fiscal 1995, which ended in July.

Experts say two factors-graphics-intensive computing and the
need for heavy-duty databases-are driving 64-bit technology.
Typical examples: Pharmaceutical giant SmithKline Beecham in
Philadelphia is tapping Alpha systems to store and analyze
data in an application that involves simulating molecules.
Pratt & Whitney in East Hartford, Conn., has deployed a cluster
of Alphas for jet-engine design.

The Milwaukee Journal/Sentinel chose two Alpha-based servers
to replace two Unisys V-380 "light" mainframes. Peter Stockhausen,
the newspaper's VP of information technologies, says his company
also looked at IBM's AS/400 minicomputer and an HP midrange
system. "The HP and IBM were fairly comparable to each other,"
he says. "Digital was significantly faster in total throughput."
The Journal/Sentinel now runs its customer-service database
and billing system on the Alpha servers. Bottom-line benefits
include faster access to customer records and better customer
service.

A major advantage these new chips offer is that 64-bit computing
breaks through the 4-Gbyte memory limit of 32-bit systems.
Digital's Alpha Server 8000, for instance, supports 14 Gbytes
of memory. The larger cache makes it possible to process huge
chunks of data on a single chip.

"With 64 bits, you can have one big application running in memory,"
says Patrick Smyth, director of marketing with Digital's Unix
business segment in Maynard, Mass. "That translates into dramatically
improved performance and much shorter response times," he adds.

Record-Breaking Benchmark

The proof behind these performance claims? In December, Oracle
announced a record-breaking benchmark of 11,456 tpmC (transactions
per minute based on the C set of benchmark tests created by
the Transaction Processing Performance Council in San Jose,
Calif.) for its Oracle7 database. The benchmark was set using
an eight-processor Alpha server running Digital's 64-bit Unix
operating system.

Another technical barrier that's smashed by a 64-bit architecture
is file size. A 64-bit file system can handle much larger files
than a 32-bit system-a decided advantage as images and video
become part of a file system.

But sheer speed is the most talked-about advantage of a 64-bit
world. Chipmakers are already one-upping each other with claims
of world-leading performance. On Nov. 2, HP announced release
of the PA-8000, billed as having "the highest performance available
today," 8.6 SPECint95 (a measure of CPU Integer performance
by Standard Performance Evaluation Corp. in Manassas, Va.).
Less than two weeks later, Digital announced sampling of its
Alpha 21164, touted as "the world's fastest and highest performance
microprocessor," at 11 SPECint95.

Living In The Real World

Experts warn users not to get caught up in the benchmark brouhaha.
"We discount the meaningfulness of a spec number [because]
it doesn't reflect what a real-world application with real
world data is like," says Steve Schick, a spokesman for Mips
Technologies in Mountain View, Calif. Mips' redesigned 64-bit
chip, the R10000, will go into production in January.

"The better measure is when you get down to real applications,"
agrees Arthur Goldberg, executive VP with HAL Computer Systems,
a Campbell, Calif., subsidiary of Fujitsu. HAL just began shipping
workstations based on its own Sparc-compatible 64-bit chip,
the Sparc64.

In other words, technology managers should try before they buy.
But regardless of the processor, it's fair to expect a major
performance improvement when pumping an existing application
through a 64-bit machine. A typical example: HP says 32-bit
applications will run 70% to 100% faster on its PA-8000.

There are important differences in 64-bit platforms. Silicon
Graphics Inc., for instance, is the market leader in "floating
point" performance, important for 3-D and graphical applications
such as animation. Silicon Graphics' customers include Disney
and Ford Motor Co. With the R10000, says Schick, Silicon Graphics
is concentrating on "reducing bottlenecks that hang up a processor,"
rather than devoting all of its attention to the sheer speed
of the chip. The goal is improved database performance. "We've
been running database trace code, and so far it is proved out
that there's a huge difference in performance," says Schick.

Silicon Graphics attributes the R10000's performance improvements
to two techniques: dynamic scheduling and nonblocking caches.
The former improves processor efficiency by "reordering" instructions
to suit the execution resources of the chip. The latter keeps
the processor active rather than waiting for data it may later
need to complete an operation.

Sun is challenging Silicon Graphics with the UltraSparc I, which
it bills as "the world's first general purpose microprocessor
to deliver on-chip support for MPEG-2 decode." MPEG-2 is an
industry standard for broadcast-quality video.

Digital and HAL Systems, on the other hand, concede the high
end graphics niche to Silicon Graphics. "We don't pretend to
think we can compete with them in the entertainment business
at the high end," says Bill Glazier, Digital's director of
workstation marketing in Maynard, Mass.

Digital has its own bragging rights. It is one of the few 64
bit chip suppliers with a 64-bit operating system, Digital
Unix. Sun's Solaris and HP's HP-UX are 32-bit operating systems
that have been tuned for 64-bit chips but are unable to take
full advantage of the 64-bit architecture. In addition, Digital
sells Microsoft's 32-bit Windows NT operating system for the
Alpha.

Rich Sevcik, VP and general manager of HP's systems technology
group in Cupertino, Calif., acknowledges that 32-bit software
cannot take full advantage of 64-bit hardware. "You can increase
the clock rate [of the application], but that has nothing to
do with 64-bit-ness," he says.

No Need To Rush

HP has promised to deliver a 64-bit version of HP-UX in the
second half of 1996. Once done, applications still need to
be written or recompiled to run in 64-bit mode. "There are
very few 64-bit apps in the world," says Sevcik. "In commercial
environments, we're not going to see 64-bit applications for
three to five years."

Indeed, for most organizations, there's no need to rush into
64-bit computing, says Sevcik. Fewer than 5% of current HP
systems ship with the maximum 4 Gbytes of memory, evidence
of untapped potential on 32-bit systems. The extra power of
64-bit processors, he says, is mainly needed for high-end database
applications. "If you're doing something like decision support,
it's worth paying for the large memory," says Sevcik. "You'll
get some benefit from that."

Graphics-intensive computing is the other big strength of 64
bit chips, making them a good match for the real-time multimedia
applications soon to appear on the World Wide Web. However,
PowerPC partners IBM and Motorola, and PC chip giant Intel
agree with HP's analysis-that 32-bit chips will continue to
meet the needs of most users. In fact, the 32-bit PowerPC 604
is nearly as powerful as the 64-bit PowerPC 620.

This is a dilemma that has caused IBM and Motorola to delay
the 620's release until mid-1996. They hope to widen the performance
gap between the two processors over the next six months.

Intel and HP are partnering on a 64-bit architecture that combines
the two dominant chip technologies: RISC and CISC (complex
instruction set computing). The partners have yet to announce
a microprocessor based on the HP-Intel Architecture, but experts
expect a 64-bit chip, called the P7, in 1997 or later. Until
then, Intel will be pushing Pentium Pro, a 32-bit processor
released in November.

Long-term planners have their sights set on the new generation
of 64-bit chips and beyond. "Today's move toward 64-bit file
systems and 64-bit processing are just stages in the evolution
of information technology," says X/Open's Lambert. "It is important
to recognize this and not develop solutions for 64-bit that
are not sufficient for 128-bit and beyond."

Voice Messaging: A Smart Service -- Wildfire has unveiled an electronic 
assistant that can answer, forward, and identify calls-while still sounding
human

The hottest, hippest new must-have for the upwardly mobile professional
is the Wildfire Electronic Assistant. If you don't have one
or at least know somebody who does-that's likely to change
this year. If your job depends on your phone, Wildfire can
change your life.

The system, offered by Wildfire Communications Inc. in Lexington,
Mass., runs on a server that handles all incoming and outgoing
voice communications, no matter where you are. Users dial a
number to access their own pre-programmed Wildfire Assistant.
Then, a computerized female voice-which doesn't sound computerized
at all-uses voice recognition technology to prompt users through
the management of their incoming and outgoing voice communications.

Beyond handling voicemail, the system, at the user's voice request,
can quickly return calls to people who left a message. During
a Wildfire session, the system will even interrupt itself to
announce and connect the user to incoming calls.

Wildfire can forward calls to any phone and tell hotel operators,
"I'm looking for John Doe." Like any good assistant, it lets
users screen calls on the fly or by using a preprogrammed list.
If you don't answer a call, Wildfire can tell you who is calling
by sending a message via a pager.

The real power of Wildfire will be evident as virtual workgroups
grow more common. For example, Wildfire can let a developer,
contractor, and real estate agent communicate as if they were
using the same office voicemail system and personal assistant.
If the real estate agent and contractor called their Wildfire
Assistants at the same time, they could connect and talk to
each other from two distant pay phones.

Wildfire also can call users in a restaurant during a long lunch,
reminding them that it's time to move on to the next appointment.
"It's the beginning of the growth of machines talking to people
on behalf of people," says Paul Saffo, a Wildfire user and
director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif.

It's also addictive. Says Rick Smolan of Sausalito, Calif.,
"If I had to choose between my car and Wildfire, I would probably
give up my car." Smolan is president of Against All Odds Productions,
which just produced the book, The Passage To Vietnam. While
assembling the book, his Wildfire Assistant called him every
day in Vietnam with messages, then dialed all his outgoing
calls, saving expensive hotel phone charges. "It's like having
a little person following you around," Smolan says. "At a pay
phone, I can get things done in minutes that used to take an
hour."

That's because Wildfire helps eliminate voicemail tag. Currently,
about 75% of all calls fail to connect with the intended recipient,
and most end up in voicemail, the company says. At the same
time, Wildfire enables time-pressured professionals to politely
screen out all non-urgent phone calls.

It also helps juggle demanding clients and dual professional
lives. Take Chris Gregory: By day, he's director of sales and
client services for Video-It in Culver City, Calif., the country's
oldest post-production house. By night, he does commercial
voiceovers for products such as the Ginsu knife, Nordic Track
exercise machines, and Packard Bell computers. Missing a call
can cost Gregory $300 to $1,000. "If I don't get back to someone
in five to 10 minutes," he says, "they're dialing someone else."

A few months ago, Wildfire began licensing companies to offer
the Wildfire Electronic Assistant as a dial-in service, eliminating
the need to buy a $50,000 server. Wildfire has licensed the
service to three bureaus that offer the service for as little
as $39 a month, though heavy users are more likely to spend
$150 to $250 a month.

Licensees include Advanced Communications Inc. in Effingham,
Ill., which targets Wildfire to sales and marketing entrepreneurs;
Milcom Corp. in Wilmington, Mass., which is marketing to New
England and Northeast professionals; and Virtuosity, which
already counts N.Y.P.D. Blue co-executive producer and director
Mike Robins as a user, is targeting the capital of hip: Los
Angeles.

Purchasing a service instead of a $50,000 server is catching
on like ... well, let's just say that Wildfire co-founder Nick
d'Arbeloff believes "it's possible that the service business
could overwhelm the server business fairly quickly." One reason
may be that those people who can't drop $50,000 for a server
"may well be more in need of Wildfire than their corporate
counterparts" who have support staff, he says.

Quick Response

Wildfire seems to work well for CambridgeCAD Technologies Inc.,
a four-person Apple and IBM reseller that is on call constantly
to provide customer support. "It's critical that we respond
to our customers quickly, and this is much better than pagers
or portable phones," says Dan Tully, executive VP of the Cambridge,
Mass., company.

"It frees us so that we don't have to have somebody in the office
constantly." At about $8 a day, it's also cheaper than a receptionist.
But Tully says the potential loss of revenue from missed calls
far outweighs the subscription cost. "There's really nothing
to compare it to," he says.

Wildfire already has generated a lot of interest. In the past
year, more than 60,000 callers have heard a demonstration of
the service by calling the company's "800-Wildfire" demo line.
The company expects to have service bureaus in the 10 largest
metropolitan areas by the second quarter of 1996, with national
coverage and several thousand users by year's end. Cellular
providers AT&T and Pacific Bell will integrate the technology
into their service in 1997, and Wildfire is in discussions
with other carriers.

What's next? How about networking Wildfire servers together
and letting multiple Wildfire Assistants schedule and set up
conference calls? In the future, Wildfire will handle all communications,
including E-mail and faxes. Someday, you may even be able to
program your assistant by dialing in through the World Wide
Web.

Further down the line, Wildfire may provide assistance at home
monitoring the baby's room, turning off the oven, or telling
the temperature outside. Or you may use Wildfire in your car.
But Wildfire isn't for everything- when it comes to voice recognition
for television remote controls, d'Arbeloff believes the thumb
is faster. But in other cases, once someone's gotten used to
Wildfire, it's hard to let go. Says Saffo, "It already seems
like a foreign idea for me to take a phone call without first
knowing who's on the other end."

Paging Systems: New Wireless -- As paging technologies evolve, companies gain
low-cost ways to deliver information to mobile workers

By:
Jill Gambon

Skytel Corp. was ahead of its rivals when it rolled out the
first two-way paging service last September. But the company
can expect plenty of competition this year as several companies
introduce their own two-way paging and voice messaging services
on the much-hyped narrowband Personal Communications Services
(PCS) networks, thus bringing anytime, anywhere communication
a step closer to reality.

As those PCS networks come on line, paging products, long derided
as low-tech gadgets, are starting to gain respect and win over
corporate users. PCS networks operate at higher radio frequencies
than cellular and use twice as much radio spectrum as one-way
paging. They offer two-way messaging, voice, and even full
data transfer services. As the technology evolves, companies
envision pagers becoming a low-cost alternative for delivering
key business information to mobile workers.

The information systems department at Global Marine Inc., an
offshore drilling contractor in Houston, has been using SkyTel
2-Way for several months to keep LAN technicians in contact
with the help desk. SkyTel's service lets technicians answer
messages with preprogrammed replies like "stuck in traffic"
or "I'll call in 15 minutes." They can also send an up-to-500
character E-mail message by connecting the device to a Hewlett
Packard palmtop computer.

Constant Contact

Global Marine technicians, who roam among three buildings, no
longer have to find a phone to answer a page. "What I like
is the response capability," says Gary Garrison, the company's
telecommunications manager. "If you're in a meeting, you can
deal with a problem without having to get up and use the phone."

It is precisely this ability to stay in constant contact and
easily exchange information that SkyTel and its rivals hope
will drive demand for their services. SkyTel and others have
invested heavily in building PCS networks. SkyTel got a head
start when it won a Pioneer Preference award from the FCC in
1991 to develop the first two-way messaging service. Since
then, 10 companies-including SkyTel-have paid more than $617
million for the nationwide narrowband PCS licenses the FCC
auctioned in July 1994.

The rollout of two-way paging and voice messaging comes at a
time when paging's popularity is at an all-time high. Some
34 million Americans carry pagers, up from 27.3 million last
year, according to Dorothy Salmon, a paging analyst with MTA
EMCI, a telecommunications consulting firm in Washington. Salmon
expects demand to grow by 25% to 30% a year during the next
few years.

Some companies already use one-way paging networks to deliver
limited amounts of information. The New England Medical Center
in Boston uses software from Data Critical Corp. of Redmond,
Wash., to transmit EKG files to doctors over one-way paging
networks.

The advent of two-way messaging should increase the capacity
for sending and requesting information, permitting bigger,
more complex files to be exchanged, says Craig Kairis, VP of
business development for Data Critical. "There's more bandwidth,
so we will be able to do more faster," he says. Particularly
promising is the potential for PCS networks to access and query
the corporate database, Kairis adds.

Trials In The Offing

With the network infrastructure nearly built, many carriers
are getting ready to roll out trials. Sometime in the first
quarter, Paging Network Inc. (PageNet) in Plano, Texas, will
begin testing its voice-messaging service in San Francisco,
Dallas, and New York over its PCS network. Dubbed VoiceNow,
the service promises to transform a pager into a pocket-sized
answering machine for about $20 a month. PageNet subscribers
will listen to digital voice messages by holding a pager to
their ear. By mid-year, PageNet plans to launch trials of a
two-way data messaging service in Atlanta. Like SkyTel, PageNet's
service will let subscribers send pre-programmed messages or
reply to a page by selecting from a menu of responses. By 1997,
the company expects to offer more robust data transfer, like
sending spreadsheets over its PCS network.

PageMart in Dallas also plans to launch trials of its voice
messaging and two-way paging service this year. The company
expects subscribers will eventually use the data service to
conduct transactions such as airline and hotel reservations
or to order theater tickets. PageMart is aggressively courting
software makers to integrate wireless messaging with enterprise
applications such as E-mail.

"The [PCS] spectrum is considered a wide-open frontier. The
software will give it its personality," a PageMart spokeswoman
says. To prime the pump, the company released a software developer's
kit last June. PageMart is working with the software companies
to target vertical markets like field service and field sales.

AirTouch Communications of Dallas also is developing a two-way
messaging service that is expected to debut this year. Another
supplier, PCS Development Corp. of Greenville, S.C., is expected
to begin trials of a voice messaging service over its two-way
network in Atlanta in the first quarter and in Boston in the
second quarter. The company expects to have nationwide voice
messaging and two-way data messaging by 1997.

The investment community is also getting involved. In November,
PCS Development announced it raised $55.5 million in a private
equity offering, the largest venture-backed private equity
financing in 1995, according to Securities Data Corp., a Newark,
N.J. research firm.

For its part, SkyTel is improving its pager's design and better
integrating its network with enterprise applications such as
database querying. The company is readying beta versions of
its software developers kit and is upgrading the pager with
pen input capabilities to make it easier to generate messages,
says Doug Brackbill, SkyTel's senior VP of advanced applications.

Some envision the day when pagers equipped with infrared ports
will enable wireless file transfer between pager and PC. Updated
spreadsheets or word processing documents sent to a pager could
be transferred via infrared to a laptop or PC for viewing or
printing. Notebook makers are expected to build two-way paging
capabilities into their machines, eliminating the need to connect
the pager to the notebook to transfer files. "It's so obvious
that two-way paging should be built into notebooks," says Ira
Brodsky, president of Datacomm Research in Wilmette, Ill. "A
lot of the voicemail phone tag and hunting for phones would
be avoided."

Motorola, developer of the Reflex two-way paging protocol, has
licensed its technology to Texas Instrument's semiconductor
division, so notebooks with two-way paging capabilities could
be on the market by year's end, says Larry Conlee, corporate
VP and director of worldwide markets for Motorola's advanced
messaging systems division. Brodsky also expects paging capabilities
will soon be better integrated into personal digital assistants,
creating a market for information services like traffic updates
and travel and entertainment reports to be delivered over PCS
networks.

One looming issue, however, is dueling standards. While many
paging companies are basing their systems on Reflex, AT&T has
developed a TCP/IP standard, known as Pact (Personal Air Communications
Technology). "The fact that AT&T would invest energy and time
to come up with their own standards underscores how important
this market is," says Motorola's Conlee.

Interactive System: Media Circus -- More apps, low prices draw business to 
multimedia tent 

By:
Mary Hayes

For consumers, the definition of multi-media is easy: cool PC
games, CD-ROM videos, and CD-quality music played on a PC or
Macintosh. But business and technology managers are still struggling
to define multimedia and what multimedia technologies mean
to their enterprises. To many technology managers, "multimedia"
is a code word for flashy, yet unnecessary, devices and applications
that are too pricey to be truly useful.

Business attitudes about multimedia should begin to change in
1996. Advances in technology and lower costs will help business
PCs evolve from tools that create and manipulate static, text
based information to integrated communications systems that
incorporate sound and movement while encouraging user interaction.
More businesses will begin to use desktop videoconferencing,
computer-based training, interactive catalogs, and other multimedia
applications.

"It's important for the information technology community to
think outside the box," advises Philip Dodds, president of
the Interactive Multimedia Association, a trade group in Annapolis,
Md. "Multimedia applications will develop from areas we're
not even thinking about-things we haven't used a computer for
before." That's why, in Dodds' view, businesses need to become
more creative in encouraging the daily use of PCs.

Several factors will help drive multimedia into mainstream corporate
America. The vendor community is working hard to improve such
still-immature technologies as video compression. More software
and hardware companies are banding together and promoting open
multimedia standards. Systems manufacturers are building more
systems pre-loaded with multimedia hardware, obviating the
need to spend corporate dollars for add-on software.

But perhaps the biggest force in multimedia in business is the
declining price of systems that have sufficient computing power
to run multimedia applications. Pentium-based PCs were selling
early in 1995 at an average of $2,200; by early 1996 they will
be priced at least $500 lower. That's important, because while
most businesses use a version of Microsoft Windows on the desktop,
most multimedia Windows applications don't work well on PCs
that run on microprocessor platforms less powerful than Pentiums.

Price wars broke out among makers of Pentium-based systems in
the last quarter of 1995 and are expected to continue into
1996. Intel, which produces the Pentium chip, says it will
cut prices again on Feb. 1, which should continue to fuel system
price drops.

Also, computer manufacturers now build systems with multimedia
in mind. For example, in October IBM unveiled its PC Series
Model 330 containing a 75-MHz Pentium microprocessor with 8
Mbytes of RAM and a 540-Mbyte hard drive for $1,660-just a
few hundred dollars more than a powerful 486 PC system. That
Pentium PC ships with 2 Mbytes of video RAM and a CD-ROM drive.

Hugh Hendrick, IS manager for the City of San Mateo, Calif.,notes
that even budget-crunched municipalities are now buying Pentiums.
"Most new systems we're buying are Pentiums," says Hendrick.
"They're so cheap." But how many of these Pentium PCs include
multimedia? That depends on the cost of add-on hardware, says
Hendrick. "As these features become more common and you see
more bundles, people will get more motivated," he adds.

Growing Trend

Several manufacturers already have announced multimedia bundling
a trend that should grow in 1996. Tatung Co. of America Inc.
in Long Beach, Calif., recently rolled out the Uniq 5510, a
100-MHz Pentium PC with Super Graphics Video Array (SVGA),
a Creative Labs sound card, a CD-ROM drive, 16 Mbytes of RAM,
2 Mbytes of video RAM, a 540-Mbyte hard drive, and a software
utility that sets resolution and color depth. Total price:
$2,688.

In December, Sigma Designs Inc. in Fremont, Calif., announced
a deal with Zenon Technology Inc. to pre-install Sigma MPEG
accelerator cards in Zenon's Pentium systems. Because it includes
standard Motion Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) video-compression
technology, Zenon's $2,000, 75-MHz Pentium Interactive MPEG
system (which comes with 16 Mbytes of RAM, a 1-Gbyte hard drive,
and quad-speed CD-ROM drive) can process TV-quality video and
CD-quality sound without add-on cards.

Some vendors are bundling multimedia hardware and software.
Compaq says it will ship PCs with ProShare, Intel's desktop
video- and teleconferencing software, by late 1997. The two
companies say they need nearly two years to figure out how
best to bundle conferencing and keep systems costs low.

Several manufacturers are jointly developing open standards
for multimedia technology. One of the most important is the
adoption of the MPEG video-compression standard, which is being
pushed by the MPEG consortium, a group sanctioned by the International
Standards Organization in Paris. MPEG helps networked systems
move large video images more easily and eliminates the jerky,
unpolished look of video that runs on PCs. The more vendors
that adopt MPEG technology, the lower the cost and the more
compatible various systems will become.

Microsoft's Windows 95 desktop operating system is expected
to gain MPEG support this year. But industry observers note
one major problem with MPEG software: It requires that the
microprocessor do most of the work, making the technology suitable
only for high-end Pentium machines. Thus, the adoption of MPEG
software rests on the affordability of those systems.

But MPEG's real growth will come from corporate acceptance of
videoconferencing."These systems are almost as common as a
copy machine for global companies," notes Dusty Sykes, a consultant
at Vanguard Communications in Morris Plains, N.J.

Eric Goldreich, IS manager at law firm Sheppard, Mullen, Richter
& Hampton in Los Angeles, plans to purchase a Concord videoconferencing
system from PictureTel Corp. in Danvers, Mass., early in 1996.
Notes Goldreich, "If I have just 10 lawyers who don't have
to fly from San Francisco to L.A. for a meeting every month,
the system pays for itself." The cost of operating Concord
about $2,800 a month-is "less than it was a few years ago,"
says Goldreich.

In 1996, businesses can expect more portable conferencing systems
at more affordable prices. Analysts predict systems makers
will start to market PC notebooks with color LCD screens, high
quality sound, and CD-ROM drives in the $2,000 price range.
Improved video on portable systems may affect how some sales
and marketing professionals work. Soon, business will experiment
with video presentations or videoconferences on the road.

After all, as more workers install multimedia Pentium or PowerPC
machines at home, the more they'll come to expect the power
and glitz of multimedia at work.

Visual Tools: Constructing Better Visuals -- Low-end visual development tools
will use new operating systems to offer high-end features

By:
Sean Gallagher

Once upon a time, visual development tools could be categorized
easily. At the low end were tools like Microsoft's Visual Basic
and Powersoft Corp.'s PowerBuilder. Developers could use these
products to quickly build desktop applications or front ends
for databases, but such products lacked management tools and
facilities for large team development. At the high end, tools
such as Forte from Forte Software Inc. and Dynasty from Dynasty
Technologies Inc., could build three-tier applications and
had the enterprise architecture that the low-end tools lacked,
but carried a hefty price tag.

But 1996 will see those class distinctions fade away as the
low-end tools of yesterday gain many of the features of enterprise
class development tools. New releases of PowerBuilder, Visual
Basic, Borland International Inc.'s Delphi, and Gupta Corp.'s
Centura-a 32-bit successor to SQLWindows-will ship this year,
putting new power into the hands of Windows developers for
a fraction of the price of their heavyweight cousins.

Two major new technologies will push these tools into the world
of full-scale enterprise development: standard object models
for both the desktop and distributed environments, and structured
methodologies for building large-scale applications. At the
same time, built-in compilers will make the performance of
these tools closer to that of third-generation languages (3GLs)
like C++

Visual tools are coming of age partly because operating systems
are finally up to the task. Visual Basic 4.0 and the upcoming
32-bit releases of Delphi version 2.0, PowerBuilder 5.0, and
Centura will run as native applications on Microsoft's Windows
95 and Windows NT operating systems. Besides being more stable
than Windows 3.1, these operating systems offer an object model
for applications to interact with-Microsoft's OLE 2.0 object
technology.

OLE controls (OCXs) are now the standard components for assembling
Visual Basic applications. Since all the development tools
being written to the Windows 95 standard will be able to use
OCXs, the OCX market is likely to explode this year, giving
applications everything from database access controls to built
in Internet functionality.

The OLE object model also turns OLE 2.0-compliant software-including
applications written in Visual Basic 4.0 and the upcoming visual
tools-into components that can be embedded in or linked to
other OLE 2.0 applications. This level of application integration
comes at a price: Many developers consider OLE too big and
too slow. But it opens a number of possibilities to users of
visual tools, including a means to partition client-server
applications.

Distributed OLE

The first visual tool to take full advantage of OLE 2.0 was
Microsoft's Visual Basic 4.0, introduced in September. The
centerpiece of Visual Basic 4.0 is its remote automation object
technology, based on Microsoft's distributed extension of the
OLE object model. This technology will be released separately
in 1996 as Network OLE.

The distributed extension to the OLE standard supports communications
between applications and objects across a network as though
they were running on the same machine. OLE automation objects
thus become server applications, pushing visual tools into
the realm of multitier client-server development.

Three-tier client-server applications are partitioned into client
and multiple server components to ease management headaches
and to increase performance. Most of the business logic computing
is handled by a shared object running on an application server,
while the client is reduced to handling little more than how
the data is entered and displayed.

Network OLE will make communications between application server
objects and client front ends part of the same interprocess
communications structure that handles communications between
Windows applications on the same computer. Network OLE will
use an established technology to do this: remote procedure
calls (RPCs)

Gupta's SQLWindows and other visual development tools have had
the capability to pass RPCs for some time, but they often require
coding in C or C++ to fully exploit RPCs. Network OLE wraps
RPCs in an easily digestible form, removing much of the pain
of developing with it.

So far, only Visual Basic leverages this technology directly.
But other visual tools can use Visual Basic as network plumbing
by acting as remote automation objects for Visual Basic applications.
Once Microsoft makes distributed OLE part of its operating
system, any OLE-supporting tool will be able to hook into Network
OLE.

Microsoft also is teaming with Software AG to port OLE integration
to Unix, VMS, and MVS systems. But some vital elements are
missing from Microsoft's object model-for one, it lacks a tool,
such as an object broker or an object repository, to manage
the networked objects.

Visual Basic also lacks a built-in methodology for designing
code, and despite its new version-control capabilities, it
still strikes high-end developers as too undisciplined in its
framework for large-scale development. Also, because Visual
Basic uses a run-time interpreter rather than compiled binary
code to run its applications, it suffers a performance hit
that is worsened by OLE 2.0's sluggishness.

The next release of Visual Basic will address some of these
issues by adding a compiler. In addition, Microsoft will initiate
a partner program for third-party developers of management,
computer-aided software engineering (CASE), and distributed
tools.

Delphi was touted by Borland during its initial development
as a Visual Basic killer. While it hasn't swept Visual Basic
from the field, Delphi has won over many Microsoft customers
and established a niche for building fast, tight, desktop database
centric applications.

What made Delphi hot in 1995 will make it hotter in 1996. It
manages to balance the flexibility and power of an object-oriented
programming language with the speed of a rapid applications
development tool, and it has strong database integration features.

But Delphi has also grown into something more. The next release
of Delphi-version 2.0-will take further advantage of its Object
Pascal language's 3GL roots in the 32-bit realm and leapfrog
many of the enterprise features of Visual Basic. There will
be three versions of the tool: Delphi Desktop for individual
developers, Delphi Developer for professional LAN-based developers,
and Delphi Client/Server Suite for client-server developers.

The developer and client-server versions will include both development
management tools often associated with the high end of the
applications development market: an object repository for sharing
reusable forms and other objects, a data dictionary for standardized
data types, direct support for Intersolv's PVCS version-control
software, and a source-code library of visual controls.

Another new feature incorporated into the two high-end versions
of Delphi will be the Open Tools API, an applications programming
interface that's designed for integrating Delphi with CASE
tools, version-control systems, and third-party experts (as
Borland calls its automated helpers). The client-server edition
also will include tools specific to the world of two-tier development.
One of these is SQL Explorer, which allows developers to browse
and edit the configuration of domains, triggers, and stored
procedures on any supported database server.

But when it comes to three-tier computing, Borland has decided
to let others manage the details. The Scotts Valley, Calif.,
company has not implemented its own application partitioning
architecture; instead, it will exploit Microsoft's Network
OLE for three-tier client-server applications.

Three Platforms

Powersoft's PowerBuilder 5.0, which will ship before the summer,
adds both application partitioning and the capability to compile
code. PowerBuilder also brings with it the best inherent cross
platform capabilities-it's the only visual tool of the four
that can deploy applications on Unix and the Macintosh, as
well as on Windows.

At the same time, PowerBuilder's limitations fall somewhere
between Visual Basic's and Delphi's-it is neither as flexible
as Delphi nor as easy to use as Visual Basic. This will change
with its upcoming support of Microsoft's OLE 2.0 and OCX standards
and its growing library of objects.

Powersoft, rather than rely on Microsoft to provide the plumbing
for three-tier applications, is building its own multiplatform
model for distributed objects. Within PowerBuilder 5.0, developers
will be able to deploy PowerBuilder objects on Windows NT,
Unix, or Macintosh and use Powersoft's own object request broker
to establish communications between applications and distributed
objects. Powersoft's Practical Application Partitioning strategy,
which revolves around its object request broker, will let PowerBuilder
developers move objects to application servers, compile them
as executable programs on the server platform, and manage connections
between applications and objects through a transport object
running on a designated server. While this method of object
brokering is proprietary, the Concord, Mass., company has designed
its architecture to plug into a standard Common Object Request
Broker Architecture (Corba) system in the future.

PowerBuilder 5.0 will compile to native binary code by first
generating C code, then passing that code behind the scenes
to the Watcom 32-bit C compiler. While this will give PowerBuilder
applications better performance, developers won't be able to
access or modify the generated C code to tune or debug it.
Gupta isn't moving its SQLWindows platform to the 32-bit environment.
Instead, the Menlo Park, Calif., company is rewriting its 16
bit product, creating a completely new underlying architecture.
Gupta is hedging its bets in some ways. The company will continue
to offer its 16-bit SQLWindows 5.0 product for two-tier client
server development and will incorporate many Centura features.

Centura will be positioned as a higher-end product than SQLWindows,
with Gupta's sights set on competing in the same arena as Forte
and Dynasty. In December, Gupta announced a partnership with
Open Environment Corp. of Boston to produce a three-tier technology
for its SQLWindows and Centura products. The three-tier product,
called QuickRPC, will let Gupta applications use Open Environment's
three-tier and Distributed Computing Environment application
architectures. Gupta also will provide connections between
its development tools and transaction processing monitors such
as Novell's Tuxedo. To automate the partitioning of Centura
applications, Gupta will provide a three-tier wizard, similar
to the wizards in Microsoft's desktop applications.

Centura will include an open object repository and data modeling
and source code management capabilities. Gupta is teaming with
Rational Software Corp. to incorporate Rational's Rose CASE
tool into the 32-bit product, and is building on the team development
technologies of Gupta's TeamWindows product.

The Centura language, like SQLWindows, will be fully object
oriented. Gupta will expand its current partial compilation
to compile all object code into dynamically linked libraries,
and users will be able to build fully compiled OCXs-none of
the other tools currently does this.

As these once low-end tools push into three-tier computing,
they may make good on some long unfulfilled promises from structured
tools-and at a lower price.

Programming Languages: Java Makes The Web Perform -- Sun's fledgling 
programming language for the Internet is drawing a crowd of client-server
software developers

By:
Jason Levitt

Imagine if the cost of maintaining client software on your corporate
desktops were reduced to a fraction of its current level. What
if your networked applications automatically came in versions
for Windows, Macintosh, and X Window? Perhaps you'd like to
run your client application no matter where you were or what
machine you happened to be using.

This could be the near future of client-server software on the
Internet if Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java programming language
achieves its potential. Not bad for a product that was originally
developed as an embedded language for consumer appliances and
was virtually unknown a year ago. But with an Internet-crazy
industry hungry for adding portability, two-way interactivity,
and flexible content to the rather static pages of the World
Wide Web, Java is the right technology at the right time.

Java (it's not an acronym; the name was chosen to convey a sense
of liveliness and interactivity) owes much of its notoriety
to Netscape Communications Corp., whose decision to license
the Java run-time interpreter for inclusion in Navigator 2.0,
the most widely used Web browser, created enthusiasm among
developers. Although there are no shipping commercial applications
based on Java, or even a release version of the software development
kit for creating such applications, companies such as Applix,
Eastman Kodak, Mitsubishi, Toshiba, and Starfish (headed by
ex-Borland International chairman Philippe Kahn) are all aggressively
pursuing Java software development and integration with their
existing products. Additionally, such companies as Borland,
IBM, Macromedia, Metrowerks, Microsoft, Netscape, Oracle, Silicon
Graphics, and Spyglass have licensed source code for the Java
run-time interpreter so they can create clients capable of
executing Java applets, applications written in a subset of
the Java language designed for use in Web pages. Individuals
and small developers are also making their presence known by
posting their Java applets on Sun's main Java Internet site
(http://java.sun.com)

Portability and security-both at the top of the information
systems manager's most wanted list-were important considerations
in Java's development.

Java applets are highly portable, reducing both maintenance
and time-to-market for multiplatform applications. Developers
need to write the application only once. A single compiled
applet will run identically on any platform that has a Java
enabled browser.

Java applet portability is accomplished through the Java run
time execution environment and the class libraries used for
applet programming, which isolate the applets from architecture
specific knowledge of the execution platform. For example,
applets don't know if the screen they're writing to is managed
by Windows or MacOS; they simply write to a display object
that has generic screen attributes. Although generic objects
limit the developer's ability to access platform-specific features
(such as advanced screen drawing on the Macintosh), using generic
objects increases portability. To support a new platform, only
the Java run-time execution environment needs to be ported
to the new platform.

Java is an interpreted language. But unlike most interpreted
languages, which are executed directly from source code, Java
applets are compiled into an architecture-neutral bytecode
format, which is smaller and more efficient to interpret than
source code. Once compiled, the applets sit on the Web server
waiting for a Java-enabled browser to download them. When the
applets are downloaded to the browser, the run-time interpreter
inside the browser executes the applet code.

To quell the security concerns of users, Sun has placed limits
and controls on the resources available to applets. For example,
an applet is permitted to establish network connections only
with its originating host, and it cannot create new processes.
Local file system access is very limited, but there is no agreement
among browser vendors on how to restrict file system access.
Sun's HotJava browser uses Access Control Lists to limit file
system access, while Netscape's Navigator 2.0, which is still
in beta, allows no access at all. Kim Polese, marketing manager
for Java, concedes that Sun has not reached an agreement with
Netscape on security implementation details. "We're working
with Netscape [and the other Java licensees] to have more browser
consistency with the security options that are available,"
Polese says.

Java-enabled browsers assume that any applet is untrusted, and
so they first pass the applet through the Java Bytecode Verifier
to ensure that it doesn't violate any security rules. They
then run the the Java Class Loader to verify that the applet
doesn't try to spoof an existing class or otherwise try to
extend the applet in a bogus manner.

Unfortunately, simply specifying these two security mechanisms
isn't satisfying potential Java users. Companies need assurances
that all Java-enabled browsers will faithfully adhere to the
security measures. So to further placate Java security worriers,
Sun has instituted a Java-compatible logo, which is enforced
contractually with the licensees of the Java run-time interpreter.
Products from licensees must pass a test suite to ensure that
all applets will run with everyone's interpreters, and interpreters
will faithfully enforce security precautions.

What's Brewing

While it appears that many developers are taking a wait-and
see attitude toward Java, some, such as Applix in Westboro,
Mass., are jumping in quickly. Applix, known for its ApplixWare
office productivity tools for Unix and Windows NT-including
integrated spreadsheet, E-mail, graphics, and real-time data
collection tools-claims to have developed the first Java-based
client-server spreadsheet.

Applix took the spreadsheet component of ApplixWare, which is
not a client-server application, and rewrote the user interface
portion in Java, using Java's network communications abilities
so that a client could communicate with the spreadsheet, which
would be maintained and updated on a server. The calculation
and data-access engines were left on the server to keep the
client side simple. The Java-based spreadsheet looks very much
like the ApplixWare spreadsheet, but the Java version can run
on any platform that has a Java-enabled browser.

An additional benefit of this Java-based ApplixWare component
is simplified network updates of the application. Since Java
applets are downloaded from the server before executing on
the client, updates can be made by simply updating the components
on the server. No intervention on the client side is necessary;
when the client executes the applet, the current version is
automatically downloaded from the server.

"We have a range of customers who are interested in this network
centric computing model where there is very little client-side
maintenance," says Mark Yohai, director of Internet applications
for Applix. Yohai expects to offer a demo version of Applix's
spreadsheet applet soon from its Web site (http://www.applix.com
) though he was unable to say when the product will be released.

Starfish is making a Java applet out of the group-scheduling
component of its popular Sidekick networked contacts manager.
The result will be that wide area, multiplatform, group scheduling
is easily accomplished via the Internet. Then, even people
without Sidekick can participate in group scheduling by downloading
the applet and executing it in their Java-enabled Web browser.

"The big problem with workgroup products in the past," says
Starfish CEO Kahn, "is that you had to have the client program
to participate, but the problem is that participants don't
always have the client program."

Though both Starfish and Applix have offered convincing demos,
users have yet to see any serious applications hit the market,
despite the excitement over Java technology. Part of the problem
is that most Java development tools are still crude. Some significant
development tools have been announced, however.

Symantec is offering Java support in Expresso, an add-on tool
to its C++ development environment. Borland says it will deliver
Latte technology, a visual programming environment for Java,
in several stages, with the first commercial release scheduled
to ship by June.

Also, Natural Intelligence Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. expects
to ship its Applet Development Kit for the Macintosh, code
named Roaster, in January. Roaster will include a Java compiler
and an applet testing environment. Sun also expects its Java
software development kit for Windows 95 and NT and Solaris
to ship in January, with Sun's Macintosh development kit going
into beta about the same time.

Too Attractive To Ignore

With applications still to be delivered and nagging concerns
about security, Java has yet to prove itself. Nevertheless,
the speed at which the technology is being adopted, coupled
with the promise of greatly reduced costs, are proving too
attractive to ignore.

Java has no real competitors at the moment. But when Microsoft's
Internet publishing system becomes generally available in the
first quarter of 1996, it will offer an alternate-though not
necessarily an incompatible-development choice. Microsoft has
announced it will add Java run-time support to its Internet
Explorer browser, though there is no indication that Microsoft
will add Java support to its Internet Studio design tool.

Microsoft's strategy may have a number of advantages initially,
mainly the ability to share downloaded OLE Controls (OCXs)
with OLE-enabled applications on PCs. But unlike Java applets,
OCXs are platform-specific, which puts a greater burden on
the developer to provide versions of OCXs for each client platform.

Sun has already published on its Web site pertinent APIs and
specifications for both the Java language and the run-time
execution environment. According to Sun's Polese, these specs
allow developers to write Java interpreters or language implementations,
therefore calming fears that Sun will be the sole source of
Java technology.

New tools, such as the Expresso Grinder compiler (http://wwwipd.ira.uka.de
~espresso), developed by Martin Odersky, a professor at the
University of Karlsruhe, Germany, that claims to translate
Java programs into Java bytecode format much faster than the
compiler supplied by Sun, are proof that at least some of the
specs are usable.

Hot Skills In '96 -- Internet, client-server, and networking
experts top lists of the most wanted



The hot talent in information systems in 1996 will be people
who know the Internet, client-server computing, or networking,
hiring executives say. Nudged out of the spotlight but still
much in demand will be SAP R/3 and Lotus Notes experts.

The fortunate ones with the coveted skills may not only find
it easier to land a job but could also wangle a higher salary.
Plus, IS people with strong business ability could be in demand
for new hybrid posts.

It's no surprise that the hottest area in computers-the Internet
is creating demand for Internet skills. The supply isn't expected
to match the demand.

"IS organizations are looking for people experienced in working
with the Internet, particularly regarding security issues and
building firewalls," says Vic Janulaitis, CEO of Positive Support
Review, an IS consulting firm in Santa Monica, Calif. Other
Internet skills in demand include familiarity with tools for
creating splashy Internet products.

In the client-server arena, expertise in C++ programming still
will be in heavy demand. But so will dexterity with other development
languages and object programming tools.

Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc. in Dallas, which is migrating from mainframe
to client-server computing, is seeking expertise in Visual
Basic, Forte, and Oracle software, says Trey Bradley, chief
information officer. He hopes to upgrade the skills of the
existing staff, but will look outside for hard-to-find people
like Forte developers.

Meanwhile, Greg Scileppi, executive director of RHI Consulting,
the Menlo Park, Calif., technical services arm of job-placement
firm Robert Half International, says he is getting heavy requests
for workers with client-server skills such as expertise in
front-end graphical user interfaces, relational databases,
and help-desk support.

Other IS organizations are looking for expertise in older software
on new platforms-for example, IBM DB2 database software on
Windows NT.

State Street Bank of Boston is searching for "networking expertise
that runs the gamut, including peer-to-peer networking," says
CIO David Sexton.

Job experts say it isn't unusual for a programmer who would
otherwise be paid $50,000 to $60,000 a year to see an extra
$10,000 to $20,000 tacked on for rare skills.

Pat Roberts, president of Professional Training Services Inc.
in King of Prussia, Pa., says some of her large corporate clients
are creating roles for people with "exceptional business, operational,
and technical understanding."

Some companies are appointing liaisons between business units
and the IS organization. Roberts says these posts are often
filled by someone with "good people and business skills" from
the IS organization, or someone with solid technical skills
from the business unit.

In Short: Sporting A Promotion



Herman's sporting goods Inc. in Carteret, N.J., promoted its
top information systems executive, Michael O'Neal, to executive
VP and chief operating officer. O'Neal, who joined Herman's
in 1990, had been VP of logistics and information services.
Taking over O'Neal's IS duties is Michael Worral, senior VP
of strategic planning and business reengineering.

In Short: On A Health Kick



Two health-care companies have named chief information officers.
NovaCare Inc., a King of Prussia, Pa., provider of rehabilitation
and nursing services, appointed Steven Wise VP of information
systems and CIO, succeeding Paul Ross, who the company says
is leaving to pursue other interests. Wise joined NovaCare
in 1993 as director of systems and programming. Meanwhile,
Genesis Health Ventures Inc. in Kennett Square, Pa., named
Marc Rubinger to be the geriatric health-care provider's first
CIO. He had been VP of decision support at Genesis' Shared
Medical Systems unit.

In Short: A First For Witco



Chemical Maker Witco Corp. in Greenwich, Conn., made Ronald
Edelstein its first chief information officer. Edelstein, who
joined the petroleum products manufacturer in 1991, had been
Witco's general manager of information systems. Witco says
it decided to create the CIO post because "the use of data"
is the manufacturer's "most important variable."

The Secret CIO: What's Hot Versus What's Not -- 1996 promises hype, chic 
trends, and maybe even some really useful tools

By:
Herbert W. Lovelace

Even if you are not paying attention to the calendar, it is
still easy to notice when the end of a year is reached. Forget
the traditional indicators: holiday parties and general ledger
system problems. The new year is signaled by magazines' guesses
about what the next 12 months will bring. Reading these predictions
takes your mind off of worrying whether you held down December
spending enough to avoid blowing the annual systems budget.

It would be fascinating if the magazines also wrote about how
accurate their past projections have been. For instance, whatever
happened to CASE and expert systems? And how many times can
you read about the coming of asynchronous transfer mode? You
get the idea.

Another approach would be to compare Chic Hot with Actual Hot.
Chic Hot is what we talk about when we go to meetings with
other chief information officers. Actual Hot is what we're
really doing. In 1995, reengineering and data warehousing were
Chic Hot. If we changed a system to combine two reports we
called it reengineering, and any use of existing information
was called data warehousing.

In 1996, reengineering and data warehousing should continue
as strong contenders in the Chic Hot category. Joining them
will be objects and the ever-popular Windows 95-which will
probably win the Lovelace Verbiage Ratio Award. The LVRA goes
to that product with the highest ratio of printed word to corporate
use. With the exception of Dow Chemical rolling out Win95 and
Ford doing what they call a test (on more machines than most
of us possess), the consensus of my friends has been that it's
not ready for prime time, but will still garner as much media
fervor as the O.J. Simpson trial.

Actual Hot is more difficult to predict, but it is clear that
SAP's R/3 software will continue to gain momentum. If you haven't
yet considered it, take a look; your boss will expect you to
be able to explain why it is, or is not, good for your company.
Lack of familiarity with R/3 could be a career-limiting move.

Crawling Fruit

The Internet hype will start to bear fruit as businesspeople
look for ways to move knowledge of their products onto the
Net and gain an edge on their competition. The entire class
of tools that addresses Internet security will be big. Bad
things can happen to good people without proper firewalls and
carefully considered security plans. Java, one true application
of object technology, should be really hot. Java, if you have
not had a chance to investigate it, is a programming language
that, among other things, can embed animation into HTML pages.

Finally, World Wide Web spiders and people who know how to use
them will become big late next year. A spider, which is a program
such as Lycos that goes out on the Net to find the information
you want, is essential to using the Net intelligently. MetaCrawler,
which automatically searches other spiders, is really interesting,
although it opens all sorts of ownership and other legal issues.

Hope you had a happy New Year. Cindy and I relaxed in front
of the fireplace, and I did not even dwell on Kratmeyer's request
that we install a Win95 data warehouse in International Operations
to support his reengineering effort. I wish he would stop reading
airline magazines.

dollar international company. Herb practices his day job under

Desktop Agenda: The Parts Bill Left Out -- Microsoft bugs help exhume deleted
material from The Road Ahead

By:
Stephen Manes

Everybody's making predictions, so here's mine: History will
rank Bill Gates as an author right up there with one of his
personal favorites-Robert James Waller, the man who wrote The
Bridges Of Madison County. No one with a heart could possibly
remain unmoved at the poignant images in Bill's book The Road
Ahead (Viking, 1995). I almost shed a tear as I read this:
"Stallion, she thought, as his fingers eagerly caressed both
buttons of her Microsoft mouse. Stallion, she knew, as all
at once he manfully manipulated the Control, Alt, and Delete
keys of her Microsoft Natural Keyboard."

Actually, that passage didn't make it into the book. But as
I reported in The New York Times, security lapses in Microsoft's
OLE object technology make Office files suck up deleted data
from your hard drive unless you're using Windows NT (Microsoft
issued a fix for the problem on Dec. 6). Besides, when you
use the "fast save" option with Microsoft Word, your deletions
stay in the file.

I predict that thanks to these amazing "features," sources may
soon treat us to portions of the book that were deleted before
it reached the presses. Before you curse Microsoft for causing
your deleted rants to reappear in E-mail messages you've sent
across the Net, give thanks that its incompetence may have
kept alive the parts of Bill's book that he left out.

In the book itself, for example, Gates is stingy with credit.
His fellow billionaire Paul Allen receives his due for helping
develop the original Microsoft Basic, but the "third man" on
that project, programmer Monte Davidoff, isn't mentioned. The
Parts Left Out will reveal that Gates actually cited everyone
whose work he borrowed, but the bibliography was mysteriously
omitted at the last moment.

The book explains some of the electronic novelties of the huge
house Gates is building, such as pictures and music that can
follow guests around like an obsequious puppy. The Parts Left
Out will disclose the shocking news that although most of the
house's systems are based on Windows NT, the windows themselves
will be controlled by a variant of IBM's OS/2 system that did
so well with airport baggage in Denver.

Shirts And Suits

In The Road Ahead, Gates writes that "Soon there will be computerized
shirt-making machines that will obey a different set of instructions
for every shirt ... It is conceivable that within a few years
everyone will have measurements registered electronically so
it will be easy to find out how well a ready-made item will
fit, or to place a custom order." The Parts Left Out will reveal
that every article of clothing Gates has worn since 1991 was
produced by a top-secret Microsoft system that also cuts and
styles his hair.

The book discusses a "full bodysuit" that can reproduce tactile
sensations. The Parts Left Out will disclose that Microsoft
has had a prototype under development for years. Programmers
who volunteered for the project will declare they have experienced
bliss-for the first time in their lives.

Gates writes that he thinks of a "wallet PC" as a "new Swiss
Army knife" that will serve as "a camera, a pocket tape recorder,
a cellular phone, a pager, concert tickets, a map, a compass,
a calculator," and "perhaps a loud whistle to summon help."
The Parts Left Out will show that the only part of the prototype
that works is the whistle, though breakthroughs are expected
in nail-file and scissors technology.

Stephen Manes is co-author of Gates: How Microsoft's Mogul Reinvented
An Industry (Touchstone/Simon and Schuster)

Object Technology: Make Software Fit Business -- Business software should be 
designed to help users do their jobs-not dictate their actions

By:
Robert Morison

The Internet is dramatically changing our view of information
access. As Net users, we are learning to find the information
we want, or even suspect exists, using generic tools. This
information-centric model is gathering momentum as we enter
the new year.

Yet most corporate information systems aren't built to participate
in the flow of new information, or to capitalize on the creativity
unleashed by it. As corporations, we're still tied to the predetermined
data regurgitated by cumbersome applications whose design centers
are actually automation, not information.

This situation cannot continue; the business world is changing
too fast. The purpose of business software is overdue for radical
rethinking. To date, software has been used to organize information
to automate processes. Instead, software should organize information
for communication and understanding, creating a model of the
business that can be used in many ways. Implementing this change
is a primary challenge for IS organizations in 1996 and beyond.

What's wrong with today's business software? Take a simple example
 a telephone call to a mail-order outfit. A typical sequence
 I'm put on hold ... I listen to canned sincerity telling me
how important my call is to them ... a representative then
asks for the customer codes on the mailing label ... I say
the catalog is in my wife's name and was sent to our former
address, and therefore does little to identify me ... I'm asked
to supply credit-card information, address, and phone number
 ... I'm finally allowed to name the item I want ... it's out
of stock.

What's going on? The rep's work has been automated. The company
designed the "best" way to handle orders, then implemented
it in software. Now, the rep is enslaved by a system that is
unfriendly to customers, demeaning to the rep's intelligence,
and ultimately unproductive.

Do your systems also impose one right way of doing things on
a variable world? Let's face it: There is no single best way
of doing anything-and there's no longer any such thing as a
stable transaction-processing system.

Ugly Complexity

The focus of business software must change to give people useful
packets of information and functionality. Software shouldn't
try to impose order; it should model the business in its ugly
complexity.

When the business changes, you use the model differently or
modify only what needs to change. Software shouldn't dictate
workers' actions; it should model their domains and respect
their intelligence in deciding how to act. That way, my mail
order rep could build an order that satisfies us both.

The technology for creating this software is, of course, object
orientation. These tools provide a natural means for organizing
software into useful packets, which is important because it
encourages business modeling. Paradoxically, the only way to
build a large, dynamic business model is bottom-up, learning
about the business and the model as you go.

These notions of software are overdue for implementation. For
years, we've been fooling ourselves that we're making progress
by dabbling in object technology and implementing option-laden
applications. But we're still reautomating.

We won't turn the corner until we change the approach. So here's
a New Year's resolution: All new software must model rather
than automate; it's the only way to cope with business change.
We must also change the intent. We shouldn't aim to "get it
right," but simply to "get it."

Technological advance-increasing processor and communications
power, multimedia, the Internet-is creating an exciting new
venue. But without redefining their software, corporations
continue playing catch against the stoop. We can't imagine
what the business world will be like when people have access
to robust business models. But it'll be different, it'll be
exciting, and companies that create models early and well will
enjoy a competitive advantage.

INTERNET AND TELECOMS MERGER ANNOUNCED

Commercial Internet service provider UUNET Technologies and telecoms
carrier MFS Communications Company are to merge in a $2bn deal which
was announced on 30 April 1996. This agreement creates a combined
organisation with 50,000 business customers worldwide, served by 4,200
employees making it the most significant deal to be made public during
the prolific Internet World show at San Jose, California.

Until the announcement, UUNET Technologies, the longest-established of
the major commercial Internet access providers, had been seen primarily
as a partner of the Microsoft Corporation, but it now appears that the
company will back the link. Bill Gates, chairman and CEO of Microsoft
said: 'We are highly supportive of this merger with MFS, since the
combination of a facility-based telecoms carrier with a high quality
Internet service provider offers the potential for high bandwidth
availability at lower costs for end-users.'

Under the terms of the agreement, UUNET shares will be converted into
MFS common stock at the rate of 1 to 1.777776. The resulting $2bn (at
30 April close of market) valuation is one of the highest yet achieved
by a specialist Internet company in public flotation or merger deals.
It comes even though UUNET, like the majority of specialist Internet
service providers, has been running at an operating loss for the larger
part of its history. Once again this confirms the general performance
of the Internet-related stocks as a premium commodity to investors.

The combined company arising out of this deal will be strongly placed
to exploit the increasing synergies occurring between Internet and
traditional telecoms operations. The business will possess some 543
Internet points of presence (288 outside the US), putting it among the
best-developed Internet service operations in the world. This will be
supported by a substantial telecoms infrastructure. James Q Crowe,
chairman and CEO of MFS, in a prepared statement, indicated four major
areas of benefit to the growth of Internet-related business resulting
from the merger:

- Savings on UUNET's expenses for local communications services, which
represented over 40% of the company's network expenses.

- Combining purchasing power for international and domestic leased
circuits, thus reducing expenses.

- Improved operating margins through the collection of co-carrier
payments for dial-up Internet access.

- Improved sales performance for Internet activities.

Many commentators on the Internet have felt for some time that the
specialist Internet service providers such as UUNET, Netcom and PSI
were unlikely to prove sustainable businesses without the support of
larger parents, or full integration into existing, related
organisations.

NET FOCUS

Welcome to a new venture in Internet information publishing. Internet
for Business, published by FT Telecoms and Media Publishing, is a move
towards putting Internet-related factual information into the hands of
the business strategists and decision makers who will play a key role
in shaping the usage of these global network systems in coming years.

The Internet already attracts more column inches than perhaps any other
single area of new technology development, which is saying something
quite extraordinary given the importance of other technological fields
in modern society. Not all of this publicity has been positive, of
course, but there seems to be a wide-reaching consensus regarding the
importance of the Internet's future role in the global communications
industry. Surprisingly, the majority of readily available printed
information about the Internet focuses mainly on consumer applications
and services. Attention is given to commercial implications and
applications, but much of this coverage is hidden away in specialist
publications. It also shows an unhelpful tendency to wrap its content
in the technical mysteries and burgeoning jargon of the Internet
sector.

Internet for Business aims to change all that. The newsletter will
focus on the facts, presented as far as possible in lay terms, or with
clear explanation of technical terms and jargon. Internet for Business
will provide you with clear, unbiased and objective accounts of all
that is important in understanding the Internet sector whether
concerning new technologies, protocols and standards, typical or
outstanding business applications, company news or share performances.
For the sake of complete impartiality, coverage will be given to
commercial online services such as CompuServe and Delphi, in addition
to the Internet proper. However, it is expected that the blurring of
the boundaries between these organisations and specialist Internet
Service Providers will accelerate in 1996 and thereafter, leading to a
convergence of operation and activity across the network providers.

The Internet remains a young technology, in commercial activity at
least, and many of the companies pioneering the commercial application
of the system remain under-capitalised and inexperienced in the global
marketplace. The pace of change is quite extraordinary, and many
initiatives which look exciting today are likely to prove impractical
or unconvincing in the real world. For every Netscape Communications
there will undoubtedly be many failures, and ultimately the existing
major players in the computing and telecoms industries are likely to
hold the upper hand.

Nonetheless, the Internet, or something which emerges from it, will be
a permanent feature of our commercial and personal lives, and will
continue as a means of building new markets, developing new profit
centres, and changing and streamlining business operations. Internet
for Business will assist its readers in tracking Internet growth and
development, and in pinpointing the real opportunities for their
organisations and backers in coming years.

The editors of Internet for Business, Andrew Parker and Ray Attwood,
can be contacted by e-mail at intforbus@pearson-pro.com or through the
offices of the publishers, whose details are given on the back page of
this issue.

HARDWARE ALLIANCE MEANS NEW INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS

Late April saw the announcement of the takeover of StrataCom, a leading
supplier of telecoms switching equipment, by Cisco Systems, a market
leader in the manufacture and supply of internetworking equipment
including routers and LAN switches. According to Cisco, the new
relationship will provide an integrated combine, able to provide end-to-
end solutions across public, private or hybrid networks. The move
clearly represents a gearing up by Cisco to meet the expected future
growth in telecoms, Internet and Intranet technology.

The acquisition of StrataCom was carried through under an offer of
shares in Cisco common stock, in exchange for all outstanding shares
and options of StrataCom. With Cisco's common stock valued at a little
under $50, the total value of the transaction was in the region of
$4bn. Final confirmation of the deal is due by late June 1996.

Of most interest in Internet applications is the new group's integrated
ability to handle the advanced switching technologies which are at the
heart of state-of-the-art Internet network systems. The two companies
will have highly-developed expertise in the design and implementation
of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and frame relay high-speed WAN
switching equipment. These technologies are being increasingly adopted
by Internet service providers to offer far more robust and flexible
data communications technology, especially to corporate users.

MASS MARKET IN INTERNET TELEPHONY?

One of the most appealing, and yet controversial products to be
launched for Internet users in recent times has been Internet
telephony. A number of software companies have launched products which
allow Internet users with sound-enabled computers to make two-way
telephone calls over the Internet, throughout the world, for the price
of a local call (or free if they are attached to a corporate Internet
access).

This technology is soon to be delivered to a mass audience by Netscape
Communications, which has announced that an Internet telephony utility
will be integrated into the next generation of its browser software.

The new Netscape browser, to be called Atlas, will include an
application called CoolTalk, which provides the telephony capability.

Initially users will only be able to call other users who are currently
online. CoolTalk will operate with modems at data rates as low as
9,600bps.

Internet telephony has been controversial among the Internet community
since early versions of the software were bandwidth intensive,
blanketing out the more bandwidth-efficient activities such as Web
traffic and e-mail. In some cases Internet service providers even went
so far as to ban the process from their networks.

However, improving audio compression technology appears to be making
the technology more acceptable across the Internet. And it represents a
genuine threat to established telecommunications companies across the
world, especially to their high-priced international telephone
services.

UK NAME REGISTRATION SHAKE UP

A new structure for the registration and administration of Internet
addresses in the UK was announced in mid-April by Dr W Black, the
nominated manager of the .uk space within the overall structure of
domain names on the Internet. The change involves the establishment of
a non-profit company to take over the day-to-day processing of domain
name registrations in the UK, and of a steering committee of industry
representatives to oversee its operation. Membership of the steering
committee is open to all organisations with a legitimate interest in
the name registration process, and will be subject to an annual
membership fee. A system of name registration charges is also proposed
to defray the operating costs of the new establishment. All new
Internet sub-domain names, the core of the Internet addresses used from
day-to-day by all types of user, will incur the charges, although
special arrangements may be made for educational and other non-profit
organisations.

These changes, which will bring the UK into line with other countries
such as Germany, Japan and the commercial domain in North America, have
received a mixed response from within the Internet industry in the UK,
with some suggesting that the planning and decision-making process had
been undertaken with insufficient publicity and consultation. Lack of
information on the changes seems to have caused widespread
misunderstanding of the proposals, including some suggestions that the
move represents an exploitative change attempting to bring more control
of the UK Internet back into the hands of UKERNA, the Government-
established company which controls the operation of the UK's academic
network, JANET. This has been fuelled by the fact that Dr Black, who is
an employee of UKERNA in his current role, has been designated as the
first manager for the new structure.

More realistically, it is clear that stabilisation and regularisation
was needed in this area. There are some 6,000 registered users of
Internet domain names in the .co.uk area alone (this being the domain
name suffix allocated to UK-based commercial Internet addresses). This
number is increasing by 100 every week in second quarter 1996. It is
widely understood that current structures, where commercial Internet
service providers provide voluntary support to UKERNA in administering
name registration for specific sub-domains such as .co.uk, have begun
to unravel under the pressure of expansion occurring in the Internet at
present.

Under the new system, a fixed rate of charging will apply to all new
Internet address registrations - #100 for each new name registered,
covering the first two years of operation, and #50 per year thereafter
to cover the maintenance of the name in the register and central DNS
structures (the computers at the heart of the UK Internet which convert
the day-to-day use of textual forms of addresses into the numeric
Internet protocol addresses used in the operation of the Internet
between computers and networks). Members of the Steering Committee will
qualify for a significant discount on these full rates, on behalf of
their customers, which they are able to pass on in full or in part. It
is intended to commence charging according to the stated scales for all
new name registrations after 31 May 1996. Recurrent charges for
existing names will begin on 1 June 1997.

THE BATTLE OF THE BROWSERS

In almost simultaneous press announcements in mid-March 1996, Microsoft
and Netscape Communications both trumpeted deals confirming close co-
operation between their organisations and America Online (AOL), the
world-leader in the commercial online networks market.

Organisations such as AOL, CompuServe and Prodigy have recently moved
to offer far more flexible Internet access to their users, and have
shown a desire to integrate the best of Internet-specific software into
their user interfaces. Given their large customer bases (AOL alone with
over 5 million users worldwide), it is natural that fierce competitors
such as Netscape and Microsoft should vigorously woo these companies.

In the case of AOL, Microsoft seems to have achieved the more
definitive relationship. AOL has chosen to integrate Microsoft's
Internet Explorer Web browser software seamlessly into its main user
interface, making it the main tool which AOL users will harness in
searching across the World Wide Web. In return, AOL has achieved one of
the goals long sought by the commercial network providers, the
provision of an easy access to its service for Windows 95 users, via a
folder on the desktop of the operating system.

Netscape, by contrast, has reached agreement that its Navigator browser
software should be integrated into the interface for GNN, a more
specialist Internet service operated by AOL. The browser will also be
an option for AOL users generally. In return, Netscape will provide AOL
with a prominent presence within its own Web site.

Microsoft thus appears to have obtained pole position with this major
user base, regarding Internet applications, and will offer AOL users
the benefit of its ongoing development of new Internet software tools
under the ActiveX Technologies programme. These include utilities to
provide animation, 3d, and video to the Internet.

Consolation for Netscape Communications comes in the form of a parallel
deal with CompuServe. Under this agreement, CompuServe is able to
distribute the Netscape Navigator software to users of its CompuServe
Information Service, its core group of online customers, and to users
of the Spry Internet access service, recently acquired by CompuServe.

These moves reflect the more general struggle between Netscape
Communications, as the developer of the dominant browser for World Wide
Web users on today's Internet, and Microsoft, the world's dominant
software company. Microsoft manifestly wishes to wrest away Netscape's
market leadership in this field, and is moving forcefully towards
achieving that end.

PRODIGY LOSES MARKET SHARE

A recent survey by Odyssey, the San Francisco-based research firm
indicates a shift in fortunes for the major online services.

In its Homefront survey, Odyssey found that during the last two years
the market share of the four major online services, America Online
(AOL), CompuServe, Prodigy and Microsoft show a dramatic improvement in
market share for AOL, while similar figures for CompuServe remained
static.

The big loser appears to be Prodigy, with a 50% fall in market share.
Recent reports in the San Jose Mercury News, indicate a possible
management buy-out of Prodigy from its owners IBM and Sears Roebuck for
a sum thought to be under $100m.

NETCOM'S FIRST

Launching its new UK operation and UK Internet access services on 1 May
1996, US specialist Internet service provider (ISP) Netcom became the
first of the major independent ISPs from North America to start an
operation from scratch in the UK.

One of the top three North America specialist access providers, Netcom
has come to the UK market late in comparison with major competitors
such as UUNET Technologies and PSINet. Both these companies chose to
launch into the UK market through acquisition of an existing local
provider. This latter approach has proved of mixed value to its
exponents.

The UK launch for Netcom - its first outside North America - capped a
satisfying early 1996 for the company, which saw its user base climb
above the 400,000 level in April 1996, and its first quarter revenue
for 1996 grow to $24.1m, a growth of 221% over the equivalent period in
1995 (Netcom figures).

Netcom has aimed high, in the creation of its UK operation, hiring over
50 staff by the launch date, and establishing a nationwide network of
virtual points of presence in collaboration with local telco Energis.
Users throughout the country will therefore be able to access Netcom's
dial-up services via a local telephone call. Heading up this UK system
will be new managing director David Clarke, who formerly had a strong
track record in high-level management with Compaq, the successful PC
manufacturer/vendor.

Among the more useful aspects of Netcom's service from day one will be
a full 24-hour, seven days per week customer service facility, and a
range of access services tailored to both business and consumer users.
'We believe we are the only ISP in the UK market offering a truly
competitive Internet solution,' said Clarke.

It will be interesting to track the respective progress of the three
major ISPs now active in the UK market over coming months.

UUNET Technologies, the new owners of Unipalm - PIPEX, arguably the
most effective of the indigenous access providers for the corporate
sector, has major distractions in its own merger with MFS, reported
elsewhere in this issue, and in the delivery of Internet access
services for the Microsoft Network in the UK and elsewhere. PSINet,
having acquired the UK arm of Pan-European provider EUnet, has gone
through a drawn-out process of infrastructure and staff re-development,
to meet the high standards set by its service in the US. Consequently
it has been seen to move backwards in the eyes of many commentators, in
terms of customer credibility and market performance. A full launch of
PSINet's consumer and commercial access services in the UK has still
not been achieved, some seven or eight months after the EUnet GB
acquisition took place.

Given the relative position of these three major players, and the still
small scope of BT's Internet access operation, it may well be advisable
for business users at least to take advice on Netcom's services,
despite their greenness in the UK market.

Netcom may be found on the World Wide Web at http://www.netcom.net.uk.
In addition to providing details on Netcom's UK operations and
services, the site provides a NetNews section, a Web search facility, a
directory of UK Web sites, customer support and frequently-asked
questions (FAQ) information.

SEARCHING SUCCESS FOR DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION

Digital Equipment Corporation Alta Vista search for the World Wide Web,
a latecomer in the field by comparison with other services such as
Lycos, Yahoo and Infoseek, received recognition of its effectiveness
through receipt of an Industry Award for Outstanding Service from US
publication Internet World.

The award, which was announced during the Internet World show in San
Jose, recognises Alta Vista's immediate and widespread adoption by Web
users, since launching in December 1995.

Identified as the most comprehensive search site on the Web during
Internet World's recent testing of search services, Alta Vista has
become a must-use tool for many Web surfers during its short history.
Digital Equipment's own statistics tell the story, with the site now
reaching as many as seven million hits per day.

Since inception, the index maintained for the Alta Vista site has grown
from 16 million full text pages to 22 million (as at April 1996) with
over 11 billion words. The index also covers more than 13,000 of the
USENET newsgroups available over the Internet.

During Internet World in San Jose, Digital Equipment announced plans to
develop the search engines used in the Alta Vista sit into a family of
fast search tools to be marketed into commercial and consumer markets.

AVIS RENT-A-CAR

http://www.avis.com

Avis has become the latest of the major car hire companies to establish
an interactive service on the World Wide Web. The site, known as the
Avis Galaxy, is operated from the US, but offers a worldwide service.

The most convenient aspect of the Web site is the facility to obtain
firm quotes, with a special Web users' discount, and to reserve car
hire bookings, for journeys at home or overseas. A trial use of the
site obtained a discount-rate quote for hiring an intermediate car for
a business trip in California, with the price stated in pounds
Sterling, since the quote was requested in the UK. When first seeking
this information, it was not immediately obvious how to obtain a price
quotation from the site, since the quotation service uses the same
interactive forms as the firm car booking system. But closer
examination showed that users can click on an option requesting a price
quote rather than a firm booking.

Apart from this quibble, the site appears to be well thought out in
terms of navigation, with tool bars at the foot of each page allowing
access to other sections of the site, or a return to the home page.
Users with the graphics capability of their browser switched off, or
with non-graphical browsers, are provided with text-based alternatives
to the graphical hyperlinks which are structured into the site.

In addition to the quotation and reservation service the Avis Galaxy
also provides information on special Avis services such as the
company's Travel Partners scheme and Business Rate Plans, details of
location of the company's main outlets, special offers, e-mail contact
information and a number of other interactive services. Many of the
national Avis operations covered by the Web information provide
pictures of the cars available in their country, together with textual
information describing their features.

The site is configured to be accessed using the Netscape Navigator
browser, and like many of this type, offers the user the option to
download a copy of that software, if they do not already use it.

A GERMAN PRESENCE

http://www.government.de or http://www.bundesregierung.de

The Press and Information Office of the Government of the Federal
Republic of Germany has recently launched a Web site providing a range
of information services for Web users. Details on the site are in
either German or English, with a straightforward navigational process
enabling visitors to the site to select the language required. Site
content is heavily textual, overall, but this is perhaps appropriate to
the rather bureaucratic nature of much of the information.

Users will find that they need to delve fairly seriously to get to more
informative elements in the site, since the first few levels give very
general information which is neither searching nor loaded with factual
content. However, users should persevere, since the site does reward
more careful exploration. One of its most useful elements is a list of
German Web links under a number of potentially helpful categories,
including: general information on Germany; news and media; travel;
German Zip Codes (Search Engine); business and law; exchange programmes
and research; culture and language classes; sport; German government;
political foundations; and the EU and embassies.

The general information category, for example, offers links to a range
of more detailed sites, such as the Deutsche Welle, a government-
supported media organisation, the German Foreign Office home page and
the site maintained by the Goethe Institute, the well-known German
cultural organisation.

The business and law section offers links such as Germany's Top 500
Firms - an alphabetical listing and a listing by size (in English),
reports on German and European financial trends (in English) and
Biz.Travel, a server with information on doing business in Germany and
particular German cities, with listings of Chambers of Commerce.

Other interesting links include pointers to several news magazine and
newspaper Web sites, and a series of online travel services, some of
which provide online reservations and ticket sales.

As with many Web sites, the power of this site is rather more in the
further information which is accessible through it, rather than in the
information which it provides itself.

Anyone familiar with Germany, and doing business in that country, is
likely to find this particularly true, and may well only pinpoint some
of the linked sites as useful for future reference. However, newcomers
to the country and its business practices are likely to find the site
itself more immediately useful.

TECHNICAL AND MEDIA EVENTS CATALOGUED ONLINE

http://www.zdnet.com/zdi/calendar/calendar.html

The ZD Net Trade Show Calendar is a new service offering a calendar of
trade events, worldwide, in the following categories: broadcasting and
media; computer aided technologies; computer hardware/peripherals;
entertainment industry; computer software/services; Information
Technology; engineering; Internet/online services; publishing;
telecoms.

Extracts from the total calendar of events may be obtained using a
search form, which offers the ability to select a given country or
countries, any one or more topics, and a range of dates within which
the events should fall. The search results are presented as a table of
events, including their open dates, the city where they take place and
general subject coverage. A search may also be made for a single event,
using all or part of its title. For each event listed as a result of a
search, a hypertext link takes the user to further details on the show,
including venue information, event frequency, and in some cases details
of visitor and exhibitor attendance at the previous occurrence of the
event.

A test search was performed, retrieving all the events listed during
calendar 1996 covering the topic of Internet. The resulting list
included 16 trade exhibitions and conferences, with the major Internet
events such as Internet World International, Networld and Interop and
Online Information, general computing events such as Comdex/UK,
Computers in Manufacturing and Software Development and more
specialised events such as ECTS, Manufacturing Week and MTQ - Testing
for Quality. The only obvious omissions were events which were launched
recently and were not yet widely-enough publicised to have reached this
US-based database (such as the new Internet '96 Show to be held in
London in October).

PRE-EMPLOYMENT SCREENING ARRIVES

http://www.informus.com

US data search specialist Informus is offering a full range of pre-
employment screening services for US companies on the Web, launched in
early 1996. Companies which wish to use the service are required to
sign up with Informus, and are then provided with an ID and password
enabling them to access a full set of information services online.

Informus places great stress on its security procedures, and the
vetting of customer companies before it obtains access. In this way
every measure is taken to ensure that only bona fide users are able to
access the site, preventing inappropriate or exploitative use.

Charges for the service are processed automatically online and the user
companies billed accordingly. Informus stresses the immediacy of
information availability and the facility for highly selective
information retrieval as the main benefits to users of working on the
Web. Company figures suggest that a typical search for a given job
applicant would cost in the region of $20 - $70, depending on the
nature of information sought.

The Web site is currently configured to offer the active service,
accessible only to registered users, plus a set of demonstrations,
background information on the service and a registration utility for
companies wishing to take up the system. An e-mail contact system is
also provided.

Among the services available from Informus regarding job applicants'
previous histories are: driving records; prior workers' compensation
claims; criminal history; employment records; educational records;
credit ratings from ratings agencies; address detail confirmation;
personal references vetting; and professional licence checking.

Thus the site offers human resources professionals the opportunity, for
example, to check an applicant's claim to have a clean driving licence,
or to examine claims regarding past salary and employment details or
educational and professional qualifications. The main areas of the
service currently used by subscribers, according to Informus, are
driving reports, criminal history information, address history,
previous employment record and credit history.

GET WEBBED UP ON CANADIAN DOCUMENTS

Micromedia, a Toronto-based corporate information source, has launched
a new service on the Web to offer company and document tracking
services in the Canadian corporate sector. The service, known as
Canadian Research and Electronic Documents Ordering Service (CREDO),
offers searching across a 600,000-entry index of corporate filings
covering the Ontario Securities Commission and Industry Canada,
together with selected documents from the Vancouver and Montreal
markets.

Users are able to search for individual documents or companies online,
and to create personal information profiles which the CREDO service
will then monitor for them. Under the latter option, an alert is issued
to the user each time a new document is obtained within the profile
established.

Once documents have been identified for the user, Micromedia is able to
deliver copies to users in North America using same day or overnight
delivery services or three hour delivery locally in Toronto. Home and
overseas users may use the fax alternative. A full scale of charges for
actual document access and delivery is published as part of the site.

INTERNET LINES THROWN OPEN IN SAN JOSE

The Internet industry, along with its current and potential customers,
descended in unprecedented numbers on San Jose, California at the end
of April, for the 1996 Internet World conference and exhibition. With
over 350 exhibitors, and estimated visitor numbers in the region of
40,000 according to organisers Mecklermedia, the event is once again
the largest Internet-specific trade show in the world. Ray Attwood and
Andrew Parker were there...

Based at the heart of Silicon Valley, still the creative engine of much
of today's computer industry, Internet World achieved an impressive
array of new product announcements, mergers and acquisitions. Some of
the most important of these are described elsewhere in this issue,
including our lead story on the merger of UUNET Technologies and MFS
Communications Company (see front page) to form one of the strongest
operations in the Internet field. The event has been so successful that
it has been transferred into the Los Angeles Convention Center for
1997, the only exhibition and conference facility on the West Coast of
the US able to handle the show's size and complexity. Mecklermedia
sources predicted a likely growth to around 500 exhibitors for 1997
(citing the fact that a 75-strong waiting list for exhibit space
existed for the 1996 event), and to well in excess of 50,000 visitors.

Internet World's development as an event is a true mirror of the
development of the commercial Internet industry itself. Launched four
years ago, the first West Coast event only attracted in the region of
50 exhibitors, and less than a tenth of this year's visitor turnout.
This has changed to such a degree that all the major players of the US
computer industry were represented at the event in 1996, with the likes
of IBM, Microsoft and Digital Equipment using the show as a platform to
launch a plethora of Internet-related initiatives. Along with these,
representatives of other major sectors such as telecoms were equally
active, as exemplified by AT&T's launching of its new WorldNet global
Internet access service.

Not even the arrival of summer-like weather, with temperatures soaring
into the 90s, seemed to discourage the eager Internet users thronging
around the booths. However, the major impact of the 1996 event on
attendees was not so much in the new products and services to be
identified on a high percentage of the stands at the show. Instead the
lasting impression created focused on two areas. One is a process of
consolidation, as a host of companies active in the Internet sector
seek to build formal or informal alliances, merge or acquire within the
industry, and share technologies. Microsoft and Netscape, among several
others, are major collaborators in the establishment of the SET
protocol for secure credit card transactions over the Internet and
World Wide Web. Search engine and Internet search specialist Lycos has
licensed its core technology to Frontier Technologies for its
CyberSearch software product, a unique, browser-independent system for
performing Web searching and storing information on sites visited for
future reference. Traveling Software, producer of the popular PC-
linking package, Laplink, announced at the show its acquisition of
Milktruck Software, a pioneering start-up company developing offline
Web browsing and Web site capture utilities. These are but a few of the
deals and agreements which the show brought to the attention of the
wider world.

The emerging force of Intranets

The other major process within the Internet industry, highlighted at
the show, is the emergence of Intranets as a key focus of the marketing
and product development activities of the Internet sector. Intranets
are treated more fully in a separate article in this issue of Internet
for Business. In brief, however, these represent the development of
Internet-based software tools and techniques to provide cost-effective
and easy-to-use sharing of electronic information resources within the
corporate or organisational computer environment. This may be across
either local area networks or wide area networks. A new enthusiasm for
Intranets has been driven by recognition among Internet developers that
many medium to large-sized companies remain more open to innovative
information technology tools within their management information
systems, rather than in communicating with the world at large. Equally,
the tools available for the sharing of, for example, electronic
documents over a corporate network have been relatively expensive up to
the present, and Internet-developed software tools often allow similar
levels of functionality at lesser cost. Thus a major marketing
opportunity has been recognised by the wider Internet industry, and the
focus on Intranets has been consciously developed to allow clear
recognition by potential buyers of the different focus of products
offered in this area. The term Intranet was omnipresent at San Jose,
despite being seldom used across the industry up to late 1995.

Internet World 1996 was clearly a resounding success for its
organisers, and the buzz across the exhibit halls also suggested a
level of satisfaction among the exhibitors. It stands out as a staging
post in the development of Internet business. The continuing sections
of this article set out some of the more interesting changes, deals,
products and services which were aired at the show.

General Internet systems

Microsoft Corporation, in a battery of announcements, focused mainly on
its upgrading of the Microsoft BackOffice Server Suite version 2.0. The
enhancements launched during Internet World included built in messaging
and groupware software, a high-performance Web server and an updated
database, all with inbuilt support for both Internet and Intranet
activity.

Electronic forms specialists JetForm, of Falls Church, Vancouver
announced a new intelligent forms system for the Web. Delivering far
greater flexibility and complexity of operation than standard HTML
forms, JetForm's family of utilities will allow the implementation of
complex data retrieval processes over the Web for both Internet and
Intranet environments. Included within the family of software
applications are a Server for creating and uploading forms, a form
filler client programme for end users and the Web Connectivity Pak
which collects data from forms and delivers it to the server for data
processing.

In a similar move, Decisive Technology Corporation of Palo Alto,
California, launched its desktop survey software suite, under the
Decisive Survey name. Decisive Survey software is designed to allow
survey developers to create and implement e-mail mediated surveys over
both Intranets and the Internet proper.

Reflecting a slow but steady move towards better multilingual
capability on the Web, and on the Internet at large, Israeli software
developers Accent Software introduced a multilingual plug-in for the
Netscape Navigator Web browser. Using the Accent plug-in, surgers will
be able to view sites written in more than 30 different languages
transcribed correctly on screen, including the use of any special
accents or scripts which may be required. The plug-in also enables
multilingual configuration of all the operating information within the
Netscape browser.

Electronic commerce developments

Among the most eagerly awaited software utilities for the whole
Internet community is the Secure Electronic Transactions (SET) secure
credit card transaction process. This protocol, sponsored jointly by
MasterCard, Visa and several of the giants of Internet software
development such as Microsoft and Netscape, will allow easy-to-use,
secure processing of credit card transactions over the World Wide Web.

Claiming to be the first software developer to implement SET fully,
Terisa Systems of Los Altos, California, demonstrated its prototype SET
software solution, which processes credit card transactions in a three-
way link between purchaser, credit card merchant and the banks'
international financial transaction processing networks. Terisa
confidently predicts preliminary availability of its SET software, for
inclusion into other developers' online systems, for June 1996.

A more detailed examination of SET technology will appear in an issue
of Internet for Business later this year.

Intranet solutions

Inmagic of Woburn, Massachusetts, launched Navigation Server, offering
a broad range of searching, indexing and cataloguing capability for
corporate Intranet systems. Building on search technology licensed from
search specialists Lycos, the new product allows users to search across
and display on screen, not only HTML documents, but also information in
word processor and spreadsheet formats. A further facility will be the
creation of HTML output dynamically from database material in native
database formats.

IBM announced a number of Intranet-related initiatives at the show,
including a series of firewall and security products, Web production
and editing software, and the integration of its infoSage service into
Lotus Notes. InfoSage is a news delivery service available over
Internet and Intranet environments, drawing on news feeds from
organisations such as Dun and Bradstreet, COMTEX and Information Access
Company.

A further announcement from IBM concerned the launch of Crytolope
technology, a system allowing the encryption of individual messages or
documents for transmission across Internet and Intranet services, with
access only available to the authorised recipient.

Internet news service

The Wall Street Journal announced its new Internet online service on
the Web, claiming it to be the first online news service to launch with
a subscription/charging structure in operation from its inception.

The Web site, known as the Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition,
offers a basic range of services, including headline information
updated several times a day, free of charge. Paying users will be able
to access more detailed information underlying the headlines, including
access to analytical and financial information compiled in the
Journal's newsroom, and to create their own personalised news profile
drawn from the full range on the service, which will then be delivered
daily to their desktop computer.

Subscribers who sign up with the service before 31 May 1996 will be
able to use the full site free until 31 July. Thereafter, the
subscription will be $49 per year, or $29 for existing Wall Street
Journal subscribers.

HTML editors, converters and Web site management suites

One of the most notable changes in Internet software over the past 12
months has been the vast upgrading of HTML features, allowing a whole
host of flexible services on Web pages. Among these are the ability to
handle details in table format, the Netscape-specific frames
technology, which allows the definition of several different spaces
within one Web page, each of which may be scrolled through and changed
independently of the others.

The downside of these changes is that many new codes and syntax
features have been added to the earlier versions of the hypertext mark-
up language (HTML) used to construct pages for publication on the Web.
Fortunately for users, the software industry has kept up with this
process, and Internet World saw the launch of a range of new or
upgraded utilities which allow point and click editing of HTML,
compilation of HTML documents from templates, conversion of existing
word processor or desktop publishing files into HTML and proving of
finished HTML pages within a true or simulated browser display.

Internet for Business will be publishing a more detailed examination of
these utilities, and exploring their effectiveness for businesses on
the Web, in a later issue. Among the more interesting software in this
field in San Jose were SoftQuad's new version 3.0 of its HotMetal Pro
HTML editor, the Spider HTML editor from InContext, and a piece of
software named HTML Transit, from InfoAccess, which allows direct
automatic conversion into HTML format from a range of word processor
file formats. Others active in this market include Adobe with its
Pagemill product, IBM/Lotus with a new utility called The WebMaster's
Apprentice, and Microsoft with its Front Page and Internet Assistant
utilities.

SoftQuad also showed beta versions of a new utility named Panorama Pro,
which employs additional document mark-up technology, drawing on ISO
standards, to establish style sheets for HTML documents.

This is a particularly interesting development, since style sheets for
HTML have previously been an unrealised wish for much of the Web
development community. Before Panorama Pro, the most likely candidate
for creating more controlled appearance of documents on the Web had
appeared to the Adobe's Acrobat and Postscript technologies.

However, SoftQuad has achieved similar functionality with much more
efficient file sizes, and its system looks to be one worth tracking.
Internet for Business plans to bring you up to date on this in a later
issue.

Internet access services

PSINet of Herndon, Virginia, took the opportunity of Internet World to
announce a new mobile Internet access service, WorldLink. WorldLink is
a flat-rate service irrespective of the location from which it is used,
providing what PSINet claims to be the industry's first master account
management capability via the Web. Connection may be made via ISDN for
between $29.95 and $49.95 according to bandwidth, or by modem.

Networked Internet systems

Computer networking giant Novell announced an agreement with TCP/IP
software specialists Frontier Technologies Corporation, whereby Novell
will integrate TCP/IP functionality into its networking solutions. The
system will employ Frontier's SuperNFS client software for TCP/IP
applications, with operation available in several languages including
US English, French, German and Japanese.

Java tools

Several companies move the Sun Microsystems Java programming language
closer to being the simple tool desired by average business and
consumer users by introducing Graphic User Interfaces enabling Java
application development without line-by-line code needing to be
written.

Among those in this field were PowerProduction Software of Hermosa
Beach, California, with its WebBurst Java authoring tool, and Aimtech
Corporation of Nashua, New Hampshire, with its Jamba Java authorising
software. Such tools move Java firmly into the everyday application
field, and may well lead to a far wider implementation of realtime
programming applets (as Java routines are known) across the Web.

INTERNET SHOPPING - TWO CONTRASTING APPROACHES

A major area of commercial activity on the Internet has been the
appearance of virtual shopping malls. These have met with mixed success
and the dream of opening a store front to a global audience without the
associated overhead costs of traditional retail stores has not always
proved to be successful in its realisation. Indeed many stores in the
various electronic malls have found sales of products to be meagre.

While some malls have closed, others have changed their approach using
experience gained in previous attempts, to modify or completely restyle
their retailing activity based on the experiences of Internet shoppers.
After studying the way shopping is carried out on the Internet and
gaining a clearer idea of the profile and buying habits of internet
customers, more carefully-targeted sites are now appearing on the Net.

Two examples of different approaches to retailing in this new
environment can be seen by comparing the Internet Shopping Network,
based in Palo Alto, California with Online Interactive which is centred
in Seattle, Washington.

The Internet Shopping Network was founded in June 1993 and is an
established player by Internet standards. It is now a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Home Shopping Network which has a 10-year track record of
TV shopping to its name. The purchase of ISN in 1994 was seen as a
means to expand Home Shopping Network's reach into cyberspace and gain
access to the potential of a worldwide customer base.

ISN's reorganisation

Originally operating as part of the plethora of online malls which
sprang up over the past two years - represented by a wide range of
different products and suppliers - ISN has now re-organised its Web
site with changes in site navigation, graphics, format and content
aimed at providing a new approach from a redesigned Home Page and
concentrating on a well-defined and proven area of the online market.
Not surprisingly this market sector is in retailing computer hardware
and software where ISN's experience has indicated the best results can
be found.

Currently ISN offers over 25,000 products from more than 600 major
companies and makes use of a special feature called the 'Downloadable
Software Store' to take advantage of the unique attributes which the
Internet can lend to retailers. At this site a customer can gain
instant access to over 45 software product selections which may be
instantly purchased and downloaded direct from ISN to the user's own
computer. Thus ISN users benefit from the major attraction of Internet
shopping - convenience and speed. This is particularly useful when
dealing with experienced computer users who make up a large proportion
of the purchasers and who appreciate the advantages of a site modelled
on new paradigms rather than trying to create a replica shopping mall.
This profile will gradually change as more shoppers are found from
within the ISN links to AOL, Compuserve and Prodigy. These are services
where customers will often tend to be less computer literate. The
recent addition of 'Power Search' and 'Subject Category' will help in
this case by producing a list of the most relevant product or products
depending on a customer's interest. This type of service, using the
specific searching strengths available over the Internet, really begins
to demonstrate the useful way in which Internet retailing can be of
benefit to less experienced computer users too. With the recent
agreement to retail many of Microsoft's popular packages through the
Downloadable Software Site, ISN will find an increasing customer base
among this group.

ISN customers of course need to register before transactions can take
place and this requires an approved credit card, e-mail address, and
billing and shipping addresses. Once these details are received across
what ISN claims is a secure network, then all future transactions can
be carried out using a membership code, with all credit card
information kept offline. ISN uses Netscape Commerce server for
commercial transactions with security features including server
authorisation, data encryption, data integrity, and user authorisation.

Another organisation with an agreement to sell Microsoft products is
Online Interactive, which will retail through its atOnce Software
Store, again highlighting the importance attached to convenience and
speed of service in Internet retailing.

The company uses an online sales process based on a high speed Web site
for marketing and downloading encrypted software from the Internet.
After the desired software has been downloaded in encrypted form,
Ziplock collects credit card data, and in a separate, modem-based call,
directly routes the entire order to a secure proprietary network with
no credit card information ever passing across the Internet. After
authentication is complete and credit card approval given, an unlocking
'Key' is transmitted to the customer's computer. Ziplock then installs
the software, decrypting it to make it available for the customer's
use.

A commercial twist

In addition to atOnce software, Online Interactive also operates the
FreeShop Online, which takes the original ethos behind the operation of
the Internet, i.e. free access to information, and gives it a
commercial twist. The FreeShop is a means of providing direct marketing
and advertising for consumer products and services which are promoted
through free offers. This provides marketers with the ability to reach
a large customer group for a low charge and for the customers to sample
products free of charge. Online Interactive claim that since its
inception FreeShop Online has generated more than one million
electronic orders for over 180 companies. Recent evidence indicates
that between 18-30% of visitors are buying as a result of free offers
derived from the site.

FreeShop claims to process demographic information and leads on a daily
basis by e-mail when a free offer is selected and in so doing allows
prompt interaction between suppliers and customers which they claim
will aid the formation of future customer loyalty. A twice weekly
consolidated paper/label service is also available for fulfilment
purposes. While statistical evidence is not readily available, FreeShop
currently claims around 100,000 orders per month and rising among the
more popular online retailers in its site.

The offers are grouped in intuitive categories to allow easier and more
effective browsing and it is again claimed that on average three clicks
are usually sufficient to move the shopper from storefront to order
screen thus alleviating one of the major design disadvantages of many
electronic malls where endless web pages of ill-matching links nullify
the speed and convenience of shopping on the web. The popular
categories for the site are proving to be computing, magazines,
finance, entertainment and fitness products.

The effect of promotions on customer response rates is particularly
interesting and can increase interest and acceptance of offers by up to
ten times. This is achieved by a mixture of chat lines, contests,
spotlights and a club newsletter.

FreeShop is designed primarily as a lead-generating facility for
organisations which operate direct marketing strategies. By operating
FreeShop in the context of services such as America Online, and the
Microsoft Network, Online Interactive gains access to many millions of
consumer and business users. Companies promoting their products and
services through FreeShop normally follow up any leads generated by the
site by sending out free samples, catalogues or other promotional
information in the mail. However, a growing number of companies are
resorting to delivery of electronic promotional information to FreeShop
users.

These two contrasting versions of consumer retailing over the Internet
are beginning to represent the way in which this medium can provide a
truly useful and effective service to consumers. As technology develops
and the experience of other electronic malls is put to practical use
the whole concept and presentation of such retailing will evolve from
the current designs to show marked changes which no longer reflect the
transfer of outmoded and inappropriate concepts to the Web.

Internet for Business will track further developments in this field and
provide regular updates on new developments.

INTRANETS - THE NEW GROWTH PHENOMENON

During the last two years, a great deal of attention has been focused
on the development of the Internet and in particular on the external
uses of the World Wide Web. As the Internet began its transformation
from a medium used primarily by government departments, academics and
researchers to one with a commercial bias, the spotlight still remained
fixed on the comparative merits of different corporate Web sites and
the traffic which they generated.

While the debate about 'hits' on a web site, together with the problems
of transmission times for graphics and worries over security all
occupied the media, a quiet but fundamental shift was beginning to take
place within corporate structures. This involved the adoption of
Internet technology and the TCP/IP protocols on which it runs to form
corporate-wide networks 'Intranets'. Lacking in the immediate glamour
or controversy that many Web sites have generated, this application of
the Internet has been disregarded by many commentators. Instead the
issues concerning the informative, PR, sales and marketing potential of
Web sites have all been scrutinised and discussed with increasing
frequency. As this debate made headline news much less was said about
the ability of Intranets to perform vital business applications within
corporate structures.

More haste, less thought...

It is hardly surprising, therefore, that in the frenetic rush to place
information on the World Wide Web, many organisations have put up Web
pages with little thought to strategic planning and the real benefits
which might accrue to the company. The desire to claim a place out
there on the 'Net' and promote the company image with Web pages full of
hypertext links and colourful graphics has also outweighed the more
prosaic but beneficial use of a strategy which uses one or more servers
to allow password entry for nominated staff, suppliers or customers, to
gain network access and use e-mail within corporate environments linked
to LAN-based information and interfaced with the Internet.

However, recent statistical evidence does indicate that companies are
now realising what the Internet and its associated technologies can
offer, and this is leading to a change in approaches to strategic
planning as the potential of Intranets impacts upon corporate minds and
begins to show up in future growth predictions. Zone Research, based in
Redwood, California, reports that during 1996 revenue from sales of
Intranet servers will outstrip those for general Internet use, and by
1997/98 will exceed Internet server sales by a factor of three to four
times. In monetary terms this represents a private Intranet market in
1997 of over $4bn, and approaching $8bn in 1998. It is thought that
over 50% of the world's largest corporations are now actively planning
to develop their own private networks in Intranet form.

Benefits of Intranet communications

With such a fast growing and lucrative market, many of the hardware and
software suppliers within the Internet industry are re-focusing their
sales and promotion efforts towards intranet applications. This change
of focus is set to become an established feature in future advertising
and marketing campaigns, and at events such as the recent Internet
World Show in San Jose, California, where many companies were featuring
benefits of developing intranet communications. Digital Equipment
Corporation, for example, announced an Intranet strategy that will
supply its products and services as 'Intranet ready'. By providing a CD-
ROM they can turn Open VMS, Digital Unix, or WindowsNT servers into
Intranet-ready systems, and in co-operating with Microsoft and Netscape
are ensuring that their customers will be presented with ready-made
solutions on Digital Platforms. Established browser software will be
supplemented by firewall systems, to ensure secure connection of the
corporate Intranet to the Internet at large. For remote users Digital
will then offer 'tunnelling' software utilities which allow authorised
individuals to access information within the corporate Intranet, across
the firewall boundary.

Promoting internal corporate networking

Novell's recent announcement of its new corporate Intranet server
called 'Inner Web Publisher' is also indicative of the new emphasis now
being placed on specifically promoting internal corporate networking,
and the move to integrate servers with software tools to make them
seamless and easy to use. This can be seen by the recent agreement
between Novell and SoftQuad to bundle HoTMetal Light (the freeware
version of SoftQuad's high end HTML editor, HoTMetal Pro) with Novell's
product and allow end-users the ability to take advantage of
increasingly sophisticated Web authoring and publishing software.

Intranets explained

With so much effort now being focused on Intranets, therefore, it is
appropriate at this stage to ask just what Intranets are, and why are
they so important? At its simplest an Intranet could be described as an
'internal Internet' which allows employees secure access, often behind
firewall technology, to corporate information systems, but with the
added advantages of external links to the Internet itself. The benefits
of access to vast information resources which are so characteristic of
the Internet can also be duplicated by the Intranet for distributing
internal company information. 'Information mining' has been a feature
of Internet for some time as the research potential of huge remote
databases has been realised.

This situation is mirrored in many corporations where not only current
information, but also archive or 'legacy' information stored often in
previously incompatible hardware and software systems needs to be made
widely accessible in-house. New Web applications can allow Intranets to
tie new applications and legacy resources into a seamless interface.
Why is this so important? The importance of such a system can be seen
from a number of viewpoints.

In an increasingly competitive environment any company which can plan
and manage its communications effectively, and where appropriate,
provide an interface with external customers and markets, will gain
maximum leverage from its information assets. In any corporate strategy
this internal communications benefit of an Intranet should be
considered as one of the first building blocks of any overall Internet
strategy, often before creating a public face using an external Web
site, which on its own may prove to be of dubious worth.

The type of information which can be manipulated in this way indicates
the real potential for companies to benefit from better use of their
own internal data, links with additional external data, and the
customisation of this information as required for either internal uses
or external purposes.

Information can vary from general company announcements where a company
may, for example, mount its corporate policy manuals as Web sites
rather than print lots of copies of the document for physical
distribution, to the provision of sales and performance data, personal
employee communications and highly secret management information.

The amount and range of information which can be accessed is great but
the ability to reduce this quickly and easily to relevant core data as
required, in a secure environment and at a fraction of the cost
previously associated with such an exercise, are the real reasons for
the interest in Intranets. An example of this application can be seen
in the recent announcement from Inmagic a leader in text-based
technology which has licensed spidering technology from Lycos to
deliver 'DB/Text Navigator Server', a new product that will allow
spidering, searching, indexing and cataloguing of corporate Intranets.

This will include the integration of Lycos' Web spiders with InMagic's
'DB/Text WebServer' to provide a powerful search and publishing engine.
Harnessing this technology, a corporate Intranet user will be able to
structure indexes and search processes for all users across the whole
information resources of the company. IBM is also using the Intranet
focus as part of its repositioning in this marketplace, and as a major
plank in gaining ground lost over the past ten years to major
competitors like Microsoft. New links announced by the IBM Global
Network service to provide Lotus Notes for use in Intranets as well as
public networks are an example of this and will form part of a more
detailed feature on IBM in a later issue of Internet for Business.

Flexibility at a low cost

The open standards that form the basis of Intranet technology allow
companies a great deal of flexibility when adapting their own
communications strategy without the historic need to consider costly
options for matching the current software and hardware they use.
Together with an ever-growing acceptance by employees of the benefits
of using hypertext links to locate information and the relatively cheap
cost of purchase, the advantages begin to mount up. An ability to
record better productivity levels while achieving cost reductions is a
powerful incentive for companies to look carefully at the adoption of
Intranets.

While these reasons alone would be sufficient to persuade many
managers, the advantages become even greater when management and
employees link into external communications streams either
asynchronously or in realtime with suppliers and customers or perhaps
sales personnel at geographically remote locations and across different
time zones. Internet for Business will continue to explore the theme of
Intranets in forthcoming issues. Wherever possible examples of best
practice will be highlighted, offering readers greater insight into the
practical benefits and organisational implications of adopting Intranet
methods.

YAHOO FLOATS HIGH ON STOCKMARKET

The well-known Internet service company run by chief Yahoo Jerry Wang
went public in April with what seems an almost inevitable clamour for
shares by all those expecting to make a killing from dealing in high
profile Internet companies.

A total of 2.6 million shares started at $13 on NASDAQ before soaring
to over $40 in one of the largest ever first day gains, according to
industry sources. As with many Internet companies (e.g. Netscape or
Easynet in the UK) the share price exceeded expectations for a company
with only just over one year's trading to its name and a loss making
revenue of under $1.4m. The result of all this activity was a market
capitalisation of over $1bn.

Yahoo is primarily an Internet-based search engine and directory
service for a medium which is notoriously large, unstable and therefore
difficult to quantify and record accurately. It has since been imitated
by several other products and recently lost its premier place in the
Netscape Web site as other competitors began eating into its market.
This competition together with an unknown potential to gain advertising
revenue has not deterred visitors who seem more impressed by the six
million hits per day which the service claims.

LYCOS RECORDS GROWTH IN VIEWING FIGURES

While much media attention has recently been given to the Yahoo
flotation, another company operating a search tool, Lycos, has also
been registering some strong gains.

Incorporated in June 1995, and with a market capitalisation of around
$250m this company has according to its president and CEO Robert Davis,
recently recorded up 4.5 million viewings per day from a figure of 6.5
million per month in mid-1995. The site now claims to have 100 separate
organisations advertising on it including Visa, Mastercard, Disney and
Hilton Hotels.

Advertising rates are levied on either a subject or general basis and
charges vary from $20,000 per million viewings to $50,000 per million
viewings.

Lycos, which now licenses its search software to 18 companies including
AT&T and Microsoft, has according to Davis, revenues growing from $215m
in the first quarter of its current financial year to $825m in the
second quarter ending 31 January 1996. Its agreement to license
spidering technology to companies like InMagic for the burgeoning
Intranet market should see continued growth figures.

DATA TRANSMISSION, DATA COMPRESSION AND THE WEB

This article provides an explanation of some of the factors involved in
causing slow response times on the Internet and explores the technology
of data compression, which is perhaps the most promising avenue of
development in resolving these difficulties.

One of the thornier practical issues facing any organisation wishing to
distribute information over the Internet is the question of data
transmission rates. All too often, when trying to view a Web site,
information passes across the Internet so slowly that a page may take
several minutes to take shape on the user's monitor screen. This is
especially true where large quantities of graphical or textual
information have been built into the site being viewed, because of the
extra time taken to download this heavy content over the Internet.

When designing a Web site, a clear conflict exists between the wish to
provide complex, visually appealing information and the need to create
Web structures which will transmit across the Internet, page-by-page,
in acceptable time periods. The results of these conflicts are clear to
see across the Web. A year ago many Web sites boasted substantial,
graphically complex home pages, often with well over 200 kilobytes of
information. This graphically-rich approach was then carried through
the presentation of the whole site. By contrast, in second quarter
1996, most well-informed Web producers have cut back on the graphical
content of sites, using smaller graphical images to enhance the appeal
of Web pages without making them the fundamental building blocks of the
information. The perceived problems in this area are so severe that
many players are waiting to see what technical solutions may evolve,
before committing themselves to large scale online publishing activity
across the Internet.

Limitations on data transmission rates

It is often assumed that the speed with which data can be retrieved
across the Internet is basically tied to the speed of the access
available to the individual user. Thus the expectation is that a dial-
up user with a 9,600 bps (bit per second) modem will always find data
transfer vastly slower than someone using a state-of-the-art 28.8kbps
(28,800 bits per second) modem. Corporate users with 64kbps ISDN
connections, or Mbps leased line connections are seen as still better
off.

This is true to a certain extent. The average data transmission rate
achieved in a given Internet transaction will generally be partly
dependent on the speed of the final access stage. However, other
factors come into play. Because the Internet works by sharing the
available data transmission bandwidth (total amount of data
transmissable between two points over a given time) between all the
transactions occurring between any two points, the speed of
transmission achieved by any single transaction is dependent on the
weight of traffic competing for the same route.

Additionally, one must also take account of the loading on the server
(source-end computer) which is providing the information to be
retrieved. The busier the server, the slower its response to any given
request.

Add all these factors together and one can see some fairly surprising
results. So, for example, if a UK modem dial-up Internet user retrieves
a 10MB file from a server in the US, it would be quite common for the
average data transmission rate achieved across the whole transaction to
be only in the region of 1 to 1.5 kbps. This is well below the
theoretical transmission capability of the current state-of-the-art
modem, and would result in a total file transfer time in the order of
hours rather than seconds.

The major benefit of faster access is that when the rest of the system
does speed up, the faster device can achieve faster transient data
rates. This in turn achieves a higher average data transmission rate
over the course of one large transaction, or many smaller ones,
improving the overall efficiency of the system.

Data compression techniques

The data transmission efficiency of the Internet, and the Web in
particular, is dependent on a whole host of factors beyond the sheer
speed of connection operated by an individual user. Since this is true,
and as data transmission can be a tediously slow process over the
global networks, measures must be sought elsewhere which can increase
the overall efficiency of the system and individual transactions. High
on the list of technologies which may be adopted to this end is the
technique of data compression.

Most personal computer users will by now have encountered data
compression in some form. Utilities such as PKZIP or WINZIP have become
widely used in compressing software and textual information, so that
they may be transported more efficiently on disk, and many software
packages now require a fairly lengthy de-compression stage during their
first installation on a given computer. Such compression/de-compression
techniques can equally be applied to graphics files, which take up such
a large proportion of the time taken in retrieving Web pages from the
servers on which Web sites are mounted.

The benefits of using data compression in preparing information for
mounting on the Web are manifold, with gains across the whole Internet.
The Web now generates a substantial proportion of all Internet data
traffic. Any steps to reduce the file sizes, and thus the data
congestion across the system in total, make the whole experience of
Internet use more rewarding and more efficient. Equally, for an
individual organisation mounting a Web site, its users will be
generally far more comfortable in using the site when retrieving
compressed data.

Some commonly available compression technologies have the ability to
reduce graphics files down to between a tenth and a twentieth of their
original size, without perceptible loss of quality on screen when the
files are retrieved. Going back to our hypothetical 10MB file, this
would mean that the retrieval time involved in calling the file across
the Internet at our average data rate of 1.2kbps would be reduced to
minutes. Of course there is a small lag introduced because the client
computer receiving the compressed file has then to de-compress it,
which is a finite process. However, the de-compression period is
usually significantly less than the time saved in transmitting the file
across the Internet, meaning that all sides obtain benefit from the use
of compression.

Compression standards on the Internet

Of course there is one major rider to consider. Most compression
techniques require the attendant de-compression utility to be available
to the end-user. This is certainly true of the majority of graphics
compression techniques which may be applied to images for the Web. This
means that a Web site developer must either find the means to provide
each user of the site with the de-compression software for the
particular compression technique employed, or that a compression
technology must be selected which is already widely used across the
Internet.

Until recently, the Internet had adopted as a de facto standard for
graphic image file compression a technology known as the graphics
interchange format (GIF). So prevalent was the use of this technique
that the term GIF had become almost synonymous with the term graphical
image among Web users. GIF is a fairly straightforward compression
technique, designed specifically for use with network systems and for
the realtime transfer of graphics files. Its original developer was the
CompuServe commercial network service, and from there it spread widely
across the Internet. Most Web browser software utilities, up to the
present time, include a GIF reader to provide their standard image
processing capability.

But this useful and almost ubiquitous technology has come under threat,
because the core compression technology employed is under patents held
by its original developers, the Unisys company in the US. Unisys took
steps in late 1994 to enforce its patents, which in turn obliged
CompuServe to put in place a licensing system, requiring any new
software developer using GIF processes to pay royalties on their
application. The response of the Web community, and Internet software
developers, has been to work up a new compression standard, which is
seen as a full replacement for the GIF technology. This new compression
standard is known as the portable network graphic (PNG, pronounced
'ping'). The development of PNG has been undertaken by an international
group of developers under the wing of the World Wide Web Consortium,
W3C, based at MIT. W3C is the nearest thing there is to an overriding
authority controlling the protocols, standards and development of the
World Wide Web, although it has no formal powers.

PNG is still under development, but though still less prevalent than
GIF, is fairly commonly used by Web sites.

The three most commonly available graphics compression techniques on
the Internet are as follows:

- GIF - the Graphics Interchange Format developed by CompuServe;

- PNG - Portable Network Graphics format;

- JPEG - a graphics compression standard developed by an international
standards committee known as the Joint Photographic Experts Group
(universally known as 'Jaypeg'). JPEG techniques are now available as a
built-in feature of the Netscape Navigator Web browser, and are
becoming increasingly common as a means of reproducing graphical images
for Web applications.

Before going into any detailed comparison of these methodologies, it is
necessary briefly to explain the difference between 'lossless' and
'lossy' compression techniques. Lossless compression (as in GIF and PNG
methods) essentially defines the full image when it is compressed, in
such a way that repeated cycles of compression and de-compression
produce an identical image each time.

In lossy compression, the essential concept is that, for reproduction
on a computer screen, or using a colour printer, the amount of detail
available in any given electronic image file is actually greater than
the human eye can resolve. Techniques have been developed such that
information can be discarded during compression, and still leave the
image of a sufficient quality to appear identical to human vision, when
it is de-compressed. Detailed pixel-by-pixel (a pixel being the
smallest indivisible element in the image) analysis would reveal that
some of the pixels in the image have been changed, typically by some
form of averaging process, so that the detailed definition of the image
is significantly reduced by such compression/de-compression methods.
The benefit of this approach (as used by JPEG) is that substantially
higher compression ratios may be obtained from the same original data,
by comparison with lossless compression. However, repeated cycles of
compression and de-compression will result in substantial deterioration
of the image quality.

Features desirable in image handling

In presenting images on the Web, and allowing them to be downloaded by
Web users, a certain number of features are sought from the software
employed:

1. Streamability - the technique employed should allow for the image to
be transmitted serially (that is bit-by-bit) across a network;

2. Progressive display - the image being retrieved by the client
browser software is progressively built up on the monitor screen,
either section-by-section, or as a progressively more detailed picture
across the whole area of the image;

3. Transparency - the ability to define one colour within the original
image, or some defined portion of the image, as transparent. This
enables the image to be placed against a background of differing colour
in such a way that the background colour replaces the desired portion
of the original image;

4. The ability to store ancillary information, such as non-printing
text, within the data structure of the compressed file;

5. Hardware and software independent operation;

6. Lossless compression, for preference, since many applications of
graphics transfer over computer networks may require images to be open
to examination by computer systems, rather than just by the naked eye,
or to be employed in processes such as print origination;

7. The ability to handle colour palettes employed in typical personal
computer monitor and software systems, such as the 256 colour palette
devised for early versions of Windows.

Both GIF and PNG standards offer all these features, but PNG has a
number of other advantages.

It also handles truecolour images - those which employ a colour-
blending process to generate the areas of each colour across the image,
rather than a defined colour palette, and a more sophisticated
grayscale process.

It offers a system called the alpha channel, allowing transparency to
be defined across the full image, rather than for a particular single
colour from a palette, or particular part of the image. And gamma
correction is provided, allowing the image intensity to be adjusted
according to the likely application to which the image will be devoted.
More sophisticated error correction techniques are also found in PNG as
is faster building of initial elements in the progressive display of
the image across network links. Unlike GIF, PNG is now designed to be
an open standard without legal obligation to pay royalties or licence
fees to its developers.

By comparison, JPEG is not designed to offer the same spread of
functionality as either the GIF or PNG standards. The compression
technique devised for the JPEG standard was seen as providing a first-
rate means of processing truecolour photographic material, and complex
hand-drawn artwork, along with more complex, naturalistic halftone
images. JPEG is not well adapted for use with text, simple line art
drawings or any other simple outline material.

When used with the type of image for which it was designed, however,
JPEG compression is a very effective tool, achieving compression ratios
of up to 20:1, with no perceptible loss of quality when the image is de-
compressed for on-screen viewing. Use of GIF on the same image would
obtain something in the region of 3:1 compression, or perhaps a little
better. With an image containing constant variations in colour, JPEG
would also produce a more realistic image on de-compression, whereas a
GIF de-compressed may show noticeable banding effects through its
failure to define colour change graduations adequately. JPEG has
another benefit, in that it is possible, in compressing an image for
presentation as part of a Web site, for example, to offset the quality
required in the application against the degree of compression applied.
Thus, if only a very low resolution is required in the final image, on
screen, compression ratios of up to 100:1 are available. If very high
resolution is required, by contrast, then compression may be limited to
much lower ratios. This helps to make JPEG a very flexible tool for the
Web developer.

The major downfall of JPEG on the Internet is that it is much less
widely-integrated into the software utilities, such as Web browsers,
which are used to 'unpack' images from their servers on the system.
Many highly effective JPEG viewers and utilities are available, even in
the freeware domain. However, other than Netscape and a few others,
most of the fundamental Internet tools require such JPEG viewers to be
configured separately, making the standard rather more clumsy for the
average Web or Internet user than GIF.

It should be borne in mind, however, that this position is not likely
to be static. There is increasing pressure within the Internet
community to greatly enhance the ability of the Internet to handle
transfers of graphical, audio and video information, and the more
advanced compression techniques are likely to be increasingly adopted
as part of the means to achieve this.

The future of online image handling

All the techniques described so far essentially employ similar
mathematical processes to achieve their compression effects. These rely
on re-defining the image, pixel-by-pixel, so as to reduce the amount of
data required to construct the image on screen on de-compression. Since
early 1996, a company called Iterated Systems has been making a wholly-
different compression/de-compression technology available to Internet
users. This may offer significant benefits in performance in comparison
with currently popular techniques, with the added advantage that
essentially the same technology can be adapted to process audio and
video data streams.

Iterated Systems, founded in 1987, has developed a compression
technology based in the use of advanced mathematical processes known as
fractal transforms. Data is compressed by identifying such formulae to
define recurring elements in the image, so that large areas of
repeating data can be replaced with the fractal definition, together
with codes to define position, colour, intensity and other necessary
parameters. Iterated is so confident of the quality of its technology
that it has publicly stated the goal of making its system the de facto
standard on the Internet, and in any other TCP/IP network systems, such
as corporate internal information networks (Intranets).

Fractal compression has already been widely adopted as a means of
efficient image storage and retrieval in CD-ROM applications. Among the
users in this environment have been Microsoft, in handling the 7,000
images in its Encarta encyclopedia along with other multimedia
encyclopedia developers such as Hutchinson and Grolier.

A typical fractal compression process would reduce a 2MB file to a
compressed form of about 40kB in size, representing a compression ratio
of approximately 50:1. According to Iterated, this would be comparable
in quality on de-compression with a JPEG file produced with a far lower
compression ratio. Hence the fractal technique potentially offers far
greater data transmission benefits and efficiency benefits, while
offering at least equivalent image quality to other methods, and some
interesting additional features.

By contrast with GIF and PNG, fractal image files (FIFs) load
differently when retrieved over a network. Instead of gradually
appearing in increasingly higher definition across the whole ultimate
area of the image, a FIF will appear first as a thumbnail-sized version
of the full image, at full definition, clearly showing the nature of
the image from the start. It will then gradually expand up to the full
size defined by the creator of the Web page. Additionally the file,
once retrieved, can be handled in a more versatile manner than de-
compressed files from other technologies. It is possible, for example,
to zoom into given areas of a FIF at much higher ratios than is
possible with a comparable JPEG image, without the blocky quality
introduced by the pixel-to-pixel boundaries in conventional images. It
is also readily possible to vary the colour depth of the image both
upwards and downwards after retrieval.

Iterated Systems has released as freeware a utility called Fractal
Viewer, which can be downloaded free of charge from its Web site. This
allows users to retrieve and de-compress FIFs from the Internet.
Fractal Viewer can be added as a plug-in to Netscape Navigator, the
popular Web browser, so that Netscape is able to retrieve FIFs
seamlessly from Web sites. At the same time the company has made
available a utility called CoolFusion, which handles video and audio
material in a similar fashion. This is also freeware and also able to
be integrated with the Netscape Navigator. For developers, an image
processing tool called Fractal Image is available commercially, along
with a shareware developers' kit.

CoolFusion is perhaps the most exciting of these tools. At present it
is not possible to comment on its effectiveness, since Iterated has yet
to release any fractal-compressed video material for evaluation.
However, if the levels of data compression predicted can be achieved,
then the technology of realtime video transmission over the Internet
may be brought a large step forward. Iterated's people currently talk
in terms of achieving realtime colour video transmission at data
transmission rates suitable for modem transmission. This currently
remains well beyond the scope of the most widely-used video compression
tools on the market - either MPEG (for Motion Picture Experts Group), a
distant cousin of JPEG, or Apple's QuickTime technology.

A key tool for the future of the Web

Until such a time as the whole Internet can guarantee data rates in the
64kbps range for every individual transaction, at least for Web
applications, compression technology offers the most promising route
for development of advanced data delivery systems such as sophisticated
graphics, voice telephony and full-motion video in realtime. Since the
timescale for the achievement of widespread high-bandwidth connectivity
is probably in years rather than months, it can be seen that any
organisation looking to be involved in sophisticated Web information
distribution should be fully conversant with the most appropriate
compression technologies available for its purposes. This article has
set out some of the current techniques, and pointed to one promising
area of development. It is likely that Internet for Business will
return to this theme frequently in future issues.

HOME OR AWAY - THE WEB SITE DILEMMA

A crucial decision facing any organisation planning to establish its
own information service, or site, on the World Wide Web is whether or
not to invest in the equipment, software and human resources necessary
to manage such a system in-house. The alternative, of placing the site
on a remote server, managed by a hosting service, may appear at first
sight to have disadvantages in loss of control, and to require payments
which have no capital benefit to the site developer. However, on closer
scrutiny, the matter is not so straightforward.

The costs involved in setting up a Web site on an in-house, managed
basis are likely to be in the order of #10,000 to #15,000 for hardware
and software alone, even at the entry level. To this must be added the
necessary Internet access, rental of which from a service provider will
be in a similar order to the hardware and software costs, in the first
year of operation.

If a full-time Web site operator is employed (traditionally known
somewhat onesidedly as a Webmaster), then a further outgoing in excess
of #20,000 per year should be envisaged. This leaves aside any question
of investing in security or firewall software, to protect the site from
unauthorised intrusion or attempts to use it as a means to break into
the organisation's network, if any.

In return for such investment, a Web site publisher will gain total
control over the site, including its efficiency of operation and
maintenance, the regularity of updating, and the types of access
allowed to one or more different categories of user. If the site is
connected to the internal LAN it will also be possible to use it as the
server for an Intranet, an information service for the organisation's
staff, using World Wide Web software and interfaces.

Hosting a Web site

However, the level of investment indicated above may seem a large jump
for any organisation, particularly among small businesses, if coming to
the Internet or Web for the first time. The alternative, which has
become increasingly popular in recent times, is to establish a Web
site, but to have it hosted on a remote computer, managed by, and
installed at the premises of a service company.

In this case, the owner of the site can still take direct control of
the appearance, content and functionality of the Web site, even
downloading updated direct on to the server by using a remote Internet
connection. However, the hosting organisation will take responsibility
for the Internet access required by the site, monitoring and
maintaining the function of the site, backing up its contents and
supervising the hardware. Equally, they will incur the capital costs
for the equipment and services needed.

The costs involved in this process are often extremely reasonable. A
typical service of this nature in the UK is offered by Cambridge-based
Internet systems integrators, Electric Mail. This company offers two
levels of Web hosting service, WebSpace and WebSpace Light. WebSpace is
the top-level service, offering users the ability to operate a Web site
on Electric Mail's servers, with its own discrete address (known in the
Internet field as a URL - Uniform Resource Locator). The basis charges
for this service would amount to approximately #1,000 over the first
year of operation, and somewhat less per year thereafter. WebSpace
Light, which registers an organisation's Web site as a sub-section
(known as sub-domain) of Electric Mail's own Web site, is available for
less than #200 per year.

Hosting in the UK and abroad

Most of the UK's leading Internet service providers will offer similar
hosting services, among them companies such as Unipalm Pipex and
PSINet. Similarly the same services are often available from Web
production companies such as London-based Webmedia. An identical
picture is seen, for example, in the US, where leading service
providers Netcom and UUNet offer identical or similar services. Very
often the detailed arrangements for Web site hosting are published by
these companies on their own Web sites, including scales of charges
levied.

The cost/benefit equation in establishing a Web site may well be tipped
heavily towards the outsourcing option, especially for smaller
companies or those embarking on experimental use of the Web. In-house
operation really only makes sense if a major site is contemplated,
fully-integrated with other information services operated by an
organisation, and requiring constant updating and supervision from the
organisation's own staff.

Web hosting services are readily available in the UK and the US, and
this is equally true across all the countries where commercial Internet
activity is gaining acceptance. Anyone contemplating creating a Web
site, whether commercially-orientated or otherwise, is well-advised to
give this option serious thought.

INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATIONS - THE INTERNET LEAP FORWARD

Out of the many disparate strands which are slowly emerging from the
commercial development and harnessing of the Internet, two levels of
practical and creative thinking may be isolated. One is the tendency
simply to take existing methods of communication and presentation of
information from media such as television and the printed word, and to
transfer them with little adjustment into Internet contexts such as the
Web.

Meanwhile more imaginative and possibly more risk-oriented developers
and implementers search for new information models which operate to
obtain the maximum return from the particular strengths of the Internet
medium. The momentum towards this latter approach is slowly building,
and numbers of companies are developing software which takes this style
away from a few informed insiders and into the field of systematic
application of available tools.

In truth the differentiation between the more conservative application
of traditional media approaches, and the exploration of new
communications paradigms, is rather to be seen as a spectrum between
two extremes, and not as a pair of incompatible options. Some
traditional media techniques work effectively over the Internet, after
all. However, as with the evolution of television or radio
broadcasting, the development of commercial communications over the
Web, for example, will assuredly tend towards new models which are most
effective in harnessing the medium. Insiders generally feel that this
process will take place far more rapidly than has been the case in
previous generations of media.

What then are the strengths identifiable for the Web, which perhaps
best exemplifies the Internet as a tool for interactive communications
between groups and individuals with commercial goals in view? It would
be rash to attempt to create an exhaustive list at this early stage in
the growth of the medium. However, a number of elements are already
clear:

1. Flexibility - one Web site, with suitable control over categories of
access, can serve a range of different audiences, such as company
staff, shareholders, customers, collaborators, distributors, the press,
government and official regulators and many more;

2. Adaptability - information on a Web site is open to frequent update
and focusing at relatively low cost, by comparison with traditional
methods such as printing.

3. Interactivity - properly configured, a Web site can allow a truly
balanced, two-way communication process, whereby various audiences can
receive messages from the site owner and respond with similar force and
precision. It is also possible to allow mutual interaction between the
various audiences which the site may address - between customers and
distributors, for example;

4. Immediacy - information can be uniquely tailored to the needs of
very narrowly-focused groups, and updated to match their changing
responses.

Up to second quarter 1996, many organisations which have launched Web
sites have failed to go beyond the creation of electronic billboards.
Information presented is essentially sales driven, relatively static
and offers little opportunity for users of sites to communicate or
interact. Web users in general tend not to respond positively to such
ponderous content, preferring to spend their time in surfing sites
which are far more active, interactive and fast-moving.

Some of the tools which allow companies to build such interest into Web
sites include:

1. Database interfacing software - allowing site visitors to search
company information relevant to their needs, and access the search
results through their own Web browser interface. These tools create
HTML pages dynamically according to the search results for the user,
meaning that the underlying database may be left in its natural
database environment, rather than being converted into HTML in total.

2. Intelligent agents - utilities which allow users to specify, once
and for all or on an ever-changing basis, a range of information types
from within a site's resources which are particularly relevant to their
interests or needs. The agent then delivers the relevant information as
a selection from the total content of the site (an interesting current
example is the Personal Times, the interactive version of The Times of
London, where users may define an information profile to confirm the
material from the overall structure of the newspaper which they wish to
see each day.)

3. Online forms - tools structured into the HTML mark-up of Web pages
to allow users to send information back to the Web site owner for
future reference.

4. Interactive offline discussion groups and online chat groups.
Increasingly used in sites relating to consumer marketing, especially,
these services allow communication, with or without some form of
moderation by the site owner, between users of the site, whether within
a particular group, such as current customers, or across groups, so
that, for example, customers are able to communicate with distributors,
retailers, or other groups using the site.

5. Online ordering and payment structures - the basic building blocks
of genuine online commerce.

6. Multimedia data-delivery software - allowing the presentation of
information through a Web site in audio, video and 3D forms.

Web communications defined

One of the terms heard with increasing frequency in this field of Web
communications is the word 'Pointcasting'. The major strength of
established media such as newspapers, radio and television has been
broadcasting, the distribution of one fixed message, or a small range
of fixed alternatives, to a large audience with defined commonalities
of interests. The Web moves away from this model to give the marketing
or corporate communications strategist a whole new toolkit.
Pointcasting is seen as the process of establishing messages which are
valid to individuals or small discrete interest groups of relevance to
the site owner, and the updating of these messages to continue their
relevance to those targets over time. Pointcasting relies on the
harnessing of tools such as those outlined in the previous paragraph,
to ensure that two-way communication is established between a Web site
creator and the individual users, at a constantly relevant and fruitful
level.

One company which has begun to create software applications which are
designed to address this technique in a simple, managed software
environment, is Silicon Valley start up BroadVision. Preferring to use
the term one-to-one marketing, rather than pointcasting, since its
offering focuses in the business development side of these new Web
techniques, BroadVision has launched a suite of software which will
underpin the development of these focused, interactive techniques in
the commercial Web environment. Called Broad-Vision One-to-One (tm),
this is a software system which is designed to manage the entire
marketing and selling life cycle on the Web. Four areas of
functionality are offered;

1. Community - the provision of dynamic information relevant to users,
not always focused directly on the site owners' products and services.
Interactive communication between users of the site is also delivered,
where appropriate. This aspect of the software is designed to build a
community of users, and deliver intrinsic benefits to them within the
structure of the site, encouraging their repeated use of the
information.

2. Profiling - data tracking utilities which allow the site owner to
form detailed knowledge of each individual relevant to the products and
services dealt with by the site. This will, for example, remember all
the transactions entered into by a given user, giving the site owner
useful profile details for design of further interaction with that
user.

3. Targeting - intelligent-agent style functions, allowing the sites
content to be delivered to individual users in a fashion which best
serves their short-term and long-term needs.

4. Transaction processing - electronic ordering and sales, customer
services, EDI, reporting etc.

This methodology bears comparison with traditional direct sales
techniques. Leading exponents of catalogue selling, for example, have
long improved their sales performance by maintaining extensive database
information regarding the tastes and buying habits of customers.
However, the Web is more powerful still, since it allows the marketing
professional to interact more frequently with a wider range of
audiences, and to develop a more detailed understanding of the needs
and wants of the individuals and companies' which buy their goods and
services.

Software such as that provided by BroadVision, which is one of a number
of providers in this field, allows non-technical staff of companies
seeking to harness Internet marketing techniques to have direct control
of the strategy and information content of the process. Such tools
promise to have a similar revolutionary effect in the Internet field as
did desktop publishing software in the print-on-paper communications
process. Once they are well-established, the whole process of marketing
on the Internet should be moved up a notch in terms of accessibility
and effectiveness.

SMALL BUSINESSES RELUCTANT TO JOIN WEB

O'Reilly Associates have published the results of their recent survey
Conducting business on the Internet. The full results are available for
purchase by contacting their Web site at www.ora.com.

The companies surveyed were drawn from the Dun and Bradstreet database
and divided into large, medium and small organisations. The response
rates upon which the results were collected were 410, 406 and 214
respectively. Large companies were classified as those with more than
1,000 employees, medium-sized companies with 101 to 1,000 employees and
small companies with less than 100 employees.

While the results indicated that 51% of large companies in North
America currently use the Internet, only 8% of small companies take
advantage of the network, and while a surprising 28% of large companies
plan no Internet access in the near future, this figure rises to 53%
for medium-sized and 79% for small companies.

Intranet activity was also monitored with 37% of large companies having
at least one internal Web site while external Web site activity was
registered with 35% of large companies.

PATTERNS OF DEVELOPMENT FOR THE WORLD WIDE WEB

Latest figures from two of the world's leading research groups in the
high technology sector shed further light on the development of the
Web, and on the use of software designed to support access and
searching across this global data structure. Data released reveals the
continuing explosive growth of the Web as a means of publishing and
accessing data, and identifies clear winners and losers, up to the
present date, in the battle for dominance in software development for
Web browsers.

According to figures published by the International Data Corporation,
the total number of users of the Web, across all sectors, will reach
some 30 million or more during 1996 up from under 10 million in 1995.
These numbers are projected to reach well in excess of 120 million by
the close of the decade. In parallel with this growth, a shift in the
balance of the Web is forecast by IDC, with the percentage of Web users
worldwide being located in the US falling from nearly 80% in 1995 to
little over 50% at the end of 1999.

IDC's fellow research group Dataquest took advantage of the opportunity
provided by the Internet World show to announce a new service providing
market insights over the Internet delivered through the World Wide Web.
The service, entitled DQi (Dataquest Interactive), will offer high-
value quantitative analysis and news on the IT industry (the site
address is: http://www.dataquest.com). Of special interest to Internet
industry analysts during the Internet World event was a new breakdown,
published by DQi, of the use of various types of Web browser software
across the Internet sector. Statistics compiled by Dataquest were
obtained by monitoring the traffic on a wide range of Web sites which
publish statistics on numbers of accesses and the type of browser used
by each visitor to the site.

Using this basis for statistical analysis, Dataquest concludes that the
Netscape Navigator Web browser, in all its versions, remains the most
popular among Web users, with some 84% of all Web traffic being
generated by this browser. Netscape's nearest competitor in the Web
browser market is now the Microsoft Internet Explorer, which has just
7% of this market, although its user base is among the fastest growing
of all the Netscape alternatives. Other browsers listed include the
proprietary browser of America Online, with 3% of the market, and NCSA
Mosaic, the original graphical Web browser, whose various versions take
1% of the market. The remaining competitors take a further 5% between
them. Among this latter group, and with the highest growth rate of all,
is the Sun Microsystems Hot Java browser, developed to feature Sun's
Java online interactive programming environment.

Dataquest will continue to track the browser competition, and many
other measures of the Internet and computing sector, publishing regular
updates on the Web site launched at Internet World.

VIDEO NETWORKING TAKES A STEP FORWARD

General Instrument Corporation, a technology integrator for interactive
voice, video and data delivery over computer networks, announced a new
initiative in video-enriched interactive services in early May. GI, a
US-based multinational, is launching a programme known as Videoware
Innovation Partners, to establish key collaborations with other players
in the networking field for the delivery of its Videoware video-rich
data service over broadband networks. The GI system, in collaboration
with its VI Partners, will allow network operators to deploy a high-
speed turnkey system integrating hardware, network management, Internet
and intranet access and multimedia services.

Initially GI is concentrating on delivering services over its
proprietary SURFboard network, an end-to-end system delivering video
and data at 27Mbps to PCs equipped with its SURFboard adaptor cards.
This network structure depends on cable outward links, with a standard
telephone return path. Hence the return data feed operates at
narrowband data rates only. Nonetheless, the company's solution is one
which may be implemented immediately, over existing cable networks. GI
plans to launch a two-way broadband system, harnessing Asynchronous
Transfer Mode switching, based on the use of existing cable
infrastructure for both outward and return information.

Partners in the Videoware Innovation programme include America Online,
CompuServe, Dorling Kindersley Multimedia, Macromedia, Paramount
Pictures, Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems and Turner Broadcasting
System.

-DIFFICULT YEAR AHEAD FOR ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDERS

INTERNET BUSINESS NEWS-DIFFICULT YEAR AHEAD FOR
ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDERS
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

New research from TFPL says that 1996 is going to be
a difficult year for the new online service providers
who are expecting to cash in on the European service
market.  The study compares the European market model
to the USA and notes that the main US services such
as CompuServe, America Online and Prodigy have had
subscriber loyalty before the widespread use of the
Internet whereas in Europe service providers face
competition from the Internet as wekk as from free
public teletext services, videotex services and
localised online services.  Martin White, managing
consultant at TPFL, said: "Companies are tying to
take advantage of the rapidly growing installed base
of PCs in both the business and consumer markets
without fully understanding cultural issues about
information use. You only have to look at the way in
which the newspaper industry differs in each country
to see one example of the way in which online
services will have to adapt to each national market.
-- the evidence from the French Teletel services is
that users are more inclined to use the services for
transactions, rather than just for information."

INTERNET BUSINESS NEWS-DIGITAL INTRODUCES INTERNET
RESCUE SERVICE
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Digital Equipment Corp's Multivendor Customer
Services business unit has introduced a new service
aimed at Internet users called the PC Rescue Service.
Subscribers will be given access to a dedicated
hotline where technicians will solve any Netscape or
Mosaic Internet access problems and any PC hardware,
software or peripheral problem for any major brand of
PC hardware and software, irrespective of what system
and network operating system used.  David Allen,
marketing director of Digital's MCS unit, said: "In
our most recent research we discovered that more than
one in four people had difficulties in learning to
use and understand computers -- many of these have
bought a PC to access the Internet. Fourteen percent
of people have also experienced major breakdowns and
systems crashes -- which proves the industry still
needs to provide comprehensive support and rescue
services like PC rescue, if we are going to continue
to have a satisfied and rapidly growing Internet user
community." Yearly subscription costs are GBP117.50
with calls charged at GBP20 per incident. Members who
join before March 1996, will receive 5 free calls -
making membership almost free.

INTERNET BUSINESS NEWS-CABLE ONLINE GOES FOR UK
 CABLE CO' NET SERVICE
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Yet another new Internet service provider has gone
online, although this company claims to have a
different unique selling proposition to the rest.
Cable Online, a business unit of cable TV and
telephony service vendors CableTel, is planning to
leverage its business contacts within the cable
sector to provide Internet services over the regular
PSTN and cable phone networks around the UK.  The
company is confident of success and has claimed it
will be the number one Internet provider by the end
of 1997 with the key being its massive supply of
bandwidth, access points, scalable system and
support. Philip John, managing director of Cable
Online said: "In partnership with CableTel, we have
put our considerable telecomms resources and
expertise behind the service and placed great
emphasis on customer care.  We're confident that
disgruntled customers will move to us from other
service providers and that we will also attract a
healthy number of 'newbies'." Untimed service will be
charged at GBP12.95/month for dial-up access and free
technical support is offered on a toll-free number. A
number of local call points of presence are set to be
introduced with 90% UK local call penetration by mid-1996.
ISDN and leased line services are also being
offered although pricing information has yet to be
released.

INTERNET BUSINESS NEWS-MICROSOFT FACES HOSTILE
EUROPEAN RECEPTION AFTER EURO ONLINE VENDORS ALIGN
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Microsoft Corp's presently lacklustre plans to move
in the European online communications market with its
Microsoft Network seems to have been hit for six
after Germany's biggest media and telecommunications
companies joined forces with the world's largest
online services company to head off Microsoft.
Deutsche Telekom AG, Bertelsmann AG, Axel Springer
Verlag and America Online have signed letters of
intent to cooperate in online service provision and
operation. While not everything is yet cut and dry as
the proposal will require tight scrutiny from
Europe's competition watchdog, many observers point
out that the EU is likely to be favourable to the
deal in view of the threat from Microsoft Corp. 
While Internet service providers around Europe will
be marginally affected by the service, the new group
plans to introduce mainly content-based services,
placing it in direct competition with Microsoft's
Microsoft Network and CompuServe.  A complex range of
stock swapping is set to take place between the
partners to strengthen the deal. Possibly to placate
the watchdogs, the companies have stated that they
have no immediate intention to merge their own
extensive individual online services into one unit --
although of course they have denied to rule this out
as an option. Microsoft was also slated in a research
report note from Goldman Sachs claims that failure by
Microsoft to  articulate an Internet strategy' could
 ...weigh heavily on investors.' Goldman Sachs & Co.
cut its rating on the software giant.  Goldman has
removed Microsoft from its recommended list for top-rated stocks
and cut its rating from buy to moderate
outperformer. It is understood that the analyst cut
the stock because of Microsoft's failure to develop a
compelling Internet strategy which could dampen
upward movement in the stock during the next six
months, noting the expectation of an important
Internet strategy announcements from Microsoft in
about six months. Separately Microsoft has announced
that it has released the beta version of its
Microsoft Internet Information Server for Windows NT
-- more commonly known as Gibraltar -- to around
1,000 test sites worldwide and a second beta phase to
15,000 sites before a 1Q'96 launch.

The company is offering a taster to its service

service will be priced at GBP9.99 per month for five
hours and GBP.04p/minute thereafter.

European retailers are failing to take advantage of
the real potential advantages of Internet-based
retail services such as remote shopping, promotions
and customer awareness, according to research carried
out by Cap Gemini Sogeti/Hoskyns. The survey polled
46 of the top 200 retailers across Europe, noting
that while 90% are already connected on to the
Internet or seriously considering its benefits, use
of the Internet differs between retail sectors. The
fashion industry, for example, is failing to see the
benefits while mail order and wholesale ventures are
booming. Marc Peters, retail sector manager at
Hoskyns, said that despite the perceived advances,
retailers are not yet utilising the full potential of
the Internet and that current interest is mainly
exploratory.  Most of the companies who are trialing
the Internet have low expectations, with half-percent
of turnover being the expected rate of return within
two years and four percent over 10 years.  The survey
polled users on the main perceived barriers to net
trading with too few users topping the list at 59%
followed by Internet users are not the target markets
(57%), concerns over financial security (43%) and
lack of delivery infrastructure (39%). Separately,
telecommunications companies are failing to make the
most of the Internet's WWW despite being at the
forefront of most technical developments -- that is
the claim of a new survey conducted for Wollongong
Group. Wollongong polled 300 businesses and
discovered it was only the IT industry sector which
sees real commercial benefits from the Internet's
WWW. The survey, when split into industry sectors,
noted that while 30% of respondents were from IT
firms, only 8% where from telecommunications-related
companies.

ELECTRONIC MAIL ACCESS
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

A call has been made by the Rand Corp in a new study
for all Americans to be given equal access to
electronic mail. Rand says that private and
government policy makers should work together to
bring all Americans -- irrespective of income -- onto
the information superhighway, enabling them to reap
the considerable benefits over time.  Rand highlights
what it says is a growing number of  information
elite' parties which is made up of well-off
individuals with access to computers that can
transmit and receive e-mail.  According to Rand: "As
e-mail becomes more pervasive, as more commercial and
government transactions in the United States take
place online, those information haves may leave the
have-nots further behind, unless we make concerted
efforts today to provide all citizens with access to
the technology."  Amongst the ideas passed by Rand
for getting the less well-off onto e-mail are
recycling of old (lower specification) computers and
associated software should be readily encouraged
along with the proliferation of public access
terminals, possible operating in the same vein as a
payphone.

OF INTERNET FOR BUSINESS USERS
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Corporate security staff are still concerned over the
use of the Internet for commercial purposes,
according to the third annual Ernst & Young
Information Security Survey.  Over half of the US
firms polled reported security-related financial
losses in the past year with 20 companies reporting
losses in excess of US$1m.  Out of the firms who had
grasped the nettle and gone online, 20% reported that
an intruder had successfully or nearly successfully
breached security systems.  The overall level of
Internet security came under fire from 40% of users
who said they were dissatisfied with the inherent net
security and 87% of firms said that they would make
greater use of the Internet for corporate purposes if
the security was improved. Candidly, most companies
admitted that they do not have adequate tools or
properly trained personnel to defend against
information security losses. The report surveyed
1,300 chief information officers and other senior
information executives. Other interesting findings
included that over 66% of sites encountered a
computer virus in the past year, a rise in the number
of security precautions taken and greater
introduction of security tools. Ernst & Young has
also reported that one out of every five companies
connected to the Internet has reported an attempted
or a successful break-in to their company's network
in the past year and that 65% of firms gave been
affected by a computer virus. A financial loss was
only experienced in a  small portion' of companies
hit by intruders of all kinds. Ernst & Young said
that 66% of its respondents who are not using the
Internet now and 83% of respondents who plan to
within the next year, said they would use the
Internet for more business purposes if security was
enhanced.

detect and investigate.  Det. Ch. Insp Barry Drew
singled out the PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) package as
the leading cryptographic package which is being used
perfectly innocently by millions of users worldwide
and abused by paedophiles looking at continuing their
sick trade. "Some people are sending porn down the
Internet together with the instructions as to how to
use encryption to safeguard yourself. You need to
know the key to unscramble it. It's being used more
and more extensively for all sorts of things," said
Drew, head of the National Criminal Intelligence

for subsequent use.  Dan Metcalfe, managing director
of LAN Software Direct claims that network and IT
administrators have been calling for such a service
for a long time even though most of the information
can already be found on the Internet and online
services such as CompuServe. "Network administrators
have been demanding a service like LAN Software
Direct for some time.  Networks are growing in size
and complexity but management resources remain
static.  Administrators need products which will
automatically manage certain elements of the network
and at the same time boost LAN  productivity. Most
managers do not have the time to research and test
the hundreds of software management products on the
market," said Metcalfe.

LEADERSHIP IN INTERNET FAX SERVICE OFFERINGS
COPYRIGHT 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

AlphaNet Telecom Inc of Canada is buoyant about its
expectations of becoming the world's leading provider
of voice and fax Internet services by the end of 1996
through the launch of its Unipost and EconoFax
services.  Much of the confidence comes in the shape
of patents for the technology held in the USA, Canada
and several other key countries. Michael Reichmann,
president of the firm, believes that the Internet
transmission technology patents will make the company
hold a powerful position.  Unipost and EconoFax will
allow users to access and send all their voice, fax
and electronic-mail messages over the Internet for
the cost of a local telephone call, providing
dramatic savings for the users notes the company. A
number of partners will be announced in the near
future in different strategic areas around the world
although further details are presently not known.

The use of online services has given a much-needed
breather lifeline to researchers, reports the
Chronicle of Higher Education in its 17 November
issue, as work which is published online before it
comes out in print can trim valuable weeks off the
one-year limitation they have if they wish to file a
patent on their findings. The Internet's WWW is also
used in order to promote the findings and keep the
patent clock at bay. While, according to the article,
the US Patent and Trademark office hasn't issued a
ruling on electronic disclosure, a spokesman says
patent lawyers should assume that anything that's
available online should be considered published.

INTERNET BUSINESS NEWS-STUDENT CHARGED WITH INTERNET
TERRORISM
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

A New York state college student has been charged
with terrorizing an Indianapolis family over the
Internet by threatening in e-mail messages to hunt
them down, rape a 12-year-old girl and kill them. The
19-year-old alleged perpetrator has been arrested at
St John's University and charged with aggravated
harassment -- a misdemeanour offence.  It appears
that the activity was viewed as a prank by the
accused.  Court papers reveal that a user under the
alias  Mr Bungle' broke into a conversation that the
12-year-old was having on 21 October on  the Internet
with a 13-year-boy from Toronto and after a few
innocuous questions about age, the accused allegedly
wrote that he wanted to sodomize her. The father of
the young girl intervened online and ordered the
accused to desist, only to receive e-mail littered
with sexually offensive messages which escalated into
threats including claims that he had HIV and would
infect the girl. A hearing has yet to be made.

REALITY MAY CATCH UP TO HYPE THIS YEAR
Opportunities Abound, But So Does Competition and Consolidation

      Overall, growth in the Internet marketplace will not slow in
1996. 
      Net software firms will barrel into the new year fueled by
product introductions that will dominate the first half of the year.
Internet service providers will continue to expand their networks at a
breakneck pace, and new content providers will enter the marketplace
with ever richer multimedia content featuring 3-D, audio, and video.
      But despite the opportunities that such growth represents, the
Internet industry also will show signs of growing up this year. The
number of firms racing onto the Net will slow somewhat from 1995
levels as companies struggle to justify the expense of their sites. 
      Despite this slight slowdown, last year's hype about the Net
will continue to draw more competitors into the access and software
businesses, sharply increasing the amount of competition and leading
to an industry shakeout. Increased competition also will spark the
often-predicted access wars as Internet service providers vie with
telcos and cable firms to capture market share. Competition also will
inspire firms to consider introducing proprietary applications that
work with the Net's open systems to capture customers.

Will Open Standards Survive?

      Although the Net has always been based on open systems, the race
to get a competitive edge has encouraged firms to introduce and
implement new specifications long before standards bodies or other
industry members can evaluate them. Firms with sufficient marketing
muscle and innovative ideas have set de facto standards. To keep up,
others have begun incorporating the standards -- sometimes before the
specifications are even available to the public.
      "No one is waiting for final specifications to begin
incorporating new capabilities into their products," said Stratton
Sclavos, president of VeriSign. "We can adapt to final specifications;
we can't wait around for them to emerge."
      Since many firms -- most notably Netscape Communications Corp.
-- have benefitted from this practice, many plan to copy the strategy
in 1996 -- something that could lead to a confusing jumble of possible
standards introduced in 1996, warn industry experts. Inevitably, some
firms will back the wrong standards.
      But an even bigger threat to open systems are the increasing
number of application programming interfaces (APIs) that are popping
up. Offering an API encourages firms to adapt to a particular
technology that may or may not be open, said Gary Eichhorn, CEO of
Open Market.
      Many suspect that Microsoft Corp. will use that strategy to
capture a large portion of the Internet market, even though the firm
has pledged to use open standards. "I don't really see Microsoft
participating in the open systems, cross-platform environment," said
John Patrick, vice president of Internet technology for IBM. 
      Despite the fears, many major firms have renewed their
commitment to open standards, which should ensure that the openness of
the Net will survive at least another year.

Partner, Partner Everywhere

      The quickest way to get ahead in the Internet business is to
partner with -- or acquire -- a company with a promising technology.
As a result, partnerships will continue to drive much of the Internet
market in 1996, and mergers and acquisitions will be on the rise as
firms try to buy into the Internet market.
      "We expect to see a lot of mergers and acquisitions activity in
the market, and, of course, partnerships will continue to drive the
market," said Mary Pat McCarthy, partner and national director for
software and services practice at KPMG Peat Marwick. "There will be
some alliances you would never expect."
      IBM will actively seek partners for everything from simple
marketing agreements to possible technology acquisitions. "We want to
show how well we can work with others," said IBM's Patrick. Most other
major firms plan to pursue a similar strategy.

Consolidation Continues

      However, partnerships won't be enough to save some firms. Every
software firm in the country is expected to jump into the Internet
market with some product in 1996. Yet few have clear plans for how to
compete in the market or even in what products to develop. "Software
firms don't have a clear strategy and no one knows what it should be
doing on the Net," said KPMG's McCarthy. "Companies are vying for
positions and everyone is trying to cover their bets without knowing
what the successful strategy will be." 
      As a result, many firms could get burned. "I think there will be
continued consolidation in the software industry, and it will be
harder for small companies to survive unless they have a strong niche
or staying power," said McCarthy. "Large firms will continue to gobble
up small ones, and there will be a lot of jockeying in the Internet
and web arena."
      One of the main Internet software areas to take a hit will be
the browser market, predicted Laura Hanny, an analyst with First
Albany-META Technology Research. Hanny asserted that Netscape will
lose its market dominance in 1996 as other firm's browsers become more
widely available. The integration of browsers into software packages
as the ubiquitous client could further shake Netscape's leadership
position, she said. 
      However, that may not matter, since few firms will ever profit
from the sale of browsers. "Everyone agrees that browsers will become
commodities," explained Gaston Bastiaens, CEO of Quarterdeck.
      But the software market isn't the only one to face consolidation
in 1996, according to the Yankee Group. Internet service providers
(ISPs) also will feel the pinch as long distance firms, local telcos,
and cable firms begin to offer access (see related story on page 3).
The Yankee Group predicts that the number of ISPs will drop from
around 1,400 to 600 in 1996. In 1997, the firm predicts the number of
providers will plummet to less than 300.
      Content providers and service firms also will feel the pinch,
added Yankee Group analysts.
      In fact, the only firms that seem immune to consolidation are
the hardware and chip manufacturers. These businesses can expect to
see sales increase as demand rises for existing products and new
products -- such as so-called dumb terminals or browser boxes -- are
introduced.
      Quarterdeck's Bastiaens believes that the home computing market
will take off, boosting penetration from 37 percent of homes today to
65 percent by 1999. However, although growth will come from home
users, he asserted that the money will still come from corporate
markets.

IPO Mania

      But even a predicted industry consolidation won't be able to
dampen the financial market's enthusiasm for Internet stocks -- at
least not in the short term, said Hanny. Expect to see a rush of
Internet firms going public this year.
      "The market is a frenzied environment and it is very chaotic.
Many clients are talking about going public," said KPMG's McCarthy. 
      "Firms want to ride the craziness while it lasts and while they
can raise money," said Hanny. "We expect to see a lot of IPOs next
year."

Legal Troubles Brewing

      Experts also expect to see a lot of lawsuits next year. Several
cases, including Statton Oakmont vs. Prodigy and the Church of
Scientology vs. NETCOM (see Internet Week's May 29 and December 4
issues and a related brief on page 4), have set some precedents, and
attorneys expect that more lawsuits will be filed this year.
      In particular, copyright and trademark infringement suits are
likely to become more commonplace as firms struggle to protect
intellectual property on the Net, says Doug Wood, executive partner of
Hall Dickler Kent Friedman & Wood, a New York law firm. The number of
libel and slander cases also is expected to increase.
      Besides legal actions, 1996 will probably see some laws enacted
as well. Congress is unlikely to leave the Internet alone, and its
continued attempts to legislate privacy and pornography could cause
problems for many Internet firms. Also, the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC), which has already begun monitoring the Internet for deceptive
advertising claims, is expected to beef up its efforts in 1996 and
make Internet advertising a major priority, say FTC sources. Other
government agencies also will monitor web sites for infringement in
areas of their jurisdiction.

Uncovering Opportunity

      Despite potential legal tangles and industry consolidation, more
firms are expected to jump on the Net. New products, delivered in the
first half of 1996, will help these firms expand their web sites
beyond simple advertisements into real tools to expand sales and cut
costs while improving customer service. In short, experts believe that
the Internet industry will deliver solutions rather than just hype in
1996. These solutions will spell opportunity for many.
      "There remains a significant opportunity to help firms establish
a presence on the web -- especially in other countries around the
world," said IBM's Patrick. "Firms will realize that just having a
page or an ad on the Net is just the tip of the iceberg. Business
applications will be added, and more firms will bring Net technology
inside the network."
      As this takes place, companies will need to improve the way they
manage information -- opening the door for consultants and integrators
as well as software firms, added Patrick.
      Meanwhile, the often-hyped but little-shopped electronic
shopping malls also will become more popular in 1996, especially when
firms update their approaches and security solutions become more
widespread. "They are using models of the past, and it's not working.
Retailers need to rethink their approaches rather than just putting a
paper catalog online," said Hanny. The widespread introduction and
acceptance of electronic payment methods will further boost sales (see
related story on page 2). When tied into exchange systems, worldwide
commerce will begin to take off, with many sales going to Japan.
      With sales going global, many firms will rethink the way they
serve overseas markets, while others will rush to expand into Europe,
Asia, and Latin America. Already, ISPs have pushed into Europe,
followed by the online services and other content providers. Netscape
established several overseas offices in 1995, as did Quarterdeck. That
trend will continue as more firms expand overseas.
      While some firms expand geographically, others will concentrate
on increasing their market presence in the U.S. Experts believe that
an Internet industry marketing blitz is coming, goaded by increased
competition. Already Digital Equipment Corp. has begun running
Internet-related TV ads, while Net ad space in the Wall Street Journal
continues to fill several pages.
      Competition also will drive firms to differentiate their
products and services and hone their marketing messages. IBM plans to
emphasize its ability to deliver complete solutions, while Open Market
will tout the security options and other features of  its server
software. Targeting niches will continue to be popular.
      Other firms will seek new products to help differentiate
themselves. Quarterdeck has heavily invested in collaborative
computing solutions. Although the webification of Lotus Notes could
stunt some of the market potential, collaborative computing is
expected to be hot in 1996 and beyond.
      "Imagine being able to cut travel time and expenses by having
telephone conferences that cost next to nothing since you are using
the Internet," said Bastiaens. Quarterdeck plans to introduce its
voice conferencing and document sharing software in 1996.
      Also expected to debut in 1996 are the so-called browser boxes
or dumb terminals. Although the market is hot on the idea, VeriSign's
Sclavos cautions that encryption and other security solutions must be
incorporated for the technology to really become useful. Sclavos
expects encryption chips to emerge in the next 12-18 months that will
help add security to such "dumb" terminals, which could help drive
their popularity. 
      "I think browser boxes are a wonderful concept. In the next six
months, we expect to see demos showing how they will work, but I think
they may have problems meeting the price point without running into
power management and security issues," he said. "They will have to
have security for people to use them.
      "It will be noteworthy to see if $500 is a good cutoff point,"
said KPMG's McCarthy. "Is that too expensive with some people? I see
prices coming down. I also think the baseline computer price will go
down over time, offering competition for the boxes."
      Meanwhile, 1996 will see Java going beyond the simple,
animation-type applications that it is currently being used for to
power real business applications. Java applets will power more
interactive applications on the web and will enable firms to offer
valuable information and services. By the end of the year, most
browsers will support Java, and Java applications will become
commonplace, predicts IBM's Patrick. IBM licensed Java from Sun in
December.

SECURITY MARKET TO BOOM TO '96:  AUTHENTICATION, ENCRYPTION,
ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS WILL BE WIDELY DEPLOYED THIS YEAR

      Security breaches made headlines in 1995. In 1996, security
solutions will make inroads into everyday workings of business and
lives of consumers as encryption, digital signatures, and
authentication systems become ubiquitous in server and client software
packages, say industry executives and analysts.
      "1995 was a great year for security. [Security] went from being
talked about by cryptographers at security conferences to becoming a
common topic in financial and Internet conferences and talked about by
businesses," said Stratton Sclavos, president of VeriSign. "In 1996,
you will see security solutions moving from the realm of specification
debates and political jockeying about protocols to being actually
rolled out."
      Such widespread deployment of security solutions will accelerate
the acceptance of electronic commerce and make doing business online
more commonplace, predicted John Patrick, vice president of Internet
applications for IBM [IBM]. "In 1996, we will see the beginning of a
new level of trust and understanding about authentication and
encryption. This will bring the next major round of growth, fueling
major growth in electronic commerce," he said. 
      To help consumers become more comfortable with online
transactions, banks and credit card companies plan to launch an
education campaign in the spring. The campaign will encourage
consumers to shop and bank online and will assure them that security
standards (especially those proposed by Visa and MasterCard [4823Z])
will protect credit card numbers and other information.
      Meanwhile, software firms are expected to incorporate electronic
payment modules into both client and server software packages by
midyear. Initially, most will focus on credit card payment methods,
with cash and check systems catching up late in 1996 or early in 1997,
say analysts. This could allow other solutions to enter the race,
although those with existing products will continue to be regarded as
market leaders, they say.
      But although secure payment methods will continue to receive the
most attention, consulting and intranet solutions are expected to
generate the most revenues.
      Many security experts believe that consulting will provide one
of the biggest opportunities for the security market in 1996. Besides
helping clients implement security solutions, consultants also will
help them develop security policies and procedures -- something many
firms don't have. "Having a set of policies and procedures in place to
authenticate users is critical for setting up a network security
system," said Sclavos. VeriSign plans to introduce a formal consulting
branch this year (the firm already provides consulting to clients).
Meanwhile, firms such as IBM and others with existing consulting
businesses will reap the benefits of their service.
      Deploying firewalls and user authentication systems within
company networks also will be lucrative in 1996 as firms begin using
web technology internally for a wider variety of tasks. At the same
time, public/private keys will begin replacing passwords for network
access, predicted Sclavos.
      Meanwhile, security vendors also will introduce longer
encryption keys. Sclavos predicts that 128-bit encryption keys will be
replaced by 256-bit keys in the next two years. Authentication keys
will grow from 1,024 bits to 2,048 bits.
      The security market's opportunities will continue to draw
competitors. Sclavos expects competition to heat up this year when the
U.S. Post Office, IBM, MasterCard, and Visa join VeriSign in the
public key certificate management business. But VeriSign welcomes
these firms into the market. "When public keys are enabled in all
browsers and servers, tracking the keys will be a big job," he said.
"We think there is room for competition." 

E-data Takes Action, Offers Licenses

      E-data Corp. is negotiating licenses with eight companies and
has notified 32 others that they are violating its patent. E-data
holds the Freeny patent, an electronic distribution technology for
audio, video, software, and other digital data. The company has
targeted more than 100 firms for infringement. IBM [IBM] received a
license in September; other firms are negotiating terms. For more
information, contact  E-data at (201) 866-8456.

ACCESS:  PHONE COMPANIES BEGIN DIVING INTO THE INTERNET
Several Major Players Poised to Roll Out Service in Early 1996

      By the end of 1996, there will be at least one telephone company
competing for a share of the Internet access business in every major
U.S. market. Long distance companies won't be the only ones taking on
Internet service providers (ISPs) in the access business; most local
telcos plan to push into the market place this year. 
      The newest telco to enter the access market is GTE Intelligent
Network Services (GTEINS), a GTE Corp. subsidiary. Last week, GTEINS
introduced a dial-up and dedicated line Internet access service called
GTE.net. Dial-up rates are $8.95 for five hours of access (additional
hours cost $1.95 each) or $24.95 for unlimited access. 
      The firm will provide its customers with Netscape Communications
Corp.'s [NSCP] Netscape Navigator browser (thanks to a licensing
agreement between the firms) as part of the package, and it is beta
testing Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Information Server (code-named
Gibraltar) and Internet Studio Visual Publishing System authoring tool
(code-named Blackbird). GTEINS already offers the service in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area and plans to expand service nationwide by the
end of the year. GTEINS is part of GTE's long distance branch.
      Meanwhile, local carriers also are starting to move into the
field. Bell Atlantic plans to begin offering access in the
Washington-Baltimore area in February, and other local carriers are
not far behind. 

Planning to Take Over

      Speaking as if they already owned the access business, senior
telco executives discussed plans for the Net at, "Building the Optimum
Business Model: Telcos Providing Internet Access and Services," held
Dec. 13-14 by International Communications for Management (ICM) in
Washington D.C. 
      Local telcos are already gunning for the ISPs. Douglas Bulleit,
chief strategist at BellSouth, referred to ISPs as "interlopers,
laying on the public network, getting fast packet on one side, slower
dial-up on the other, and doing remarketing." 
      Bell Atlantic Media Ventures President Robert Beran predicted
that ISPs will have to get used to the fact that local and long
distance carriers will provide the bulk of access in the future. "The
big gorillas are getting into the game," said Beran.
      Telco executives see themselves as obvious providers of access
services because they consider Net access to be essentially the same
thing as voice telephony and believe customers feel the same way. Jeff
Cragan, director of new business development at Pacific Bell Internet
Services, cited a company survey which found that 87 percent of
residential customers would be interested in obtaining Internet access
through their local telephone company. 
      Telco executives also believe they have an infrastructure
advantage since their networks are designed to aggregate traffic at
their own switching points instead of at a server placed on the
network by one of their customers. This view could mean that the
recent struggle between Bell Canada and its ISP customers (see
Internet Week's Dec. 4 issue) over traffic levels may repeat itself in
the U.S.

Taking on Telcos

      This trend worries some in the ISP industry, since the access
providers will soon have to compete with the supplier of its product.
However, not all ISPs fear the entry of telcos into the market. "It's
a question of how well they can do it. They have the basic network
infrastructure to provide service, but how good is the service going
to be?" asked Brian Muys, a PSINet spokesman. Muys pointed out that
existing offerings from Sprint and MCI have not "taken the market by
storm," and he maintained that there are differences between providing
voice service and Internet access.
      "The way [the telcos] are approaching it is kind of 'we're
already in the phone business, and Internet is a no-brainer for us,'
but it's not that easy to be a good Internet provider," said Muys.
"They may provide adequate service, but when it comes down to
providing the tech support, keeping the network up, and keeping the
customers happy, I think there's going to be a longer learning curve
for the telephone companies than they would anticipate."
      GTEINS disagrees. Bob Zinnel, director of network operations for
GTEINS, said that although the businesses are not identical, the core
competencies in telephony will help the firm provide Internet access.
"The infrastructure we're putting in place is sized and planned for
the same kind of quality assurance we planned into the telephone
networks," said Zinnel. "Reliability is high on our list -- no
customer busy signals, no customer outages, no degradation in speed --
all those things had to be taken into consideration in our offering."
      Zinnel also points out that the people staffing the GTE.net
project came from GTE's internal data network group that ties the
company's dispersed operations together -- something that includes
significant experience in IP networking.
      In addition, Zinnel says, "We have an advantage in the billing
and backend operations, since that infrastructure is already in place.
Our telephone operation issues millions of phone bills per month.
That's one of the things that's killed off some of the smaller ISPs.
Once the user base gets to a certain level, they just can't keep up
with the billing."
      If the Internet is such a natural place for phone companies to
be, why haven't they been involved all along, and why have they chosen
this particular time to move into the field? One reason: Telcos are
notoriously conservative, and making money on the Internet has been a
speculative proposition until recently.

Profits Provide Motivation

      That is changing, however, and telcos have come to see the
Internet as a potential profit center. "Internet services will provide
the RBOCs [Regional Bell Operating Companies] a new high-growth source
of revenue in a business with attractive margins," said Pete Renner,
vice president, business information and advanced communications at
NYNEX Entertainment and Information Services.
      However, Renner and others pointed to another driving force
sending telcos into the Internet arena: the rapid approach of local
loop competition, which will pit local carriers, long distance
carriers, and the cable industry against each other in a multibillion
dollar, life-or-death struggle. In this kind of environment, even
something as big as the Internet is ultimately important as a
defensive weapon. "This will keep people on the NYNEX network," said
Renner. 
      Bell Atlantic's Robert Beran agreed that telcos have to be on
the Net if they want to remain industry leaders. Their customers are
demanding access, and they must be able to compete with other carriers
who will offer it if they don't. "We have to do this to retain our
customer base," said Beran.

Grand Strategy

      Each of the telcos' Internet strategies are similar and break
Internet opportunities into the general categories of access, content
provision, and hosting customer sites. 
      GTE.net, like most of the local carriers, will offer access,
along with a package of hosting and content development services for
business customers. "We do not plan to get into content development
per se," said Fred Walters, GTEINS' director of business and product
development. "But where there are applications where we see an unmet
market need, then we will become a content developer to serve that
market." Walters cited several vertical market segments, such as
education, where the firm may offer content.
      Although Farouk Hussein, MCI's senior manager of international
Internet marketing, described content as an "unstable" business at the
moment, most telcos see content as an eventual opportunity since
content can help telcos differentiate their services in the market.
Proprietary content will not be part of most initial service roll
outs, however. Both Bell Atlantic's Robert Beran and NYNEX's Pete
Renner said their companies will begin as simple access providers and
will develop their content strategies as they go. Beran said Bell
Atlantic likely will start by providing hotlinks to content, along
with a search tool. NYNEX has begun moving existing content, such as
its yellow pages, onto the Net. The firm debuted its Internet Yellow
Pages last year.
      Hosting web sites provides another opportunity, although it is
still not a big profit center for most firms, said AT&T's [T] David
Hughart. "It is probably breaking even and will eventually make
money," he added.
      That leaves access as the big money maker, and telcos plan to
squeeze it for profits while they can.

Turning on the Meter

      Telcos have demonstrated a strong preference for measured
access. Although Internet users prefer flat rates, providers have
learned that flat rates bring more difficulties than they solve. Users
occasionally interpret "unlimited access" literally and leave a
connection up continuously. The result is strain on the network and
impaired service quality for other users who begin to encounter busy
signals when dialing in.
      Although MCI's Hussein claimed MCI had found that only a very
small fraction of users will do this, other carriers maintain that it
is impossible to offer flat rate access and provide quality service.
Pacific Bell's Jeff Cragan said his company learned this lesson when
it tried to provide flat rate ISDN service earlier this year. Enough
users left connections "nailed up" that Pacific Bell eliminated flat
rate access.
      GTEINS, which does offer flat rate access, has established a
policy to deal with those that abuse the unlimited service. "In our
end-user contract, dial-up access is exactly that. It was meant to be
dialed up access," said Walters. "If we find that a customer is on 24
hours a day, then we're going to ask them to move to one of our
dedicated access services."
      Walters said that GTEINS does not have a predefined figure above
which usage would be considered excessive. Instead the company will
handle this on a case by case basis. 

Prodigy Appeal Denied

      In a ruling last week, New York State Judge Stuart Ain
reasserted his opinion that Prodigy Services Co. was a publisher,
rather than a common carrier. The decision opens the door for future
lawsuits against firms that allow users to post messages on
newsgroups, bulletin boards, or other online forums. In his opinion,
Judge Ain stated the need for a precedent as his reason for upholding
the earlier ruling.
      Judge Ain had made the original ruling in May when investment
banking firm Stratton Oakmont filed a lawsuit against the online
service provider. Stratton Oakmont later dropped the suit when Prodigy
agreed to apologize for an incident in which someone allegedly libeled
the firm on one of Prodigy's bulletin boards. The judge found that
since Prodigy passed messages through a filter to screen out obscenity
and derogatory terms, it exercised editorial control over the material
and therefore could be charged with libel. 
      Last week, Prodigy also acquired an interest in SonicNet, a web
site offering rock and music content owned by Sunshine Interactive
Network. Funding came from Prodigy's Wildflower Partners division,
which supports Internet-based content providers. SonicNet will provide
Prodigy with original, exclusive content as part of the deal. Prodigy
will provide support as well as funds for additional staff members.

CONTENT:  DIRECTORY SERVICE CHANGES STRATEGY TO COMPETE
555-1212.com Targets Niche, Locks in Area Codes as Domain Names

      When Jeff Field began surfing the Net last February, he couldn't
find an online directory that offered information about local
businesses. So he decided to create one.
      Launched in October, the directory, called 555-1212.com, was
designed to be a cross between a yellow pages directory and Yahoo!, a
popular Internet directory. By listing companies under their telephone
area codes, as well as more than 8,000 categories, Field hoped to
provide additional online information about companies -- especially
ones like hotels, restaurants, movie theaters, and services -- that
web surfers couldn't find anywhere else.
      "There's one site (http://www.thelist.com) where you can go and
find a list of ISPs broken down by area codes. We think that's a
useful service in itself, but we also want to do the same for hotels,
movie theaters and such," Field said. By using the popular telephone
information number as the name for his service, he believes the
directory's URL will be easy to remember and will draw visitors.
      To lock in that advantage, Field registered every telephone area
code, plus 555-1212.com, as a domain name. This will allow web surfers
to find businesses in their area quickly by typing in the familiar
telephone information number -- something that could prove a major
competitive advantage as local phone companies put phone directories
online.
      But despite that coup, competing with those services  has been a
challenge, forcing Field to change his strategy.

Change Is Inevitable

      As it was originally conceived, 555-1212.com would have no
advertising and minimal graphics. To generate revenue, Field planned
to charge companies for listings on the site. He thought businesses
would pay $5 for a 2-line listing and $10 for a link to a home page or
ad page. Although the model is popular with yellow pages -- which the
directory is modeled after -- it proved unsuccessful on the Internet.
Field found that firms were reluctant to pay for a listing offered to
them free by competitors such as Lycos and Yahoo!. Now basic listings
are free.
      Basic listings allow businesses to include their names in three
subject categories and two different area codes. Field charges an
additional fee for listings in extra categories or area codes.
      555-1212.com allows the companies to select the categories they
are represented in. Field said he was disappointed with how other
search services handle their listings. "It took me nearly three weeks
to get listed on Yahoo! and when I did get listed, the tagline was
very different from the one I supplied," he said. Yahoo! has since
changed the way it handles listing requests.
      But since it is not charging for listings, 555-1212.com had to
begin selling sponsorships to generate revenue. Although it uses the
traditional sponsorship style, sponsors' graphics are smaller than on
other sites, since Field believes graphics slow performance.
      Although this new business model more closely resembles that of
search tools such as Yahoo!, WebCrawler, and Lycos, Field emphasized
he is not trying to compete with those services. Instead, he describes
his creation as between NYNEX's Yellow Pages and Yahoo!. "I didn't
start out with the intention of making a telephone directory," said
Field. "I just wanted to make it easy to find a local business using
the Net."

Building It Up

      Since the site has only been online a few months, its directory
is still sparse. Field said this will not keep visitors from returning
to the site because they will see the value of his simplified format.
Nevertheless, "our number one priority is getting content," Field
said. "I may not have the content at the moment, but I have ease of
use and a familiar name."
      To fill the directory, Field will initially concentrate on
California's 408, 415, and 510 area codes. He said studies show that a
large percentage of Internet users are based in those regions and
would  likely use the service.
      Although he is actively seeking content, Field is relying on the
speed and ease of use of the directory to draw users. So far he has
shunned the complex graphics and content features of other
directories, saying they slow users down. "I want to get people their
information and get them on their way," he said.
      Once he has built up the number of listings, he thinks that
555-1212.com will become "invaluable as the Internet's business
directory."

THE 1990s:  DECADE OF CONVERGENCE

     As we move into the 1990s, companies are gearing up for the
convergence of various ISDN products along with the networks.
ISDN users, stranded on "islands" for the time being, are peering
across the vast spaces that separate the different switching
products and are beginning to build the pylons to connect these
islands.
     These pylons are represented as international ISDN standards
that have been adopted along with implementors' agreements being
cultivated by various companies.  These implementor agreements or
confidentiality agreements with developers and various companies
are often only hinted at in the various interviews we have had of
late.
     Make no mistake about it:  Vendors, RBOCs, and resellers are
jockeying for position and working on strategic alliances.
Everyone seems to have an ISDN laboratory either in the planning
stages or newly opened to test their equipment with that of
developers.
     Less then 2 years ago, the laboratory work was being
delegated to Bellcore, BNR in Canada, and AT&T Labs in
Naperville, Ill.  Then the RBOCs, first Southwestern Bell,
decided they needed their own private testing laboratories.
     Northern Telecom is also a player with major testing
facilities in North Carolina and Texas, not to mention its
affiliation with BNR in Canada.
     Even the consulting firms such as Andersen Consulting (ISDN
NEWS, Dec. 6, 1989, p. 2) are offering laboratories for the
testing of ISDN services as well as for the development of
applications.  Just recently, Hayes Microcomputers has added its
laboratory in Atlanta to the growing list of testing facilities.
     The development of these laboratories across the United
States and Canada illustrates the importance of applications
development along with the integration of systems and switches.

Standards organizations are cooperating

     The Consultative Committee on International Telegraph and
Telephone (CCITT), sponsored by the United Nations and located in
Geneva, Switzerland, has been making advances for the last year
toward other regional standards bodies.  These include the NIU-
Forum and others stressing the need for working together and not
duplicating efforts.
     Speculation is that the CCITT is concerned about its future
role in the standards implementation process because regional
standards bodies are proliferating rapidly, meet more frequently,
and can implement changes more quickly.
     Other standards groups are also forming alliances.  The
Corporation for Open Systems (COS) and its European counterpart,
the Standards Promotion and Applications Group (SPAG), have also
begun to form alliances with each other as well as their Japanese
counterpart, the Promoting Conference for OSI (POSI).  Australia,
of course, has a users' group supported by Telecom Australia, and
Canada has just formed a users group.   These affiliations around
the globe are heralding the 1990s as "The Decade of Convergence."
     Studies have indicated that these early days for ISDN
include only 1/10 of one percent of the telephone lines in the
United States.  The RBOC trials and commercial services updated
this month in ISDN NEWS indicate extensive growth at Bell
Atlantic and U S West in the United States.
     From the United Kingdom, Ovum Ltd. reports that 50,000 ISDN
lines will be equipped for data by 1990, 280,000 in 1991, and
800,000 in 1992.  These ISDN lines will have to be interoperable
to meet their full potential.
     Dennis Hayes, president and co-founder of Hayes
Microproducts, told ISDN NEWS that the United States is on the
"verge of 5 years of ISDN" and predicts significant growth in
ISDN in the next 5-7 years.  He expects it will take the same
amount of time for the ISDN market to mature as it did the
videotape player market.
     If the standards, applications, and interoperability testing
is being stressed in corporation laboratories, as well as
standards and users organizations around the world, it is highly
likely that ISDN will be interoperable on a normal basis, not
trial, by the middle of the decade.

HAYES RAISES ISDN IMAGE WITH PC ADAPTOR & SUPPORT PROGRAM

     Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc. is promising access to
ISDN services for IBM PCs and compatible computers by mid-1990
with an internal ISDN PC Adaptor.  The product is based on
CCITT's basic rate interface (BRI), and supports both Northern
Telecom's and AT&T central office switches, X.25, and the
American National Standard's Institute (ANSI) high-speed data
transfer rates for circuit and packet-switched data.  The
estimated retail price is $1,599.  Dennis Hayes, president and
co-founder of the corporation, told ISDN NEWS the product had 6
revisions in 4 years and would be sold through telcos, large
systems integrators, and 2-4 technically qualified resellers.
     Expecting to have to "educate the sellers" as well as
activate the market with its support program for software
developers, Hayes reminisced that his company would do the same
thing it did for modems over 10 years ago.  However, he concluded
it had not been necessary to spend time with switch manufacturers
and service providers to develop capabilities with the early
modem market.
     "We see the market as a high-end segment above the dial-up
modem market," and expects ISDN to "change the way a company does
business with point-of sales, electronic banking, error control,
data compression, and other advanced applications for speed and
performance driving."

Broader market in possibly 18 months

     Hayes said that "in the next 18 months or when it gets to
the point long-distance ISDN is in operation, service is
tariffed, and we know everyone knows how to order service, we
expect to broaden the reseller base to LAN networks."
     Infrastructure is needed to support new products because
resellers do not know how to write software for advanced
features.  Applications are of primary importance with developers
and resellers working together; and Hayes has opened a laboratory
in Atlanta supported by engineers.
     Dr. John Copeland, vice president for systems engineering at
Hayes, added, "Pressure is building up.  In the last 15 years,
speed [requirements] have gone up a factor of 10 every 5 years;
[we are] reaching the limit of the analog phone."  Hayes added,
"We're paying the price of the break up of Bell System, [but by]
working with switch manufacturers, we see things coming
together."
     In December, a beachhead in Europe and possibly Asia was
secured when GPT and Hayes formed an alliance to develop,
manufacture and distribute products for ISDN networks.  (Hayes
Microcomputer Products, Box 105203, Atlanta, GA 30348, 404/449-
8791).

Kyodo to change its English corporate name+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Kyodo News Service said Monday its English corporate name will
be changed to Kyodo News, effective from Jan. 1.
     The news agency said the decision came to coincide with the 50th
anniversary of its foundation in 1945.  The Japanese name Kyodo
Tsushinsha will remain unchanged.
     The group's business arm, K.K. Kyodo News Service, will also
change its English name to K.K. Kyodo News.
     Of the group's three U.S. subsidiaries, the change applies only
to Kyodo News Service U.S.A. Inc., which will now be known as Kyodo
News America Inc.  The two others, Kyodo News California Inc. and
Kyodo News International Inc. will remain intact.

MITI to develop sophisticated enciphering technology+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Tuesday
it will develop sophisticated enciphering technology to meet the
requirements of an advanced information age.
     Research and development institutions affiliated with
universities and enterprises will be commissioned to undertake five
different projects over a two-year period starting Jan. 1, ministry
officials said.
     Cryptographic technologies exclusively for Japanese use are
required to protect private data from plagiarism, they said.
     They said sophisticated coding technology is necessary for the
settlement of transactions via electronic devices.
     The five projects were selected from among 47 candidates
proposed to the ministry this summer, the officials said.

Nintendo to enter Internet business next year+

OSAKA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Nintendo Co., a major maker of home video game machines, plans
to enter Internet business as early as next summer, Nintendo
officials said Tuesday.
     Nintendo is now developing a ''new type of magnetic disk drive''
with 64 megabytes of memory capacity that will complement the
capabilities of its projected home video machine called ''Nintendo
64,'' a company spokesman said.  Nintendo 64 will be marketed
starting next spring.
     On the strength of the new drive, Nintendo President Hiroshi
Yamauchi said the company plans to develop a machine that will enable
users to adjust the details of the prearranged story sequences of
video game software.
     The new 64-megabyte random access memory device will allow the
rewriting of video games and the storing of the rewritten stories,
unlike conventional machines that use read-only memory chips to store
game software, the officials said.
     Yamauchi said the company plans to develop ''a machine that will
allow users to rewrite the contents of a video game just as they want
its story to develop, while allowing users to store the rewritten
stories'' to complement the capabilities of the Nintendo 64 machine.
     Under a linkup agreement between Nintendo and Netscape
Communications Corp. of the United States, the pair are now
developing communication software that would allow users to exchange
such rewritten stories with each other through the Internet, they
said.
     Nintendo hopes to create an international club of fans of
Nintendo video games who would exchange their rewritten video game
stories with each other through the interlinking of the Internet and
the new machines, they said.

NETWORKS: Netaccess Multiport Modem Card

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Xircom

Tel: (805) 376-9300. In Asia: 65-323-1511. Fax: 65-224-3313

Price: Four modems: US$2,299. Eight modems: US$3,999. (Prices may
vary in Asia)

Requirements: Xircom's Netaccess Multiport Modem Card is a full-
length ISA card, requiring a 386-DX or higher processor for serial
port emulation, with more powerful CPUs needed to push Windows NT
or NetWare Connect. DRAM needs vary widely based on system
application requirements: from 4 MB to 8 MB for a basic Windows
3.1x station to 16 MB or more for an NT or OS/2 server. OS support
is robust, including compatibility with Windows 3.x, Windows NT,
and Windows 95; OS/2 2.x or higher; and NetWare 3.1x or higher.
Space in your bit box is a critical element, as there are lots of
LSI circuits producing copious amounts of heat. RAS users need to
support either AIO (NetWare), NDIS (Windows NT), or standard COM
ports. Xircom Asia says that this version will ship into some
countries in Asia-Pacific by early 1997.

N etaccess Multiport Modem Card is a full-length ISA board offering
four or eight modem ports. It features V.42bis and MNP 5
compression, onboard buffering, and speeds to 115.2 Kbps using
XMAPI mode.

Installation:

Installation path varies depending on the platform (Windows NT vs.
NetWare). Basic steps are card setup (a rotary switch sets card
mode), loading the driver from a single disk, then configuring
specific RAS and adapter settings within the OS environment.

Documentation:

Manuals are well illustrated, with succinct descriptions of
installation and operation functions. Includes complete AT and S-
register command reference, result codes, troubleshooting,
diagnostic software and support options.

Robustness/compatibility:

Supports standard COM port drivers, AIO (NetWare) and NDIS WAN
(Windows NT). Also tested with Lotus Notes.

Applicability:

Has the ability to support up to eight cards for a total of 64
ports cranking at up to 115 Kbps.

Ease of use:

Works in support of the RAS software we tested. Once setup problems
were solved, MobileView network management software sniffed out our
NetWare server, providing information on port status, signal
quality, interrupts, and connection status.

Test environment:

We tested the eight-port version in a 486-DX/66MHz HP LM server
with 32 MB of DRAM and 2 GB of hard drive space, running NetWare
4.1. We also tested it on a Compaq Deskpro 5100 100 MHz Pentium
with 48 MB of DRAM and 2 GB of hard drive space, running Windows NT
3.51.

Remote control testing was done with a Compaq LTE Elite 4/75 CXL
laptop running Windows 95 and a compatible PC running Windows 3.11
using Xircom's MobileView utility. A variety of PC-com patible
486/100 MHz-DX4s with 16 MB of DRAM were used as client stations to
establish connections using Windows 3.11, Windows NT, and OS/2 Warp
Connect 3.

Warranties and support: Check with your VAR or Xircom's Asian
office.  LAN

NETWORKS: XIRCOM'S NETACCESS MULTIPORT MODEM CARD: The All-in-One
Approach

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

If you're not afraid to put all your eggs in one basket, check out
Xircom's multiport modem card-a single-board solution to remote
access networking.

ne of the problems with attaching remote access service to LAN
hardware has been the requisite multiport boards, the multiheaded
"Medusa" cables, and the multiple stacks of modems that need to be
connected. For those of you who are discouraged by the mass of
hardware confusion required for remote access, Xircom's Netaccess
Multiport Modem Cards (NMMCs) may offer you a solution.

BEYOND METROPOLIS

According to Xircom, Netaccess is the first ISA-based system to
fully integrate multimodem support into a single card, giving users
the power of either four (with the MPM-4) or eight (the MPM-8) V.34
modems in one slot.

Xircom lists the MTBF at 163,850 hours for the MPM-4 and 86,903
hours for the MPM-8. When viewed on a modem-to-modem basis,
however, Xircom's claims of a radically longer MTBF fall short of
Microcom's Deskport Fast modem, for example, which, in either a
rack or standalone external modem, lists a MTBF of 160,000 hours.
But, as Xircom points out, if all the other components required for
an operable component system are included in the calculations, the
overall MTBF for the other vendor's system may drop below
Netaccess' reliability level.

It's a bird... it's a plane...

Able to leap multiple platforms in a single bound, Netaccess is
compatible with NetWare 3.1x, NetWare 4.x, Windows NT 3.5x, and
OS/2 2.x and 3.x. Faster than a speeding parity bit, the NMMC
supports remote access services (RAS) software that complies with
Asynchronous I/O (AIO), NDIS, or standard COM port drivers. More
powerful than a local node, Xircom supports up to eight cards per
system, so if you have the slots, you could be powering up to 64
lines from a single PC. With powers and abilities far beyond
ordinary modems, the NMMC allows transmission speeds up to 115.2
Kbps when using Xircom drivers, supporting V.42bis and Microcom
Networking Protocol (MNP) 5 compression, as well as V.42 and MNP
(level 2 through level 4) error detection, with full V.34 support
for speeds between 2,400 bps and 28.8 Kbps.

One of the slickest features of Netaccess is its ability to
configure each port individually, allowing administrators to
distribute line access privileges and setups on a port-by-port
basis via their RAS configuration settings.

Netaccess cards contain two 4 KB onboard buffers-one transmit and
one receive-and include flash upgradable firmware, with firmware
revisions available via Xircom's BBS ([805] 376-9130) or Web site
(http://www.xircom.com). At the time of this writing, the latest
Netaccess release was 2.64b, although Xircom's BBS listing has a
typo showing the file to be 2.46.

Xircom has tested and approved NetWare Connect, Microsoft RAS, and
Lotus Notes for use with Netaccess, but any system that is
compatible with either AIO or NDIS standards will work. Xircom also
lists Citrix Systems' Win View for Networks and Symantec's pcAny
where access server as compatible systems.

Another of Netaccess' talents lies in its proprietary function
mode, XMAPI (Xircom Mobile Application Programming Interface).
Netaccess can function in either of two modes: straight COM port
emulation or XMAPI. Mode selection is accomplished by dialing the
rotary configuration switch to the setting for XMAPI or to other
settings that select one of several COM port emulation modes.

The XMAPI architecture provides support for high-speed, block-mode
data transfers using shared memory and onboard buffers, enabling
Netaccess to crank along at 115.2 Kbps. When operating in XMAPI
mode, the Netaccess card bypasses the motherboard UART. This factor
allows for higher transfer rates than is possible when data runs
through a serial connection via either 8250 UART or 16550 UART.
Achieving these high data transfer rates does not require a
Netaccess card on both ends of the transfer-any modem supporting
V.42bis is compatible.

UP, UP, THEN AWAY

Installation and configuration of Netaccess is easy under Windows
NT, but considerably more difficult under NetWare Connect. Xircom
has eliminated DIP switch blocks, opting instead for a single-
function, rotary-dial configuration switch that allows
configuration of the card's I/O port address, IRQ, and operation
mode (COM port emulation or XMAPI). Once you have set the card
switch and installed the card into an available ISA slot, you can
load card drivers, which are located on a single disk. Once the
drivers are loaded, you must visit the network adapter and RAS
configuration screens specific to the OS in use to make the
Netaccess card available as a port resource.

Although installation instructions are included in the product's
user manual, you may want to call Xircom's toll-free FactsLine in
the US (a fax request system) at (800) 775-0400 and request fax
document numbers 4608 (for Windows NT installation) or 4611 (for
the NetWare installation). The fax documents provide more detailed
instructions and troubleshooting information than does the product
manual.

Installation on our NetWare server was problematic as a result of
incomplete and misleading documentation concerning the loading of
the Xircom drivers. Our Xircom diskette was labeled 1.13, which, as
instructed by the documentation, led us to copy the file aioxrc.mdc
into the same directory con taining the aiomdms.mdc in an attempt
to make Xircom's multiport modem driver available to NetWare.

We discovered that merely copying this file to the server
accomplished nothing more than the consumption of a few bytes of
disk space, as nothing more is done with this file according to
Xircom's instructions.

We found that the user must manually rename the existing
aiomdms.mdc temporarily (for example, to aiomdms.old) and load the
Xircom file in its place. Instructions referring to Xircom driver
release 1.10 called for loading the version of aiomdms that was
provided on the disk, but our 1.13 variant contained no such file
in any directory. As a result, we could nottrack the installation
path using the older loading procedure, either. Instructions
regarding NetWare Connect configurations contained numerous minor,
yet annoying, errors. Those instructions tell you to select
Configuring Ports, for example, but the actual prompt is simply
named Ports. This type of mismatch was evident throughout the
NetWare Connect configuration section, which was especially
bothersome because we were running NetWare Connect 2.0, the version
specified in the included documentation. We detected a
documentation revision synchronisation syndrome.

We encountered a minor glitch when attempting to execute a load
aioxrcm1 command using command syntax provided by Xircom. At first
glance, Xircom's command syntax seems to indicate that int= and
irq= are equivalent command options, but deeper scrutiny led us to
discover that the int command accepted only a hex argument (int=b),
whereas the irq command accepted only a decimal parameter (irq=11),
hence the program's rejection of our attempted irq=11. Written
documentation did provide this information, but we would like to
see the command syntax designate these two parameters as distinct
items. This problem was further compounded by the total lack of
command examples within this section of the manual.

This is not to say that the documentation provided with the product
was entirely inadequate. On the contrary, we generally found
Xircom's Netaccess documentation to be among the best modem manuals
we've seen. The text is well written (with the exception of the
previously mentioned problems regarding NetWare installations),
offering many informative illustrations and complete reference
sections covering at commands, S-registers, and modem result codes.
Xircom's FactsLine fax documentation adds another level of detail
to an already worthy product manual.

X-ray Vision Included

NetWare network administrators will definitely want to check out
Xircom's MobileView network management software. MobileView allows
any Windows 3.x user connected to a Novell network to monitor any
Netaccess cards located in any NetWare server. MobileView installs
easily from a single diskette and provides status reports either by
card display or by port display groupings.

Card status displays include information concerning interrupts, I/O
address settings, and active drivers. Port status displays provide
port speed, connection status, modem status, and signal quality
information.

MobileView also contains an option to trap SNMP messages, which can
help track down network or card problems. Although loading the
MobileView software was a simple task, it took several discussions
with Xircom's technical support staff before we were able to get
the software to find our NetWare server.

Clicking on the Discover button causes MobileView to seek out any
NetWare servers containing Netaccess multiport modems. MobileView
then automatically adds those servers to a server database on the
remote PC. You can also manually add servers to the list, avoiding
the need to rescan the network. MobileView displays the servers it
discovers in a vertical column within the MobileView main screen
display, requiring the user to simply double-click on the desired
server's icon to select it, then to click either the Cards button
or the Ports button to view the status displays. Xircom also
provides diagnostic software and hardware to test the Netaccess
card.

Two DOS-level utilities (mpm4term and mpm8term) are included on the
Utility Soft ware disk, along with a set of RJ-11 patch cords for
loopback port testing. Once started, the diagnostic program
displays individual port information in two columns of status
boxes, with a larger command window displayed at the bottom of the
interface.

You can enter one of five commands (run, version, config, window,
and exit) to control the test program, although we found that the
system also responds to selected DOS commands, such as dir and cls.
Xircom includes a set of 28 .scr script files which you can run to
perform loopback tests using the run command. Entering run test38,
for example, runs a test between port 3 and port 8, dialing and
answering from each side of the loopback connection.

The config command scans the current rotary switch and card
settings and updates the related information contained in the
mpm8.cfg configuration file, which is used by the diagnostic
utility driver to perform the loopback tests. If you change the
card setup, you must rerun config. If you don't, the loopback tests
will report errors.

Pocketful of Kryptonite

As previously mentioned, we encountered problems getting MobileView
to find our NetWare server. Clicking the Discover button yielded a
"Local server not found" error message. Attempts at connections
from Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 workstations both failed to locate
the Netaccess card. After researching , we discovered that we had
two types of problems.

First, we found that only connections based on Virtual Loadable
Modules (VLMs) are supported within MobileView's SNMP-based search.
Because Windows NT systems do not use VLMs at all, any Windows NT
station running MobileView will fail to detect the Novell server
with the modem card.

A Windows 95 workstation could be configured to find the card, but
only if a DOS-based VLM is loaded during start-up. Without VLM
support, the Windows 95 station also fails to discover the modem.
The MobileView documentation card initially led us away from this
conclusion, as the systems requirement section stated that the
product required Windows 3.1 or higher, when it should have stated
that only Windows 3.1 and 3.11 are fully supported.

Second, we found that MobileView fails in mixed Novell environments
where both NetWare 4.10 and NetWare 3.12 servers are operating.
When we logged in to the NetWare 4.10 server (using either bindery
or directory services authentication) and also attached to a 3.12
server (only bindery authentication is available on 3.12),
MobileView failed to discover the Netaccess card located in the
4.10 server. When we logged in only to the 3.12 server or to the
4.10 server, the system discovered our modem without incident. As
we had only one multiport card to evaluate, we were unable to test
whether cards placed in both 3.12 and 4.10 machines would be
discovered using our single login hypothesis.

The readme.txt file contained on the MobileView disk contained a
little more information concerning setup and troubleshooting than
was found in the folding card, but provided no specific
requirements or troubleshooting items for either SNMP or IPX
issues. Help options simply restated the information contained on
the tent card, providing no additional information.

Conclusion

Overall, Xircom's Netaccess Multiport Modem Card is a great
product. Its pricing is comparable to its rack modem counterparts,
and it includes improved reliability and system compactness in the
bargain. Installation instructions for the NetWare portion of the
modem setup need to be cleaned up, both in the accompanying user
manuals and in the FactsLine-based documentation, to eliminate
sporadic inconsistencies. MobileView is a useful utility, but
inadequate and misleading documentation concerning specific system
requirements combined with a lack of troubleshooting information
made installation more difficult than it ought to have been.  LAN

NETWORKS: DS Expert NetPro Computing

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

7150 E. Camelback Rd., Ste. 100
Scottsdale, AZ 85251
(602) 941-3600
http://www.netpro.com info@netpro.com

Price: A two-server starter pack lists for US$1,299, with
additional agents available for US$499. In quantity, prices for
additional agents drop to about US$350 each. Support costs are
based on the number of agents, starting at US$70 per agent and
falling to US$55 each for more than 100 agents.

Requirements: DS Expert has three modules. The tree monitor runs on
only one server per tree. The agent runs on every server that has a
replica. The last module is on administrator workstations, and the
first two are NLMs that run on any server that meets Novell's
minimum requirements for NetWare. Nevertheless, NetPro recommends
that the server with the tree monitor have at least 16 MB of RAM,
and if there are more than 100 servers in the tree, the company
recommends a Pentium 90 or better with at least 32 MB of RAM.
Administrator's workstations must be running Windows 3.1 or Windows
95, with at least 16 MB of RAM. They also need about 2 MB of
permanent space for the client software and up to 20 MB of
temporary space for traces.

S Expert is the first tool for NetWare 4.x administrators that is
designed to help optimise NDS. It examines partitions and replica
rings and reports on replicas that are either over utilised or
underutilised, thus optimising the network.

Installation: The program comes on two diskettes. The installation
program, setup.exe, runs under Windows 3.1 with Virtual Loadable
Module support or under Windows 95 running the Novell 32-bit client
software. It specifically does not run under Microsoft's 32-bit
client for NetWare. The installation program copies the tree
monitor and the agent to the servers of your choice and applies the
licenses. It also provides a batch file, netpro.ncf, that you can
run to begin the monitoring process, and the installation program
adds it to your autoexec.ncf.

In order to complete the installation properly, you have to call
NetPro with your serial number, the name of your tree, and your
contact information. The company provides you with a password for
the tree manager.

Documentation: There is a 125-page, spiral-bound manual that covers
all parts of the software in minute detail. The manual starts with
an excellent discussion of NDS, partitions, and replicas, before
moving on to installation and use of the program. A nice touch is
found in Appendix B, which lists the NDS error codes and explains
them.

This list is kept up-to-date by Novell and can be found at
ftp://ftp.novell.com/pub/ updates/nwos/nw410.

The program is relatively self-explanatory, which is good. The help
system is sparse, and many of the comments are self-laudatory
rather than informative.

Technical support: NetPro maintains a wide array of methods for
accessing support. You can contact the company via a BBS at (602)
941-3620, a CompuServe e-mail account at 70524,2670, a Web site at
http://www.netpro.com, an ftp site at ftp.netpro.com, and an
Internet e-mail address at info@netpro.com.

No matter how you contact the company, support is based on annual
contracts and is priced at US$70 per agent down to US$55 per agent,
depending on quantity. There is a free initial 90-day support
period, which ought to be sufficient for small shops.

Warranty: Thirty-day warranty from date of delivery.

Ease of use: From the administrator's workstation, you need to run
only one program, which brings up several different comparative
charts and tables. When synchronisation problems occur, they are
reported to the tree manager and reflected in the Windows
application. The shortcoming here is that the program does not snap
into more robust monitors such as LANDesk or GroupWise. Nor does it
have the ability to send mail or notify a pager. Simple Mail
Transport Protocol support is also lacking.

Robustness/compatibility: The program runs under Windows 3.1 and
Windows 95, but in the latter case it requires the Novell 32-bit
client for Windows. It does not run with the Microsoft client for
NetWare. Once running, however, it works as advertised with minimal
bandwidth and storage requirements. The requirement to call NetPro
for the password that's tied to the tree name brings back all of
the copy-protection problems that were common a decade ago.

Applicability: DS Expert is used to manage partitions and replicas
in a large NDS environment. It can identify replica placement
that's causing excessive bandwidth utilisation and delayed
responses. It can even suggest alternatives that would work better.
The information it presents on a single, integrated screen would
take hours to manually collect and collate using Novell's
dsrepair.nlm. Given the importance of the NDS structure to the
NetWare 4.1 environment, this is a tool that LAN administrators
won't want to be without.

Test environment: Tests were performed using 2 NetWare 4.1 servers
in a single tree. The workstations were connected via Ethernet 10-
BaseT. Workstations were a Dell 486/33 MHz with 20 MB of RAM
running Windows 3.1 and a 90 MHz Pentium-based PC with 32 MB of RAM
running Windows 95. All machines used SMC Elite 16 Combo Ethernet
adapters.  LAN

NETWORKS: NETPRO COMPUTING'S DS EXPERT: Tracing the Server Family Tree

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

DS Expert gives network administrators the tools they need to
manage the NDS database-tools that NetWare 4.x fails to provide
efficiently.

hen Novell introduced NetWare 4.0, it ushered in a shift in which
users and administrators had to get used to the idea of treating
servers as just another network resource and the idea that one logs
in to the network rather than the server. Similarly, the new
version represented a change for network designers, who had to
figure out how to store, update, synchronise, and protect these
network resources.

NetWare 4.0 was a monumental leap forward; nevertheless, I believe
it fell short in many respects. For example, the default rules for
partition and replica creation had to be revised and re-revised as
experience with the product accumulated. The first version of
NetWare 4.0 made no replicas, leaving the task to the
administrator. This plan lacked any fault tolerance and made the
first server a bottleneck. So, Novell made some adjustments, and
the next version made a replica for every server. When
synchronisation traffic from this new replica rule choked the
cables, it was up to the administrator to cut back on the number of
replicas.

The current version has a new default rule. It makes replicas on
only the first three servers created, which is a compromise that
works in many, but clearly not all cases. Another problem was that
the early versions automatically made new partitions by merely
installing a server in a container created by the installation
program. This factor created problems of its own by eliminating
automatic replication, which made the problems of 4.0 reemerge.

The dsrepair.nlm.nlm has changed, too. The initial versions of
dsrepair.nlm.nlm looked at the partitions and replicas stored on a
particular server and checked them for integrity, but those servers
had a very limited ability to communicate with other NetWare 4.0
servers on the LAN. Thankfully, the current release is a remarkably
robust troubleshooting and diagnostic tool.

With all of this progress, there is still one need that NetWare 4.0
fails to cover: a functional analysis of the current partition and
replica design. For example, network managers need to know if the
design is efficient. Is the design causing bottlenecks? Is there an
exposure due to too few replicas? Are the existing replicas used
evenly, or are there some that handle far more (or less) than their
proportionate share? Are there some replicas that take
significantly longer to synchronise, and if so, why? The purpose of
DS Expert, a program from US-based NetPro Computing, is not only to
answer these questions, but to help guide the administrator toward
a better NetWare Directory Services (NDS ) design.

WHAT'S IN THE BOX?

NetPro is licensed on a per-server basis. The initial package
includes the tree management program and two server agents (which
consist of the NLMs that monitor replica activity and report it to
the tree manager). Additional agents may be purchased as needed.
Servers without replicas don't need an agent, and servers with more
than one replica need only one agent. If a replica is created and
there are no additional agents available, some information is still
available, such as the replica type (read/write, master, read/only,
or subordinate reference), and is reported properly. However, no
alerts will be generated for anomalous conditions that might exist
on that server.

DS Expert comes on two diskettes. Before installing the program,
you will have to call NetPro and give the company your serial
number and tree name, after which you receive the password that
enables your program. Both the registration form and the manual
mention this need for a telephone call-however, the packaging fails
to point it out, and the box contains no special notice slip.

I went into the lab at 9 a.m. on a Sunday to install the product
and was unable to reach the company to obtain a password. Since
most prudent administrators install and test system management
software during evening and weekend hours, I suspect that limited
company availability will be a common problem. NetPro should either
print the requirement to obtain the password via telephone directly
on the box or include a notice with an appropriate message
indicating the company's hours of operation. Better yet, the
company should trust its users' honesty and abandon this indirect
copy-protection scheme.

Once I obtained the password, I found installation to be quick and
relatively painless. The program requires certain versions of CLIB
and other support NLMs, and for those whose systems have not been
updated, NetPro provides instruction on finding the latest versions
of these programs at Novell's ftp site or via NetWire, Novell's
forum on CompuServe.

The installation program asks you to specify the server that is to
host the tree management program and suggests a higher-performance
machine for those users with large LANs (NetPro claims that its
tree manager running on a 32 MB, 90 MHz Pentium easily supports 100
servers). All the servers with replicas need a copy of the agent
software, which the installation program sends out. As a nice
touch, the tree manager is capable of distributing the agent at a
later time should a replica be added to a server that never had one
before (an unused agent license is available). This feature saves
the administrator the trouble of remembering to install the agent
and the headache that comes from wondering why DS Expert isn't
reporting the activities of the new replica and the replica's
server.

Finally, the installation program adds a Windows group and two
icons-one for the program and the other for the read me file-as it
copies the administrator's application to whatever location the
installer specifies (the default is c:\dsexpert).

HELPING YOU HELP YOURSELF

Some LAN administrators are purely reactive. That is, they wait for
problems to arise, and then they fix them. Others are proactive,
anticipating problems before they occur and taking steps to prevent
them. The former approach is more common, but the latter is far
less stressful for the network manager. While DS Expert will work
for both camps, it is designed to be a proactive tool.

NDS is defined as a "loosely consistent" database. This definition
means that it does not have to be in complete synchronisation 100
percent of the time. For example, if you change your password, then
log out and log back in via some distant server, you might find
that, for a minute or two, the old password still works. The
reason? NDS uses the Service Advertising Protocol (SAP) packets to
communicate, and it holds on to updates and sends them out as
single, larger packets in order to minimise bandwidth utilisation.
It can take a few minutes for an SAP broadcast to work its way from
server to server within the network. NDS is built to tolerate these
time-dependent differences.

For this reason, merely comparing the contents of two replicas and
finding some minor inconsistencies won't necessarily identify a
problem area.

On the other hand, differences that don't resolve themselves in a
fairly short time period are problems that must be addressed before
they cause erratic behaviour for users and programs.

As a result, administrators have to examine the tree and search for
problem areas. DS Expert can issue four different kinds of alerts:
Replica Sync, Time Sync, Load Average, and Low Memory/Disk Space.
Because NDS is loosely consistent, you can program DS Expert to
issue the alert only when the condition has been constant for an
extended period of time. Those without DS Expert have to use
NetWare's dsrepair.nlm NLM to keep an eye on their NDS databases.

This presents two problems. One is that the database has to be
closed while the NLM is running. The other is that dsrepair.nlm
forces an immediate synchronisation of the database. Closing the
database prevents it from handling authentication or being updated,
possibly inconveniencing users. Forcing a synchronisation wastes
bandwidth. Worst of all, because the NDS design allows for loosely
consistent replicas, any errors reported by dsrepair.nlm are
suspect.

Listing 1 shows what you may get when you run dsrepair.nlm. Even
though the display indicates an error condition, there is probably
nothing wrong with your system. The error 625 means that the server
on which dsrepair.nlm is running isn't able to communicate with
another server.

Most likely, it is a LAN or WAN communications problem, though it
can also occur if the NDS database on the other server is also
locked (if, for example, another administrator is running
dsrepair.nlm at that server). Aside from dsrepair.nlm, there is
another way to get the information on your NDS database. NetWare
provides an NDS tracing tool that is enabled by issuing the Set
command (set dstrace=on) at the console prompt.

Enabling this tool causes NDS information to be displayed on the
console in a rather cryptic form, and the information scrolls off
too quickly to read in a busy network. To make reading the
information easier, you can direct the information to a file using
the four commands shown in Listing 2. The four steps simply tell
NetWare to begin logging synchronisation information to the screen,
then to send it to a file called sys:dstrace.log, to clear the file
of previous contents, if any, and to complete resynchronisation of
all replicas.

dsrepair.nlm.nlm and the NDS tracing tool are the only two
techniques for checking the synchronisation and replica information
that NetWare provides, yet they are unreliable. The tools look at
one particular server and report on its health and well-being
without providing information about the other servers. The only way
to be sure there is a problem is to monitor the entire database
over a period of time and note the recurring inconsistencies.

This stage is where DS Expert shines. The tree monitor and its
agents are constantly looking at and keeping statistics on all NDS
network activities. A few minutes spent looking at the status
screens of the DS Expert Windows client can give an accurate
picture of the status of the database.

Figure 1 (page 86) shows the tree view. With this view, you can see
all of the partitions, servers, and replicas. The tree is shown
starting with the root, and if there are subordinate partitions, a
folder is created with those partitions as entries. If a partition
has an alert pending, its entry has a red circle next to it-those
that are problem-free display a green circle.

Expanding the tree near the errors displays a Current Alerts
subfolder. If you open that folder, you see the text of the alert
that triggered the error indicator. As an administrator, you even
have the ability to adjust the alert thresholds. For example, a
threshold of three replicas is considered to be the minimum for a
partition. If, however, you intentionally have only two, you can
set the threshold lower to suppress the alert.

If you set alert thresholds so that DS Expert indicates when an
anomalous condition occurs, you simply check the client software
from time to time and rest assured that the database is in good
health. When an occasional alert is raised, you are the first to
know, and it is possible that you will know even before the problem
begins to negatively impact the network.

The DS Statistics tab on that same screen displays the workload
being handled for a replica. Because the agents are constantly
running, they can track the number of times a particular partition
is used to resolve a name or to perform other tasks. Figure 2 shows
the statistics for several of the NDS commands, which are called
"verbs." By comparing the utilisation levels of each of the servers
in a replica ring, you can determine if access is balanced. If it
isn't, you need to decide if the situation merits further
investigation.

There are several designs that won't be balanced-for example, a
replica of a branch office partition kept in the home office will
never have the same number of accesses as the one in the branch
office itself; and there are several designs that might-for
example, several servers on the backbone that carry the entire
tree. As an administrator, you can see if the actual utilisation
meets your expectations, and you can monitor the statistics over
time to see if there are changes that you might want to address.

As a final note, DS Expert isn't an NDS design tool. If each of the
three replicas of your partition are located in the home office and
the two branch offices, DS Expert won't issue any alerts telling
you that you need a better plan or that you're wasting a lot of WAN
bandwidth for no good reason.

On the other hand, if DS Expert hasn't heard from one of the
branches for a while, it lets you know that your tree is in danger.
Also, DS Expert has no ties to tools that expedite delivery of the
alerts. There is no pager or e-mail function, nor is the program
SNMP-based. Administrators who don't remember to check the client
program might as well not install it.

THE WRAP-UP

DS Expert doesn't change anything on your NetWare 4.0 network. It
merely reports the status of your partition and replica structure
and suggests changes (such as adding replicas) that you should
make.Making modifications to an NDS tree is still an art more than
a science, and similar to an art teacher, DS Expert can identify
areas that need improvement and suggest techniques that will work
better. But, it is ultimately up to the student to execute the
task. Just as most students do better after following their
teacher's instructions, so, too, will most LAN administrators
improve their networks after studying DS Expert's advice.  LAN

NETWORKS: Java Does it for Databases, Too

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Java is an object-oriented programming language closely modeled on
C++. The main differences between the two are based on the needs
for platform independence, security, and application size. However,
there is one major similarity: In business applications, client-
server or otherwise, neither language has native support for
databases-unlike Visual Basic and Delphi. Initial Java applets were
much like a tic-tac-toe game, animation, and other visually
interesting contexts in that they lacked persistent data storage.

In order to make Java useful for corporate development, the
JavaSoft team has proposed the JavaSoft Database Connectivity
(JDBC) API. Based on the X/Open Call Level Interface, JavaSoft's
goal is "to define a generic SQL database access framework which
provides a uniform interface on top of a variety of different
database connectivity modules. This allows programmers to write to
a single database interface, enables DBMS-independent Java
application development tools and products, and allows database
connectivity vendors to provide a variety of different connectivity
solutions."

JDBC is organised like other Java subsystems (see diagram below)-
such as the I/O and the language and graphics subsystems-as a
package of classes that encapsulate a well-defined set of services.
Because of security issues and potential lack of local database
access support (that is, a preinstalled ODBC driver), the JDBC
proposal anticipates that the three-tier architecture will be very
common. In using such a scheme, Java applications make calls to a
service layer on the network whose internals handle accessing the
database(s). From that position, the middle layers could function
much the same as any OLE or object request broker (ORB) server.

NETWORKS: Client-Server Moves to the 'Net

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

What's on the horizon for client-server computing? The next bastion
to conquer is the host-based world of the global Internet.

The more things change, the more they stay the same.

As computing technology evolves, this timeless cliche can be
applied as much to the computer world as to history in general. In
the beginning there were end user terminals that gave direction to
large host systems that ran the applications; the hosts pumped the
results back to the terminals. Hosts changed sizes and became more
specialised.

Then along came PCs, which revolutionised the business world,
putting the power of the old hosts on each user's desktop. But
there was a hitch: Each individual had his or her own set of
information, often duplicating his or her neighbour's machine.
Sharing that information was very difficult. LANs arrived and
seemed to resolve that problem. But every bright cloud has its
muddy brown lining: Networks were very hard to maintain and the
applications they required were hard to write.

A few years ago, some smart people recognised that the union of
relational databases and front-end applications made a potent
combination. They named the new technology client-server. Still,
there were concerns.

"How do I manage data scattered at offices all over the world?"
grumbled managers. "How do I use this expensive technology to
create closer relationships to my customers and find new models
that lower the cost of doing business?"

Some answers are found by returning to the earliest forms of
computing-host systems that take direction from user terminals.
Now, though, the connection is open to anyone. And anyone can be
secure and use rapidly created applications that change dynamically
in response to evolving conditions.

The key to this change is, of course, the Internet and its younger
cousin the intranet-here referred to jointly as the 'Net. And many
products are being developed to take advantage of the new paradigm.
Just consider the 'Net as one global host system.

SECURITY

Analysts, visionaries, and everyday Joes predict great things for
the 'Net. Stock market successes such as Netscape, Yahoo, and even
America Online are evidence of that.

Analysts estimate that within 10 years, electronic, or online,
commerce may account for about one-fifth of the U.S. economy. But
to reach anything close to that share, the inherent insecurity of a
decentralised, unorganised system such as the 'Net-where users
can't even know who owns the computers through which their traffic
passes-must be transformed.

Last year, a group of visionary companies including Visa
International, MasterCard, Microsoft, IBM, and Netscape banded
together to create Secure Electronic Technology (SET). SET is a
protocol that provides a way to automatically route payment
information between users, merchants, and their banks.

The protocol specifies technology that encrypts credit card
transactions, automates the processing and clearing of credit card
payments, works with existing security protocols (such as Secure
Sockets Layer), and is supported by toolkits from Microsoft, RSA
Data Security, and Terisa Systems. In April, Terisa Systems
introduced SecureWeb Toolkit 2.0. This standard is an early, open
commercial step toward winning the confidence of the general public
for electronic commerce.

JAVA AND JAVASCRIPT

Like a nova bursting across the night sky, a new language called
Java has swept aside competition in the race to create a standard
programming facility for the World Wide Web. Sun Microsystems
initially created the project that resulted in Java in the hopes of
developing a set-top cable television box. That market, into which
many companies poured millions of dollars over the last seven
years, is still somewhere out in the future. Java is probably the
only commercial product to come out of those years of research.

Java exploded out of Sun's labs so quickly that even now, only a
few months after it moved out of beta and into production, it is
impossible to count the books, magazines, conferences, and Web
sites devoted to it. One major computer book publisher, which
typically ships 5,000 copies of new titles to bookstores, shipped
20,000 copies of its first advanced Java programming book-and it
sold out almost immediately.

What is most amazing is that Java has achieved this unprecedented
level of acceptance while still being an incredibly hard to learn
language. It is C++ with minor differences in regard to memory
management and access to hardware. The latter delta is for
practical, rather than technical reasons: How many users would let
some unknown applet be downloaded and executed on their computers
if there was no such limitation?

JavaSoft, Sun's new subsidiary created to develop, manage, and
market Java, has proposed a new API: Java Database Connectivity
(JDBC). JDBC will allow Java applications to access any back-end
database in the same way as ODBC.

In fact, the draft proposal for the JDBC API standard states that
ODBC should be leveraged and that the two APIs, both being based on
the X/Open SQL Call-level interface, may even be able to use the
same drivers (with a small bridge driver connecting JDBC to ODBC).
(For more on JDBC, see "Java Does it for Databases, Too.")

OLD 'SOFT-Y

As late as the end of last year, Bill Gates was discounting the
significance of the Internet. Four months later, he totally
reorganised Microsoft, instructing his employees to find ways to
adapt Microsoft's products to 'Net life. Often in computing
history, new generations of technology have caused old giants to
fall, but so far Gates has avoided the myopic vision that did in
his predecessors. Microsoft has responded to the Internet surge by:

 Releasing Internet Assistants for all office components that
convert spreadsheets, databases, documents, and graphics to HTML;

 Purchasing Vermeer Technology for its FrontPage HTML editor;

 Releasing Internet Information Server at no cost;

 Announcing an end-to-end electronic commerce system called
Merchant (using the security technology discussed earlier);

 Updating the OCX standard to ActiveX to support 'Net components
and releasing a set of basic ActiveX components (such as Winsock,
ftp, HTML and Network News Transport Protocol [NNTP]);

 Adding support to Visual C++ via five new classes in the Microsoft
Foundation Classes;

 Announcing Peer Web Services to allow Windows 95 and Windows NT
users to expose folders on local hard drives as Web pages;

 Releasing VBScript, a freely available, multiplatform, lightweight
version of Visual Basic; and,

 Licensing Java, plus a Java development environment (Jakarta),
and, plans to include the Java Virtual Machine in future releases
of the operating system products.

A key theme running throughout Microsoft's efforts is leveraging
the installed skills base. Rather than requiring users to learn
completely new programming languages and tools, Microsoft now tries
to add 'Net capabilities to existing products. "Microsoft has the
resources to back all the horses in the race," said Dwight Davis,
editor of Windows Watcher. "No one knows enough to make any
predictions, but Microsoft is determined to cover all the bets."

THE REST OF THE PACK

Microsoft is not alone in providing 'Net-related tools to corporate
developers. The main competitors to Visual Basic in the low-to-
middle end of the client-server application development market are
Sybase PowerBuilder and Borland Delphi. Both are responding to the
challenge of creating applications that can live on the 'Net.

With the motto "Fast Applications Anywhere," the PowerSoft division
of Sybase had planned to ship version 5.0 of PowerBuilder by the
end of second quarter 1996. This release adds a compiler (something
users of interpreted development tools always clamour for) based on
the proven Watcom technology, and the ability to create three-tier
applications with server-based components.

However, while Visual Basic 4.0's Remote OLE facility can be used
with non-Visual Basic OLE servers, PowerSoft will take a closed
approach. In this first step into the distributed arena, Mitch
Kramer, of the Patricia Seybold Group, labeled PowerBuilder's
middleware as proprietary.

ParcPlace-Digitalk provides a mid-level development tool called the
VisualWave Development Environment. Based on its long-established
VisualWorks Smalltalk environment, VisualWave takes the drudgery
out of creating ready-to-run 'Net applications with a cross-
platform, multidatabase, object-oriented system.

It automatically converts screens, forms, and tables into HTML, and
generates the required Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts. The
included Personal Web Server allows applications to be tested
directly on the development machine. On the downside, you must also
purchase the VisualWave Internet Application Server as well as
climb the steep learning curve of the encyclopedic Smalltalk class
library.

Oracle is also moving aggressively into the 'Net marketspace.
Recently, it released Designer/2000 WebServer Generator, a free
upgrade to Developer/2000. Now developers can create applications
that query Oracle databases and publish reports via browsers.

"For internal clients, Developer/2000 2.0 [this upgrade is due
before the end of 1996] would allow us to run a thin client that
runs a Java applet. So, if we need to upgrade the application, we
upgrade the server, not the client," said a senior applications
developer with a large US retail company. "Implementing multi-tier
architecture would keep client-side maintenance costs down."

Attachmate made its reputation delivering host connectivity to PCs.
But now it is moving into the 'Net as well. The Extra Developer
Series enables developers to create applications that access host
data from Windows 95 and Windows NT platforms running over
intranets or traditional networks. The host data can either be
coming from databases, mainframe screens, or program-based business
logic. QuickApp generates code for Visual Basic, C++, PowerBuilder,
and Delphi that allows systems developed in those environments to
use screen-based data.

MOVING INTO THE HIGH END

Among the range of larger scale application development systems,
Forte Software and Texas Instruments Software are taking fairly
typical approaches.

Next Software and Haht Software are bringing out completely new
tools.

Version 2.0 of Forte's eponymous software, released late in 1995,
allows enterprise developers to create dynamically partitioned
applications so that developers can tune deploy-ment needs among
client machines and any number of appropriately powered and located
servers. To add 'Net access via any browser, the company recently
announced the Forte Web Server software development kit.

In April, TI released WebCenter. Web Center, combined with an
existing TI product, Composer, delivers enterprise-class
applications that can be delivered concurrently in any of four
configurations: host/terminal, traditional client-server, PC
clients (such as spreadsheets), and 'Net clients against server-
based applications (see Figure 1).

Dan Ivanov, manager of information technology at Air Canada, says,
"We are committed to delivering strong support to our customers and
believe that WebCenter will allow us to significantly improve the
quality and speed of our customer service in a very short time."
WebCenter provides browser clients with a live 'Net page with
dynamic content rather than a display of static documents. Through
Composer's ability to connect to any database, relational or
legacy, WebCenter users can provide global data access to their own
customer base.

NEW FROM THE WEB

Next Software was originally founded by Steve Jobs to develop and
sell machines for the educational market. With the first commercial
release in 1988, though, reality forced the company to expand its
horizons to include the business market.

Over the next few years, Next struggled in a crowded Unix bazaar
and finally gave up. Instead, they have been building on the simple
yet powerful application development system that was part of the
NextStep operating system.

Most recently, the firm released the Web Objects product line. The
entry-level version offers an easy entry point for building dynamic
'Net applications that incorporate a set of prebuilt components and
WebScript. This version can be downloaded for free from
http://www.next.com.

WebObjects Pro adds the ability to incorporate C, C++, and
Objective C code as well as OLE connectivity and database client
library support. It also provides for distributed 'Net application
servers facilitating scalability and management. The top-of-the-
line version, Web Objects Enter prise, provides a complete dynamic
'Net development solution. This variant is targeted to customers
requiring a solution that encapsulates existing data and
applications.

"We're very impressed with the functionality WebObjects brings to
corporations building dynamic, Web-based ap pli cations," said Jona
thon Schwartz, president of Lighthouse Design. "In less than two
months of working with WebObjects, Lighthouse has already delivered
WebVision, a server-based developer component designed to augment
Next's technology, delivering data-driven graphics to WebObjects
developers."

Haht Software, a year-old startup, is marketing its product
Hahtsite-as a tool for stretched-thin MIS staffers who are being
pulled into 'Net development projects. Founded by a group of
executives from Q+E Software, Hahtsite uses a compiled Unix version
of Visual Basic rather than CGI scripts to handle scalability and
security issues. Applications created with this tool are entirely
server-based, with HTML pages created and accessed by browser
clients. The developer product runs on Windows 95, Windows NT, and
Solaris (see Figure 2).

DECISION SUPPORT

A basic need in most client-server systems is standard reporting.
Actuate Software is set to ship Actuate Report Server 3.0, the
first report server that can serve up reports as Universal Resource
Locators (URLs).

Using Web Agent, which connects any Web server to the report
server, corporations can make predefined report formats accessible
to any browser client. The Actuate Viewer Plug-in adds searching
and help capability, table of contents, and hyperlinks to other
reports. According to Larry Sikon, chief technologist with
Montgomery Securities, "The Report Server is oriented to high-
volume, client-server-level reporting. Overall, Actuate has done a
good job of emulating the Visual Basic mode of development, which
is visual, and which reuses objects."

IQ Software announced a new member of their IQ series of client-
server decision support software, IQ/LiveWeb, which allows users to
publish corporate data over the 'Net. It allows users to submit
queries to corporate databases, schedule them for execution, and
publish them on Web servers in HTML or Portable Document Format.

When discussing decision support, Online Analytical Processing
(OLAP) isn't far behind. Sure enough, MicroStrategy and Arbor
Software have announced server-based Web interfaces for their OLAP
servers.

Users with only a browser on their desktop can use MicroStrategy's
DSS Web to connect to DSS Server and perform the same sophisticated
data analysis as if they were connected locally. Arbor plans a
similar gateway for its Essbase OLAP server. And both plan to
integrate Java applets into their systems.

READY FOR WHAT COMES NEXT

The history of technology has taught us once again that predicting
the future is a difficult task, at best. The Internet and intranets
are still in their nascency and changing so rapidly that it is
impossible to predict what will transpire over the next year, much
less an even longer time period. Every new medium is used first as
a better way to do that which has been done before. The first cars
were merely more expensive and, of course, horseless versions of
the carriage; radio was used to send telegraphs without Morse code;
television was used to transmit radio programs with visuals added;
computers were used to automate counting and calculation.

In each instance, an individual or small group figured out some new
and different purpose for the new invention. Still, that process
took time. We see the same happening on the 'Net. It provides
faster, simpler connections to data.

Companies can set up electronic commerce systems to sell tickets,
flowers, or music without the need for direct human involvement on
their end (setting up these systems still requires a great amount
of human involvement, but that will change soon enough).

Others have set up radio stations. Down the road are plans to send
movies and television shows down the wires. But none of these are
new. The real uses of the 'Net are still out over the event
horizon.  LAN

NETWORKS: The Human Factor

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

When analysing successful and unsuccessful helpdesk
implementations, I discovered seven key attributes that the best
helpdesk practices exhibit.

 Helpdesk implementations are driven by management.

 It must distribute and discuss metrics using reports.

 Call management is centralised.

 IS staff must embrace the helpdesk tool.

 Management must define and quantify its expectations of the IS
staff.

 Helpdesk staff must be accountable.

Let's now discuss each factor briefly. For the first, it is
apparent that the managment must realise the benefits of a helpdesk
system. If management does not take ownership, the staff won't be
motivated to use the tool. Management must stress the importance of
using this system to create a knowledge base.

Distribution and discussion of metrics. Unsuccessful helpdesk
systems adhere to the paradigm "Garbage In, Nothing Out." This lack
of reporting, or metrics, usually occurs because the folks setting
up the system spent more time figuring out how to get the staff to
use the system than they did determining its value.

A manager requires staff to enter all trouble calls in the
database. However, once all the calls are logged, he doesn't know
how to mine the data for useful information, which he can then
present to superiors. When staffers realise they are entering calls
but not receiving any feedback on their performance, they stop
logging calls. To be successful, a helpdesk system must present
meaningful data to the staff and management.

Centralised call management. The helpdesk can log calls only if
they come into the helpdesk. While most helpdesk packages allow
network administrators to enter tickets, these folks are less
likely to enter records. This situation is compounded by the fact
that users usually know who to call directly to get their questions
answered. As a result, numerous calls go unreported. This
information call routing can undermine the system and adversely
affect projected staffing levels. To close this informal channel,
some organisations tell their administrators to put their phones on
"send." As a result, users reach a live person only if they call
the helpdesk.

Get IS staff to embrace the helpdesk. Most helpdesk implementations
fail because of a What's-In-It-For-Me mentality. IS staffers
usually see helpdesk tools as one more task to juggle during the
work week. Management must show the staffers the value the software
provides. Often, a disparity exists between the manager's desire to
get meaningful reports out and the staffers desire to spend time
entering that information so managers can extract it. IS staffers
don't see how this process affects them. Management must show them
how these tools will reduce their workload.

Defining expectations. A manager must specify which tickets should
be closed within an hour and which ones could be closed within a
day. Some tickets, by definition, take longer to close. For
example, if IS has to order software before it can be installed on
a user's machine, that ticket may stay open a week. However, taking
a week to answer a spreadsheet question is unacceptable.

Manages should define their expectations of IS staff in writing.
One way is to draw up a contract between the helpdesk and end users
that spells out the service level agreement between the two
parties. If managers do not define these parameters, how do they
know whether the helpdesk is meeting or exceeding users'
expectations?

Accountability. Helpdesk implementations can fail because people
start to believe that using the tool is optional.

So, how can management ensure that employees use the helpdesk
system? Money and status usually do the trick. Managers can use the
helpdesk as a tool to base performance reviews. Future raises and
promotions will be determined by how well each individual meets the
service levels managers have set. If staffers "forget" to close
calls, they will not be given an opportunity to "back date" the
ticket.  LAN

Storage Dimension, a US$60-million provider of RAID and tape
storage systems for LANs, wanted to set up an automated help desk
to provide quick response to users' inquiries. To do this, Storage
Dimensions turned to Apriori GT, a knowledge-based software
foundation program from Platinum Technology.

Using Platinum's Apriori GT, Storage Dimensions designed its own
method of Internet access for customer self service, called
TechConnect.

TechConnect is designed to help resellers, field service personnel,
customers, and other networking vendors access documented solutions
for commonly asked questions about Storage Dimensions' storage
products.

Customers can access the easy-to-use TechConnect help system 24
hours a day via the Internet (techconnect@xstor.com) or via private
online services. The knowledge base automatically provides users
with detailed, context-sensitive information on installation,
compatibility, and support for any Storage Dimensions product, as
well as related products from a wide variety of vendors. To access
this information, users simply send an e-mail message from within
his or her existing mail application describing the problem.

"The TechConnect knowledge base has a dynamic feedback loop," says
Bill Kirkwood, director of customer service and support at Storage
Dimensions. "It is constantly monitored by technical support
specialists and engineers. All problems or issues are analysed, and
resolutions are fed back into the knowledge base.

As a result, solutions are consistent and readily available to
support specialists and customers alike. The system automatically
prioritises solution documents based on frequency of use, which
speeds up resolution to the customer. In this way, trends are
discovered, and the customer becomes part of the product
development process."

Today, 25 per cent of Storage Dimensions' support inquiries come
via the Internet and up to 75 per cent of those calls are resolved
by the customers on their own (see figure).

The helpdesk staff's workload has been reduced by about 20 per
cent. Storage Dimensions paid approximately US$160,000 for the
Apriori GT and a Sun Microsystems Sparc 670 MP server; the company
achieved return on investment in less than a year. Storage
Dimensions estimates it has saved more than US$200,000 annually in
the two years Tech Connect has been online, according to Kirkwood.

TechConnect utilises the same documents that the Storage
Dimensions' technical support representatives rely on daily to
resolve 99.4 per cent of customer support inquiries. Kirkwood
points out that users now have access to these same documents via
the Internet.  LAN

NETWORKS: Dialing for Help

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Sometimes it takes a little help to make a little help. Here's how
to design an internal helpdesk that will keep your burgeoning
networks under control.

esigning a smoothly working, professional, yet cost-efficient
helpdesk support function is not an easy task. There are many
potential pitfalls to avoid.

A successful helpdesk planning project must tackle some tricky
issues, such as planning for future growth and changes in
technology and laying out provisions for the project's final
implementation.

Experts agree that the key to a helpdesk that will achieve first-
rate operation is adequate planning during the initial design
phase. This stage is when the project's team members must estimate
the current helpdesk needs and predict the near-term challenges the
helpdesk will face once it is in place. These initial plans include
important factors-such as expected growth in the number of computer
users, new applications that will need to be supported, and new
technology issues-that will impact the helpdesk during its first
years of operation.

The first step during the planning stage is for management to
ascertain that a helpdesk function is actually needed. It may be
that increased user demand for assistance is due to unusual
circumstances, such as a heavy staff turnover, an influx of new
trainees, or installation of new hardware or software. In these
cases, the temporary need for increased end-user support can be
fulfilled by other, less-costly methods.

Generally, you can easily assess your company's need for a
dedicated helpdesk when informal, ad hoc help provided by your
technical staff becomes a burden for them and disrupts their usual
activities. According to Stephen Davies, president of U.S. Computer
Group, a US-based supplier of support services, the proliferation
of departmental and companywide LANs within the corporate
enterprise is driving the need to support multivendor nodes, open
systems software, and diverse applications. This proliferation has,
in turn, led to a growth in end-user demand for assistance. This
type of support requires complex problem analysis to resolve
increasingly sophisticated computing problems, making ad hoc end-
user support a monumental task.

If your staff is no longer able to satisfy users' requests for
support on an informal basis, whether it's due to an overwhelming
number of support requests or a need for support that is beyond the
support staff's capabilities, it's time to begin to plan for a
helpdesk.

Matt Kochan, vice president of marketing and business development
at Digital Equipment, suggests that you watch for these telltale
signs that an organised end-user support function is necessary:

There is a large Data Processing staff
turnover (which indicates possible
staff-member burnout).

MIS receives poor marks from end
users (registering unhappiness among the users).

User productivity takes a dive (which could signal users'
frustration with technical tools).

If any of these symptoms are occurring, a helpdesk may be needed.

IN COMMITTEE

If it is determined that a helpdesk is needed, management's next
step is to proceed to the planning and design stage by forming a
helpdesk project committee. Delegates from company management, MIS
personnel, and end users should all be part of the helpdesk
development plan. It is important that each affected group be
involved in the helpdesk initiative for it to succeed.

The committee concept allows management, users, and support
personnel to jointly iron out helpdesk functions and expectations,
thus avoiding misunderstandings about what types of support will be
available. The committee should determine exactly which functions
the helpdesk will provide, define its functionality level, and
decide which applications, systems, and equipment will be
supported. Staffing and training requirements, hours of operation,
and budgets should also be addressed. With all parties in
agreement, anticipation of what the final helpdesk implementation
will provide will be clear, and the committee can formulate the
helpdesk's charter.

The next step is to investigate the benefits and drawbacks of an
internally operated facility vs. an external helpdesk. There are
three viable options for the implementation and management of a
helpdesk: the helpdesk function can be an in-house entity, it can
be completely outsourced, or it can be a hybrid operation that uses
both in-house staff and an outside service provider.

In-house helpdesks give you complete control over operations,
training, staffing, and costs. However, administration costs can be
high, and you will need extra time and staff to manage the
operation.

Despite the drawbacks, many small organisations may still want to
choose an internal helpdesk, explains Harvey Walker, general
manager of US-based integration firm Extranet Telecommunications.
Walker says his firm often recommends its clients do exactly that.

"If you deal with a constantly evolving product and you have to
continually train outside staff, the costs can be extremely
expensive," says Walker. "Extranet's clients are mostly small
software and Internet access companies with changing product lines.
Because of this, we usually suggest they go with internal
helpdesks." It's quicker to train internal people on the different
product changes when they are already familiar with the products,
he explains.

In a totally outsourced helpdesk situation, the helpdesk vendor
manages the entire problem resolution process. This resolution can
be done at the customer site or remotely from a designated helpdesk
facility. The vendor runs all phases of the helpdesk operation at a
predetermined cost, which benefits the customer. Of course, the
customer relinquishes all control over the operation. Training can
be challenging, as well; it is more difficult for outside people to
keep up with the constantly changing conditions of your LANs.

In a typical hybrid helpdesk solution arrangement, the outside
vendor manages the helpdesk's operation, call response, and problem
isolation process. The resolution of the problem is relegated to
the onsite staff or a designated service vendor. There are
administrative cost savings to be gained from this type of
arrangement, but you give up control over the helpdesk's management
and usually have the added disadvantage of a helpdesk facility that
is located far from your users.

There are many reasons why your company may choose to use an
outside vendor to provide its helpdesk needs.

It may be that there is a lack of technical expertise in your
company's ranks. Your company may be going through a period of
reduced growth, or management may have made a strategic decision to
dedicate resources to the company's core business. In such cases, a
total outsourcing agreement is appropriate. If the company's users
are spread out across a large geographic area or dispersed among
many locations, a remote helpdesk may be more appropriate.

TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE

Once you've decided whether your helpdesk function will be
internal, external, or both, the next step is to define in detail
the level of service the helpdesk will provide.

Says US Computer Group's Davies: "It is extremely important to
obtain companywide agreement on what the helpdesk will and won't
do. Inflated user expectations and exaggerated claims of technical
resources will result in a disappointing end product, dooming the
helpdesk."

Clearly define the level of service the helpdesk will provide and
either distribute it in a report or circulate the proposed helpdesk
charter. A basic helpdesk answers telephone calls from users,
dispatches technical assistance, and tracks problem resolution. A
midlevel helpdesk tackles low-level problem-solving by asking the
caller basic questions about the problem and walking him or her
through its resolution. Problems such as downloading files, using
e-mail, or finding a lost document are easily handled in this
manner. High-level helpdesks are staffed with skilled technicians
who are capable of using remote diagnostics and expert system
packages to examine a complex system problem and resolve it.

The level of helpdesk that is best for your organisation depends
upon the capabilities of your in-house or outside vendor service,
the organisation's size, the technical competency of the user base,
and the amount of the allocated budget. Setting up high-level
support is expensive. Software costs alone can range from US$2,000
to US$7,000 per user; consulting and train ing fees average an
additional US$1,500 per day. Add these costs to the amount you will
spend on hardware, space, and labor, and you will see how
staggering the start-up cost can be.

hidden costs

There are hidden costs involved, as well. Don't underestimate the
amount of resources you will need to start and run a top-notch
helpdesk. Your start-up costs will include staffing, training,
equipment, telephone services, software, and floor space. Expenses
for training, in particular, will be ongoing. (For more
information, see "Help Yourself." For a look at a successful
helpdesk implementation, see "Electronic Troubleshooting" on page
80.)

The top priority of the planning team is to design a helpdesk that
is extremely easy for users to access-if it isn't, users will
bypass it. Users should be able to access the helpdesk with a
single telephone call. After the usual logging data (name,
location, computer type, and software used), the caller should be
able to describe the problem and be walked through the solution.

Davies advises that to ensure that the help is beneficial and
remains attractive to users when they need assistance a user-
feedback mechanism should be built in to the system. Successful
helpdesks need a scheme for gauging user satisfaction and
effectiveness. With out user feedback, the only way to grade the
operation's usefulness is through the opinions of those who work on
the helpdesk itself, which would certainly result in a subjective
evaluation. Users' satisfaction with the helpdesk can be reported
and measured in formal, companywide surveys, joint IS and user-base
meetings, or via e-mail to a designated ombudsman. Whatever means
you employ to judge users' perceptions of the helpdesk operation,
it should be performed at regular intervals on a continuing basis.

Designate a high-level manager (or management team) to oversee the
helpdesk's operations. The manager must continuously review overall
helpdesk procedures and make necessary adjustments to meet new user
demands (for example, user load increases, technology enhancements,
and operational time changes to support disparate, and worldwide
sites). Planning for this important function should be done during
the initial design stage.

Management reports tracking the user's initial call, helpdesk
action taken, and final problem resolution should be easily
obtainable. These reports will ensure that the helpdesk can quickly
adapt to users' changing needs, which is critical to its success.

Collect data that details the number of calls received (per hour,
day, week, and month), the total time taken to arrive at a
successful solution, and the number of calls that were successfully
resolved by the helpdesk vs. the number of calls that were
escalated to alternate support. These statistics should be tracked,
tabulated, and reported regularly. The helpdesk manager needs this
data to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the helpdesk
function, and the information can be used to adjust staffing,
training, and hours of operation, as necessary.

There are a number of software packages available that can help
document these types of data (see related story "Help Is on the
Way," page 67). Small companies can buy an off-the-shelf general
helpdesk software product with the needed features built in for
less than US$5,000. Larger companies, with more than 25
workstations, can expect to pay about US$1,000 per user for a
package.

DEATH BY OVERKILL

According to the helpdesk Institute, companies frequently make the
mistake of not understaffing but actually overstaffing their new
internal helpdesks. Start small and increase staff and hours of
operation as needed. Automation is playing an increasingly large
part in helpdesk services as LAN support becomes more complex. New
programs are constantly being made available. These programs
automate the helpdesk call handling process, bringing it down to
its simplest level: symptom, problem, and resolution.

Relying too heavily on automation is a common pitfall of new
helpdesk func-tions. With so many helpdesk products available, this
trap is easy to get caught in. Automation is good up to a point: It
reduces costs, allows users to access the helpdesk around the
clock, and, when used correctly, it provides efficient problem
resolution. But don't forget that, in general, people prefer live
communication with other people as opposed to computer automation.
If users are too often asked to dial up and "talk" to a machine,
they'll stop using the helpdesk no matter how efficient its
problem-solving abilities.

CAN'T GET ENOUGH HELP

Many helpdesks are already providing services and support in areas
other than problem-solving and trouble call management. Inventory
management, contract administration, user training, and
documentation distribution are all examples of services now being
handled by the typical company helpdesk.

For many organisations that now depend on their LANs for daily,
ongoing business activities, the proper staffing and operation of a
helpdesk has become as critical as the proper staffing and
operation of the marketing department. The technical tools are just
as crucial. Whether your helpdesk operation is to be basic, medium-
level, or high-level, it must be planned correctly to obtain the
proper combination of people and technology.  LAN

NETWORKS: Help Is On The Way

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Help desks are commonly viewed as expendable. But functionality and
upcoming standards may show that supporting internal users makes
good business sense.

The grim reality of corporate life in the 1990s means companies are
resorting to layoffs, cutbacks, and even going out of business.

This dilemma is being felt on a large scale in internal MIS
departments, which often have to make do with a fairly small staff
no matter how many employees need to be supported. The crisis is
compounded at the helpdesk level, where often only a handful of
individuals is charged with solving the everyday computing problems
of more employees than they can adequately manage.

While many IS departments view the helpdesk as expendable and focus
cost containment measures in this area, this decision can come back
to haunt them in the form of reduced employee productivity.

In other departments, the helpdesk may be sacrificed in favour of a
company's external customer support infrastructure, which may be
viewed as a bigger contributor to the firm's bottom line.

But with a relatively fragmented structure, no dominant player, and
dozens of proprietary products, the helpdesk market seems to be
going in many directions at once with no clear destination.

Partly to bring some cohesion to the market, several organizations
are working on standards that will provide a uniform means for
passing helpdesk data between various users and that will create a
way to import and export knowledge. This combined effort of
multiple companies will give users better information regarding the
importance of helpdesk software to an internal IT infrastructure,
as well as information as to how spending money on such resources
will actually result in a return on investment.

THE BOTTOM LINE

When IT managers find out that the total cost of ownership (the
initial price plus cost of maintenance) of just one PC can be
thousands of dollars over a few years, many start slashing funds
for what they consider nonessential items. Sometimes this means
cutting financial support for the helpdesk. But sacrificing this
asset could be equivalent to throwing the oars off a sinking boat
to make it lighter.

With a restricted helpdesk infrastructure, employees are limited to
waiting around for a member of the IT staff to show up in person to
troubleshoot their problem. Alternatively, they may ask a coworker
for help, which could cost more money in lost productivity than it
does to maintain that workstation.

A key way to do more with less is to literally enable end users to
help themselves. Most helpdesk software vendors realise that the
fewer relatively mundane calls a support analyst has to field, the
more time and energy he can devote to more severe incidents.

Instead of losing users in an endless loop of automated telephone
voice menus, it is more effective to give them control over when
and where they request information by using the World Wide Web and
an ordinary Web browser (see figure, page 76). If a user has a
question about importing an Excel chart into Word, for example,
rather than attempting to locate the appropriate information in a
manual, he may be able to surf over to the helpdesk through the
corporate intranet and type a few key words to find an answer.

For more complex problems, an individual could create a trouble
ticket and dynamically interact with it before sending it via e-
mail to the helpdesk system and waiting for an analyst to call (see
"Answers Online," page 77). The trouble ticket might be customised
depending on the department or business unit.

Using the Web to resolve IT problems may not supplant the old-
fashioned method of picking up the telephone, but giving users
options can only contribute to the efficiency of the helpdesk.

BRANCHING OUT

In many organisations, the helpdesk is used to route calls and keep
track of who called and with what type of problem. But because most
companies can't dedicate a staff to running the helpdesk, this
entity has started addressing IT-related functions, including asset
management, inventory management, and training administration.

"In the past, asset management might have been under the operations
department and the helpdesk might have been an offshoot of customer
support, but now helpdesk, systems support, asset tracking, and
inventory fall under the same umbrella, and are all under MIS,"
says Bruce Law, executive vice-president of US-based Bultema.
Bultema is an organisation that works with helpdesk and support
vendors to develop business, product, and marketing strategies.

By integrating inventory tracking functionality into a helpdesk
system, IT staff can take calls from users and have immediate
access to each user's desktop environment.

Some helpdesk packages also integrate with change management
applications, which aid in the administration and management of
moves, adds, and changes that can occur after an office move or a
companywide software upgrade. This way, the helpdesk database
always includes information regarding which employee has which
equipment and where they are located.

This integration between the helpdesk and other applications can be
seen in products from all the major helpdesk and support software
vendors in the market. One example is SA-Expert Advisor from
Software Artistry, a problem and call management product that's
part of the company's SA-Expertise suite of automated support
solutions.

The suite contains a variety of modules that users can add as their
needs warrant. These components include an asset management
application, a change management solution, and a component that
integrates the product's support functions with network management
platforms.

Another combination of offerings includes helpdesk software with a
software product that searches for answers to questions or
problems. Utopia Technology Partners' Utopia Resolve/

CBR2 is a joint venture between Utopia, a helpdesk automation
software vendor, and Inference, a provider of software developed to
search and retrieve information in a variety of applications.

The product works with Utopia's HelpDesk to combine problem
resolution and call tracking. Once a call has been logged using
Utopia's HelpDesk, a case-based reasoning session initiates to help
the user solve his or her problem.

Scopus also uses Inference's technology in its CasePoint Link
product, a case-based reasoning module that integrates Inference's
CasePoint search engine and Scopus' products. CasePoint Link
prompts users with a series of questions, the answers to which then
allow the product to search various databases to come up with a
solution.

Clarify's ClearSupport product goes a bit farther by integrating
inventory management with software distribution-an asset for large
enterprise networks with thousands of computers to support and
administer. Clarify's system unites with Microsoft's Systems
Management Server, resulting in a simplified method of distributing
and updating Clarify's helpdesk application. Centralising and
automating software distribution helps lower the cost of running a
helpdesk.

Clarify also features integration with Tivoli System's Tivoli
Management Environment systems management suite. Earlier this year,
Tivoli announced Tivoli/Plus for Clarify, a software module that
integrates Clarify's support product with Tivoli Management
Environment.

DKSystems' DKHelpDesk for Windows includes a project management
feature that tracks the movement of existing equipment and the
installation of new equipment. It also integrates with OnTrack for
Training, the company's training administration and management
software.

In the long run, this integration between the traditional helpdesk
application and various management components can help reduce the
total cost of ownership, which can be important for IT departments
on a lean budget.

Another helpdesk innovation that brings efficiency and possible
lower costs to IT departments is integrating telephony capabilities
into support software. This integration can provide information
about a caller and solutions to prior incidents involving that
caller.

Professional Helpdesk (PHD) announced earlier this year a module
called PHD Automated Attendant, which is built into the company's
PHDEnterprise and PHDPremium helpdesk software products. The
products support Novell's Telephony Services API telephony
standard, which allows PBXs and servers to connect to each other
and pass information back and forth. Helpdesk analysts are able to
instantly obtain information that can help them resolve problems
faster and more efficiently.

Vantive uses a process called database routing, which the company
positions as different from traditional screen pops. "This concept
provides value to the caller, because when someone calls in, the
system asks them for their [telephone] extension, and then it goes
to the database. Depending on the information, the system might put
the caller to the front of the queue, or it might route the call to
the appropriate person," says Bob Tate, vice-president of marketing
at Vantive.

SECOND BEST

Corporations whose primary business is selling products to
customers know the value of an external customer support system. In
fact, many major internal helpdesk software vendors also provide
products that are used primarily for external customer support and
service.

The situation many companies experience is one in which more time,
effort, and funding goes to this external support infrastructure
than to the company's own internal helpdesk. "Clearly there is a
correlation; if you support the external customers well, you gain
revenue benefits," says Scott Webber, president and CEO of Software
Artistry. However, he adds, although the gain in revenue from
outside customers may be more direct, employees are also customers.
"With both internal and external customers, you have issues and
problems that need to be addressed. And if IS doesn't provide
quality support [to the internal customer], the customers have
[other] choices," he says.

Although an internal department may not be viewed as a customer, in
many cases the business unit, for example, does contribute
financially to the IT department. This transfer of funds may be
mostly paper based, but it's a business deal nonetheless. If a
department feels the helpdesk isn't adequately addressing its
needs, it can choose to outsource its support needs, thereby taking
away business-and funds-from the helpdesk.

"With service, you are dealing with one customer at a time and
making sure they are satisfied, whether they are internal or
external," says Bultema's Law. "But the helpdesk is mission
critical in both cases."

Many support software vendors don't see this link, but once they
realise that their own people are crippled, that will change, says
Barbara Noti, senior analyst for application development strategies
at the Meta Group. "As vendors who are leaders in external customer
management also sell to the helpdesk, you'll see people derive the
benefits," she says.

Some in the industry go beyond a relationship between internal and
external customers toward consolidation of the internal helpdesk
with the external customer support infrastructure. "In the past,
you may have had a high-end, robust support solution for external
customers and a lackluster one for internal [customers], but now we
see they are coming together in a centralised approach," says Law.

This merging might be in the form of a support center, under which
any type of support issues can be addressed. With such
consolidation, the internal helpdesk can only benefit because the
external applications usually receive more attention.

STANDARD PROCEDURE

With close to 200 companies developing and shipping helpdesk and
support software, the lack of cohesion in the marketplace is no
surprise. Most helpdesk products are based on proprietary
technology with no established method of communicating with each
other.

One exception may be the support many major vendors have shown
toward manufacturers of knowledge bases. These are products that
load into helpdesk software and contain information about a range
of issues and known problems associated with different hardware and
software products. One example is ServiceWare's Knowl edge-Paks,
which come in versions that cover a variety of systems, including
Microsoft Word, Lotus Notes, NetWare, OS/2, and the World Wide Web.

Helpdesk vendors realise the value of such prepackaged knowledge
bases, and more than a dozen of them have established relationships
with Service Ware to OEM Knowledge-Paks with their own helpdesk
software.

The Molloy Group goes the extra mile and not only repackages
Knowledge-Paks under its own Knowledge Cube line of content
databases, but also modifies the products to work with the
company's Cognitive Processor. The Cognitive Processor is a
technology that enables the company's Top of Mind helpdesk software
to learn from each call that's logged. Upon integration, the
Knowledge Cube databases can make Top of Mind "smarter" about
certain topics.

Other than the support most helpdesk vendors have shown for
ServiceWare, the industry lacks meaningful standards that could
make it easier for helpdesk analysts to share information across
multiple helpdesk platforms and improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of support products. To this end, the Desktop
Management Task Force (DMTF) has announced the Support Management
Working Committee (which is charged with developing a standard for
exchanging electronic service tickets) and a standard that will
outline the content and structure of knowledge used by support
systems.

The Support Management Working Committee is chaired by Patrick
Bultema, president of Bultema and former chair of the US-based
Helpdesk Institute. Bultema found that many CEOs in the support
market were interested in hard-hitting advice about where their
companies should go and how they should position their product
lines. "We look at overall trends in the industry and focus on
innovation and transforming businesses in the area of high-tech
support," Law said.

The current method of exchanging information in helpdesk
troubletickets partly fueled the formation of the committee. When a
user has a problem, he or she calls the internal helpdesk. There,
an analyst generally opens a trouble ticket in which key
information about the call is logged. This ticket remains in the
onsite database, so if the problem is too big for the analyst to
handle and the call is escalated to the systems integrator, the
information can't be readily exchanged. Often, the integrator must
open a new trouble ticket and enter the information all over again.

If the problem is too big even for the integrator and the call is
further escalated to the vendor, the process occurs again. "Each
step you have a person on the telephone creating a service ticket,
with no way of sharing the information and passing it along," Law
said. Many organisations do use e-mail to exchange trouble ticket
information, but that information, unaccompanied by a form
document, doesn't always make sense.

The committee is looking at an Electronic Document Interchange
standard for passing along service ticket data and emphasises that
it is not trying to replace the way service tickets are used.
Rather, it is attempting to define a standard way of moving these
tickets among systems.

This effort will most likely involve creating a common platform for
sending and receiving electronic trouble tickets, a data format for
sending these tickets, and a transport mechanism. Mechanisms under
consideration include e-mail and Internet protocols.

"This standard will allow people to say that even though they have
different systems and different information in their trouble
tickets, at least there is a common way of exchanging this
information," Law said.

Although knowledge bases are very useful when employed in
conjunction with helpdesk software, they are, nonetheless,
generally built on proprietary formats. Support organisations do
have access to vast amounts of knowledge, but exchanging this
knowledge can be cumbersome because there's no standard way to do
it.

The DMTF committee plans to create a standard for content,
structure, and exchange of knowledge, which will make it easier to
share such information among a variety of systems. The standards
committee, which includes vendors such as Astea, Digital, Hewlett-
Packard, IBM, Inference, Intel, and Vantive, plans an aggressive
timetable, with standards slated to be in place by early 1997.

MARKET SHAKE-UP

With the progression of both the standards movement and the effort
to educate customers on the importance of deploying and maintaining
a helpdesk infrastructure, the next step might constitute a major
industry shake-up. In an environment where so many vendors are
vying for a piece of the pie, inevitably some will drop out of the
race, and others will be taken over by larger companies.

In the past year, Astea International acquired Bendata (another
major player in the market) and McAfee took over Vycor. More such
mergers could be in the works, thus reducing the number of
competitors in the support market.

The support industry started out simply tracking calls, it then
moved to identifying who was on the call, then integrating with
problem management and other applications, and finally the industry
moved to sophisti cated knowledge tools that empower end users. But
the industry is still very proprietary, with almost 200 companies
and no market leader.

As long as industry players make the effort to find common ground
and let IT departments know their internal customers are as
important as their external ones, most organisations will be in a
better position to do more with less and still meet their budget
requirements.  LAN

NETWORKS: A Choice of Tech Support Tools

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

What happens when your remote sites go down? What tools do you need
to extract troubleshooting information? Show those techs a thing or
two.

he process of dealing with network troubles seems to unfold in six
stages. Stage one: You realise that something is wrong. Stage two:
You call your VAR. Stage three: Your VAR sends a technician. Stage
four: You describe the problem to your VAR. Stage five: The tech
fixes it. And finally, stage six: Everyone is happy.

The only hard part in this process is stage five. You expect the
proverbial knight in shining armor to arrive on his white horse and
slay the dragon. Instead, here comes the haggard tech-a little
hunched over-with a laptop and a briefcase full of tools, hoping at
least to find the dragon, never mind kill it.

Even when this method is successful-and the so-called dragon is
slain-it still leaves you with a handful of problems. Stages three
through five are expensive. If you employ your VAR via a
maintenance agreement, you're spending money. And the technician
may have actually used your problem to learn something useful. But
the next newbie who faces the same problem will have to start from
ground zero. Anything you can do to minimise the time it takes for
that tech to complete the service call benefits both you.

Several companies offer diagnostic tools that help you find the
fault and perhaps kill the dragon. We'll take a look at some of
them and discuss what you can do in your own office to lower costs
and share knowledge.

Touchstone Software's WINCheckIt helps you examine a PC and
diagnose its maladies. It first examines the hardware on the
machine in question and produces a report. The report contains a
summary of all the devices known to the system. Detailed reports on
IRQ or DMA usage are available.

This program solves two common problems for technicians:
determining from the current environment what add-on hardware is
appropriate and cleaning the drives.

For example, let's say the technician needs to install another
adapter card on the workstation. The "Hardware" icon on the
WINCheckIt taskbar brings up a list of possible cards that might be
added to the machine. The tech chooses a Dialogic voice card;
however, this card cannot be installed in this specific machine due
to IRQ conflicts.

Sometimes, technicians are called in for a problem as simple as
disk space shortage. While WINCheckIt doesn't add capacity, it can
identify waste. The "Clean-up" button on the main screen tells the
program to look for duplicate files throughout the hard disk. Many
of them must remain in place.

For example, every machine has several SETUP.EXE and README.TXT
files, which should be retained. However, files are frequently
copied to create a "temporary" backup, then never deleted. The
cleanup function finds candidates for deletion, so you can clean up
the disk drives. Using this procedure, you can often recover 10 to
15 per cent of a disk's capacity. Of course, making a good,
verified backup before beginning spring cleaning is a smart idea.

Archiving wizard

Another product that helps you recover disk capacity is Synmantec's
Norton Navigator, which has an archiving wizard. It searches the
disk for files older than an administrator-specified date and lists
them. You can then use built-in tools to copy the files elsewhere,
or you can compress them into .ZIP files.

Sometimes, your problem stems from a missing or outdated driver or
module. Various options are available for supplying customers with
such items, and the costs incurred vary with each. Your VAR's
technicians should carry disks of common items, such as the latest
NetWare client software.

If you've standardised all your client configurations as much as
possible (for example, all clients receive SMC Ethernet NICs or
Adaptec SCSI cards), each technician must have a disk or two with
the latest software for these cards. Doing so will solve many of
your problems. Nevertheless, while the tech is at your site,
they're bound to be in need of something they left at their office.
There's a least one easy way to solve that problem.

If your technicians carry modem-equipped laptops with them-always a
sound idea-they shouldn't be caught without Traveling Software's
LapLink. LapLink is available in versions for DOS, Windows 3.x, and
Windows 95. The software connects over serial or parallel
connections as well as over LAN and Internet connections.

They can use LapLink to access files from their office while
they're on the road, but they must first set up a workstation at
the office to run it. The workstation must be logged in to the
server and dialed in to the local Internet access provider. From
their laptop, they can access the Internet and run LapLink to
connect to the LapLink workstation in their office.

To do successfully, they need their office workstation's IP
address. (That address changes every time a new Internet connection
is made.) Make sure the connection doesn't time out if it's idle
for just a few minutes. You also must be able to use telnet
services; some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) require an extra-
cost "shell" account for this purpose.

Once they have the files they need on their laptop, they can attach
the computer to your LAN and use LapLink to make a peer-to-peer
attachment to move the files. If a LAN isn't available, or if the
connections, topology, or protocol are different from what they
have, they can use LapLink in its parallel or serial mode with the
supplied cables. (Parallel mode is about three times faster.) The
parallel cable has male terminators at each end, so it can connect
to the parallel ports of two PCs. There is a handy converter that
changes the Centronix plug found on all common parallel printer
cables to a male, 25-pin, D-Shell connector in most computer
stores. With it, techs can use your printer cable to connect the
PCs.

For a VAR to support you from their site, ask them to try LapLink
Host. Helpdesk staffers can use LapLink Host to take control of
user workstations, allowing them to diagnose and fix problems
remotely.

CD-ROMS TO THE RESCUE

Several CD-ROM titles can help you minimise the time your techs
spend on support calls. The three most popular titles are Micro
House's Micro House Technical Library, Novell's NSEPro, and
Microsoft's TechNet.

Novell's NSEPro has just about everything you'll need to support
NetWare and other Novell products. Think of the NSEPro as a series
of index cards, with some fact, file, or other nugget of
information on each one. Because tens of thousands of cards exist,
they're indexed and searchable electronically. The CD-ROM includes
all the files available from Novell's ftp site (ftp://novell.com)
and NetWire (Novell's CompuServe presence); the CD-ROM is published
eight to 10 times a year.

The Micro House Technical Library, updated quarterly, is a CD-ROM
encyclopedia containing information on NICs, system boards, hard
disk drives, and controllers. Its entries include graphics and
tables. You'll find this tool extremely useful in researching how
to set up hardware. If you have ever found yourself holding a
controller card, NIC, or motherboard without the accompanying
manual, this tool is a welcome solution.

The Technical Library is available in a network version (sold with
licenses that allow various numbers of concurrent users) and a
standalone version. Running the latter requires that a hardware
switch, called a dongle, to be attached to the parallel port of a
user's workstation. This stipulation is an annoying inconvenience,
but the value of the information outweighs it.

Microsoft's TechNet is also a two-disk set. Each monthly update
contains over 150,000 pages of current technical information, along
with the latest drivers and patches. It covers topics such as
client-server and workgroup computing, system platforms, database
products, and Windows and Macintosh applications. TechNet even
includes the entire Microsoft Knowledge Base, with over 50,000
questions and answers. The CD-ROM uses a Windows-based, full-text
search engine. Information is displayed in a scrollable,
prioritised list, and you can place electronic bookmarks in the
text, annotate topics of interest, and print directly from the
screen.

While you're loading up the CD-ROM server, throw on a copy of the
Windows 95 CD-ROM. After installing new hardware, you'll often be
asked for a file or two from that CD-ROM. Ask if your tech has a
copy, so that there is one permanently in his briefcase. With
LapLink, you can make all that information easily accessible. With
your LAN, use NETSETUP from the CD-ROM to make a Win95 directory on
the server. Doing so lets your own staff without CD-ROM drives
access those files easily.

STAY OUT OF TROUBLE

The last thing you want to happen is for an infection from another
of your VAR's customers to pass from the tech's laptop to your
workstations. You should run a server-based virus scanner such as
NetShield from McAfee. In addition, you should have a variety of
up-to-date scanners and disinfectors to test and clean infected
stations. Check the National Computer Security Association's (NCSA)
forum on CompuServe or the Computer Security Institute's (CSI) Web
site (http://www.gocsi.com) for a wide variety of products from
anti-virus program (AVP) vendors.

You should also get into the habit of using write-protected
floppies. If your VAR's techs are equipped with laptops, they
should be running a shield program at all times-no exceptions.
Remember, if they infect you, they have to spend a lot of non-
billable hours cleaning your systems.

HELP YOURSELF TO A HELPDESK

Many VARs contract with their customers to provide technical
support. In a large organisation, this service is called the
helpdesk. Smaller companies focusing on their business rather than
the technology that manages it often want to outsource their
helpdesk needs.

VARs are well positioned to support a dozen or a hundred clients,
just as a corporate helpdesk can support anywhere from a few to
numerous users and departments.

I believe that the ideal helpdesk hasn't been written, although
several have potential. If your organisation is large enough, I do
know that with a combination of products, you can build a helpdesk
that comes close to perfection.

Start with the core helpdesk software, One example is McAfee's DP
Umbrella. (This product was developed by Vicor, which was later
bought by McAfee.) In addition to the traditional helpdesk
functions such as tracking open items, escalation, and reporting,
DP Umbrella has several built-in features and add-ons. The Help
Desk Monitor is one of them, and it provides technicians a place to
log new calls. It automatically prevents duplicate entries of the
same problem by one caller (for example, if the caller has already
reported it).

If another user reports the same problem, the software adds that
call to the count of pending calls; when a solution is found, it
can be distributed to all users who suffer from that particular
problem.

Another built-in feature is called the White Board. Through it,
operators post messages about situations that may affect several
end users. All calls relating to a posted White Board notice are
linked together; they can be worked on, updated, and resolved
simultaneously. This collaborative computing tool lets technicians
learn from each other.

More importantly, it prevents several of your own techs from
working on the same problem at the same time in an uncoordinated
manner.

Among the DP Umbrella add-ons is Vicor Web. This tool lets the
helpdesk post common problems and solutions to an Internet or
internet Web site, so users can find their own solutions. This
feature can dramatically reduce the number of calls individual
technicians must handle, which cuts the cost of staffing and
managing the helpdesk. You can track helpdesk calls for reporting
purposes, and you can restrict access to various parts of the Web
site based on security clearances (or support levels). For example,
if your office has no oher technician on staff, you can get minimal
information, such as how to change printer ribbons, while your
offices with more savvy users can access updated drivers or other
files.

Another add-on product to DP Umbrella is Vicor listener, which
monitors network management consoles via its Simple Mail Transport
Protocol (SMTP) Listener. The software receives SNMP messages from
any system capable of e-mailing them, letting the helpdesk staff
act proactively to manage a problem before it becomes a crisis.

If you need to standardise management information, American
Megatrends recently introduced PC Care. This product fully exploits
the DMI technology supported by most BIOS vendors to offer
standardised system information.

PC Care collects information stored in the BIOS and puts it into a
standardised Management Information File (MIF) format. The program
then interprets DMI data into one of several formats, which an then
be converted to SMTP messages and sent to Vicor Listener.

In this process, problems brewing in one user's PC can be brought
to the attention of the helpdesk staff before the user even knows a
problem exists. These problems can be resolved in a planned,
scheduled manner rather than in crisis mode.

Few helpdesk products include inventory management and purchasing,
but I believe the Vicor product and Open UPTIME from Metrix do-and
do so quite well.

The Metrix product includes purchasing system and replenishment
capabilities, and it maintains a complete history record on parts
and products shipped (including serial-number tracking). It has an
add-on module called the Repair Center, which ties in a service
depot function so authorised materials can be repaired while
recording information for parts and labor billing.

The basis for receiving technical support is being prepared when
you do find a problem on your network. These tips and tools will
help you and your VAR's techs resolve the problem at hand and avoid
crisis situations.  LAN

NETWORKS: RUNNING YOUR OWN DNS

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

As your network grows, you may be considering the option of running
your own Domain Name System (DNS) servers.

We show you how to navigate the DNS structure.

ll hosts on the Internet- or on any TCP/IP network for that matter-
have an assigned 32-bit IP address. In addition, most hosts also
have a name, because names are easier to remember than addresses.
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the distributed database that
contains the names and addresses of all reachable hosts on a TCP/IP
subnet, including the Internet.

Most, but not all, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will set up
and maintain the DNS information for their customers. However, you
may prefer to operate your own DNS. Let's take a look at Internet
domain names and the DNS's structure and discuss how you can create
and maintain the DNS information.

INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES AND STRUCTURE

Internet host names use a hierarchical address structure that
comprises a top-level domain, a subdomain, and a host name. Top-
level domain names and IP network addresses are assigned and
maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA, USC
Information Sciences Institute), which is responsible for the DNS's
overall coordination and management. Domain administrators assign
host names and addresses within their domain. (For more information
on the IANA, contact its Web site at http://www/isi/edu/diz7/iana.)

The Internet naming hierarchy is best understood by reading a host
name from right to left. All host names end with a top-level domain
name (see Figure 1). Generic top-level domains (although generally
limited to the US) include the following: com (commercial
organisations), edu (educational institutions, primarily four-year
colleagues and universities), gov (US government agencies), mil (US
military), org (nonprofit organisations), net (network providers),
and int (international treaty organisations).

The host name smcvax.smcvt.edu, for example, is assigned to a VAX
computer (smcvax) within St. Michael's College's subdomain (smcvt),
which is within the educational top-level domain (edu). The name
golem.bill.com refers to a host (golem) in the Hill Associates
(Colchester, VT) subdomain (hill) within the commercial top-level
domain (com).

Other top-level domain names use international two-letter country
codes, such as au (Australia), ca (Canada), de (Germany), es
(Spain), fr (France), jp (Japan), mx (Mexico), and us (United
States). Each country determines its own countrybased subdomains
and how the associated DNS database will be organised.

The US domain, for example, is organised mostly on the basis of
geography, usually using a name with the following format:
organisation.city.state.us. The format may be slightly different
for special names, such as those for state government or K-12 and
two-year educational institutions. The address cnri.reston.va.us,
for example, refers to the Corporation for National Research
Initiatives located in the US.

The ca subdomain within the us high-level domain does not cause a
conflict with the ca high-level domain; the former refers to
California and the latter to Canada. The host name

myo.inst.keio.ac.jp refers to a system at the Science and
Technology Department of Keio University in Yokohama, Japan; note
that the ac subdomain within jp refers to academic institutions.

THE NAMING PROBLEM

Because host names are easier to remember than IP addresses, using
them is a convenience for the humans who use the network. However,
the network has to provide some sort of name-address translation in
order to operate.

Prior to the definition of the DNS, the HOSTS.TXT file was used in
the ARPAnet. It contained the IP address, name, and alias(es) of
every host on the ARPAnet. This scheme was suitable when the
network had only a few hundred systems and was not very dynamic.
But, it is wholly unsuited for the Internet, which has almost 10
million hosts (as of January 1996) and 10 percent growth per month.

HOSTS.TXT files are still used, however. Their main function today
is to contain the names of local systems, so one machine on a LAN
(or other local network) can find other local systems without
performing a DNS lookup.

When TCP/IP software is configured on a host, the location of the
HOSTS.TXT file must be provided if the file is used by a given
system.

Figure 2 illustrates a fictitious network: the foo.com domain.
Listing 1 shows a sample HOSTS.TXT file for this domain. Each line
contains three fields: the IP address, host name, and (optionally)
any aliases the system might use. For example, a system on the LAN
trying to make an frp connection to the local ftp server might
attempt to open a connection to 192.168.210.3, ftp.foo.com, ftp,
www, mail2, or dns2.

THE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM

The DNS is a distributed database containing the names and/or
addresses of every host accessible via the Internet. The DNS was
one of the key developments that allowed the Internet to grow as it
has. Unlike HOSTS.TXT files, which must be maintained individually
at every host on the network and synchronised to ensure their
correctness, DNS files are maintained by thousands of hosts on the
network. Each host is responsible for a portion of the name space,
which is called a zone. The DNS provides a mechanism for
identifying backup databases in case the first one becomes
unavailable. DNS databases are updated automatically, so
information on one name server does not remain out-of-date for
long.

When TCP/IP software is installed on a host, the address (not the
names) of one or more name servers (usually no more than three) are
one of the configured parameters. When the host attempts to
establish a connection to another IP host, it first checks its
local HOSTS.TXT file (if there is one) for the name of the remote
host. If the remote host is not the HOSTS.TXT file, the local host
sends a query to the primary DNS name server. The primary name
server might not contain the information about the particular
destination host; in that case, the query is forwarded to another
name server higher up on the domain name hierarchy.

Consider the following example. Suppose a user on a system at Baz
University (domain: baz.edu) wishes to initiate a connection to the
Web server at Foo Corp. (www. foo.com). The following name
resolution steps would occur:

1. The Baz host checks its HOSTS.

TXT file. In this example, Foo's Web server is not found.

2. The Baz host then checks its primary DNS name server. Because
the Baz DNS server probably covers only the baz.edu zone, it does
not contain Foo's Web server address; instead, it forwards the
query.

3. The query is passed to a name server higher up in the DNS
hierarchy. A database exists for every top-level domain. The
database contains the name of every sub-domain within that top-
level domain and its assigned name server(s). When the higher-level
name server checks the com DNS file, it finds an entry for foo.com
and the address of its DNS server(s). This information is returned
to the Baz DNS server.

4. The query is then forwarded to one of the name servers for
foo.com, which, in turn, returns the IP address of the Web server
(198.168.210.3).

You can use several TCP/IP tools to examine the DNS. The most
common DNS lookup utilities are NSLOOKUP and Host. If you turn off
the "recursive" option, you can see these steps in more detail.

The DNS database contains different types of information on
resource records (RR). Following are descriptions of the most
common RRs.

Start of Authority (SOA) records indicate the authoritative name
server for a given domain and a few additional administrative
items.

Address (A) records supply the IP address for a given host name.

Canonical Name (CNAME) records supply host alias names. You can
define multiple A records for a given address, providing alias, or
alternate, host names. It is usually easier (and less prone to
human error) to supply one A record for a given address and use
CNAME records to define alias host names for that address.

Pointer Records (PTR) associate a host name with a given IP
address. These records are used for reverse name lookups.

Mail Exchange (MX) records define the mail system(s) for a given
domain.

Name Server (NS) records define the name server(s) for a given
domain.

DNS SERVER SOFTWARE

DNS server software has various names, depending on the operating
system. Windows NT refers simply to DNS, while Unix has named or
Berkeley Internet Name Daemon (BIND) boot files. When the DNS
process is launched, it will read a boot file that contains the
names of the database files containing the DNS information. Listing
2 shows a sample boot file, called named.boot.

The first record in the boot file contains directory information
and points to the directory where the DNS program files reside.
Each remaining record contains three fields that describe a DNS
database file: the type of DNS information, the domain defined in
the file, and the file name. The six records listed refer to the
DNS databases that this DNS server is primarily responsible for.
The six domains defined here are:

foo.com: The DNS entries for the foo.com zone, which contain
address, mail server, and name server RRs, are found in the file
foo.com.zone.

210.168.192.in-addr.arpa: The foo.

com domain is associated with the IP Class C address 192.168.210.0
(a valid IP address for use in a private network per RFC 1918).
Reverse lookups (obtaining the host name from an IP address) are
accomplished using a reverse database file. In this file, the name
of the domain is the reverse dotted decimal notation of the
domain's IP address followed by in-addr.arpa. (The latter is an
indication of the use of IP addressed within the ARPA address
assignment domain. This nomenclature is an historic holdover from a
time when more than one type of address could be found and more
than one addressing authority existed.) The file containing this
data is called foo.com.rev.

localhost: Localhost is a special IP name that always refers to the
local host and, by convention, has the Ip address 127.0.0.1. This
information is located in the file called localhost.zone.

0.0.127.in-addr.arpa: IP reserves the Class A address 127.0.0.0 for
local loopback. This address, therefore, is not maintained by any
global DNS registry. For completeness and security, we define the
reverse lookup for this address in a file called localhost.rev.

O.in-addr.arpa and 255.in-addr.arpa: IP reserves the all-zeros (0)
and all-ones (255) addresses for special purposes. These domains
are defined in all the all-zero.zone and the all-one.zone files,
respectively.

The final record defines where to find the DNS cache information
for the root domain (.). This is not a cache as in short-term
memory, but rather a set of fixed pointers to the higher-level DNS
databases. In this example, the cache information is maintained in
the file named.cache.

DNS RECORD FORMATS AND DATABASE FILES

All DNS resource records have a similar format. Although you can
find many shortcut notations and abbreviations in DNS files, I have
used examples with simple nomenclature to eliminate confusion and
ambiguity.

The first field in any DNS record is always either an IP address or
a host name. If this entry is missing, the name/address from the
previous record is implied. Note that all names and addresses end
with a trailing dot (.), which signifies that the name or address
is an absolute name/address rather than a relative one. Absolute
addresses, also called fully qualified domain names, are relative
to the root, while relative addresses are relative to a default
domain (which may or may not be the root). This field may,
optionally, be followed by a time-to-live (TTL) value, which
indicates the length of time the field's information field should
be considered valid.

The second field indicates the address type. In today's DNS
databases, the string "IN" most likely indicates an Internet
address. This field is present for historical purposes and enables
compatibility with older systems. The third field is a string that
indicates the type of RR. This field is followed by optional
parameters specific to the RR.

The foo.com.zone file, shown in Listing 3, contains information
about the foo.com domain, including name lookup, mail exchange, and
name server information. Specific RRs of note follow.

Notable rrs

The SOA record includes the name of the DNS server system and the
e-mail address of the person responsible for the name server. Note
that the e-mail address is not in the expected form; rather than
user@domain, the format user.domain is used. This record also
contains five other parameters.

1. The serial number identified the version of the DNS database.
Whenever the file's information is changed, the serial number must
be incremented so secondary servers examining this database know
the information has been altered. In this example, we use a serial
number format containing the year (all four digits), month, and day
of the last update. This numbering scheme is usually sufficient if
you don't change your DNS database more than once a day. Some
systems just start counting at 1 and increment it every time a
change occurs.

2. The refresh value tells the secondary name server(s) how often
to check for updated information (10,800 seconds is three hours).

3. If the secondary name server is unable to contact the primary
name server, it continues its attempt to make a connection at the
specified retry intervals. In this example, it will try once every
3,600 seconds, or every hours.

4. If a secondary name server cannot contact the primary name
server within the specified expire period, the secondary server
stops answering queries about this domain. The theory behind this
parameter is that at some point, the data is so old it might be
harmful-no answer is better than a bad answer. In this case, the
time period 604,800 seconds is one week.

5. The TTL value is returned with all responses to database
queries. It tells the requester (or other servers) how long the
information can safely be cached (86,400 seconds is one day). The
TTL value is the default value for all records in the file, it may
be overridden by a TTL value provided with a given RR.

NS records contain the address of the name server(s) for this
domain. In this example, two name servers have the foo.com DNS
information.

MX records contain the addresses of the mail exchange system(s) for
this domain. The number before the address is the preferred system.
When a remote user sends mail to user@foo.com, the remote mail
system looks up the MX record for the foo.com domain. the remote
mailer then attempts to establish an SMTP connection to the foo.com
mail system with the lowest preference value (in this case,
mail.foo.com). If that system is not available, the remote mailer
tries the next level mailer (in this case mail2.foo.com).

The A records contain the IP address associated with the host name
in the first field of the record.

The CNAME records contain the alias host names associated with the
host named in the first field of the record. Although you can
assign a single A record and many CNAME records to a single system,
be careful when doing so. Some mailers, for example, do
unpredictable things when asked to resolve an MX host name that
uses a CNAME record rather than an explicit A record. In the
following examples, the addresses of the backup DNS and mail
servers are specified with separate A records, even though they
point to the same machine.

GOING IN REVERSE

The database file for the IP address domain handles the reverse
lookups.

The records and their formats are essentially the same as those in
the previous examples, except that PTR records are used instead of
A records. PTR records contain a host name to associate with the IP
address that is in the first field of the record. The foo.com.rev
file that corresponds to the foo.com network is shown in Listing 4.

Listings 5 and 6 show sample localhost.zone and localhost.rev
files, respectively, providing forward and reverse address lookups
for the loopback address. Listings 7 and 8 show sample files for
the all-zeros and all-ones addresses. These files are provided only
for completeness and security.

Finally, if the local name server cannot resolve a name, the query
is forwarded to a name server higher up on the domain name tree.
The named.

cache file contains the addresses of the top-level DNS servers. You
should periodically download this file from the Internet Network
Information Center (InterNIC) at
ftp://rs.internic..net/domain/named.cache. (This file
is also called named.root and named.
ca.) Listing 9 shows an abbreviated version of the current
named.cache file. The single dot (.) indicates the root domain; the
"3600000" is the TTL value, indicating that these entries should
expire after about six weeks (3.6 million seconds).

WHY MAINTAIN YOUR OWN DNS?

If most ISPs are willing to maintain a DNS for their customers, why
would a company or organisation consider operating its own? The
most obvious and pressing reason is that not all ISPs will provide
this service.

However, even if the service is available, a site might want to run
its own DNS for other reasons. One might be to have more control
and to ensure the database's accuracy. If you constantly move
systems around, change host names, and/or changes IP addresses,
your ISP may not keep the DNS as up-to-date as you would like-or
need it to be.

Another issue is reverse name mapping; some ISPs keep reverse name
information only for servers-not the individual host systems. In
this case, users may not be able to connect to ftp or other
information servers that attempt to reconcile the user's host name
with the IP address. Furthermore, as your site grows in size and
complexity, your ISP may be unable to meet your needs.

AND THAT'S NOT ALL

Running a DNS is not terribly hard, but you must be careful when
creating the databases. You must update the DNS files whenever a
system name or address change is made. The serial number

must be appropriately updated whenever you make a change. The most
up-to-date named.cache file must be periodically downloaded from
the InterNIC. You also have to manage zone transfers, which is the
procedure for moving DNS data between primary and secondary name
servers. These procedures require planning. The example used in
this article is a simple case of a small LAN attached tothe
Internet. If you understand the DNS, you can manage your servers;
this way, you know the servers will be up-do-date.  LAN

NETWORKS: Performance Grading Gets Four Stars

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Microtest, in cooperation with industry leaders, introduced the
concept of performance grading-as opposed to simply identifying
pass or fail conditions-to provide a more accurate assessment of
the quality of Category 5 links. In the past, it seemed acceptable
to only know if a link passed or not. If you got a green light, you
considered the link to be OK.

A simple passing indicator was acceptable because different cables
appeared to have fairly equal performance factors. In fact, TSB-67
had been written with this binary form of testing in mind. Today,
however, the performance of Category 5 cables varies widely,
especially if you buy cable from more than one vendor. For example,
you may find that one vendor's cable barely passes TSB-67
requirements, while another vendor's cable tests the signal-to-
noise ratio 60 times better.

Performance grading has several advantages. For one, users can
differentiate marginally compliant links from superior links. This
ability helps identify those links that offer longer life and lower
transmission error rates and that support higher-speed
applications. Also, you can measure the product's quality, assuming
you obtain the cable from the same supplier (that is, the cables'
performance factors are approximately the same). Such data can help
you evaluate whether your cable installation team will need more
training before the next job.

Performance grading rates the quality of Category 5 links that pass
in terms of near-end crosstalk (NEXT). The idea here, similar to
standard NEXT tests, is to measure the amount of NEXT at a variety
of frequencies within the cable's operating bandwidth. The
difference is that the performance grade is based on a range of
acceptable NEXT values (in decibels) at each frequency.

As shown in the figure, Microtest divides the range of acceptable
NEXT values into seven quality bands, each 3 dB apart at the 100
MHz end of the spectrum. This tester indicates whether the link
passes, as well as the quality band within which it operates. For
example, a cable exhibiting performance shown in the figure would
pass at quality band three. If you're interested in upgrading your
existing PentaScanner to include performance grading, Microtest
offers the PentaScanner 350 upgrade kit.  LAN

NETWORKS: Reading the Cable Meter

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

A lot can go wrong beneath the casings of your network's coiled
connectors. Peek into your cabling infrastructure using these cable
testing techniques.

Did you ever take your car in for major transmission or carburetor
work, only to have the mechanic point out the belts showing through
what's left of your tires' tread? When dealing with a complex
system, it is sometimes the simplest component that we tend to
neglect. But when those components fail, the effect on the system
as a whole can be as devastating as a major component failure.

Network cabling provides a medium for the transport of data among
users, servers, printers, switches, and routers within your
network. Any cable that isn't contributing to the flow of data will
seriously degrade or even halt your network operations.

Inadequate cabling is one of the most common causes of network
problems, so don't take your cabling infrastructure for granted.
Cabling requires the same kind of careful troubleshooting,
monitoring, and maintenance routines that you implement for your
network's other systems. Not utilising preventive testing and
effective troubleshooting procedures on your cabling will
eventually backfire on you. The results of such neglect will
certainly give you migraines and probably make you wish you had
chosen a different line of work.

How do you ensure that your cables are installed properly and not
the cause of any network glitches? Whether you're checking a recent
implementation or trying to fix a problem on an operational
network, a cable tester is the most ef fective tool for certifying
whether the network's wiring is capable of transmitting data
successfully. The proper implementation of proactive testing using
a cable tester helps minimise network downtime and eliminates a
great deal of stress when cable problems do arise.

WHERE IT HAPPENS

Cable testing takes place within the Physical layer of the OSI
reference model. The Physical layer defines the transmission of
bits through a medium, and standards at this layer specify the
electrical characteristics of the signal, cable, and connector pin-
outs. As you know, the most written-about cable types today is
Category 5 UTP wiring, which supports the 100 Mbps data traffic
found in networks running on protocols such as Ethernet, Fast
Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI.

Most cable testers, such as Fluke's DSP-100, run tests to certify
whether a Category 5 cable installation meets the requirements for
passing data. Testers are available that allow you to test other
cabling media, such as multimode and single-mode optical fibre and
thin and thick wire coaxial cable. However, if you need to test at
layers above the Physical layer, such as the Data-link layer or
higher, you'll need a protocol analyser.

When should you perform cable testing? The obvious answer is when
users begin to experience problems, but that type of reactive
problem-solving is not desirable, especially for cable testing. Any
cable testing procedure you attempt after problems have already
occurred will certainly be pressured and stressful. And even so,
users will often have to wait until you fix the problem before they
can return to work.

Sometimes these situations are unavoidable, however. When you find
yourself under the gun to restore the network's functionality due
to an emerging problem, such as slow or no response from network
resources, your first step should be to utilise your network
management software or protocol analyser to determine the part of
the network that is at fault. If the cabling and connectors are
identified as the culprits, a high-quality cable tester and knowing
how to use it will prove invaluable.

By far, the best time to test your cables is immediately after
they've been installed. This proactive testing philosophy will pay
off by minimising problems that could plague your network in the
future and by making the process a more pleasant experience for
you. Concentrate on testing before problems occur-not only once the
installation is complete, but periodically, as well. Preventive
maintenance is your greatest ally against network problems of any
kind. The result will be a more reliable network and much happier
and productive users.

COMMON CABLE FAULTS

It's worth repeating that cabling problems rank very high as the
cause of networking troubles. Mechanical elements, such as cabling,
connectors, and wall plates, tend to fail more often than active
electronic devices such as network adapters and switches. It's also
much easier to make unnoticeable mistakes when installing wiring
and connectors. Thus, if you're experiencing connection problems or
excessive delay, there's a good chance the cabling infrastructure
is at fault.

Of those problems that do stem from cabling and connectors,
approximately 85 per cent are caused by a faulty installation, not
from product defects. Cable installation errors come in all forms.
For example, a technician working on the corporate telephone system
could accidentally snip a network cable, or a cable installer could
improperly attach a connector to the cable or exceed distance
limitations for a particular cable run. These errors may have a
large or small effect on the network, depending on which user or
server cable was cut or improperly installed.

Intermittent problems are generally caused by improper splices,
poor connector attachments, lack of termination, and corrosion. A
cable will maximally transfer the energy of a data signal as long
as the impedance within the cable remains constant. However, a
signal encountering a sharp change in impedance will produce
reflections. Reflections occur when a signal is reflected in the
direction from which it came, causing a potential collision with
itself or another signal.

Reflection occurs most often when there is lack of termination on
the cable. Cable terminators are there to absorb the power and
dissipate it as heat, making the cable seem infinitely long to the
traveling signal. If a terminator is missing, a signal will reach
the end of the cable and be met with a difference in impedance in
the air that surrounds the cable's exposed end, causing a
reflection. In addition to lack of termination, improper splices
and poor connector attachments may cause reflections.

Cabling ailments can also cause excessive attenuation, decreasing
the amount of signal power that reaches the receiving device. This
situation causes the signal-to-noise ratio to decrease, leading to
greater transmission errors.

In very few instances, the cable you buy may not meet
specifications. Even if you buy from a reputable vendor, there is
that chance that the cable you've purchased has severe
imperfections. Therefore, you should make it a habit to test the
cable before installation.

CABLE TEST LINEUP

Before you purchase or utilise a cable tester, you should
understand what they can do. First of all, cable testing is
intrusive, meaning you can't support normal data traffic over the
cable while running tests. Of course, if you're in the middle of
implementing the cable plant, there won't yet be any users. But, if
you're troubleshooting an active cable segment, you will have to
bring down the cable on which you are working. Lastly, and more
importantly, cable testers that comply with the Technical Services
Bulletin (TSB) -67 standard, which was approved in October 1995 by
the EIA/TIA 568A committee, perform a series of four tests to
ensure your cable installation is adequate.

These tests are: Wire map, link length, attenuation, and near-end
crosstalk (NEXT). A new offshoot of cable testing, performance
grading, may be of help, as well (see "Performance Grading Gets
Four Stars").

The wire map test ensures that a link has proper connectivity by
testing for continuity and other installation errors. Continuity
tests verify that the wire is not broken and that physical
connectivity exists throughout the connectors and cabling. Thus,
the wire map test will tell you if, as in our previous example,
someone accidentally cut the cable. Sometimes during installation
the installer may inadvertently fail to connect the wires on one
connector pin to the corresponding pin on the opposite end of the
cable. This, of course, will not facilitate a connection-the wire
map test verifies proper pairing of wiring on opposite ends of the
cable.

The twisting of wires in UTP minimises induction of current flow
from other devices that may be emanating electromagnetic waves,
such as nearby wires. A Category 5 cable includes four individually
twisted pairs of wires. If you don't wire your RJ-45 connectors
exactly according to a standard, such as EIA/TIA 568A, T568A or
T568B wiring scheme, then you may produce split pairs. A split pair
occurs when you attach the connector in such a way that a wire pair
consists of one lead from one twisted pair and another lead from a
different twisted pair, creating a pair of wires that are
untwisted. The split pair configuration provides a path for data to
flow, but problems can occur. Of issue is the resulting untwisted
wire pair, which will encounter an excessive amount of external
noise interference and crosstalk, causing transmission errors.
Cable testers do a good job of detecting the existence of split
pairs.

Link length measurement tests tell you whether the cable meets the
length requirements specified by the T568B cabling standard. Cable
testers use a device called a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) to
determine the length of a cable. The TDR also indicates if there
are any improper cable splices or terminations.

As shown in Figure 1 (page 54), The TDR tests cables based on the
principle of reflections. The TDR connects to an end of a cable the
technician wishes to test, then sends a signal throughout the
cable. This signal reflects off changes in impedance, especially at
the end of the cable, and the amplitude of the reflected wave
corresponds to the degree of impedance mismatch.

The TDR records the amount of time between the test signal's
departure and its return, which constitutes the signal delay. It
then calculates the distance to the reflecting point based on the
speed of the signal and signal delay.

Several products on the market today run TDR tests on metallic or
fibre optic cable. For example, the Tektronix TS100 Option 01
Metallic TDR tests LocalTalk; Type 1 and Type 3 cables; Category 3,
4, and 5 cables; and thin and thick coax cables. This test set
finds shorts, ends, and breaks in the cable. The Tektronix TFP2A
Fibermaster Optical TDR (OTDR) tests single-mode and multimode
fibre optic cables.

A data signal loses power while traversing the length of a cable.
This loss of power is called attenuation. For metallic and fibre
cabling, attenuation increases linearly as a function of cable
length. However, radio signal attenuation increases exponentially
with greater distances. If too much attenuation is present between
source and destination, electrical noise becomes significant and
transmission errors will occur more frequently. Attenuation tests
help you identify problems such as manufacturing defects and
corrosion.

Many LANs, including Ethernet and Token Ring, utilise digital
signals to carry information among network devices. A digital
signal contains a series of discrete voltage levels that represent
the 1s and 0s of the data signal. In the time domain, which you can
render visually with an oscilloscope, a digital signal appears to
contain only DC (0 Hz) characteristics, such as positive 5 volts
for a logic 1 and negative 5 volts for a logic 0. However, a
digital signal's sharp changes of amplitude cause the signal to
contain very high frequency components. You can observe this effect
by viewing the signal's frequency characteristics on a spectrum
analyser.

In addition to cable length, the amount of attenuation is also a
function of frequency. Most cables will offer more attenuation to
higher frequency signals than to lower frequency signals. Thus,
cabling acts as a low pass filter, smoothing out the sharp edges of
the digital signal.

Cable testers examine attenuation by measuring the effects of
sending a series of signals that step through the cable's operating
frequency bandwidth. For Category 5 testing, most cable testers
cover bandwidth ranging from 1 MHz to 100 MHz by taking readings in
1 MHz increments. This process certifies whether the cable meets
specifications in the part of the frequency spectrum where the
signal mostly resides. For Category 3 links, the frequency test
range is 1 MHz through 16 MHz.

The cable tester will report a passing grade if all frequencies
pass specifications. If a cable fails, the tester will tell you the
frequency at which it didn't meet requirements. Some testers also
indicate the amount of attenuation per foot. Cable testers are
available that work with metallic or fibre cable. For example,
Microtest's PentaScanner measures attenuation (as well as many
other impairments) on Category 3, 4, and 5 cable, and AMP's AM9100
tests single-mode, multimode, and plastic fibre cables for
attenuation.

NEXT is a specific case in which signals at one end of the link
interfere with weaker signals that are coming back from the
recipient. Current flow resulting from the difference of potential
impressed by the data signal consists of electrons that move
through a metallic wire. This stream of electrons creates an
electromagnetic field around the wire that may induce the flow of
electrons in an adjacent wire. This crossing of the signal into a
different wire is called crosstalk.

You may have experienced voice signal crosstalk while talking on
the telephone, probably in the form of another audible con
versation occurring during a telephone call. Sometimes crosstalk
occurs if you add a telephone line to your home and utilise both
telephones at the same time. The close proximity of the wire pairs
allows the signals to cross.

Causes of crosstalk generally include improper wire placement and
inadequate shielding. The twisting of wire, as is the case with UTP
cable, offers some resistance to crosstalk and other interfering
signals. Shielded twisted pair and coaxial cable offer a further
degree of protection. But fibre optic cable is completely immune to
crosstalk because fibre uses light rather than current flow to
transport the data. The flow of light through the fibre's core does
not produce an electromagnetic field that couples to nearby fibres.

In addition to crosstalk, networks may encounter the induction of
external electrical noise. This noise can become significant in
relation to the signal power, setting up the potential for errors.
The noise that causes these problems within network cabling is
usually Gaussian or impulse noise. Gaussian noise has nearly
uniform amplitude across the frequency spectrum and primarily
results from thermal conditions in the atmosphere. Impulse noise,
though, is typically the outcome of human-made devices such as
light switches, spark plugs, and heating coils. Impulse noise
typically occurs in short blasts, causing transmission errors to
occur in bursts. As with crosstalk, external noise produces an
electromagnetic field that causes unwanted currents to flow through
metallic data cables.

The amount of NEXT varies erratically as you sweep through the
operating bandwidth of a cable. For an accurate measurement, cable
testers record NEXT by stepping though the cable's operating
frequency range at very small increments. For Category 5 cable,
TSB-67 recommends a maximum step sise of 0.15 MHz for lower
frequencies and 0.25 MHz for higher frequencies within the 1 MHz
through 100 MHz frequency range. It requires a fast instrument to
test the hundreds of samples.

Fluke's DSP-100 handheld cable tester is a fast performer of NEXT
tests. The DSP-100 utilises digital signal processing to increase
its speed and to allow samples to be taken at close 100 KHz
intervals. The DSP-100 performs all tests required by TSB-67 for a
four-pair cable in under 20 seconds. This tester not only
identifies the presence of crosstalk, it also locates its source.

SKEWING THE DATA

The use of plenum cable continues to grow. However, there has been
a shortage of the Teflon that manufacturers use as a protective
cable coating. As a result, cable manufacturers now use a non-
Teflon coating on one or two of the four pairs in Category 5 cable.
These cables are known as "3+1" or "2+2" cables. These cables fully
meet Category 5 crosstalk and attenuation requirements, but the
difference in coatings offer unacceptable skew. Skew is the maximum
difference in propagation delay between the pair in a cable.

According to a white paper developed by Microtest, the use of 3+1
and 2+2 cables makes it vitally important that your cable tester
measure skew to avoid inaccurate length measurements and other
troubles. Because cable testers base the length calculation on
delay, the skew will introduce a range of lengths. For example, a
tester may report lengths 97, 97, 99, and 108 metres for each of
the four pairs of a 3+1 cable.

The problem of skew is more significant than simply causing some
bizarre length readings. Several high-speed LAN technologies, such
as 100Base-T4 and 100VG-AnyLAN, employ all four pairs of the
Category 5 cable. These schemes disassemble the signal into several
parts, send them down separate pairs, then reassemble the signal at
the far end. These standards expect each part of the signal to
arrive at the distant end at about the same time. However, if one
part of the signal leads or lags the others by too much, the
receive buffer cannot keep up with information transfer.

The 100Base-T4 skew requirement is a maximum of 50 nanoseconds;
however, some experts suggest a skew of no more than 35
nanoseconds. The TIA is expected to incorporate skew test standards
within a year. Today, Microtest provides upgrades to users of their
tester, PentaScanner, free of charge to include the capability to
measure skew.

A cable tester is a requirement to effectively implement and
maintain your network.

If you don't already have one, you should add a cable tester to
your toolbox. As with all network troubleshooting, the key is to be
proactive in testing to avoid problems cropping up at inopportune
times.  LAN

NETWORKS: Fault-Tolerance and Fault-Resilience

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

How tolerant are your networks? How much downtime can you really
afford? Don't live in a glass house: Here are several products and
strategies that improve network integrity.

100 per cent fault-tolerant network is a goal that can be
approached but never achieved. According to a white paper from
Vinca, a developer of fault-protection technology, "Downtime costs
are significant. The typical PC LAN is unavailable to all users 1.6
hours per week. In a 300-user network, this downtime costs
US$840,000 per year in productivity losses." Network Integrity,
another manufacturer of fault-resilient server software, estimates
the cost of a single server's downtime to be in the range of
US$50,000 to US$170,000 per year.

Today, networks are supporting a greater number of mission-critical
applications such as international financial arbitrage
transactions, where any downtime can cost millions of dollars.

GIVE 'EM THE RAS

Today, a relatively new industry in high-availability networks is
emerging. It focuses on eliminating single points of failure to
provide networks that are reliable, available, and scalable.

High-availability or RAS networks run the gamut from those that
must be available 99.99 per cent of the time to those that can
tolerate minor downtime while redundant components initialise,
providing 98 per cent availability. The spectrum runs from fault-

tolerant, where any network fault can be tolerated without taking
down the resource, to fault-resilient, where downtime is measured
in seconds to minutes. The fault may momentarily interrupt network
resources, but the resiliency of the network allows the resource to
become available with minimal downtime.

Integrators can configure hubs, switches, bridges, and routers with
passive backplanes, redundant power supplies, and management
modules so they do not become single points of failure. The network
topology can be configured to route traffic to mission-critical
resources via alternate paths. Some newer topologies, such as FDDI,
implement redundant rings on the same network.

I categorise server failures into five primary areas:

Application/NLM failures causing the server to ABEND;

Network operating system ABENDs;

Failure of disk drives, controllers, and NICs;

Power supply failures; and

System electronic component failures (such as memory and
motherboards).

In time, technology has made great strides in relation to the
integrity and availability of server data storage. RAID technology
allows data to be stored redundantly across several physical disk.
With redundant power supplies, controllers and channels in the disk
subsystems, and hot-swappable drives (drives that can be replaced
without taking the disk subsystem off-line), data storage is no
longer a point of failure in the network.

Uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), backup generators, isolated
circuits and alternate electrical power points-of-presence in newer
buildings tend to eliminate raw electrical power as another single
point of failure in a network.

SERVER SAVERS

Most server hardware manufacturers offer redundant power supplies.
Error correcting memory prevents memory error failures. Many
network operating systems offer the ability to configure multiple
NICs on the same segment, preventing a NIC from becoming a single
point of failure. Multiple disk controller cards can be configured
to RAID systems to eliminate these circuit boards as a single point
of failure. The server's motherboard and processor remain the
largest single point of failure on the network.

Servers are prone to several kinds of failures. Hardware failures
are the first that come to mind, and they are the easiest to
address. Component redundancy is the first line of defense. Server
redundancy is the second. Many solutions exist for server
redundancy, from hot-spare servers to servers mirrored via high-
speed links.

Other types of server failures are harder to address. Today, the
most common server failures come from the server NOS or application
ABENDs. Fault-tolerant solutions that mirror each server
transaction are prone to mirroring the errors that led to the
ABEND, leaving a hole in the fault-tolerant armor. In some
situations, fault-resilient solutions that provide hot spares or
live, hot servers (servers already booted and waiting to replace
the failed server) actually provide better fault-tolerance.

Early attempts to make servers fault-resilient involved configuring
them with external redundant disk subsystems. Integrators could
configure the system so that hot spares (or redundant servers
provisioned with sufficient memory), NICs, and disk controllers
could be swapped with failed servers. The network administrator
simply needed to switch the disk subsystem and network cables to
the hot spare and reboot the server. However, this process had a
significant drawback: time. Identifying and swapping out a failed
server could take several minutes. Today, with many gigabytes or
even terabytes of storage in a disk subsystem, rebooting a hot-
spare server might take up to 30 minutes.

If you can tolerate that much downtime, this fault-resilient
solution is the most economical. And its significant advantage over
other fault-resilient implementations is that a single, redundant
server can be a hot spare to many active servers.

MIRROR, MIRROR

More advanced solutions provide server mirroring or clustering
between servers and multiported disk subsystems via high-speed
links. A mirrored server can take over the operation of a primary
server if it becomes unavailable. Mirrored solutions come in both
fault-tolerant and fault-resilient implementations. If the mirrored
server takes over and users are unaware of the change, the system
is fault-tolerant. In a fault-resilient solution, either the server
has to reboot or users need to reinitialise their login,
application, or transaction.

Another advantage of the mirrored/clustered server approach is
protection against natural disasters. By placing mirrored servers
in separate geographical locations, you can mitigate the effects of
such events.

Many network software applications handle fault-resilience
autonomously. For example, database servers (Oracle, Sybase,
Microsoft SQL, and so on) often have a transaction rollback option.
Before a user updates, modifies, or deletes a record, a "snapshot"
of that record is written to a transient area of the disk. If the
update is successful, the snapshot is disregard.

If a failure occurs during the update process, the database rolls
back to the snapshot information. The snapshot is written back to
the appropriate records when the database again becomes available.
This process ensures database integrity for almost any fault-
tolerant/fault-resilient solution. Novell's NOS implements
transaction tracking-its version of transaction rollback-as a
general file attribute.

Novell was one of the first proponents of fault-tolerance and
fault-resilience; in the early 1980s, it outlined a strategic
direction called System Fault Tolerance, or SFT. The company
quickly delivered SFT levels I and II; SFT III was delivered seven
years later.

SFT I, named Hot Fix, involves redirection of bad disk blocks. SFT
II, known as Disk Mirroring or Disk Duplexing, provides hardware
redundancy for the disks. SFT II was the forerunner of RAID Level
I. SFT III implements server mirroring. Two servers connected via
high-speed media provide redundancy for most NOS functions. If one
server suffers a hardware failure, the mirrored server takes over
operation without interruption or data loss.

SFT III is a reengineering of NetWare, dividing its functionality
into two distinct parts. The NOS's hardware-specific functions,
such as disk drivers, NIC drivers, or print servers, are included
in the Input/Output (I/O) engine on the server. The I/O engine is
unique to each server in a mirrored pair. The remaining logical
functions of the NOS are included in the Mirror/Server (M/S)
engine, which is common to both servers. The I/O engines are linked
to the M/S engines by a series of four queues. The servers are
physically linked by a high-speed medium called the Mirrored Server
Link (MSL).

While this solution provides true fault-tolerance, it is limited to
mostly hardware-oriented failures. According to Vinca, recent
studies show that 70 percent of server failures are due to software
disjunction. Runway NLMs or NOS errors will likely be duplicated in
both the primary and mirrored servers. Furthermore, I/O engine
functions such as server-based print services, routing (such as
TCP/IP), and Macintosh support will not be mirrored. If these
components fail, manual intervention is needed to reconfigure and
redeploy the system. Configuring alternative resources to the
server for network print serving or TCP/IP routing may make SFT III
a tighter, fault-tolerant solution. NetWare 4.1 SFT III addresses
the TCP/IP and Apple protocol problems.

SFT III is an elegant solution. It provides true hardware fault-
tolerance in the NetWare environment. It is a well-established,
secure environment for tested and stable server applications.
However, one drawback of SFT III is cost. An SFT III solution
cannot be clustered in a one-to-many mirrored server configuration,
but only as a one-to-one, primary-to-mirrored server solution (see
Figure 1).

BEYOND SFT III

While Novell led the pack in the small to medium uniprocessor
server environment, NCR developed a fault-resilient solution called
LifeKeeper. LifeKeeper is designed for the Unix operating system
and all NOSs that run on Unix, including Microsoft LAN MAN LMX and
NetWare for Unix.

LifeKeeper, an add-on to NCR's Unix, lets up to eight clustered
symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) servers share an external disk
subsystem. Each server can maintain its own space on the sub-system
or share space with the other processors. The servers maintain
redundant links and monitor the heartbeat of the other servers via
the SCSI bus, EIA serial connections, and the network media (see
Figure 2).

The servers may be configured in an active-active or active-passive
configuration. In the active-active scenario, each server acts as
an autonomous server. If one of the active servers fails,
LifeKeeper switches applications and communications interfaces to
another active server in the cluster. This server performs the
functions of the failed server as well as its own. In the active-
passive scenario, the passive server does no processing of its own;
it waits to take over for a failed server. The system may be
configured in an n+1 design, with one passive server for up to
seven active ones. The servers need not be the same size as long as
they reside on the same segments and have sufficient memory.

Because LifeKeeper servers are constantly running and monitoring
the heartbeats of other servers, they do not have to reboot as the
affected server.

The LifeKeeper server takes over the failed server's disk and
handles TCP/IP readdressing, so users remain connected and logged
in to the "new" server. However, because the secondary server does
not maintain the failed server's cache, users must resubmit current
transactions or reattach to current server-based applications.

Because a minor time delay occurs between the primary server going
down and the secondary one taking over, and because users have to
reinitialise their applications (not their server connections),
LifeKeeper is a fault-resilient, not a fault-tolerant, solution.

Vinca offers a fault-tolerant hardware/software suite that runs on
many manufacturers' servers. StandbyServer 32 is a server-mirroring
solution that connects a warm, on-line secondary server directly to
the main file server. Data is automatically mirrored to the standby
machine via a high-speed, dedicated link that does not add traffic
to the network. When the main server fails, StandbyServer 32
automatically switches operations to the secondary machine. Users
are back on-line in a matter of minutes. StandbyServer 32 runs on
NetWare, Windows NT, and OS/2 Warp.

Microsoft depends on server vendors and third parties to provide
fault-tolerant/fault-resilient solutions for Windows NT servers.
NCR recently launched two add-ons for fault-resilient NT servers.
The company migrated many of its Unix RAS features to NT and is in
the process of porting LifeKeeper to it. You can buy LifeKeeper for
NT as an add-on to the operating system. A version of LifeKeeper
Lite is included free with NCR's OEM version of Windows NT.
LifeKeeper Lite provides one-to-one server mirroring, but it does
not accomplish TCP/IP readdressing. As such, users are required to
log in to the "new" server. Vinca's StandbyServer is also a server-
mirroring solution for Windows NT.

USING A STAND-IN

Stand-in technology enables one server to stand in for a failed
server. When a server fails, the stand-in server immediately
appears to be another, specific server on the network. Users can
continue working in their current applications; however, access to
other files is slow. A stand-in server must reboot to gain access
to files that were not in use during the crash. A secondary NetWare
server can appear to be a primary one if you reboot it under the
primary server's name. The caveat, though, is that this rebooting
process can take up to 30 minutes.

Network Integrity's LANtegrity product is a hybrid of stand-in and
fault-

tolerant technologies. With the product, one server can instantly
appear to be one of several protected servers. The stand-in server
technology is layered on top of data vault technologies, which
create and maintain a secure, managed storage hierarchy of all
current and historical data.

In addition to presenting itself as the downed server, a stand-in
server must make users' data instantly available. LANtegrity does
not use data-mirroring or multiported data storage technologies;
instead, it uses another software piece called Intelligent Data
Vault.

To enable recovery from any kind of failure-even those that corrupt
data-the data vault is "archival," which means the data vault
contains the current version of data plus earlier versions, all of
which are accessible during stand-in.

LANtegrity's stand-in server presents an identical security and
file system image to the downed server's users while continuing to
be the LANtegrity server to the other protected ones. The
LANtegrity server is never rebooted and can support multiple downed
servers. It maintains an image of the server's memory.

The stand-in image of the downed server is created by manipulating
the incoming file access communications packets. Users can continue
working on their files, but the server may have to reconnect to get
access to other files.

Network Integrity's solution does not involve a significant amount
of disk storage. The Intelligent Data Vault organises itself into a
self-managed storage hierarchy. The most recently active data
resides in its disk, which acts as a cache at the top of the
storage hierarchy. All current protected data is available via a
high-capacity tape autoloader. Earlier versions of files and
deleted files are migrated to a managed, off-line shelf storage on
tape.

Stand-in technology takes the top two components of this storage
hierarchy and makes them appear and operate identically to the
downed server's file system. This process is significantly slower
when accessing files not in cache at the time of the server
failure. Earlier versions of files can be "restored" from the
LANtegrity server into its own stand-in image of the failed server.
Even if the failed server's software corrupted a file while downing
the server, an earlier version of the file is available for use.

The data vault layer poses significant technical challenges when
collecting and managing the data. To maintain a reasonably current
image of all the protected data at a manageable rate, traditional
backup methods are unacceptable; they depend on "full" backups,
which create significant network traffic. LANtegrity's data vault
never copies the same file over the network twice. Only changed
files are copied. As a result, replication opens the door to
continuous protection.

LANtegrity is an example of a fault-resilient solution that
provides full, immediate (within 15 seconds) server access (clients
must reattach and log in) but not full server functionality. The
transactions, applications, and files in use just prior to the
server failure are immediately available.

HARDWARE FAULT-TOLERANCE

Fault-tolerance/fault-resilience is not limited to just the network
operating system or its add-ons. Many hardware vendors include
fault-tolerant features as part of their hardware designs.

For example, NetFrame Systems introduced two fault-tolerant
technologies in its serves: MultiProcessing Parallel Server
Architecture (MPSA) and Gemini. MPSA is built into every
ClusterServer. A system of redundant components, combined with
every high data throughput, minimises downtime-scheduled and
unscheduled.

In Gemini mode, two Intel 100 MHz Pentium processor/ cache modules
operate in tandem. The secondary module backs up the primary one,
instantly taking over all operations in the event of a processor,
cache, or bus interface fault.

NetFrame's technologies also include Channelstart, which allows the
system to recover from transient I/O errors or failures; the
operation is transparent to users. All I/O transactions are safely
recorded while Channelstart clears the error condition, resets the
appropriate hardware, initialises the drivers, and resumes normal
operations.

Tricord Systems, a server manufacturer, markets a line of fault-
tolerant servers called Power-Frame. PowerFrame's design includes a
passive backplane to eliminate the motherboard as a single point of
failure. All active electronic components are isolated to
independent, intelligent subsystems that are hot-pluggable into the
passive backplane.

All subsystems can be redundantly configured or protected with hot
spares, so no major subsystem failure impacts the server operation.

Tricord was one of the first manufacturers to embrace Novell's SFT
III. The entire line of PowerFrame servers support full
implementations of SFT III on mirrored configurations.

CONCLUSION

Fault-tolerance/fault-resilience lets mission-critical systems
operate with minimal downtime, but it does not come cheap.
Redundant components eliminate many of the single points of
failure, but they almost double the hardware costs. Simple
arithmetic can determine whether the "statistically" projected
downtime costs justify the cost of a fault-tolerant or fault-
resilient solution.

Some many-to-one cluster "hot server" designs help lower the costs
per server. In the end, however, the critical nature of the
applications and the availability of data to the users will
determine whether you choose a fault-tolerant or a fault-resilient
solution.  LAN

NETWORKS: Beyond Static Web Pages

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Enhancing static web pages with dynamic media such as audio, video,
animation and interactivity.

When the World Wide Web (WWW) revolutionised the Internet with a
graphically-rich environment in the early nineties, the world
forgot that interactive multimedia delivered on CD-ROM discs was
far more dynamic and captivating. After all, the first web pages
was at best, static, with a few static and low-resolution graphic
images littered across text-centric content.

On the other hand, CD-ROMs were already filled with 16-bit audio,
multi-windowed QuickTime and MPEG video, as well as smooth 3D
animations and walkthroughs. Also, CD-ROMs often delivered
interactivity through the use of graphical buttons that provided
not only visual but audio feedback to the users. On the web, all
you could see then were hypertext links.

When Marc Andressen stepped out of the Mosaic world and started the
Netscape Navigator (or Mozilla) revolution, he created an
extensible web browser model that allowed third-party developers to
add plug-ins to it. Plug-ins for Netscape Navigator are similar in
concept to Adobe Photoshop plug-ins and Macromedia Director Xtras,
allowing enhanced features to programs without requiring complete
software recompilations and upgrades. The plug-in concept also
frees the main software vendors into focusing on delivering core
features without sacrificing execution speed. For example,
Microsoft is mostly guilty of designing programs that grow in
features but become cumbersome in size and speed.

It was not until Netscape Navigator 2.x that plug-ins became
viable. With the aggressive stance Netscape took in capturing the
web market, Microsoft retaliated with its own architecture, but
could not overturn the colossal tide that Netscape created in
capturing about 80 per cent of the web browser market. Today,
Microsoft concedes that its own Internet Explorer will always be
free for downloads and that version 3.0 will embrace Netscape's
enhanced features such as frame, Javascript and of course, plug-
ins.

What are some of the plug-ins available for Netscape Navigator
today?

The main plug-ins that are widely adopted include Macromedia's
Shockwave for Director 4 plug-in (several million downloads) and
Progressive Networks Real Audio (RA) plug-in. Other up-and-coming
plug-ins that we will discuss briefly include TotallyHip's Sizzler
plug-in, Geo's Emblaze, Acrobat PDF, and Macromedia's other
Shockwave versions.

Shockwave for Director 4.x is perhaps the most interesting for web
users, since it encases audio, animation, pseudo-video, and full
interactivity within a secure environment. We are already familiar
with frustrated users across the web who discovered the many flaws
of Java and Javascript, especially in the area of network security.
And since Java is an open architecture, malicious hackers have
already written many Java applets to attack networks.

Shockwave for Director 4.x is different. It uses a BASIC-like
scripting language known as LINGO, which has been "adjusted" for
the web to disallow most file input and output operations, thereby
reducing security risk to a minimum, far safer than Java and
Javascript. And because it encases all media components into a
compiled "applet", users will not be able to make changes to it,
nor will they be able to copy media components easily, unlike Java-
created animations, which are nothing more than a "flipbook" effect
created by calling a series of still images.

We should discuss Macromedia Director briefly so that you
understand its relationship with Shockwave. Director is a
multimedia development environment which uses the film production
paradigm, with a built-in scripting language LINGO.

When you have completed your multimedia production, you save the
file to the hard disk as an uncompiled document (.DIR format).
Under Director 4.x, you use the freely-distributed Afterburner
application to compress the document up to 60 per cent using the
LZW (Lempel Ziv) lossless compression algorithm, and save the
document as a Shockwave document (.DCR). Now the .DCR document can
be served on the web effectively through the Shockwave for Director
4 plug-in.

The next step for a webmaster is to ensure that his server allows
such MIME extensions. You simply include a single line in the
"mime.types" file in the "conf" sub-directory in your "httpd"
directory (see figure 1).

Notice that I have included several MIME types that we will talk
about here, including Real Audio (RA) and QuickTime Video (QT or
MOV).

After you have empowered your server to accept and deliver such
MIME types, you would allow your web pages to embed such data and
to allow non-compatible browsers to know what's going on.

First, note that it is a self-running Macromedia Shockwave for
Director 4.x web page featuring audio and animation (see figure 2).

In your HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document, you simply add a
line that EMBEDS the .DCR document and another line that allows
non-compatible browsers or Netscape browsers without the Shockwave
plug-in to see a static image using the NOEMBED command (see figure
3).

Here's another 2 web pages featuring interactivity with the user
(see figures 4 and 5 on this page).

You will notice that the HTML codes to drive these interactive .DCR
files are identical to the self-running version above (see figure
6).

Some of the constraints of the web means that when you author your
Shockwave documents, you must watch out for a few things. First,
bandwidth issues mean that you must try to optimise your graphics
down to as low a bit depth as possible. And try to reduce the frame
rates of your self-running animation to perhaps, 5 fps. Also,
Netscape does not reproduce all 256 colors in its internal color
palette, so you may have to optimise your 8-bit colour graphic
components down to 6- or 7-bits in colour depth.

Also, Shockwave does not recognise tempo settings in Director 4.x.
So if you need delays in your applet, you need to write LINGO
scripts with embedded DELAY settings. This can set back development
time somewhat since it can be quite tedious.

Another constraint for Shockwave is that unlike Director documents,
it does not support linked media. Therefore, you cannot link
QuickTime or AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) files to the main
document. And because QuickTime cannot be embedded like static
graphics in Director, you cannot really have synchronised video.

The workaround is to export QuickTime videos into 2 files, a PICS
file (a compiled series of static PICT images) and an audio file.
Within Director, import the PICS file and it will be laid out in
the SCORE window using the "CAST TO TIME" command. Then import the
sound file in Channel 1 and adjust the DELAY settings manually (see
figure 7).

Another popular plug-in is Real Audio from Progressive Networks.
Real Audio is a streaming technology which plays as it downloads.
This is beneficial for users connecting to your web site from 14.4
or even 28.8 Kbps modems, since line reliability may be
inconsistent and the speed is slow. Shockwave for Director
currently does not support streaming, and users must download the
entire applet before he knows its usefulness at all.

Real Audio uses a proprietary compression algorithm to compress
audio much more than traditional AIFF or AIFF-C or AU (Sun's native
as well as Internet's common Audio format). A typical AIFF file may
be more than 200 K while a RA file may be one-tenth of the size.
The chart attached (figure 8, page 42) shows the mechanics of how a
Real Audio server works.

From experience, the disadvantage of Real Audio, compared to
Shockwave, is that you need a dedicated server to serve Real Audio
content. If you do not own Real Audio Personal Server or Server 2.x
software, you cannot deliver content from your server. The
workaround is to allow downloadable Real Audio content, and expect
your users to fetch Real Audio players from the Real Audio site.

I have a web page on Jive Joint web site that features downloadable
Real Audio content, the easiest to deliver, although it requires
Real Audio applications on the client's end (see figure 9 below).

The embedded HTML commands look like that shown in figure 10 below.

Other notable up-and-coming plug-ins include Sizzler, Emblaze,
Acrobat PDF, QuickTime and Shockwave for other Macromedia
applications such as Freehand, Director 5 and Authorware.

Sizzler from TotallyHip is a streaming animation plug-in
technology. You can have animations that download and play
progressively (expect some jerkiness and rough, interlaced images
though). The Sizzler image conversion tool on the Macintosh can
convert QuickTime and PICS images into a streaming animation sprite
(.SPR). However, SPR files are much larger than Shockwave, up to
several times, and therefore take up much more space on a server.
The disadvantage of Sizzler is that it does not support embedded
sounds, and you must write a Java script to play sounds separately.
That defeats the purpose of multimedia on the web.

Emblaze from Geo is also a streaming animation tool which uses
Allegiant SuperCard technology to create vector-based animations.
Because it is vector-based, graphics and animations are smaller,
play better, especially on 14.4 Kbps modems. But the Emblaze
Creator (still in beta, and only available on the Macintosh) is
slow and clunky because it was created with a high-level tool,
SuperCard. And because Allegiant still has not delivered a cross-
platform of the SuperCard authoring environment, you are
constrained to author on the Macintosh environment only. The good
news is that Emblaze can play back from Windows (any version) and
Macintosh, and the plug-in itself is a far smaller download than
Shockwave for Director.

Who doesn't talk about digital movies lately? The most common form
of movies are QuickTime and MPEG. Because QuickTime is a far more
extensible technology and can have virtual reality (QuickTime VR)
as well, we will briefly mention it here.

There are several versions of Netscape QuickTime plug-ins available
today, including Apple's own QuickTime plug-in, KM's Multimedia
Plug, and MovieStar.

MovieStar is the most stable, and can work well with Netscape
Navigator 2.x, which most users have. Apple's own QuickTime plug-in
must work with Netscape Navigator 3.x or Gold versions, and since
these versions have yet to become popular, its use is restricted
for now. KM's Multimedia plug-in is only available for the
Macintosh and therefore cannot become mainstream for now.

Adobe has been competing fiercely with Macromedia on the multimedia
and image processing front lately. Adobe took a different approach
to delivering multimedia on the web, relying on its much-acclaimed
Acrobat Portable Document File (PDF) technology. Acrobat documents
today can have embedded movies and sounds, and allow simple
interactivity.

The downside is that Adobe's Acrobat 3.x technology, which allows
the Acrobat PDF Viewer plug-in, is still in beta, and its own Web
Presenter technology based on Adobe Persuasion is also in beta.
Most users are still apprehensive in adopting beta technology. With
the limited functionality of Web Presenter (a slideshow and
outlining tool), users are more comfortable with authoring on
Shockwave for Director now.

Macromedia has also launched Shockwave for Freehand, Authorware and
betas of Director 5. Freehand is an illustration tool, and
Shockwave plug-in for Freehand allows resolution-indenpendent
vector graphics to be viewed on the web. But its functionality is
probably restricted to graphic studios and advertising agencies for
now. Authorware is a computer-based training tool and the Shockwave
for Authorware plug-in, although capable of compressing Authorware
files, still cannot optimise it well for the web. Currently,
Macromedia positions Shockwave for Authorware for intranet
applications only. Shockwave for Director 5 will be a great
product, but is currently available for Power Macintosh and Windows
95 in betas only.

In the November issue, we will discuss in greater detail how to
optimise multimedia content for Netscape Navigator.  LAN

NETWORKS: HOTTER THAN JAVA: LUCENT'S INFERNO PROMISES TO TURN UP THE HEAT

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

This column's focus has always been on the Internet. This makes
sense, of course, because the Internet is networking's hothouse of
innovation. But other major public networks are out there: there's
cable television, the telephone infrastructure, and, for that
matter, there's cellular. At the edges of all these non-Internet
networks-at the point where you and I make our telephone calls and
watch our movies-the terminals are getting smarter.

What do I mean by "smarter"? I'm talking about better CPUs and more
memory. Still, even the upcoming generation of small gadgets won't
have enough horsepower to directly adopt Internet inno vations as
we know them. Java and the latest browsers, though they bring huge
possibilities to a broad range of traditional desktop computers,
require the equivalent of at least a fast 486 chip and a good 4MB
of available memory (that is, 4MB above and beyond the operating
system's own requirements) for high-quality functionality.

THINK SMALL

If you're building a telephone or a set-top box, you can't load it
up with a lot of silicon. You may want to put in a single SIMM's
worth of memory (which is about 1MB these days) and something along
the lines of a 386 CPU. You want to sell your devices in the
several-tens-of-dollars price range, not the several-hundred-
dollars range. And your target volume should far exceed the number
of Compaq Presarios in the world. After all, there are a lot more
small, consumer-oriented gizmos-such as Sharp, Casio, and Apple
PDAs; Sega game computers; smart telephones; and singing microwave
ovens-than there are desktop computers.

The one and only network software player-at least for now-in this
broad market of small, potentially networked gadgets is Lucent
Technologies (Basking Ridge, NJ). When AT&T recently split three
ways, it was Lucent that acquir-ed the bulk of Bell Laboratories
and, therefore, its expert knowledge. Bell Laboratories invented
Unix and C, so it's safe to say that the folks at Lucent know a
little about computers and networking.

Recently, the Bell folks announced a product they have been working
on for a couple of years-a software suite called Inferno. Inferno
can serve as one of two functions: on small machines, Inferno is an
operating system, and on desktop machines, it's a suite of
applications. This means that Inferno coexists with whatever
operating system a particular desktop machine uses.

On the desktop, Inferno occupies much of the same market space that
Sun Microsystems' Java does, although during the product's May 1996
announcement everyone on the Lucent team tried to downplay this
fact. Inferno's programming language (called Limbo) lets you build
the equivalent of Java applets.

The differences that exist between Java and Inferno might also give
Sun pause. First of all, Lucent claims that Inferno runs
comfortably within 1MB of memory. In addition, Inferno implements
network operating constructs that a language such as Java is not in
a position to implement. With Inferno, you get features such as
authentication and native file management (including exporting your
file system to other clients at will) right from the operating
system.

SON OF PLAN 9

Finally, Inferno draws on the research done at Bell Labs during the
development of the Plan 9 operating system (see "Plan 9: Son of
Unix," Interoperability, Summer 1996 issue, page 41) to create an
operating system that distributes all over the network the various
kinds of work that an application performs. For example, Inferno's
browser splits its onscreen presentation away from all the data
management issues such as looking up domain names and figuring out
where to draw images within a page of text. This way, slower
terminals can focus on what you see and can off-load the CPU-
intensive work to CPU servers located back at the service
provider's shop.

Distributing the various tasks that have to be performed in order
for a client to make a presentation is an enormously powerful
concept and one with which Bell Labs has grappled for several
years. "We looked at what we had done with [the] Plan 9 [operating
system]," says Rob Pike, key Inferno developer, "and realized that
if we stripped it down to just the distribution capabilities, we
would have something very small and very powerful."

A lot remains to be seen, but there's no question that Lucent is a
vendor that has the attention of the regional Bells and cable
service providers. The possibilities that surround Inferno's
potential to quickly penetrate a broad market are staggering.
Inferno may be compelling at the corporate level, too: If you're
writing thin-client Web applications for your corporate intranet,
why not write to the same operating system that your telephones are
using and get extra capabilities for free?  LAN

NETWORKS: CABLE TESTERS IN THE FIELD

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Field testing a cable plant serves to verify its transmission
performance. This results in a more professional hand-off from your
cabling contractor. The guidelines presented in this series is a
high level summary of the results of our evaluation and experience
using the cable test instruments. These guidelines are not meant to
duplicate the information in TIA/EIA TSB67, or the contents of
individual field tester manuals, but to provide additional
information to address issues relevant to the testing of structured
cabling installations.

These guidelines should be considered generic to all testers and as
a general rule it is important to upgrade to the latest firmware
and maintain the current documentation (including readme files) of
the testers to ensure up-to-date operational procedures.

Calibration of Field Testers and Test Configurations

Different field test instruments have slightly different
calibration procedures. It is important that these procedures are
followed. Proper calibration of the field testers is required to
ensure accurate measurements.

Calibration of Remote Injector

A short length of tester equipment cord (supplied with the field
tester) is used to connect the main unit to the remote unit and the
calibration sequence activated from the main unit. This will result
in the main unit determining attenuation loss inherent in the
testers and calibrate this loss to be 0 dB (see Figure 1).
Different manufacturers provide different calibration kits. If
adapters are needed for the measurement of the installed cabling,
it is a good idea to include these adapters in the calibration.
This is because adapters are not part of the installed cable plant
and should consequently be calibrated out of the attenuation
measurement, resulting in better measurement accuracy for
attenuation.

Selection of Cable Type

Selecting the cable type closest to the cable being tested will
yield better accuracy, especially for length and propagation delay
measurements. Often, the field tester is pre-loaded with various
cable types, including 1061/2061 cables. The main result of
selecting a cable type is the selection of the nominal velocity of
propagation (NVP). Values for NVP are obtained by tester vendors
from cable data sheets, or sometimes verbally from individuals
representing cable vendors. Consequently, these NVP values are
often incorrect or out of date. It is critical that the correct
cable type be selected and the NVP determined using the field
tester calibration procedure.

Selection of Test Configuration

TSB67 defines two test configurations, a basic link and a channel
(see Figures 2 and 3). A channel assumes two connections at each
end while a basic link assumes one connection at each end.

For example, if you are testing the cabling installed by a
contractor from the wall outlet to the termination in the
telecommunications closet, you need to configure the field tester
for a basic link. If on the other hand, you are diagnosing an end-
to end cabling circuit that will be attached to equipment at both
ends, including cross-connections, patch cords, and equipment
cords, you need to configure the field tester to measure a channel.
Sometimes, you may have a situation where there are two connections
at one end and a single connection at the other end. For routine
autotest measurements, it is acceptable to measure this
configuration as a channel in the interest of efficiency. However,
for diagnostic or single parameter tests, this configuration will
need to be tested as a channel and a basic link. The end that has
two connections must pass channel NEXT requirements, while the end
with one connection must pass basic link NEXT requirements. This
type of dual configuration testing may be necessary only if you are
working in a detailed analysis or diagnostic mode.

Calibration of NVP

TSB67 outlines a simple calibration procedure for NVP using a known
length of cable. Since various testers use different internal
procedures to find the pair with the shortest electrical delay
(corresponds to maximum velocity of propagation), calibration is
the only sure way of initialising the field tester with the right
NVP for the particular cable type you are testing. This will result
in more accurate length measurements and less variability of length
between different pairs within a 4-pair cable. Figure 4 illustrates
the NVP calibration setup.

To calibrate, reel off 25 metres (82 feet) of cable and attach
modular jacks to both ends. Note the exact jacket foot marks and
determine and length of cable that is cut from the reel. Attach
this connectorised cable to the main unit and the remote unit using
tester. Select NVP calibration from the menus and enter the length
of the cable. Note that since the length is determined from the
foot marks on the jacket, it is necessary to make sure that the
field tester is set to the appropriate units (metric or US
Customary units) before running the calibration command from the
main unit. The main unit will display the NVP determined for the
1061/2061 cable that you are calibrating.

Save this NP as a default for the appropriate cable type, so that
you do not have to re-calibrate NVP again for the same type of
cable. If you move on to another installation, you may have a
different cable, which requires that you calibrate NVP again.

Field Measurement Procedures

It is important to develop uniform test practices and provide
adequate training. Although each installation may have different
requirements, it is risky letting each job get tested differently.
These units are much more complicated than continuity buzzers, and
improper settings or inadequate battery management could waste
hours worth of testing. Suitable calibration procedures and
intervals must be enforced. For example, calibration of the remote
unit every day of use is a good practice. Calibration of NVP for
each job will ensure that the NVP represents the value of the cable
being installed at a site.

Sanity Checks

Any tester should undergo regular checkups, or some form of sanity
check. Users should develop some expertise to assess whether a
tester is providing useful results. One simple method is to
construct a sample link to be used as a reference. Make sure that
is physically protected and not subject to movement. Expect some
variation with temperature, humidity, and time, but this is a valid
check for malfunctioning units. A link such as this is required for
Nominal Velocity of Propagation (NVP) calibration may be used as a
reference link and will serve as a simple test to verify the
consistency of a field tester. If this same link is used to check
periodically for tester repeatability, one will get a useful
indication that the field tester is functioning properly (see
Figure 4).

IS 11801 and TIA TSB67 Testing Issues

With the release of TIA-568-A, TIA TSB67 and IS 11801, customers
are faced with confusing choices in specifying testing requirements
and interpreting test results. Most of the confusion arises from
attempting to test against the performance limits of IS 11801. It
should be noted that several of the performance limits listed in IS
11801 are marked "ffs" ("for future study").

Some of the reasons behind the "ffs" entries include lack of
agreement from cable vendors, inconsistent results from field
testing trials, and lack of accuracy determination methods for
hand-held testing equipment in relation to such parameters. In
addition, while specifying performance limits in IS 11801, the
international standards community is still to release detailed test
procedures and test configurations.

The horizontal link from which the IS 11801 performance includes
two connections in the floor Distributor (Horizontal Cross-connect
in TIA-568-A), a 5 metre patch cord, 90 metres of cable and a
connection at the work area. This link specifically excludes the
equipment cable and work area cable. It is not clear whether hand-
held instruments, compliant to TIA TSB-67 are capable of accurately
testing this link, as this would require the test set to "exclude"
the equipment and work area cables.

One of the parameters marked "ffs" in IS 11801 is Return Loss (RL).
While the method for accurately measuring RL in the field is yet to
be specified, additional difficulties can be encountered when using
test leads or patch cords incorrectly matched to the cabling
system, or degraded by repeated use. At least one of the TSB67
compliant test sets in the market includes two choices for IS 11801
configurations (with and without RL), and the test set manufacturer
advises the users to use the "IS 11801 without RL" option. The
difficulties experienced by some users when testing RL with
incorrectly matched test leads highlights the advantages of a
cabling system designed with matched components.

In contrast with IS 11801, the TIA 568-A Standard and TSB-67
include practical test configurations (Figures 2 & 3) and accuracy
specifications for hand-held instruments. While work is underway to
harmonise the differences, and to reach practical agreement on the
IS 11801 specifications marked "ffs", the practical choice is to
refer to TIA TSB-67 for accurate field testing.

Use of Interface Adapters

Sometimes, an interface adapter is necessary to attach field
testers to the channel/link under test. These adapters are an extra
element in the link configuration and may affect the accuracy of a
measurement. In general, unknown adapters should be avoided. To
measure a basic link with a 110 interface, an adapter cord with 110
on one end and the interface of the tester on the other end is
preferred. Test instrument vendors should provide this adapter
cord. For channel measurements, testers provide an adapter from the
tester interface connector to a modular jack. Again, it is
important that only cords and adapters provided by the testers be
used to attach field testers to the link under test. Note that TSB-
67 requires that field tester cords do not exceed 2 metres.

Durability of Connecting Hardware Interfaces

An important issue not yet handled by any of the testers is keeping
track of the life cycle of test interfaces. Any jack or plug has a
reliable limit on connect/ disconnect cycles. Interfaces should be
serialised (marked) and users should keep track of how many tests
are performed so their reliable limit is not exceeded. Additional
interfaces should be ordered and available for replacement at
suitable intervals. Field testers currently do not have a mechanism
for storing the number of times an instrument has been used. Hence
it is a good practice to maintain approximate (to the nearest 100)
cycles of usage so that plug/jack contacts can be inspected and
replaced as necessary. Different testers claim different number of
usage cycles for accurate measurements. As a first step these
vendor guidelines may be sufficient. If measurements are not
repeatable or if the failure rate of links increases, it may be
time to replace the plug/jack interfaces.

Backup Procedures

Backup protection is another important issue. A simple strategy
could be to print tests every few hours. This might be suitable for
some small jobs, but may be too time consuming for most. A better
strategy is to uplink to a PC every 4 hours and make duplicates on
floppy disks. Also, make sure an extra set of charged batteries are
ready.

Structural Return Loss and Return Loss Measurements

Structural Return Loss (SRL) characterising "impedance roughness"
of a cable is a cable parameter and is measured in a laboratory
environment in accordance with ASTM D 4566 Method 3, or equivalent.
SRL is not specified as a field measurement for links and chan-nels
either in TIA/EIA-568-A or in IS 11801 standards. Hence any claims
to measuring SRL in the field should be considered non-standard and
questionable.

Return loss is a measure of reflected signal and is used to
characterise either individual components or links. When
characterising links, return loss is an indication of impedance
mismatches of different components within links and is not
specified in either TIA/EIA 568-A, or the associated TIA/EIA TSB-67
field testing document. Further TIA/EIA TSB-67 clearly states that
return loss is under study. The IS 11801 document has a slightly
different approach when dealing with items under study. It shows
the possible target values for future revision of the IS 11801
document and qualifies these values as "FFS" (For Future Study).
The reason these are marked FFS is because no industry agreement
has been reached on the possible values, test methods, and
measurement instruments.

Despite the above background, certain field test manufacturers may
implement proprietary test schemes for measuring return loss to
differentiate their instruments in the market. These proprietary
test schemes have not been reviewed and accepted by industry and
must therefore be viewed with caution.

Differences in Length Measurements

Different pairs within a 4-pair cable use different twist rates to
improve NEXT performance. This introduces a physical difference in
length between different pairs. Additionally, the velocity of
propagation may vary between pairs because of material differences.
Such differences are normal, and within the operating limits of
cabling and applications standards. Furthermore, these differences
are not significantly affected by installation of cabling, and
should therefore not be a major source of concern when checking the
quality of the installation.

Delay skew is the term commonly used to refer to the difference in
propagation delay over different pairs. The worst case delay skew
allowed in application standards is 50 ns for a 100 different
pairs. The worst case delay skew allowed in application standards
is 50 ns for a 100 metre channel. Given that the speed of light in
open space is 1 ft/ns and assuming a relative velocity of 0.6 c for
copper cabling, the maximum difference in electrical length allowed
is 30 feet (50 ns x 0.6) for a 100 metre channel. Differences of up
to 20 feet in the length measurements of pairs for a typical cable
run are not uncommon and fall within the requirements of
application standards.

Calibration of NVP for each different type of cable is critical to
reduce errors in length measurements. Different cables require re-
calibration. Note that the NVP calibration results must be saved to
ensure the new NVP values are effective. To test if the calibration
was saved, power down the tester, power up and check if the new NVP
values for the cable type being installed are current in memory.
(Note: Because of accuracy issues, TIA standards do not endorse
measurement of propagation delay and delay skew using field
testers).

25-Pair Cabling

TIA considers 25-pair cabling to be backbone cabling and requires
NEXT to conform to "power-sum" requirements. These computations
involve hundreds of pair combinations and several thousand data
points for conformance testing. Power sum NEXT testing is not
possible with currently available field testers. The alternative is
to check individual 4 pair units within a 25-pair cable and verify
each unit meets the 4-pair horizontal cabling requirements. For
example, to test a zone cabling installation with a 25-pair cable
serving six work areas, the six individual circuits can be verified
as basic links or channels, depending on the current test
configuration. Note: 25-pair cable is different cable from 4-pair
cable, and its velocity of calibration must be calibrated and
stored in the field tester. Any 4-pair unit from the 25-pair cable
may be used for calibration.  LAN

NETWORKS: THE COMMON GATEWAY INTERFACE IS THE KEY TO INTERACTIVE WEB SITES

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

This series of tutorials, which has been running since July, has
examined services commonly available on the Internet and has
explored what you, as a network manager, need to do to make such
services available within your company (via your corporate
intranet) and to others (via the Internet).

Last month, we focused on HTML and took a first look at hypertext
links. This month, we'll continue to explore HTML, and we'll take a
look at the common gateway interface (CGI).

Using simple tags, you can make any word or phrase a hyperlink.
Hyperlinks are not limited to text, however. They can also be
images. The following code fragment shows how to make an image into
a hyperlink: <A

HREF="http://www.amphibian.com/frog.htm"><IMGSRC="frog.gif"></A>

This sample code displays the graphic image frog.gif, and-if the
user clicks on that image-causes the Web browser to request the Web
page frog.htm from the Web server www.amphibian.com.

THE COMMON GATEWAY INTERFACE

HTML, along with HTTP, is the enabling technology of the World Wide
Web. HTML's most compelling feature is hypertext linking. When you
look for information in a conventional book you might search the
index for a key word, then flip through the book to find the
referenced page, and hope to find the information you seek. By
contrast, when searching for information on the Web, simply
clicking on a hyperlink and immediately jumping to the referenced
page is gratifyingly quick and easy. HTML is, however, essentially
a read-only format. It's not interactive except when using the
mouse to navigate. HTML pages are static documents that don't
change until someone (the Webmaster, in many cases) accesses the
Web server and edits them.

From the start, Web developers have been looking for ways to make
Web servers interactive to allow users to input information as well
as retrieve information. The standard way of delivering information
in this manner is now known as the common gateway interface. Using
CGI, the Web server, in response to a user request for information,
runs a program to search for that information and returns the
results to the user. In order to achieve these results, the Web
server typically generates an HTML page by inserting a few HTML
statements into a pre-existing page. A Web server using CGI in this
manner could potentially run an infinite variety of programs.

If you've used a Web search engine to find an item of interest,
you've used CGI. But CGI itself isn't the search engine. Rather,
it's a way to interface programs, such as search engines, with Web
servers.

HTTP (Web) servers are designed primarily to serve up HTML
documents. CGI files, however, aren't documents, they're programs.
Therefore, to store CGI programs, most Web servers use a special
directory, commonly named cgi-bin. The Web server knows that files
stored in the cgi-bin directory are to be executed rather than
simply sent to the user's Web browser for display. CGI programs can
be written in a wide variety of languages, including DOS batch
files, BASIC, C, and scripting languages such as Perl. It's the job
of the CGI to activate the CGI program at the proper time and pass
the program to any necessary user- or operating environment-
generated data. The CGI program then processes whatever data is
generated. Once the program accomplishes this process (which should
take only seconds-the goal here is interactivity), it must return
some output to the user via the user's Web browser. To make the
output appropriate for browser display, the CGI program must format
its output in the form of an HTML document.

A FORM FOR EVERYTHING

A CGI program has to somehow get from the user any data to be
processed. That's where HTML forms come into play. HTML forms are
similar to paper forms: They provide specific spaces in which to
enter specific data items. A simple form is shown in Figure 1. This
sample form has one text input field: product name. The form also
has some multiple-choice fields, in which, for example, the user
can check off the type of product, as well as what networking
protocols the product supports. The form also has a button the user
can click on to submit the entry. (A CGI program will only act upon
the information in a form when the form data has been submitted to
the CGI program.) Clicking on the form's Clear Form button resets
the form back to its default values. The HTML code for this form is
shown in Listing 1 (page 33). Note that to aid in discussion,
Listing 1 includes line numbers, which you wouldn't use in actual
HTML code.

The source code for a form is bound by the <form action="url"> and
</form> tags (see line 1 and line 14 of Listing 1). The use of
action specifies the action to be taken when the form is submitted.
In other words, action determines which CGI program should be run
in order to process the form, and you specify either a full or
partial URL for that program. Depending on the Web server, you may
be able to set a default directory for all CGI programs. As long as
the program you want to run is stored in that directory you need
only specify the program's file name. Otherwise, you will probably
have to provide a complete URL for the file.

Use method to move input data from the form into the CGI program
that's going to process that data. We'll explore the methods by
which this is done in more detail next month, but for now, just be
aware that there are two general methods you can use: "get" and
"post". If you're going to use the "get" method to transfer data
from the form to the CGI program specified in the action URL, be
sure that the CGI program is written to accept data in this manner.
By the same token, if you use "post" to send data from your form,
be sure the CGI program is expecting "post" data input.

Line 2 and line 3 of Listing 1 prompt the user to enter data. After
the prompts comes the code that puts a text field into the form
(line 4). Entering input type="text" tells the Web browser that it
is a text field. Specifying name="name" tells the browser that the
name of this field is name. (This example asks for the name of a
product; if you want to

ask for the user's address, you might name this field address.)
size="25"

 indicates that the text box will be large enough to see 25
characters at a time. maxlength="30" means that the field can hold
up to 30 characters of text.

In this case, the length of the field exceeds the length of the
box, so a scroll bar will appear if the user types a long text
string.

Next on the form are radio buttons, followed by check boxes. These
are both multiple-choice, but they differ slightly in how they work
in that, using check boxes, you can check more than one box at a
time, but you can select only one radio button. Clicking on a radio
button clears the radio button that was previously selected. By
comparison, selecting one check box does not deselect another.

Let's discuss radio buttons first. You determine the button style
by setting the type for the input equal to radio. There are three
statements for radio buttons (line 6 through line 8)-one for each
of the possible selections. Each statement contains
name="prodtype." This creates a logical field named prodtype. If
the first button is checked, the field prodtype takes on the value
bridge. (You can determine the value by using the statement
"value='bridge'"). Note also the keyword checked in line 6. When
the form first appears, the radio button for bridge will be
checked; in other words, we've made this setting the default. The
user can override this default setting by clicking on the Router or
Switch button.

Next comes a series of three check boxes that allow the user to
indicate which network protocols the product supports (represented
by lines 9 through 11of the sample code in Listing 1). When a user
clicks in a box, "X" appears in that box to indicate that it is
checked. Clicking again on a checked check box removes the "X," or
unchecks the box.

You create a check box field with the statement input type= "check
box ." You also need to specify the name of the input field. In
Listing 1, the name of the input field for the first check box is
set to IP. The sample code uses the keyword checked, indicating
that this box is selected by default, which the user can clear by
clicking on the check box.

When a check box is selected, by default the field with that name
has its value set to "on." Although it is not included in the
example, you can optionally use the value attribute to set the
value, for example, to "green" when the box is selected. When the
check box is not selected, the field has no value. In this example,
the default setting for all three boxes is checked. Thus, unless
the user clears the boxes, the form returns ip=on, ipx=on, and
appletalk=on. If only the IP box is selected, the form returns only
ip=on. The IPX and AppleTalk boxes will be disregarded.

I don't have quite enough space here to finish the discussion of
our sample form, so we'll have to conclude that next month. Also,
so far, I've discussed gathering data to be passed to a CGI
program, but I haven't said much about how that data is transferred
or how the CGI program sends output back to the user. I'll cover
that (and more) in next month's Tutorial.  LAN

NETWORKS: Getting Basic Netware from Within Windows: A hidden menu
Automatic disk maintenance Securing automatic logins

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

A HIDDEN MENU

The following procedure will help you create a NetWare pop-up menu
that allows your users to perform some basic operations in a
NetWare environment from within Windows 3.1.

To enable the menu on a client, make sure the client's network
driver or secondary network driver for Windows is the NetWare
device driver (netware.drv). To do so, put either of the following
lines into the client's

system.ini file:

network.drv=netware.drv

secondnet.drv=netware.drv

Then, create a file in the root of the client's Windows directory
and name it netware.ini. In this file, type:

[Options]

netwarehotkey=1

The next time a user starts Windows, he can just press the <F6> key
and a small menu will pop up onscreen. The menu allows a user to
log in to and log out of a file server, map drives and printers,
and change the hot key.

Note: You must load the netx shell before you can use this feature.

Jafar H. Alhashemi

Network Administrator

Information Technology Department

Kuwait Airways

New York

Editor's note: The netware.drv driver Alhashemi refers to is found
in the older, 2.0x version of the NetWare device driver. The
NetWare pop-up menu is a built-in feature of that generation of
drivers only.

In the newer, 3.0x version of netware.drv, Novell includes a hot-
key feature that allows users to call up the NetWare User Tools
application from within Windows 3.1.

Users access the NetWare Users Tools window to quickly perform
network operations-such as map drives and printers, send messages,
display server resources, and so on-similar to those features found
with the afore-mentioned pop-up menu available with netware.drv
2.0x.

To enable the hot key for the NetWare Users Tools application, you
need to access the NetWare Settings window. You can do this by
clicking on the Network icon in the Control Panel.

The NetWare Settings window contains an option for enabling the hot
key, and an option to specify a hot key (the default is <F6>).

As with Alhashemi's instructions, you also need to specify the
NetWare device driver as the network driver. Unlike the 2.0x
driver, you don't have to create the netware.ini file, it is
created automatically when you enable the hot key feature using the
NetWare Settings window.

AUTOMATIC DISK MAINTENANCE

As a network administrator for a 160-workstation system, I used to
receive calls on a weekly basis from individuals having trouble
saving files on their computers. I have eliminated the bulk of
those calls by adding the following lines in the system login
script of our NetWare 4.1 servers:

if day_of_week = "wednesday" and os_version =

"v6.22" then begin

#c:\dos\scandisk c: /autofix /nosave /nosummary

end

When a user boots his or her computer and the system date reads
"Wednesday," the login script launches the DOS scandisk program.

Editor's note: Scandisk, which is available in DOS 6.x, analyses
computer drives for errors relating to the file allocation table,
file system structure, directory tree structure, and the physical
surface of the disk.

The /autofix switch automatically corrects any problems scandisk
encounters, thereby avoiding any user input. The /nosave switch
tells the program to delete any lost clusters it finds. The
/nosummary switch tells the program not to display its summary
screen after it finishes the scan.

To really clean things up, I add:

#c:\dos\defrag c: /f /s:n

Editor's note: The Defrag command reorganises information stored on
a disk to make the storage more efficient and to optimise the
performance of the disk. The /f switch tells the program to
defragment the files on the drive indicated-in this case the c:
drive. The /s:n switch organises files alphabetically, by name.

The two DOS commands scandisk and defrag, with their parameters,
run without user intervention. Users know that their computers will
take a little longer to boot on Wednesdays.

Securing Automatic Logins

The July 1996 Patches and Fixes column correctly points out that
configuring a workstation to log in automatically presents a
security risk, especially if the password is contained in a text
file.

I've set up a process based on NetWare's Station Restriction
feature. My unattended stations that perform unique functions do
not have passwords, but they are restricted to one login at a
specific node address.

I've taken steps to prevent exiting to DOS by removing the comspec
environment variable from the autoexec.bat. Also, I force the
machines to log out of the network once they exit the application.

For me, this approach works because 99 per cent of my users use
their PC as a "terminal," and all applications are run off the
network.

To prevent shelling to DOS from within a DOS application, I use the
following lines in a batch file:

set oldcomspec=%comspec%

set comspec=

<load application here>

set comspec=%oldcomspec%

If a user tries to shell to DOS from an app, he receives an error
message, as the comspec variable is invalid. Some DOS applications
won't run correctly without the comspec variable, but I've found
that Lotus 1-2-3, DrawPerfect, Reflex, Symphony, and WordPerfect
work fine.

Under Windows, I prevent users from accessing DOS by not providing
them with a DOS icon and by removing the Run command from the File
menu (I use Saber Menu System).

To force machines to automatically log out after exiting an
application, I add the following lines to the end of the batch file
that runs the application. In fact, I use these lines at the end of
the batch files that run our DOS and Windows menus so that users
know what to do at the f:\login prompt. Here are the lines:

<commands that start

application>

rem Change default drive to login; clear screen

z:cd cal1\sys:login

cls

rem Blank out the DOS prompt

set prompt=

rem Display the LOGOUT message

type v:logout.txt

rem Run OUT.BAT located in SYS:LOGIN

out

The contents of logout.txt state that the logout is complete, and
to please turn the system off or press any key to restart. Here's
out.bat:

@echo off

logout > nul :

pause > nul :

warmboot

warmboot.com is a utility that restarts the machine. I forgot where
I got that particular utility, but there are several utilities
available that perform the same function.

With this setup, users see a confirming message to either reboot or
turn off the system. If the user presses any key, except <Ctrl-C>,
the PC will reboot. If the user gets smart and presses <Ctrl-C>,
the batch file will terminate. But, because there is no DOS prompt,
that user will probably just reboot anyway. (However, informed
users could type set prompt=$p$g and find themselves at z:\login.)

You can secure the remote device mentioned in "Following the
Password Piper" by restricting the login name to the node address
of that remote device. With NetWare 2.x or 3.x, this naming is done
through Syscon. In NetWare 4.x, it is an NDS property.

By using this restriction, a network login which uses the device's
node address as the login name has to be performed at the device to
which the address is tied. A password is not necessary, but could
be used for additional security.

Editor's note: The preceding letters refer to "Following the
Password Piper," which ran in Patches and Fixes in the July 1996
issue (page 28). The submission discusses one network manager's
desire for a fix that enables a workstation to automatically log on
to the network (composed, in this case, of NetWare servers) when
switched on. This process would simplify the resetting of devices,
such as e-mail servers, located at remote branch offices.

In the event that such a machine were to hang due to a software
problem, a nontechnical user could restore that machine online by
simply turning the power off and then back on.

"Following the Password Piper" also discusses ways in which such an
automatic logon could be accomplished. These solutions involve
putting the account and password in a file on the station's local
disk drive.

We point out the security exposure this involves and recommend that
the person who does the power switching also type in the password,
as opposed to keeping the password on disk.

NetWare does allow you to restrict a particular account's login to
a specific node address. While that feature can be handy and will
deter some potential attackers, it isn't going to prevent
sophisticated attacks. On some networks, such as Arcnet, the node
address is set by the installer and, therefore, can be set to any
address. On Ethernet networks, the manufacturer embeds the node
address in firmware. Note that while Ethernet NICs default to using
the address in firmware, many NICs have options that allow an
alternate address to be used, which makes it possible for one node
to impersonate another node.

Our concern about placing the password on a workstation's local
disk drive is that the network becomes vulnerable to any intruder
with physical access to that workstation. Restricting login to a
specific node address is equally vulnerable. An intruder can gain
access to a file server by simply switching on that workstation.

We included these suggestions because we feel they are good ones
for network managers to have in their bag of security tricks. They
can be a good way to augment security, but we caution you against
relying on them as foolproof solutions.

Sheldon mentions another NetWare feature-the ability to restrict
simultaneous logins. By default, users can have multiple,
simultaneous sessions. You can, however, limit an account to a
single login. This approach can be useful, particularly for e-mail
servers or other such machines on the network. If such a node is
logged in, no one else is able to log in with that account name.

This approach, too, is vulnerable to someone who has physical
access to that machine. Also, if the workstation is not logged in
at all times, there will be periods of vulnerability.  LAN

NETWORKS: Who's Afraid of TCP/IP?

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Need to understand TCP/IP and how to buy a good stack? TCP/IP is
now enjoying its day in the sun with the explosion of the Internet
and the emergence of the corporate Intranet.

Computer systems in use now are diverse. From a mainframe running
an operating system like VM or MVS, down to a PC that could be
running Windows, DOS, NT or OS2. In between are minicomputers that
could be running anything like Solaris, IBM AIX or HP-UX). You have
proprietary local area, generic operating system, mainframes
running something, minis running something else, and when you want
to network all these, one of the best technologies to use is
TCP/IP. After all, if TCP/IP is what you use on the outside, why
shouldn't you use it on the inside?

Crucial Add-ons

Key to TCP/IP technology are the add-ons such as security,
collaboration, mobility, interoperability, and ease of use.

Security involves encrypting data going between PCs and the company
firewall, for example, developing interoperability with firewalls
so you can create what is called a private network between your PC
and the firewall. Companies are focusing on enabling security into
the technology itself (IPSEC, Cylink, RSA, etc.) and also on
interoperability of security-working on establishing the standards,
and ensuring interoperability as a whole.

Collaboration software using TCP/IP as the underlying transport can
take the form of e-mail, discussion databases, video-conferencing,
etc. Companies are implementing collaboration protocols for the
next generation of audio, video and workgroup collaboration needs
using RSVP (reservation protocol), multicasting, IPv6, RTCP (Real-
Time Protocol Control Transport), or RTP (Real-Time Protocol
Transport).

With 50 per cent of all PCs sold today being laptops, the ability
for users to go mobile and still be connected to the office network
is essential. Many companies are working with technologies like
mobile IP, using one static IP address to communicate at all times
with a corporate Intranet without having to change your IP
addresses when you change you location on the corporate network.

What Features?

If you are looking for a comprehensive TCP/IP package, check if it
offers the following features:

  The ability to detect a router on the network should you not have
access to the systems administrators when you need them.

  The 7a package that supports not only TCP/IP but co-exists well
with related technologies like NetBIOS, IPX, Banyan, DEC, IBM etc.

  Address and name resolution which offers convenient features like
DHCP to manage your addresses in a simplified manner, WinSNMP
support for interoperability with third party network managers like
HP OpenView and MIB11 compliance. And you should look for a package
that supports VXD technology so you can optimise memory management
capabilities of Win95.

  Simultaneous connection from the desktop so that if you run your
software on a LAN and want to switch to a WAN, you can have both
resident in memory at the same time. Uses: serial send situations
(bank and retail), LAN and Cable situations (interactive cable),
redundancy (financial), LAN/serial connections.

  Mobile IP-so users can connect to a corporate Intranet without
changing their IP address;

  Multicast facility, which allows you to send to a group of hosts
rather than to all hosts (broadcast). The ability to multicast is
crucial to videoconferencing when you wish to link with a select
group rather than with everyone on the net.

  Compatibility with ISDN technologies like WinISDN, CAPI; support
for Sun's Yellow Pages NIS (network information service);
compatibility with firewall standards like SOCKS; compatibility
with new Novell technologies like Netware/IP, etc.

  Compliance with other related technologies like TDI (Transport
Driver Interface)-a new standard Microsoft is promoting that
resides between the Kernel protocols and apps services.

Who Provides?

Choose a company that is looking at new technologies such as RSVP
,RTCP, and RTP. RSVP reserves bandwidth for use with video and
audio, collaboration, workgroup applications, e-mail, Intranet
traffic, etc. Transport protocols are for real-time applications
such as point-of-sale.

Look for a company that follows all the issues being discussed on
the IETF (Internet Engineer Task Force) work group such as
security, mobile IP and IPv6. One of the biggest problems facing
the Internet and IPv4 is the lack of address space. IPv6 will offer
expanded addressing from 32-bit to 128-bit with hierarchical
scalability.

This will be essential for enterprise, Internet, intranet, PDAs,
cellular, cable TV, and smart appliances.

Your partner should have a well defined strategy for dealing with
issues like next generation IP addressing-how will they make the
transition from current addressing to the new one?

How will they deal with it? Gradual transition is possible, based
on a dual stack strategy, with hosts and routers upgraded
independently and no single 'doomsday,' which may be more
convenient for a lot of companies.

In my view, considering the developments, TCP/IP has become the
standard and is the foundation to the future of connectivity and
communications.

NETWORKS: Optimising a print server for NetWare

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

QHow does a network print server act in a Novell NetWare network?

AS You can choose Print Server Mode or Remote Printer Mode. In
Print Server Mode the print server emulates a workstation or file
server running the PSERVER software. This mode provides high
performance but requires one NetWare license for each print server.
In Remote Printer Mode the print server emulates a workstation
running the RPRINTER or NPRINTER software. Performance is lower
than PSERVER but extra licenses are not needed.

QHow does a print server act in a Unix environment?

AA network print server can either act as an independent node or it
can be integrated in the network spool system. In both cases it has
its own IP address, which is set as usual with the ARP or BOOTP
commands. Print jobs can either be transferred directly to the
print server by using FTP or telnet, or sent to a print queue with
the lpr command.

QDoes a network print server need a large cache memory to spool
print jobs?

ANo, a print server does not work as a spooling device. It passes
the data directly to the printer. If the printer is busy, the
network operating system takes care of the situation and the print
jobs are spooled on different locations depending on which print
method is being used. When printing via the file server, print jobs
are always spooled in a print queue. When printing peer-to-peer,
the print job is spooled locally on the PC's hard disk.

NETWORKS: Which Internet Server?

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

QI am sourcing for a suitable Intel-based Web server which would be
used in our company's intranet. I your view, how does Microsoft's
Internet Information Server compare with the other web server
offerings in the market?

AExcluding the various freeware and shareware web servers around,
there are basically four products that currently dominate the web
server market. These are: Microsoft's IIS, Netscape Communications
Server (NT Version and BSDI Unix Version) and Novell's Netware Web
Server. In terms of functionality, all the web servers support HTML
and standard CGIs (with the exception of Netware Web Server).
Netware does, however, support a proprietary extension called
Remote CGI (R-CGI). This allows the execution of CGI applications
on a separate machine from the Web server. It is different from
most CGI implementations which execute CGI applications in a
separate process on the same machine as the Web server.

In terms of API support, IIS and Netscape's Communications Server
(NT Version) both support ISAPI, NSAPI and proprietary APIs.
Netware does not support either ISAPI, NSAPI or a Novell defined
set of API to extend their web server (other than R-CGI).

According to tests conducted by Shiloh Consulting and Haynes &
Company, the Microsoft Internet Information Server substantially
outperformed the other Web servers tested on straight HTML and
proprietary APIs. This performance advantage increased consistently
as the number of clients making requests increased. The second best
performer in HTML tests was NetWare, followed by the Netscape BSDI
server and the Netscape NT server.

When running CGI, the best performer was the Netscape BSDI server,
followed by the Microsoft IIS. As should be expected, server
performance for two servers running on Windows NT (IIS and
Netscape) was virtually equal when 100 per cent of the requests
were for standard CGI. In this case, both servers spent a majority
of the time running identical CGI code, so very little time is
actually spent in the HTTP server code. Microsoft's API (ISAPI) is
roughly five times as fast as Microsoft's CGI. Netscape's API
(NSAPI) is roughly about twice as fast as Netscape's CGI. In tests
of the two servers with proprietary APIs, IIS was two or three
times faster than Netscape.

Even when the Internet Information Server was handling many more
HTML or API requests than the other servers, the average response
time for IIS to handle each request was significantly less. It was
approximately a quarter that of Netscape for straight HTML and one
third as great for 100 per cent API requests. When 100 per cent of
requests were for CGI, the Netscape BSDI server was substantially
faster than the Windows NT-based servers.

The superior performance of the Microsoft Internet Information
Server, which incidentally comes packaged with Microsoft NT Server
4.0 (and downloadable from Microsoft for NT 3.51), means that Web
site managers running HTML or API's on Intel platforms will find
Microsoft's server the best alternative for minimising hardware
costs, allowing a comfortable margin for peak loads, and providing
the maximum room for growth.

All tests were conducted on a HP NetServer 5/133 Model LS with 32
MB of RAM. The Netscape BSDI version tests were done on the same
machine but with 128 MB RAM. Novell tests were run with NetWare
4.1. IIS and Netscape Communications Server (NT Version) were run
on top of Windows NT Server 3.51, and the BSDI version was run on
BSDI Unix Version 2.01. A 100 Mbps network was used for the tests.
More information on the performance comparisons can be found on the
Internet at http://www.microsoft.

NETWORKS: ISDN to the Internet

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

QI administer 22 users on a NetWare 3.12 network. I would like to
connect to the Internet, and I want to use ISDN. How do I set up
the ISDN connections? What software and hardware do I need? What
about security? Can I run IPX NETX at the workstation, or do I need
to run IPXODI and a VLM? Is there a better way to connect to the
Internet besides ISDN?

ATo provide Internet access, you should consider installing a
router-more specifically, an "access" router that supports ISDN-on
your network. Vendors preconfigure access routers to provide dial-
up asynchronous/synchronous services for LAN and remote users.
Cisco Systems, Bay Networks, and Ascend Communications all provide
router solutions. Make sure the router supports ISDN and that it
has enough ISDN ports to support your particular environment.

When you receive your router, configure it for IPX according to
vendor specifications. Without the IPX configuration, the server
and the router will not recognise each other.

If users need only infrequent access to the Internet or if you want
to minimise performance degradation when the LAN accesses the WAN,
you can implement a dial-on-demand ISDN architecture. With dial-on-
demand, traffic within the LAN is identified as special or
interesting. In this case, "interesting" means the traffic within
the network that causes the router to perform call setup functions.
A standard configuration might allow IPX to start the call setup-as
long as the IPX packets are not carrying RIP/SAP updates. You
should be able to configure all these parameters on the router. For
example, you can configure a Cisco router to identify IPX traffic
but filter and block the propagation of RIP/SAP updates.

Your servers and workstations on your current LAN require no
additional software. The connection between the router and server
is either direct or via a hub. The workstations' configurations,
assuming each has an IPX protocol stack, remain the same. Only
workstations requiring Internet services need Internet software.

Because you're running NetWare 3.12, workstation ODI and VLM
support should already be present. The workstation configuration
requires you to add an IP protocol stack to support ftp, Simple
Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), or telnet (Virtual Terminal)
connections to the Internet. Remember that the Internet is a large
TCP/IP network and that its services are accessed using TCP/IP.
Novell's LAN WorkPlace for DOS or LAN WorkGroup software provides a
suitable IP stack for Internet access.

Security is handled at the router via filters and at the server via
NetWare security. Unless your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
suggests changes to your security configuration, you should be set.
Additional security might involve adding a firewall machine to
protect your network from outside intruders. CheckPoint Software's
Firewall 1 is a popular protection solution.

Hardware isn't all you need to access the Internet; you must also
choose an ISP. Some ISPs provide Internet addressing and a complete
suite of Internet connection options. Some might even suggest a
router solution for your environment.

WHERE'S THE CACHE?

QI've been told that the key to NetWare optimisation is to add more
memory. But before adding more RAM, I need to know how to calculate
the ideal amount of cache to support basic server operations.

AYou're right. Cache sizing is often the most beneficial
optimisation process you can perform on NetWare servers. The trick
is determining the right amount of cache for a particular server.

Unfortunately, the server memory calculations included in the
NetWare 3 and 4 documentation are outdated and, in some cases,
produce incorrect requirements. To avert this possible disaster,
take a look at two procedures that Novell has published.

The first procedure is a memory calculation worksheet that
estimates RAM requirements for new servers. The worksheet
incorporates factors, such as the server's volume parameters, NOS
features, and number of users, to produce the total memory
requirement for the server. If you're building a server with third-
party NLMs and additional name spaces, an option lets you add more
RAM requirements for these services. When you're finished with the
worksheet, you simply round the resulting estimate up to the
server's nearest memory configuration and install that much RAM in
the server. You can find the worksheet in "Calculating Memory
Requirements for NetWare 3 and 4," in the Novell Application Notes,
January 1995. An automated version of the worksheet, called
SMEM.EXE, is available in the NOVUSER forum of NetWire on
Compuserve.

The second procedure is a cache-tuning procedure for existing
NetWare 4 servers. Every server supports a different set of users
and applications; the workload they produce can significantly
affect the server's cache. In some cases, the estimate you derive
using the preceding worksheet can be several megabytes off. This
tuning procedure allows you to monitor the NetWare 4 least-
recently-used (LRU) Sitting Time Statistic in MONITOR.NLM and tune
the server's cache for its specific production environment. This
procedure is documented in "Tuning Cache with the NetWare 4 LRU
Sitting Time Statistic," in the Novell Application Notes, March
1995.

These procedures can also be found on the Web (http://www.
novell.com) and in Novell's Network Support Encyclopedia (NSE Pro)
on CD-ROM. To subscribe to the Application Notes or NSE Pro CD,

NETWORKS: Tools of the Trade

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

To ensure its technical support employees are well-versed in both
product knowledge and customer relations, WRQ requires all
potential technicians to participate in a three- to six-month
program called the Hatchery. This informal training program allows
"hatchlings" to learn about fielding support calls and the WRQ
corporate culture, which promotes treating people as assets and
giving employees freedom to do their jobs unencumbered, all without
a set schedule of courses.

LAN Mag: How many support technicians work for WRQ?

Walker: A hundred in Seattle, and we also have technical support
people in our European headquarters in Holland and in our
Southeast-Asia office in Singapore. In fact, because our sales are
through distributors, the main reason for our international offices
is for support.

LAN Mag: Do you feel that other organisations don't put that same
career-oriented spin on tech support?

Walker: I don't know specifically about other organisations, but
generally most people perceive technical support as being a burnout
job. A person normally would not think of making a career out of
technical support if they could avoid it. But that's not true here.

While the company has very low turnover in general, I think
technical support is actually our lowest turnover department.

LAN Mag: What types of resources and tools do your technicians have
at their disposal to help them look into some of the complex issues
that arise with connectivity software?

Walker: Well, a lot of people are not sure which parameters to aim
for when they're building in support because there are all these
different situations. There are simple questions, and, at the other
extreme, there are very complex questions. What we try to do is
take the attitude that first off, the customer support person is
supposed to have ownership of the problem. In other words, we don't
use really a multitier, escalation system. But if we have senior
professionals as tech support engineers, then once a problem is
assigned to them, they are there to own the problem.

In essence, they have the discretion to pursue the problem to the
end of the earth, if need be. That might be a sort of extreme case,
but in order to solve a problem that is very tough, you may have to
go back to the programmers of the product.

LAN Mag: Besides being highly trained, do the technicians have
copies of the products at their disposal or a simulated environment
set up at your offices?

Walker: They have a very generous allotment of hardware, and they
have access to every level of software up through the source. But
more importantly, technical support is actually proportional to the
developmental organisation. And that's a little unusual.

LAN Mag: So technical support is under research and development?

Walker: Yes. The technicians have access to the people that develop
the product. The frustrating thing that I have experienced as a
consumer is that in some organisations, there is no path between
the people who are doing support and the development of the product
itself. But, if a problem extends into the base functionality of a
product, there's nothing you can do.

LAN Mag: In developing your model for fielding tech support
questions, did you look at the competition?

Walker: We certainly go to a lot of conferences and try to track
what other people are doing. We try to adopt any kind of ideas and
systems, but it is a homegrown system that's been developed by our
company in response to our customers' needs.  LAN

NETWORKS: Build Support to Build User Loyalty

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Fifteen years ago, when the PC market was still in its infancy, a
group of individuals in Seattle shelled out US$500 and started
Walker, Richer & Quinn (WRQ). The company founders, including
current president, Doug Walker, and vice-president of product
development, Craig McKibben, saw the potential of the PC and its
interaction with legacy systems.

LAN Mag: Has the growing complexity of the networking world led to
the need for more technical support or a different approach toward
it?

Walker: When the PC started becoming commercially available in the
early 1980s, people were rebels; they were more self-supporting,
which represented a revolt against the big glass room with
mainframes and centralised IT.

They were circumventing IT as an act of rebellion. IT wasn't part
of the decision and also wasn't responsible for supporting any of
the new products.

In more recent years, because of the growing complexity of
networking and communications, people are ceding control back to
IT. Buying decisions used to be driven by individuals, then by
departments, and now it's by IT. Instead of a departmental decision
about software, you're making a corporatewide and enterprisewide
decision about buying a piece of software. Often those buyers are
very concerned about support, and that's one of the first things
they want to talk about. They are very, very worried about the
support, so when you do these contract negotiations to make one of
these big sales, one of the first things out of their mouths is,
'Let's talk about support.'

LAN Mag: Does that apply more to host connectivity software, such
as your Reflection line of products, especially since customers are
buying thousands of licenses to connect PCs or workstations to
enterprise systems?

Walker: Yes. It's usually the first word out of their mouths,
whereas back in the Wild West days it was more of an after thought.

LAN Mag: Why has technical support traditionally been an
afterthought?

Walker: The early adopters of PC technology were more self-
sufficient, and they took it upon themselves to deal with any
problems that would arise.

But I think the complexity has grown. When we started the company
up I was a programmer, and one of the really and truly fun things
about a PC was that you could understand everything in the whole
machine. Now it's just too complicated.

LAN Mag: Are you trying to use your mainframe background as a
competitive advantage in promoting your technical support and
services to customers, and do you feel that technical support plays
a big role when companies make a purchasing decision?

Walker: It's definitely a key differentiator.

LAN Mag: For the most part, is Guide Services the support that
you've offered all along, only now it has a specific name?

Walker: Yes, it's putting a name to the services that we have been
offering, and it also marks an introduction of some new services.
One of the reasons for putting this name on it, too, is to heighten
our customers' awareness that these services exist.

What we wanted to do under the Guide Services umbrella was include
what we call our Help Desk Plan. We wanted to be able to provide a
set of services that was particularly geared toward a help desk. We
wanted to create a flat-fee-based service plan that was based on
the installation size, set up a priority support team that could
meet some of the customers' specific requirements, give a
guaranteed technician response time, include product training, and
provide customers with technical information bulletins that give
depth of information greater than what other customers might need.

LAN Mag: How do you differentiate the Help Desk Plan from the
primary support plans of traditional technical support services,
which provide free, ongoing technical support?

Walker: The Help Desk Plan doesn't replace the traditional plan.
For most of our customers the traditional plan is quite sufficient.
But there were additional services that especially the very large
customers were asking us for, so we felt like we needed to design a
plan to provide those.

LAN Mag: With an internal help desk application, or even if you
outsource the help desk functions, a staff can solve a variety of
problems, not just those related to one manufacturer or one type of
product. Does your help desk follow along the same lines, or is it
exclusive to WRQ's Reflection line?

Walker: Well, we don't have training on other products, but one of
the things that's been a differentiator of our technical support
across the board has been our desire to support customers in their
environment. In other words, we didn't want to pass the buck; if
the customer called us up with a problem with another piece of
software, we typically try to remain the point of contact, try to
solve the problem with them, or in some cases call the manufacturer
of the troublesome software. Sometimes it's our software that's
causing the problem, but the customer doesn't always really know.
And the boundaries between your software and someone else's are not
always very well defined. So one of the differentiators for us is
that we've always been willing to have an extended view of where
that boundary is.

LAN Mag: Are your help desk technicians using software at their end
in order to keep track of the number of calls open and log them in?

Walker: We use software from Scopus for tracking problems. We also
use it for development as well. It's our bug-tracking tool; in
other words, if test engineers were testing a product, they would
run it through Scopus. It's an integrated system involving everyone
across our development organisation. Also, all of our international
offices are integrated on the same system. Then, we have a
knowledge base set up of instances, problems, and solutions. We use
Verity's engine to search that.

LAN Mag: From a support standpoint, do you keep records of each
customer as they call in? For example, if a company called today
and then again in six months with a similar problem would your
technicians be able to call up that record?

Walker: With Scopus' system, when someone calls in, it tracks the
case, and that record is an event of your problem. The record of
the type of problem as an archetype goes into this knowledge base
that we track with the Verity search engine. We even keep
individual cases; just because it's solved, it's not dead. We count
on the knowledge base to archive a case.

LAN Mag: In general what has been some of the feedback that you've
received from customers who've heard about your new offerings?

Walker: We've gotten a lot of comments back from customers. We also
did a lot of beta with key customers beforehand, so for a lot of
our key customers, the announcement was anti-climactic because so
many of them already knew about it. But, right now it looks like
the feedback is really good. I don't have figures on how many
people have signed up for this, but we're very pleased with the
results so far.

LAN Mag: How have you dealt with customers' normal frustrations
when they call a technical support line?

Walker: One of the things that's a bit confusing about support is
that consumers have different requirements, depending on what
they're doing. For example, if you just bought a word processor,
and you just typed up your story, and you wanted to print it, but
you couldn't figure out how, you might call the customer support
line. And you would probably like to know as soon as possible which
button to press to print the document. So the amount of time that
you spend on hold would be a key source of dissatisfaction. If they
said, "I'll let you know in a week," that might not do.

Similarly, if you have a mainframe or some sort of central server
or computer, people need hardware support. And, basically, if the
power goes down or the disk drive just died, you need the
supporting manufacturer or support organisation to get it back up.

It's more complicated if you're buying corporate connectivity
software. There are fewer of the "How do I print this document?"
calls. The nice thing about those calls is that they're not very
complicated, but the need for immediate response is high. It's more
typical in systemwide connectivity that the problem is very
complex, so the time element is different. It might be a problem
that requires weeks to solve or even may require onsite analysis.

LAN Mag: You discussed how tech support has changed over the last
15 years. What is your general opinion on the tech support
available today?

Walker: A lot of my own experiences are both prior to WRQ and
during the early years of WRQ, when I was doing consulting. When
you do consulting, you're putting together systems from different
vendors to create a workable system. And the biggest frustration
that I had, especially with software, was system problems. I would
get an intrinsic problem in some software and often the support
organisation that I would call had no way of dealing with it. It
was beyond the scope of their definition of support. It wasn't
whether their support was good or bad, it was not.

If [a company's] support is not so good, you can complain more and
jump up and down and raise more hell. But when it's not, it's
harder. And that's the toughest situation that I used to run into.
I think a lot of people who have been consultants have run into
that problem. So that may have been one thing that has coloured our
attitude toward not setting limits on a systemwide penetration of a
support call.

I think that problem is even more acute for people these days due
to the complexity of networking. Networking is such a huge issue
today, and it wasn't so much a few years ago. Right now, the
software that's causing the IT professionals to lose sleep and pull
their hair out is networking and the connectivity software.

LAN Mag: Do you see tech support, whether it's good or bad, as a
key factor in customers' company loyalty?

Walker: It certainly seems to work for us. I try as often as I can
to work on key sales situations. You'll run into situations
sometimes where it's a real advantage to compete with a company
that already is installed in a site if their support is bad, as
opposed to both companies arriving at the customer's site and both
claiming to have a great product and great support.

Let's say in this case the other company's product is already
installed and the customer discovered that the support was not so
good. Our support becomes a key way to make sales and close the
deal. It is definitely one of the key questions for customers.

LAN Mag: Some studies suggest that half of the cost of software
ownership is taken up by support. Does that mean customers are
paying that much for technical support services?

Walker: It's your own support infrastructure. In other words, what
does it cost to own a PC? A very elementary analysis would be,
'What are PCs going for these days?' But the truth of the matter
is, when you put all of the time of your support organisation out
there, it might be double that. Certainly we find that true in our
own organisation. The sticker price is only about half the story.
Support means more than your IS person walking around, loading
software, and upgrading software.

LAN Mag: Do you feel your approach to support services is unique in
the industry?

Walker: Our view of support is a differentiating point with us, and
WRQ has, from the beginning, looked at itself as a long-term
company trying to establish long-term relationships with our
customers. From the beginning, we've wanted to have this solution
orientation, and wanted to provide support to our customers to
build that relationship because we were taking a long-term view.
Our attitude toward tech support is that it's extremely congruent
with our overall business philosophy. If you're looking at the way
we do support, it makes it all very reasonable.  LAN

NETWORKS: GETTING WEB EXPERTISE?

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

For those who are interested in getting a head start in Web
publishing but don't have the in-house expertise, Netframe Systems
has just introduced the ClusterServer 8560i, a fully-integrated
Intranet server solution.

"Most companies are excited about deploying on Intranet, but many
do not currently have the in-house expertise required to get
started, " said US-based Rob Van Naarden, VP of Sales, Netframe
Systems.

"All that the company's webmaster needs to do, is simply answer a
series of short questions in a standard wizard."

The new system comprises a high-capacity Netframe server, Intranet
tools, Web server software, Netframe's own Site Architect software
and a comprehensive range of templates, wizards, tutorials and
scripts. Using this suite of products, corporations can create the
structure for an Intranet and have their system on-line in less
than sixty minutes, claims Van Naarden.

The price of the server starts at less than US$25,000 for a fully
configured system, including software.

Users design their Web site with Site Architect and then add
content. Netframe even provides pre-formatted content for useful
Web information such as delivery tracking, airline and hotel
contact information.

Netframe's Intranet server is based on the company's ClusterServer
platform, Windows NT, the Microsoft Internet Information Server
(IIS), Microsoft Access database, and the Excite search engine, and
Netframe's Site Architect software.

Netframe has offices in Singapore, China, Japan, Hong Kong and
Australia.  LAN

NETWORKS: PCL 6 Speeds It Up

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

The watched printer never prints. Instead, it sits calmly, lights
on, processing, taking its own sweet time-while you wait. For those
tired of the waiting game, Hewlett-Packard's (HP) new version of
Printer Control Language (PCL 6) decreases the downtime between the
print command and tactile gratification.

HP has been upgrading PCL since 1984, when the language was first
introduced to improve communication between laser printers and
workstations.

PCL 6 is designed for Windows and OS/2 environments that are
saturated with complex graphics. The Windows graphical direct
interface (GDI) commands are translated by the printer driver into
PCL commands, which are sent by the host computer to the printer
via the network or local parallel connection.

PCL firmware in the printer, in conjunction with the printer's
processor and memory, translates the PCL commands into dots. Then
the laser printer engine images the dots onto paper.

Complex documents print faster because the printer's PCL 6 firm-
ware and hardware process smaller, more compact object-oriented
commands for graphics rather than long strings of code sequences.

For example, using PCL 5e, 1,130 bytes are needed to print a
rectangle with rounded corners. PCL 6 prints the rectangle using 19
bytes, reducing the amount of traffic.

PCL 6 also allows users to regain control of their PC and
applications sooner because the printer driver quickly translates
the GDI commands to PCL 6.

Improved print quality is another aspect of PCL 6. Users get true
WYSIWYG printing because the PCL commands that define a document
map more closely to GDI commands, and the Windows printer driver
automatically downloads fonts within a document to the printer if
they are not loaded on the printer.

In addition, PCL 6 has complete backward compatibility. For the
benefit of users today, PCL 6 is currently included in HP's latest
range of LaserJet 5, 5N, and 5M laser printers.  LAN

NETWORKS: UB Networks Revamps Support

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

UB Networks may be in an iffy position with regards to its future
parent but it is toning up to remain in the business. Peter Ciceri,
vice-president and general manager of Asia-Pacific operations
recently let on that a comprehensive revamp of their customer
support programme was due.

At press time the sprucing up had barely begun but Ciceri promised
that UB faithfuls could look forward to a "channels-ready, end-user
driven support programme".

"We will concentrate on professional services, customer care and
post-sales support," said Ciceri. "End users can look forward to
even obtaining level one service direct from UB should they choose
to. Certified channel partners can provide up to level two support.

"The end user will determine who [the VARs or UB] he wants to work
with," said Ciceri. He added that directors for services and
customer care would soon be hired.

UB has been trying to establish itself outside of the high end
segment. Said Ciceri, "We need to take price cuts [in the mid- to
low-end] to build the market." However, Ciceri felt that UB was
strong enough at the high-end: "We have reset prices across the
region to meet competitor prices aggressively."  LAN

NETWORKS: Hughes Provides Satellite Link

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

If the current crop of wide area connectivity options doesn't give
you the performance or speed you've been hoping for, NetWare-
centric users can now harness the speed of satellite communication
for applications such as broadcasting large files to a number of
locations and shared high-speed Internet access.

DirecPC for NetWare, jointly developed by Hughes Network Systems,
Helius, and Cisco Systems, builds on a standalone product released
by HNS in 1994. The networked version includes hardware from HNS,
ISA card for the NetWare server, Internet Junction IPX-to-TCP/IP
software from Cisco, and LAN-to-satellite integration software from
Helius.

DirecPC provides two services: Turbo Internet and Digital Package
Delivery. Turbo Internet allows users to dial in to their ISP
through a browser and send requests through a modem. The Digital
Package Delivery service provides a way to deliver data files to
multiple locations through a single broadcast at speeds of 3 Mbps.

NETWORKS: Olicom Raises Profile

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Denmark's Olicom is laying the groundwork for a drive into the
workgroup switching market with Token Ring, Fast Ethernet and 155
Mbps ATM hardware due out in early '97. Olicom, with regional
offices in Singapore and Hong Kong, has been established in Asia
for a couple of years, but has yet to be known outside of the Token
Ring sphere.

Michael Jonsson, vice-president of international sales, said that
this impression was going to change. First on the to-do list would
be an upgrade of all support services for the region to pave the
way.

"We need to build up the support programmes because we are not
prepared yet. We have a low profile in Asia-Pacific," said Jonsson.

"One part of the rejuvenated support plan involves more pre-sales
staff in Asia. They will help the end-user do testing for product
suitability and directly work with them."

For Level 2 technical support, Jonsson said that a central site
would be set up in Sydney by the end of the year to provide 24
hour, multi-language phone support. Customers would be given 1-800
numbers and calls would be automatically routed to open support
offices. "However, we believe that nine out of ten questions can be
solved by Level 1 support," said Jonsson. Olicom's distributors and
VARs would provide Level 1 support. Two of Olicom's VARs here are
ITS and Teledata.  LAN

NETWORKS: ManageWise Grabs NT and Java

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

The story of ManageWise has always been about the expanding reach
of the management console, according to Prem Uppaluru, Novell's
vice president and general manager of the company's management and
administration division.

When Novell combined its NetWare Management System (NMS) with
Intel's LANDesk Manager in early 1995, the server-centric and
network topology functions of NMS were added to the primarily
desktop-oriented functions of LANDesk. ManageWise 2.0 incorporated
user administration into the product and also added features that
support management by third-party service providers, such as
integrators and value-added resellers.

Novell's management and administration division is currently
beginning to pass along the results of last year's initiatives by
delivering cross-platform networking services, rather than
proprietary file and print transport services. ManageWise 2.1, set
for release in the third quarter of 1996, extends the product
beyond the NetWare space. The new version includes a management
agent for NT Server that allows the ManageWise console to
configure, control, monitor, and troubleshoot the heretofore
foreign servers using the same interface and the same SNMP access
mechanism it uses for NetWare servers.

New client support in ManageWise 2.1 includes OS/2 Warp and Windows
95, and Windows NT Workstation support is due by the end of 1996.
Novell has restructured its relationship with Intel to eliminate
out-of-sync update problems, with Novell taking responsibility for
upgrading the ManageWise components; Novell will provide those
components to Intel for its separate line of LANDesk products.

Upgrades to ManageWise in 1997 will include a Web browser console,
which will provide cross-platform access to management and
administration data, and Java applets executing on NetWare servers
and on the browser system will deliver such capabilities as real-
time traffic monitoring and disk drive utilisation statistics.  LAN

NETWORKS: Novell Brings Out IntranetWare

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Convert the majority of its NetWare 3.x users over to Netware 4.11,
Novell has decided to launch IntranetWare in Asia. IntranetWare is
a bundling sweetener that will include the latest NetWare 4.11
(code-named Green River, NetWare Web Server, Netscape Navigator,
Web-site authoring tools and a multiprotocol router for WAN and
Internet connections.

"We are now making it very compelling for users to go on to NetWare
4.11. Previously, they may not have seen any real benefit upgrading
to NetWare 4, but today we are offering them ready components for
Intranet. With IntranetWare, users are only adding value to
existing network," said Derek Foo, Novell's managing director for
Singapore and S.E Asia region.

IntranetWare enables IT managers to choose how and when they want
to transition their corporate networks to intranets, by allowing
them to selectively install those networking components.

Novell is giving organisations a platform upon which they can add
ManageWise and GroupWise to create full-service intranets that will
include directory, security, file, print, management and messaging.

To access the intranet, users only need to launch the Netscape
Navigator browser from any desktop workstation and pass network
traffic to the server for IPX-to-IP translation.

Traditionally, network administrators had to install and maintain a
separate IP stack on each desktop to provide NetWare clients with
access to IP-based intranet or Internet services. Because IP is
only deployed on the IntranetWare server, administrators save time
and money by tracking and maintaining only one IP address per group
of users.

When organisations are ready to move to IP, IntranetWare supports
TCP/IP with dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) and BootP to
ease IP address management. Future enhancements to IntranetWare
will feature full firewall and proxy cache capabilities. The
product will ship in October.  LAN

NETWORKS: LAN SupportPack

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Just launched across Asia, Hewlett- Packard's (HP) LAN SupportPack
programme allows smaller companies to supplement the services of
their VAR with what HP guarantees to be "reliable" phone support
from HP technical staff.

To keep things simple, you just go to your VAR and actually buy
"packs" off the shelf. These yellow boxes contain a password, a
log-in diskette for your network details and specs and an
"incident" card for you to keep track of the number of times you
call HP. The packs are sold in 5- and 10-incident versions.

From their experience, HP says that 75 per cent of problems can be
resolved remotely. For on-site work, however, you would still
require the services of your VAR.  LAN

NETWORKS: Continuity Plan

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

The Singapore Computer Society has established a new sub-group (or
chapter, as they call it) in late August.

Called the Business Continuity Group (BCG), it aims to promote
Business Continuity as an essential component of business strategy.

As explained by group president Goh Moh Heng, Business Continuity
goes beyond disaster recovery which is merely the IT part of the
strategy.

Organisations with a Business Continuity plan can gain more time
for a total infrastructure revamp should disaster strike.

In the long run, the BCG also intends to tie-up with organisations
in the US or the UK to run examinations in Asia to certify BC
specialists.

Goh said that the affiliated organisation had not been decided yet
although one possibility could be the Disaster Recovery Institute
of the US.

At press time, a first conference was scheduled to run in Singapore
on Sep 30 as part of the BCG's activities.  LAN

NETWORKS: D-Link Rounds Out Customer Service

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

D-link is putting the final touches to a sophisticated 24-hour
customer service programme which it says will raise their
responsiveness several fold for both their VARs and end-users. "We
are now three months into the programme and field problems have
been drastically reduced by 50 per cent because of our problem
tracking system," said Henry Ngai, D-Link's vice-president of
marketing and customer support.

The new programme uses Australia as a global support centre with
Singapore as the regional support centre, and arms D-link support
staff with a Lotus Notes-based intranet for access to a
synchronised solution database and customer equipment purchase
records and problem logs.

Said Ngai: "If Australia logs off, customers can call the UK and
they would have the same records there. Databases are synchronised.
Calls can be forwarded to the different customer service units as
well. The nature of support is really trial and error." In the
past, each country maintained its own database of customers.

Said Ngai, "Problems have been promptly identified and support
staff can fax or download from the web."

The D-link support structure consists of 3 layers. Level 1 problems
are mostly to do with parameters and settings. These are non-system
problems. Level 2 engineers handle problem tracking and isolation.
Level 3 engineers fix the bugs and solve those problems which
cannot be solved in the field.

"We have relocated level 2 support into the testing labs. The
company has spent between US$5 to US$6 million on equipment and we
are sure that we can replicate all problems encountered in our
labs. In the past, some problems were not tracked," said Ngai.

At the centre of the programme is a new independent customer
service division (CSD), which controls customer service units in
each country. "Now, no matter what the query, the CSD will handle
the matter," said Ngai.  LAN

NETWORKS: Video Link Options

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Lucent's Multipoint Conferencing Unit (MCU), release 4.0 has been
introduced into the Asian market as ISDN services get ever more
popular and economical.

Features to be noted in this version are options for data sharing
through a video link, the expansion of four access ports to 64, and
to include four on-screen callers, with the ability to visually
link 24 locations on a single MCU or 46 locations between two
connected MCUs, which the sales support manager of Lucent's
business communications systems division, Lawrence Lee claims is
not offered by any other system.

"Through the feature of continuous presence plus we can deliver
this kind of switching, whereas our competitors can only view five
fixed locations with additional participants being heard, not
seen," he said.

The system is capable of transmitting voice, video, and data at
speeds from 112 to 1920 Kbps, supporting ITU standards H.320 and
T.120 for video and data conferencing respectively. Additionally,
release 4.0 is compatible with algorithms used on videoconferencing
systems from Intel, PictureTel, and Compression Labs.

According to Lee, the product is expected to be well accepted,
especially in markets such as Hong Kong where PRI ISDN is to be
launched by the end of this year, and in China where private
networks can avail of facilities such as videoconferencing.

Users may be interested to know there is an additional upgrade
investment plan, which allows the client to set up an annual or
monthly payment schedule for future upgrades, with automatic
updates of hardware and software once they become available.  LAN

NETWORKS: ATM Banks in China

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

The LAN business unit of Datacraft China is about to construct
Shenzhen Development Bank's (SDB) entire branch networking
infrastructure based on ATM technology.

SDB has purchased Cisco's Lightstream 1010 switch, Catalyst 5000
and 3000 Ethernet switches, Cisco 7507 and 2522 routers, as well as
stackable hubs from Bay Networks. The system, which is to provide
LAN connections with IP/IPX, is expected to offer connectivity to
70 branches of the bank throughout Shenzhen in mainland China.

Enhanced bandwidth for multimedia applications, will be available
via the ATM technology using China's high-speed digital data
network (DDN) backbone.

The contract is worth US$680,000, the largest of the total four now
managed by Datacraft in the Guangdong province of China, with three
in Shenzhen and one in Zhuhei.

But although the LAN market-base in China is huge, the profit
margin is small, with so many vendors now fighting for market
share.

Said Stanley Chan, Datacraft's South China account manager :"How do
you compete with other distributors who represent the same vendor
such as Cisco. It is cut-throat competition."  LAN

NETWORKS: Get Management Tools

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

For those who are venturing out from the relatively safe
environments of host-based computing and the centralised management
view, now might be a good time to try client-server as the number
of systems management products are starting to surface in Asia.

Getting an application management product to integratewith your
existing network management platform is a good place to start. One
company which dabbles in apps management is Compuware.

Compuware has a line-up of mainframe management products but it is
their client-server range that catches the eye. Central to it all
are its Econet and Ecotools products which allow managment of apps
on the LAN/WAN and servers, respectively.

Ecotools work through polling agents residing in your distributed
hardware and offers event management, performance monitoring and
resource monitoring. Econet monitors apps traffic on the network
with RMON probes and can be set to notify you should thresholds be
exceeded. A modeling tool is included to allow you to test adds and
changes before any physical work is begun.

Compuware's international sales manager for Ecosystems, Gary Angel,
revealed that a new product, Ecoclient, would soon be available to
allow fault-detection and diagnosis on hung apps. "It would take
the terminal information and see which module failed. It can then
page you, trap information and show enough so that engineers can
fix the code," he said.

"Start to evaluate management tools today. Don't add apps and
servers first because it will get too messy," said Angel. "Consider
tools such as apps management first to get the apps up 100 per cent
of the time."  LAN

NETWORKS: Switches Rule!

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Industry consultant Tom Noelle, president of US-based CMI, predicts
that routers will eventually be replaced by switches."Users are
still going to have some performance determinism loss even if you
build a switched virtual core," says Noelle. "The funtion of a
router is inherently non-deterministic. A LAN switch is the only
solution that allow users to allocate resources specifically to the
application flow."

As compaines move into enterprise TCP/IP, many will develop a
requirement for central-policy management. "A user can't just
request for any amount of bandwidth," said Noelle. "Some mechanism
has to inform the network how much bandwidth to allocate."

By moving into policy-bandwidth management, the industry is
drifting away from the concept of routers. Routers were designed
with the idea that end-systems decided what they were going to send
and the network just carried it.

Cisco realises that the router is doomed as a strategic device,
which is why it is now moving into the switching arena.  LAN

NETWORKS: MORE ROUTERS TO THE EDGE, BUILD ATM CORE

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

If you want performance determinism, then you don't want routers.
This is the view taken by Tom Noelle, president of US-based CIMI, a
network consultancy firm.

A router, according to Noelle, is simply nothing more than a
connectionless device. "Routers do not allow users to allocate
resources to a particular information flow in a way that's really
effective," said Noelle

"If I have an e-mail and video flow through a router, it doesn't
know the difference between the two and can't give one of them
priority over the other."

So does this spell the death of routers in networks? Apparently,
not just yet.

Router vendors are working hard to improve this. There's now a
protocol called RSVP or Resource Reservation Protocol that is
supposed to provide the prioritisation of important traffic flows.

"The only problem with RSVP is that it's easy for routers to make a
reservation but it's hard to fill one. In terms of implementation,
what do you do in a router to make this flow work better that that
flow," said Noelle.

The solution is to have a check list to see which particular flow
should be given priority. However, this can be very time-consuming
especially if you have a very long list.

Router vendors have also come out with the solution of sticking a
virtual circuit processor on the router to make their routing
process more efficient. "But even if you do this, you are still
routing," Noelle cautioned.

Cisco's architecture like NetFlow, for example, builds virtual
circuits with a packet processor that runs underneath the router to
reduce the amount of information the router handles.

"The only way to make a router deterministic is to stop making it a
router. So why not go the rest of the way by not having it there to
start off with," said Noelle.

Users should instead consider LAN switches. Routing could exist
only at one place in the network and that is where a connectionless
LAN has to be connected into a virtual circuit infrastructure,
according to Noelle.

"My advice is to build a virtual circuit core with Frame Relay or
ATM switching and push all the routers to the very edge of the
network. Once you've done that, begin to replace them with LAN
switches on a phase by phase basis," said Noelle. "Use routers only
where you don't have any performance problems."

The router, added Noelle, will eventually become a small low-cost
device that's subservient to the ATM network, instead of the
building block of the network itself, added Noelle.  LAN

NETWORKS: LAN MAGAZINE: EDITORIAL: A New Frontier

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Having a bold vision alone is just not enough.

What sets Malaysia apart from the rest of the pack, is its
willingness to take a risk on leading-edge technologies. With the
nation's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) taking shape and with the
merging of telecommunications and networking technologies, Malaysia
and the rest of Southeast-Asia can be assured of contributing and
having a major impact on the world in the future of networking.

Even non-IT business executives are trying to grasp the concept of
the MSC, envisioned by the Prime Minister of Malaysia. But what
will ensure its success, as Oracle's chief operating officer Ray
Lane correctly points out, is the clarity and vision of this
concept.

A concept where attitude becomes a competitive advantage. And
Malaysia, he adds, is the first institution that has put forth
attitude in these critical factors for competitive advantage. The
PM of Malaysia, himself, is personally taking an aggressive role in
pushing IT into government institutions and universities.

Critics say that the Multimedia Super Corridor serves merely to
prolong the life of the country's booming economy. And they are not
wrong. Besides cheaper labour and lower operating costs, Malaysia
is also offering extremely attractive incentive schemes to lure
companies to relocate their headquarters, R&D as well as
manufacturing facilities along the MSC.

But more importantly, Malaysia aims to be the technology showcase
for the Asian region. Plans are in the pipeline to build individual
state networks and eventually link all thirteen states
electronically.

For a start, universities are now in the process of implementing
the latest high-speed networks such as ATM.

Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia just purchased 68 Centillion 100
Multi LAN/ATM switches from Bay Networks. The number of switches
installed across the campus is expected to make UKM one of the
largest ATM sites in the world. The network today connects about 40
buildings, covering more than 8 square kilometers of the campus.

But mind you, the UKM network is only part of a strategic nation-
wide push by the Malaysian government to network within the
community and leapfrog into the age of digital economy.

Riding the same route as the Internet, ATM networks will first
spring from universities and eventually, spread into the commercial
arenas through joint projects and partnerships .

Other early adopters of ATM are the technology parks, as they'll be
the first homes for new multimedia developers that will move into
the MSC. Hi-tech companies will want to run their sophisticated
systems and development tools on high-speed networking technology.

Ironically, the recent Kuala Lumpur City Centre project did cause a
stir among some ardent proponents of ATM. Imagine KLCC, Malaysia's
pride and joy, was going to use FDDI for its backbone, they
muttered.

"Why would anybody want to use such an outdated technology," said
one puzzled senior executive from a US-based networking company.
"Not only can it not carry multimedia traffic, in real terms, FDDI
is also very expensive. If anyone is looking for a backbone
technology today that is proven and stable, ATM is the obvious
solution."

However, conservative users contend that many of the major ATM
specs are still not out yet and that any "standard-compliant" ATM
products available today are somewhat proprietary.

Still, whoever wins the KL project (which is estimated to be in the
region of US$100 million) will be basking in the limelight. It's a
massive undertaking that's never be done before in the world, say
industry observers.

Like it or not, all eyes will be focused on Malaysia for the next
couple of years. Networking vendors are looking to Malaysia not
only for an ATM testbed but for other riskier technologies; and
later, hopefully, a shining example for the rest of the region to
emulate.

NETWORKS: LAN MAGAZINE: EDITORAL

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

As trade journalists, if there is one thing that we abhore more
than having to get into the office before ten in the morning it is
the bundle of phrases that fall under the banner of technospeak.
You must know them: the technical acroynms eg. SNMP, 100Base-T,
segmentation, RMON, agents and LAN Emulation. Or the concept jargon
where one word or phrase supposedly explains a sheaf of network
topologies eg. VLANs, SMP, Switched Workgroups, intranet. All a
kind of industry shorthand to be shared and bandied around among
those in the know.

To explain to users and network manager how the many new hardware
products fit in with existing networks, our writers most of the
time have to get to the very basics of a concept usually dunked
before them wholesale by the vendors, who also do their utmost to
convince us that their product does everything well. And even match
the colour of the carpet.

This is where the shorthand technospeak of the networking industry
kicks in. But what we are worried about is a new range of phrases
which are being shoehorned into the networking industry from the PC
world.

If you have been to enough seminars, you will know that the phrase
"total solution" is used far too liberally. The top hardware
vendors are guilty of this. Everyone claims to be a total solution
provider, and yet they have only recently acquired new companies to
fill out gaps in their product line up.

Plug-n-Play is another phrase that is totally inappropriate for the
networking world. And yet vendors just entering the small
office/remote office market are throwing this around to add glitz
to their new range of hardware. We even encountered sales managers
from the most well known router company who said, with a straight
face, that their new routers for this market were PnP. We fail to
see how configuring router tables can be an easy process. Perhaps
the sales contract includes free foreign labour.

In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king. In the land of
networking, snowjobs are increasing. Nowhere more so than in Asia
where certified NetWare professionals remain in shortsupply and
where UTP cabling is left to pullers without installation
certification at all. Where some with NetWare and TCP/IP basics, a
couple of years under his belt and a knack for Adobe Pagemill and
MS Word 6 can profess to be an intranet consultant. (We kid you
not)

We dare say that most of the time the vendors don't help either.
Maybe you caught the shifty dealings of the most well known NOS
vendor last month when another trade journal exposed its selective
manipulation of analyst data to place itself higher in the market
share stakes. Apparently the Microsoft marketing hoopla method is
being studied by competitors as well.

And the BS shovelling is not confined to salesmen. Visiting senior
executives can fall under the spell as well. Our latest encounter
was with a networking NIC vendor whose CEO popped into town for a
visit. On being asked about their business in Asia, he gave the oft
heard dazzle about how Asia is their fastest growing market, how it
will be their largest soon, blah blah.

What the executive did not realise was that the journalist
interviewing him before us was a close colleague of ours who had
grilled him to admit that his Asian market share had actually been
falling by more than a couple of percentage points since the year
past and that there had been difficulties with the authorities in
obtaining type approval.

The bottom line really is not to look for how cheap the product is
or how well the company name is lit in neon. The days of vendors
merely moving boxes in volume is not that far behind us. The only
real benefit is that networking technology does work.

So as you settle in with this latest offering from the Miller
Freeman publishing group, keep us in mind. We welcome all news and
letters, gripes and tips. Call or e-mail to aptnet@singnet. com.sg
and help us eradicate the snowjobs.

LARGE AND SMALL SMR OPERATORS JOIN HANDS...
  ...And Other Possible Headlines To Watch for in 1996

     The headline above is not as unlikely as it may seem, according
to Bob Foosaner, senior vice president-government affairs, Nextel
Communications Inc..  True, small and large specialized mobile radio
(SMR) operators seemed irreconcilable in 1995, as they clashed over
how the FCC should change the regulatory landscape at 800 MHz (LMRN,
Dec. 22).
     But SMRs big and small should be able to see eye to eye on many
regulatory issues that the commission will address this year, Foosaner
said.  
     "We [in] the SMR industry are going to become common carriers on
Aug. 10, 1996," said Foosaner.  "And there are eight to 10 outstanding
rulemakings that can ... either allow us to move our businesses
forward or adversely impact our businesses.  We should have common
interests in these proceedings, which may hurt the law firms, but
would help the industry."  
     It is in the interest of all SMRs, for example, to get an
exemption from the requirement of having to offer enhanced "911"
service (LMRN, Oct. 13). 
     Among the other questions the commission has yet to decide:  
     *  Should all CMRS providers be required to resell airtime, as
cellular companies must do today (LMRN, Sept. 29)?
     *  How should local exchange carriers and CMRS providers be
compensated for terminating one another's calls (LMRN, Dec. 22)?
     *  Should CMRS providers be required to provide interconnections
to one another (LMRN, Sept. 29)?                                      

  ...SMR Operators Drop Interconnect Service

     Depending on the rules the FCC imposes on CMRS providers, some
SMR operators may find it too onerous to offer interconnect service,
said Alan Shark, president and CEO of the American Mobile
Telecommunications Association (AMTA).  Shark pointed to the possible
requirement that CMRS providers may have to offer enhanced 911
services--as well as pay fees to help subsidize telephone service in
underserved areas.  In addition, they may have to modify their
networks to allow for wiretapping by the FBI, he said.
     "If you're interconnected, you may find that there are certain
responsibi-lities that come with that ... that may not be worth it."
     Another story still unfolding, Shark said, is how the commission
will define CMRS providers.  Such providers will be subject to certain
common carrier rules, unlike private mobile radio service providers,
which will be exempt.

  ...Commission Begins Licensing New Narrowband Channels

     This story is about the hope of private land mobile radio (PLMR)
users below 512 MHz, who face an ongoing freeze on new narrowband
channels created by the commission's June refarming decision (LMRN,
June 16).
     "We're waiting for the development of technical standards," said
Fred Day, executive director, government relations of the Industrial
Telecommunications Association (ITA).  Such standards, under
development by the Telecommunications Industry Association (Working
Group 8.8), should be available before March 1.  The standards are one
of three requirements for a successful refarming effort, according to
the Land Mobile Communications Council, a confederation of frequency
coordinators and other associations, including ITA.  
     The second requirement is that the FCC protect low-power offset
systems at 450-470 MHz from full-power systems.  The third is that the
FCC establish deadlines for the transition to more efficient
technologies.

  ...FCC Allocates New Spectrum for Public Safety

     The work of the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee
promises to be the major story for public safety radio users this
year, according to Bob Gurss, legal counsel, Association of Public-
Safety Communications Officials-International Inc.  The committee, a
joint venture of the FCC and the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration, is charged with determining the spectrum
requirements of public safety users through the year 2010.  
     "We feel that it is important that the FCC take some action in
the very near term before all the spectrum gets auctioned off," said
Gurss.  "That's our biggest concern."   The committee plans to issue a
final report by September.  Gurss said the FCC may adopt a rulemaking
proposal allocating new public safety spectrum and then fold in the
report as comments on the rulemaking.
     Another headline to watch for, "FCC Creates New Public Safety
Division."  Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Chief Michelle Farquhar
mentioned this possibility in a speech last month.

  ...Strong Partnerships Separate Winners and Losers in Paging

     It is not enough to be able to sell one-way pagers on your own
anymore, said Scott Baradell, director, corporate communications,
Paging Network Inc.. New services that carriers are offering to break
out of the pack require that they invest in alliances to succeed, he
said.  Voice paging, two-way paging, wireless e-mail:  all require
strong support from software and hardware developers, such as
manufacturers of personal organizers.  Carriers also will need to find
resellers with the expertise to market these products.

MOTOROLA SYSTEM OUTAGE LEADS TO STORM OF BAD PUBLICITY
Vendor Tried To Warn Portland of Potential Problem

     A failure by a 3-year-old public safety radio system promoted as
a showcase by Motorola Inc. whipped up resentment last month in
Portland, Ore., and generated press that is every publicist's
nightmare.
     Motorola had tried to warn the city:  Two months before the
outage, it sent a bulletin explaining how to reset the SmartZone
manager of the 800 MHz trunked system to prevent overloading.  But
Dennis Quail, communications services division director, said his
staff has no record of receiving it.  
     He added, "My question is, why wasn't [this parameter] set by
Motorola to start with? ... And if Motorola was aware of [the problem]
and they've got engineers locally in town, why didn't they come over
and make sure it was set [properly]?"
     LMRN was unable to contact Motorola executives in time to comment
on this article.  
     But one of Motorola's largest customers said that public safety
agencies must take a measure of responsibility for system failures.  
     "I would be less critical of the vendor [than Portland is]," said
David Held, deputy director-communications division of the Michigan
State Police.  "[That's] because a vendor, we must remember, is in
business to make money. ... A lot of people put their complete trust
in them and figure they'll do everything for them, not thinking what
their motives are."
     Quail responded:  "It's interesting that he might say that.  We
received the system from Motorola. ...
[The setting] was something that was supposed to have been in place. 
It's [wrong] that the customer had to find out about it the hard way."
     Regardless of who was responsible for the five-hour outage on
Dec. 12, city public safety officials put Motorola on the grill,
speaking out through the city's daily newspaper, The Oregonian.  
     "Here we have this multimillion-dollar system that allows us to
talk to everyone but the Lord himself, and when we need it most, it's
gone," Sgt. Bob Baxter of the Portland Police Bureau was quoted saying
in the Dec. 20 article.  Oregonian reporters were not able to get a
detailed response from Motorola.
     The Oregonian's editorial page took its own shot:  "Portland
ought to be the most cantankerous customer in the country until
Illinois-based Motorola delivers on the city's $8.5 million investment
in an emergency radio system that failed for 5-1/2 hours during last
week's big windstorm."                                                

  ...Director Calls Motorola Responsive

     But in an interview this week, David Kish, Portland general
services director, said that "to be fair, [Motorola] has worked very
hard in the past couple of weeks to fix the problem."  He said that
Motorola has sent roughly a dozen top corporate and engineering staff
to investigate the failure, and has placed an engineer on call.  
     Kish said Motorola believes it has fixed the problem (see side
bar, page 2); later this month, the company plans to test the system
to make sure.  
     Motorola also plans to upgrade the system's software, which
should eliminate some "mysterious events" that occurred last summer. 
One of these caused a "minor outage," Kish said.  "We've had minor
problems from time to time, but Motorola has been reasonably
responsive," Kish said.  
     "In any new system like this, you go though a period where you
have bugs."  But, he added, "This was the first big test of the
system, and it didn't do what it was supposed to do.  It was the first
citywide emergency that would create this kind of traffic."  The city
plans to run a disaster drill in February to try to rebuild confidence
among users.
     Kish confirmed that the city is withholding $500,000 of the $8.5
million system until the city is happy with the system.  The city also
has suspended visits by prospective customers; more than 100 agencies
from China, Japan, Spain, New York City and elsewhere have seen the
Portland system.  

  ...Should Portland Have Taken More Responsibility?

     Portland and Motorola collaborated on system design and
construction, and the city handles ongoing maintenance, according to
Quail.  He said the city devotes six full-time technicians to the 800
MHz trunked radio system.
     Michigan State Police's Held, also a Motorola customer, was
unaware of how much expertise Portland devotes to the system.  But he
believes that at least some agencies do "fail to have a resident
electrical engineer ... to design and look out for their own needs or
to hire a consultant."
     When LMRN described Portland's outage, Held said, "I would not be
too critical of Motorola in the scenario you described. ... It's
pretty standard in the industry, for example, that you don't mix data
and voice on the same channel.  I would say that that's more the
responsibility of the customer."  Quail responded that there was no
way for the city to have realized that the control channel was set for
both voice and data.  "My thinking is, if [Motorola] knew that, why
didn't they come over here, as we still have not accepted the system. 
And until we believe everything is performing properly, we will not do
a final sign-off."  (Dennis Quail, 503/823-6971; David Kish, 503/823-
5252; David Held, 517/336-6616; Pat Shod, Motorola, 708/576-6612.)

WHAT HAPPENED

     During a windstorm in Portland, Ore., on Dec. 12, roughly half of
the emergency workers using a Motorola 800 MHz trunking system were
unable to hear their dispatchers, according to David Kish, Portland
general services director.  The system failure lasted roughly five
hours.  Kish said the problem has been traced to a control channel
that was set for both voice and data, when it should have been set
only for data.  
     When the system was flooded with calls during the windstorm, it
was unable to assign channels quickly enough.  According to Kish, the
problem was exasperated by workers who kept clicking their units,
rather than clicking them once, then waiting for a call-back. 
     Kish said that nothing bad happened as a result of the outage. 
Emergency workers were able to talk to one another using simplex
channels, and they improvised communications with the dispatchers
using data channels and cellular phones.  Some police and firefighters
also used a backup land mobile radio system.
     Communications services division Director Dennis Quail said that
Motorola plans to rewrite the link protocol between the SmartZone
manager and the 6809 controller to permanently fix the setting on
data.

**********************************************************************

     At press time, the FCC announced that round 14 of the 900 MHz SMR
auction took in $61.7 million, excluding withdrawal payments.  There
were 81 new bids placed, down from 86 in the previous round.

TOP 10 STORIES OF 1995

1. FCC Begins Refarming of Private Land Mobile Radio Spectrum Below
512 MHz: The commission adopted the latest in a series of refarming
orders to increase spectrum efficiency.  The fallout in equipment
choices, channel availability and frequency coordination will be felt
for years (LMRN, June 16, Oct. 20, Dec. 1).

2. FCC Tries To Please Big and Small With 800 MHz SMR Order:  The
commission walked a narrow tightrope--some might call it a plank--in
trying to balance the interests of large and small specialized mobile
radio companies in its December order.  Barring delays, look for
auctions in late spring or early summer.  Small companies mounted one
of the largest land mobile lobbying campaigns in recent memory to
protect their interests (LMRN, Sept. 22, Dec. 22). 

3. AT&T, MCI and Sprint Enter the Paging Marketplace:  The big-three
long-distance companies all got into paging this year in a big way: 
MCI Communications Corp. through resale agreements with SkyTel Corp.
and Paging Network Inc.; Sprint Corp. through a resale agreement with
Paging Network Inc.; and AT&T through its purchase of McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc. (LMRN, Jan. 6, Sept. 29, Dec. 15).

4. FCC Issues 'Wish List' To Improve FCC Procedures:  A 32-page FCC
report on reinventing government provided the foundation for several
far-reaching initiatives, including the proposed expansion of the
FCC's auction authority--now proposed as part of the 1996 budget bill-
-and the simplifying of application procedures (LMRN, Feb. 3).

5. SMR Industry Growth Kept on Ice:  MTA-EMCI Inc. this fall predicted
that the number of specialized mobile radio (SMR) subscribers would
grow 13 percent this year.  Observers blamed part of the lackluster
growth on regulatory uncertainty at 800 MHz, including an application
freeze dating from the summer of 1994.

6. Public Safety Advisory Committee Formed: The Public Safety Wireless
Advisory Committee was formed this summer to determine public safety
spectrum requirements to the year 2010.  Hearing complaints that the
FCC and National Telecommunications and Information Administration
sometimes worked at cross-purposes, the House Subcommittee on
Appropriations (Commerce) asked the two to jointly sponsor the public
safety committee (LMRN, Aug. 4).

7. Congress Proposes Uniform Antenna Tower Rules:  The House version
of the telecommunications deregulation bill (H.R. 1555) would direct
the FCC to adopt policies regarding state and local regulation of
towers for commercial mobile radio services providers.  A compromise
version between the House and Senate versions of the bill still is
being worked out (LMRN, May 19).

8. 220 MHz Players May Be Forced To Return Money to Arizona Investors:
Specialized mobile radio (SMR) companies sat up this summer when we
reported that the Arizona Corporation Commission had accused SMR
Advisory Group, L. C. and several affiliated companies and executives
of running afoul of securities laws.  The case reflects efforts to
crack down on the sale of unregistered securities to ill-informed
investors (LMRN, July 21).  The case may be decided in early 1996.

9. APCO 25 Celebrates Incomplete Standard:  Although the Association
of Public Safety Communications Officials International Inc.
celebrated completion of the APCO 25 digital standard, critics were
quick to point out that the association still had work to do on the
trunking protocols (LMRN, Aug. 18).

10. SkyTel Launches Two-way Paging:  SkyTel Corp. got the jump on
rival paging carriers this fall by becoming the first company to
launch two-way paging service over narrowband personal communications
services (PCS) channels.  Although Motorola Inc. was forced to take
back an early batch of defective units, by December SkyTel executives
said that several thousand units were in the hands of paying customers
(LMRN, Sept. 22, Dec. 1).

NEW DEFINITIONS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC SERVICES

     The next meeting of the Public Safety Wireless Advisory
Committee-slated for Jan. 7-9 in Berkeley, Calif.--will take place,
even if the FCC and National Telecommunications and Information
Administration remain shut down.  The committee approved the following
definitions at its mid-December meeting.  
Public Safety:  The public's right, exercised through federal, state
or local government as prescribed by law, to protect and preserve
life, property, and natural resources and to serve the public welfare.
Public Safety Services: Those services rendered by or through federal,
state, or local government entities in support of public safety
duties.  (Don Speights, 202/482-1652; http://www.pcia.com.)

AMTA TO ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION OF 800 MHZ ORDER

     The American Mobile Telecommunications Association plans to ask
the FCC to reconsider its decision not to offer bidding credits to
small businesses in the 800 MHz SMR auctions slated for the middle of
this year (LMRN, Dec. 22).  The request likely will be filed by mid-
February in a petition for reconsideration and clarification.  The
association also plans to ask for an extension of the 800 MHz
rulemaking proposal's comment period.
     AMTA will decide what else to ask for in a meeting of its small
business council, regulatory forum and board of directors later this
month, Lyon said.       Along with bidding credits, AMTA likely will
ask the FCC to reconsider its plan to partly base the upfront payment
on how incumbered a license is.  Lyon called this equation burdensome
both for the commission and for bidders.  AMTA also will ask the FCC
to clarify how it plans to allow early nego-tiations between
incumbents and prospective auction winners.  What if these companies
do not win? asked Lyon.  Will they still have to pay the costs of
retuning the incumbents?  (AMTA, 202/331-7773.)

MOTOROLA HAVING TROUBLE MEETING DEMAND FOR PAGERS

     Motorola Inc.'s factories have not been keeping up with the
orders for pagers placed by at least one key customer.  A Motorola
spokesperson said that supply is expected to catch up with demand in
the next couple of months.  She attributed the shortfall to the fast
growth of the U.S. paging market, which took Motorola by surprise.
     During an analysts' teleconference Jan. 3, Steven Jacoby, chief
operating officer of Metrocall Inc., said that since the beginning of
August, Motorola has not been able to fill its pager orders on time.  
     The situation has improved "tremendously" in the last few weeks,
to the point where Motorola fills roughly 90 percent of any particular
Metrocall order on time, he said.  On time means four to six weeks,
Jacoby said. 
     However, Metrocall still is having difficulty getting enough
Ultra Express and Encore numeric pagers and Advisor alphanumeric
pagers to meet demand.  
     Jacoby said that the entire industry has felt the pager
shortfall.  Indeed, a spokesman for Paging Network Inc., the country's
largest paging carrier, acknowledged "periodic" shortages at Motorola. 
However, they have had no impact on the company's subscriber growth,
he said.
     Vincent Kelly, Metrocall chief financial officer, told analysts
that the company logged its strongest subscriber growth ever in the
fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.  It added more than 60,000 paging units
in service.  That is a leap over the third quarter's 42,000 gain, when
pager delays were at their worst.  
     "The problem that we had [that] quarter ... was [that] we
couldn't get our hands on product--period," said Kelly.   
     Metrocall's stock had dropped 39 percent from $29 on Sept. 21 to
$17.75 the day of the conference (Jan. 3).  Yesterday (Jan. 4), the
stock fell another $1.25 to $16.50.  Here are some other facts that
emerged in the analysts's meeting, in which company officials
attempted to shore up investor confidence.  
     *  Metrocall has its eye on several possible acquisition targets,
which together have more than 700,000 subscribers.  Currently the
company, the country's sixth-largest carrier, has an estimated 940,000
subscribers.
     *  Metrocall is talking with five paging carriers about reselling
their advanced paging services over narrowband PCS channels.  
     *  More than 41 percent of the company's subscriber base has been
won by indirect distribution channels.  Metrocall recently signed
distribution agreements with nationwide retailer Ritz Camera Centers
Inc., Beltsville, Md., and catalog sales company Crutchfield Corp.,
Charlottesville, Va.
     *  The company recently increased its direct sales force by 100
people.

IN BRIEF

     Glenayre Technologies Inc.  has introduced new network standards
designed to increase paging network capacity by nearly 100 times.  The
new protocols are called Wireless Messaging transfer protocol (WMtp)
and the Wireless Messaging application programming interface (WMapi). 
WMtp, which can coexist with the Telocator Network Paging Protocol
(TNPP).  It is based on the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) used in the Internet and allows operators to
transmit Internet mail to pagers.  WMapi lets service providers create
two-way messaging applications for narrowband personal communications
services (PCS) networks, including those supporting Telocator Message
Entry (TME) standard.  (Irene Moore, 770/623-2449.)

     MobileMedia Corp. (MBLM) plans to introduce single-frequency
pagers in the second quarter of 1996.   Company officials said the
switch to one frequency will allow consumers to upgrade their paging
services or to relocate without changing their pager.  Separately,
yesterday (Jan. 4) MobileMedia completed its purchase of BellSouth
MobileComm for roughly $930 million.  (Jean Coppenbarger, MobileComm,
601/977-1648.)

     At press time, Mobile Telecommunication Technologies Corp.
announced that it had added 135,600 paging and voice messaging units
in service in the fourth quarter, ended Dec. 31.  All told last year,
the company added 561,900 units, to break the million-units-in-service
mark.  Separately, the company named John Palmer, Mtel Chairman, as
acting CEO.  Bernard Puckett will step down to become a company
consultant.  The company expects to name a replacement for Pucket in
the near future.  (Scott Hamilton, Mtel, 601/944-3800.)

PAGING INDUSTRY BRACES FOR AUCTIONS OF 931 MHz LICENSES

     The paging industry is facing the prospect of competitive bidding
of one-way paging licenses for the first time.  Well over half of the
FCC's backlog of 8,000 931-MHz paging applications are mutually
exclusive, and those applications are likely to be awarded by
auctions, industry sources said.  
     According to Don Vasek, senior issues manager-industry affairs
for the Personal Communications Industry Association, the commission
since June 1995 has talked about adopting a rulemaking proposal to
resolve the mutually exclusive licenses.  However, we were unable to
contact FCC officials to comment on an expected release date due to
the partial government shutdown.  
     Vasek's talks with FCC officials suggest that the commission will
select major trading areas (MTAs) and basic trading areas (BTAs) as
the geographic boundaries for the licenses.  It also will choose
auctions to award them, he believes.

  ...Other Applications Also Pending 

     The FCC essentially has had an application freeze in place at 931
MHz since December 1994, Vasek said.  Part of the holdup stems from
the lack of a spectrum-sharing treaty with Mexico.  
     The commission had planned to meet with Mexican officials late
last month to decide how to share paging frequencies in border areas. 
At press time, we were unable to find out whether an agreement had
been reached.  The commission has been reluctant to grant new
applications for fear that the treaty--or lack of one--would have a
"daisy-chain" effect on existing and pending licenses, Vasek said.
     In addition, over the past six months the FCC has been developing
software and improving its data base to automate the processing of 931
MHz applications.  That software has just been completed, Vasek said. 
     According to Vasek, several dozen paging carriers, from small
local operators up to nationwide carriers, have 931 MHz applications
pending.  He said the expected rulemaking may ask the industry to
comment on whether the new regulatory framework at 931 MHz should also
be applied to 929 MHz, UHF and VHF bands.  
     Vasek said that there is "probably little chance of that
happening," however, because those frequencies have been used heavily
for "years and years and years."

JANUARY 8, 1996

'96 WILL BE A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR COMPETITIVE PROVIDERS

The new year is always a time to dream of endless possibilities,
but for competitive providers, 1996 could offer both the best
and the worst of times.

New entrants in the local exchange have an abundance of capital
available to them and will continue to forge ahead with
expansion plans.  But money must be spent wisely so that returns
on investment improve and profits grow.

Federal legislation - if it indeed passes - as well as number
portability and universal service trials, will play a key role
in hastening local competition's development.  But if a federal
law doesn't make it onto the books this year, and permanent
solutions for the technical details are not resolved, then it
could take almost two years for competition to become
widespread.

Pundits have said that if federal legislation doesn't pass this
year, it may not have another shot until 1997 or 1998 because
'96 is a politically charged presidential election year.

But as long as key congressional legislators make it known to
the industry that reform will come to the forefront again, it's
expected development of competitive markets will continue,
albeit slowly.

"As long as we have the impending threat, it will force
companies to strategize and negotiate a market position that is
good for us all," D. Craig Young, president of Brooks Fiber
Properties Inc., told Local Competition Report.

The industry is discouraged about the progress with federal
legislation.

"I'd like to say we're going to have legislation, but I don't
think so," said Heather Gold, president of the Association for
Local Telecommunications Services (ALTS).

Conferees still are trying to iron out a compromise that won't
get vetoed by the White House.

Top industry executives seem to agree on the odds of federal
legislation passing this session:  about 50-50.

It won't be the end of the world, though, if Congress fails in
its bid to reform the outdated 1934 telecom law.

"A national policy will speed things up...it would provide a
road map," Royce Holland, president and COO of MFS
Communications Co., told LCR.  "But from our standpoint, it's
not essential.  Things are happening so quickly in the states
and gaining momentum."

But without federal legislation, competitive providers will have
to continue fighting a state-by-state legislative and regulatory
battle.

States, however, will continue to advance telecom competition.
Even less progressive states, such as North Dakota and Montana,
may get caught up in the reform momentum.

States also will play a key role in developing permanent
interconnection rules and number portability, and will work to
establish a universal service funding mechanism appropriate for
competitive markets.

There are several active trials for number portability and a
permanent solution should be decided on by year's end.

"Policies may be in place [by '96], but implementation will take
until 1997," said Rick Kozak, president and COO of American
Communications Services Inc. (ACSI).

There will be a domino effect for instituting number portability
when permanent solutions exist.

"Once we get [number portability] in place in one state, the
others will fall," MFS's Holland said.

The issue needs to be forced through by regulators, Brooks'
Young, told LCR.  If not, "the local exchange companies will
keep trying to roll out number portability and pass unwarranted
costs to competitors."

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) now is exploring
number portability in a notice of proposed rulemaking, but it is
doubtful the commission will devise more than an outline for
implementation.

The FCC needs to be more proactive in the development of local
competition, industry leaders believe.

"We need a higher awareness from the FCC" in order to establish
fair interconnection rates and slow down premature lifting of
RBOC regulation, said Robert Annunziata, chairman, president and
CEO of Teleport Communications Group.

1996 and beyond will see former competitive access providers
(CAPs) continue to layer on new services and add switches to
become new and improved local exchange companies - but that may
be costly.

"It's somewhat facetious for CAPs to say they will be one-stop
shops," said ACSI's Kozak.

Kozak believes CAPs should focus on their core strengths - such
as circumventing the RBOCs networks for long-distance providers
- rather than spreading themselves thin as a local exchange
company.

"More companies die from indigestion than starvation," Kozak
said.

But other companies believe their game plan must include
switches in order to become truly competitive.

"CAPs will have to offer switched services" to gain a
competitive edge, said J. Shelby Bryan, president and CEO of
IntelCom Group Inc.

IntelCom and others plan to move into the switched mode in '96
and beyond.

"All of our switched services will not be put on by 1997," said
Brooks' Young.

It's likely today's budding local exchange companies will be
swallowed up by some of the market's big fish.

For instance, there has been speculation as to whether MCI will
buyout companies such as ACSI to help jumpstart it's local
subsidiary MCImetro with existing operations.

And MFS long has been touted as a prize to be acquired - but it
could be MFS that does the buying.

The first move in this direction already has been made by Brooks
Fiber Communications, which bought City Signal early last week.

BROOKS FIBER SHARPENS ITS TEETH WITH CITY SIGNAL ACQUISITION

Brooks Fiber Properties is starting its new year off with a bang
- with acquisitions, co-carrier agreements and hitting a
milestone in number of networks.

Local Competition Report has learned that Brooks has signed a
letter of intent to buy City Signal.

At press time, no details had been released about the price
Brooks paid for the Grand Rapids, Mich.-based competitive
provider, which operates a 25-route-mile Michigan network
extending through Grand Rapids, Holland, Zeeland and Traverse
City.

Speculation has run high through the industry about what would
become of City Signal since its parent company, US Signal, sold
its long-distance subsidiary Teledial last fall (LCR, Oct. 30,
1995).

At the time of the $115 million sale, City Signal said it was
planning to use the proceeds to fuel its expansion throughout
western Michigan and possibly beyond state borders.

The Brooks/City Signal deal is only the beginning of a trendy
shakeup in the competitive access industry, analysts believe.

"There's going to be a definite wave of consolidation," Darrell
J. Edmonds, associate managing director of Bear, Stearns & Co.,
told Local Competition Report last week.  Edmonds sees Brooks,
as well as other competitors such as MFS, swallowing up the
smaller guys in order to enter a market more quickly.

This move is definitely in line with Brooks' strategy, according
to Stuart Conrad, vice president of C.J. Lawrence/Deutsche Bank
Securities.

Brooks will continue to swallow up smaller competitive access
providers (CAPs) on their way to becoming one of the largest
providers in second- and third-tier markets.

The company has an aggressive game plan and met its goals for
1995.

Just under the wire, Brooks Fiber Properties captured the last
two cities to reach its goal of being in 20 cities by the end of
the year.  Brooks plans to invest more than $20 million to build
and operate fiber-optic networks in Stockton, Calif., and
Jackson, Miss.

And with the purchase of City Signal, Brooks brings the tally of
cities it's in up to 24 after the first week of 1996.  By the
end of this year, Brooks expects to be in more than 30 markets.

A co-carrier agreement Brooks made with Nynex last week removed
the last hurdle for providing local service in Massachusetts.
Brooks will install a switch in Springfield, Mass., and plans to
offer competitive dialtone services in the first quarter of '96.

In other acquisition moves, Brooks Fiber merged with its parent
company, Brooks Telecommunications, and the parent company's
primary operating company GLA International.  The move was
designed to bring GLA's capabilities of telecom engineering and
consulting activities to Brooks Fiber.

"Our new relationship will allow us to leverage the technical
expertise and industry experience of GLA in all areas of
telecommunications to facilitate the rapid expansion plans of
Brooks Fiber," said Jim Moffit, GLA's managing director.

The surviving company will be Brooks Fiber Properties.

TIME WARNER SEEKS PUCO AID IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH AMERITECH

Time Warner Communications sent out an SOS to the Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) for help in finalizing an
interconnection agreement with  local incumbent Ameritech.

But Ameritech claims that the cable company-turned-competitive
phone provider is engaging in a war of words intended to keep
the telco out of the cable business.

Time Warner had hoped to have a deal sealed by Dec. 31, 1995,
but the deadline passed without one.

With the PUCO's help, Time Warner hopes the last few economic
details can be worked out by Jan. 15.  If a deal can't be
reached, Time Warner said it will have to delay its plans to be
a competitor in the local switched service arena.

In its second required 60-day report to the commission on the
status of negotiations, Time Warner said all the technical
details of interconnection have been fleshed out in the good-
faith negotiations, but now comes the sticky part.

There are costs, for things such as interim number portability
and other items that neither company would comment on, that must
be ironed out before Time Warner can begin providing service.

The PUCO's staff most likely will sit in on final negotiations
between the competitors.  "We haven't made an offer yet," Kerry
Stroup, assistant directors of the PUCO's utility department,
told Local Competition Report at its deadline.  But he said that
doesn't mean one isn't in the making.

Time Warner could have filed a complaint with the PUCO, but has
not yet done so because it felt a compromise could be reached
with the commission's assistance.

"We didn't file a complaint because we're trying to keep this
below the level of a nuclear war," Marsha Schermer, regulatory
vice president for Time Warner's mid-West region, told LCR.

But the A-bomb may drop anyway.

Ameritech vehemently believes Time Warner is engaging in a
negative publicity campaign that will sway Columbus, Ohio, city
officials to delay or deny a cable franchise to the telco.

Time Warner's Schermer calls that "fascinating speculation."

In November, Ameritech and Time Warner apparently reached an
agreement on several key points.  But, in mid-December, Time
Warner came back with a new list of demands, according to James
C. Smith, Ameritech Ohio vice president.

These new demands are what has caused the delay, Smith told LCR.

"We didn't put on the table anything that looked new late in the
game," Schermer said.

Schermer said Ameritech has willingly negotiated the details
thus far, but believes Ameritech Information Industry Services
(AIIS) - the unit involved in negotiations - may not able to
make the final decision.

It is possible that another of Ameritech's seven business units
will have to get involved before all is said and done.

Smith noted that AIIS has been the lead negotiator for several
interconnection deals in Illinois and Michigan.  AIIS has final
authority to approve all aspects of the deal.

"It is especially ironic that Time Warner has chosen to use this
tactic when their own representatives have admitted that
Ameritech's cooperation has gone beyond what they have
experienced in other non-Ameritech states," Smith said.

Optimism remains that a deal can beworked out by Time Warner's
Jan. 15 deadline.

"If Time Warner is serious, one can be worked out," said
Ameritech's Smith.  "The question is do they want one."

Ameritech's Smith said he feels that Time Warner believes lack
of an interconnection agreement may keep the telco out of Ohio's
cable market.

Time Warner is seeking a regional agreement so it can hook up
with the incumbent local exchange company (LEC)  in the three
Ameritech states it has operations:  Ohio, Wisconsin and
Indiana.

Unfortunately for competitors in these three states, Ameritech
does not have the same willingness to interconnect as it does in
Illinois and Michigan.

In these two states, Ameritech is seeking acceptance of its
Customers First plan, which would allow the local provider into
the long-distance market.

"Does Ameritech want to be the leader  in supporting local phone
competition, like their ads say?" Schermer said.  "If it is such
a good idea [in Illinois and Michigan], why not in Ohio,
Wisconsin or Indiana?"

MFS Communications, one of the other certified competitors in
Ohio, just entered into negotiations with Ameritech Ohio.  And
though progress is being made, MFS predicts it will not have an
easy time of it.

"Ameritech has different motivation there than in Chicago," said
Dan Caruso, vice president of MFS's local services
implementation group.

MFS already has an interconnection deal with Ameritech in
Illinois and hopes it can transcend state boundaries.

"Some aspects can be regionalized, but for others it will be
necessary to treat them on a state-by-state basis," Caruso said.

IntelCom Group, which has an application pending in the state,
also said it expected to initiate interconnection talks with
Ameritech this week.

MCImetro, which has been approved by state regulators, has yet
to seek out an interconnection deal, Ameritech said.

MARYLAND PUTS PERMANENT RULES IN PLACE & RATES ARE BEST AROUND

Maryland's got a good deal on interconnection rates.

In its permanent rules regarding local competition adopted last
week, the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) has set up
interconnection rates of .5 cents a minute - lower than even
those rates of between .5 cents and .75 cents a minute set up by
trendsetting states like Illinois.

"This was a dramatic improvement over the interim rates (2.1
cents a minute)," Gary Ball, MFS Communications' director of
regulatory affairs for the Eastern Region, told Local
Competition Report.  "This sends a strong signal that the
commission is looking for companies to come in and compete."

Issues such as number portability and universal service will
have to be addressed in additional rulemakings, said Larry
Bugden, vice president of Teleport Communications Group's
Maryland network.

Development of universal service is one of Bell Atlantic's
primary concerns.

In addition to setting interconnection rates, the PSC set forth
the terms by which new local exchange companies can buy dialtone
lines from Bell Atlantic, either whole or in part.

The commission's order also ensured customers will have access
to "911" services and, thanks to an interim number portability
plan, they will be able to keep their current phone number even
if they switch providers.

Under the ruling, new competitors will be able to establish
their own local calling areas or use the same area set up by
Bell Atlantic.

FAILED COMPETITION BILLS IN ARK. AND MO., LEAD LEGISLATIVE
LOSSES

Among the unsuccessful legislative initiatives in 1995 were
legislative attempts in Arkansas and Missouri to open all local
services to competition and allow price-based alternative
regulation systems.

In both states, Southwestern Bell and GTE mounted a successful
lobbying campaign that squashed all attempts from moving
forward.  Southwestern Bell reportedly spent more than $5
million on its lobbying just in Missouri to stop the state's
local competition bill.

Other unsuccessful legislation included a Washington state bill
that would have prohibited intraLATA toll dialing parity until
1998.  Although the bill passed the legislature, Washington Gov.
Mike Lowry vetoed it as being contrary to the general pro-
competition direction of state telecom policy.

Another casualty included an Indiana bill that would have
required state certification of any provider of two-way video
services.

This seemingly-simple bill was withdrawn by sponsors in the face
of massive lobbying by cable TV interests that claimed it would
require them to obtain state territorial certificates in order
to provide interactive video services to schools or libraries,
and would give telcos a way to thwart commercial development of
interactive cable TV services until the telcos were able to
enter that market.

Nebraska was unable to pass a bill that would have given the
Public Service Commission jurisdiction over cable TV video
service quality and the power to resolve certain types of
consumer complaints involving cable TV video services.

Telephone companies, eyeing eventual entry into video services,
had pushed for the bill in hopes of consolidating handling of
video quality issues and customer video-service complaints at
the state level, rather than leaving these with scores of local
governments.

A North Dakota Senate bill to raise the maximum size for a
deregulated small telco to 50,000 lines failed to win passage,
although backers managed to push through a House bill raising
the size limit for deregulated status from 3,000 lines to 8,000
lines.

CABLE & WIRELESS ONE-STOP SHOP UP-AND-RUNNING IN NEW YORK CITY

Add Cable & Wireless Inc. (CWI) to the growing list of long-
distance providers getting their fingers in the local service
cookie jar.

But according to industry watchdogs, CWI may not be as
formidable of an opponent as the big three interexchange
carriers.

"I would be more concerned if companies said they weren't
getting into new markets," said Brian Adamik, an analyst at The
Yankee Group.  "Now we're going to see solely communications
services companies rather than local telephone and long-distance
carriers."

Although CWI is the first long-distance provider to offer resold
local service to customers in New York City, it seems that its
initial scope will be limited.

CWI will market its UniLink package of local and long-distance
service to its current business customers, which total more than
100,000 nationwide.

But the company plans an aggressive attack on the market.

CWI received authority in November to be a local exchange
provider in Connecticut and awaits word from commissioners in
California, Illinois and Texas.

"Our intent is to go national, [but] driving that is the
regulatory environment," Alan Stiffler, director of strategic
operations at CWI, told LCR last week.

CWI initially will resell local service from the networks of
incumbent LECs, competitive access providers or cable companies,
depending on what's available in various markets.

"Once we reach critical mass, we intend to be a facilities-based
provider," Stiffler said.

UniLink is up and running in New York City now after a nine-
month beta test ended last month.  The company would not say how
many customers currently use the package of services in the Big
Apple.

The long-distance giant could enter the local loop to challenge
Ameritech and GTE this year, depending on the speed with which
the PSC finishes its work on local competition rules.

RESELLERS CAN SIGN UP WITH AMERITECH MICHIGAN FEB. 1

Ameritech filed a resale and network interconnection plan in
Michigan, similar to the one it debuted in the Chicago area in
November (LCR, Nov. 13, 1995).

If approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission, the plan
will offer a host of Ameritech services and basic local exchange
components to companies licensed as local phone companies in the
state.

Enhanced features such as Caller ID, voice mail, Centrex and
ISDN also will be offered, discounted on a term and volume
basis.

Ameritech expects to have the resale options available Feb. 1.

GST Revenue Up 211% In 1995

GST Telecommunications reported revenue of $18.7 million for the
year ended Sept. 30, 1995, up from $6 million the previous year.

The Vancouver, Wash.-based telecom provider experienced a net
loss of $11.3 million (78 cents a share) for the year, up from a
loss of $3.5 million (33 cents a share) in 1994.

Losses are attributed to the significant number of sales,
marketing and management employees added to handle expansion of
networks.

NEBRASKA BEGINS HEARINGS ON IMPLEMENTING LOCAL COMPETITION

The Nebraska Public Service Commission will hold hearings
throughout the state in late January and early February to
receive testimony on opening the state to local competition.

Local exchange competition is set to begin in the state July 1,
1997. Interested providers will be able to file applications for
local authority Jan. 1, 1997.

A few of the issues to be discussed in the hearings will be
intraLATA dialing parity, number portability and the definition
of basic service.

For more information on hearing locations, dates and times,
contact the PSC at (402) 471-3101.

BELLSOUTH FIGHTS RATE CUT

BellSouth wants the South Carolina Public Service Commission
(PSC) to reconsider a recent order requiring the telco to cut
its rates by $42.2 million

In what could be the last Bell rate case decision in the state,
the commission set the company's return on equity at 12.75
percent instead of the previous 13 percent.

The PSC told BellSouth to reduce carrier access charges by $12
million, and cut rates for line hunting and PBX trunking
services by a total $15.8 million.

The order also requires BellSouth to reduce intraLATA toll rates
by $5 million, and lop $1.3 million from rates for direct
inward-dialing service.

The remaining $8 million must be applied to basic exchange
service rates, according to the rate design plan to be submitted
by the company later.

BellSouth said the ordered rate cut is more than twice as large
as is supported by the rate case evidence.  The company said
it could support a rate reduction of about $17 million.

BellSouth has proposed adoption of an indexed price cap plan as
a permanent replacement for earning-based regulation in South
Carolina.  A decision on that plan is expected soon.

U S WEST PROPOSES RATE REBALANCING

U S West has asked the Arizona Corporation Commission to approve
a revenue-neutral rate rebalancing plan that would shift about
$20 million in revenue away from intraLATA toll and onto local
exchange service.

The company estimated the change would increase local service
rates by an average of $1 a month.  U S West said it needs to
rebalance rates to cost in order to meet the expanded toll
competition expected this year following the April 1 date to
begin implementation of intraLATA toll dialing parity in
Arizona.

RHCs PLAN 1990 GRASSROOTS EFFORT TO RELAX MFJ RULES

     The 7 regional holding companies (RHCs) are preparing
expensive lobbying campaigns for this spring to urge local
telephone users to contact their Washington representatives and
demand legislation that will relax the hold U.S. District Judge
Harold Greene has over the modified final judgment (MFJ).
     The RHCs, however, are opposed by powerful informational
services and consumer lobbies that for years have been telling
the American public that if the restrictions are relaxed, the
RHCs may increase rates for voice services to subsidize the new
services.
     This year's campaign will claim through published articles,
mailings and print advertisements that 80% of the American public
supports the holding companies and wants the sophisticated
informational services the local Bell operating companies (BOCs)
want to provide, but--because of the restrictions--legally
cannot.
     The RHCs know that they must excite the American public into
action so Congress will be compelled to address what amounts to
the formation of a national telecommunications policy, THE LONG-
DISTANCE LETTER has been told.  If the issue is swept under a rug
once again, America's role as a telecommunications leader in the
global market may be threatened.
     Legislation that will revise Greene's oversight of the MFJ
is among high-priority items on the House telecommunications
subcommittee list, we are told, and will be pushed early in the
legislative session by subcommittee Chairman Edward Markey (D-
Mass.)
      Greene's restrictions to keep the holding companies out of
the manufacturing, long-distance and informational services
businesses have kept half of the nation's telecommunications
industry idle, the RHCs complain and may reduce America's future
in the telecommunications explosion to that of a buyer of
foreign-made goods and services.

Again, RHCs Say That the Situation Has Changed in Last 6 Years

     Conditions that existed 6 years ago when divestiture was
ordered have been outdistanced by changing world conditions, the
RHCs claim.  Located and oriented to regional markets, the
companies claim they do not have the capability any longer of
developing the monopoly that was foreseen in Greene's ruling.
     The RHCs also say that America already has fallen behind
other countries where such services as electronic mail delivery,
data inquiry, shopping, banking, hotel reservations, cable
television and others are being provided by telephone companies.
     France's Minitel has offered videotex and electronic
services since the mid-1980s, building a customer base of 5
million by providing free terminals.  Today the government-
subsidized company adds 10,000 customers per month and no longer
provides free terminals.
     Minitel's customers can use their videotex terminals to make
airplane reservations, trade in stock, buy from a catalog or find
out about weather conditions,employment opportunities, local road
conditions, and telephone and address listings from a database
inquiry service that accounts for 20% of the system's traffic.
     According to a study commissioned by the RHCs late last
year, 3 out of 4 Americans believe that "it is absolutely
critical" that this country provide services offered by other
countries.  Four out of every 5 people in the survey said they
would use a telephone computer to make appointments, review
supermarket "specials," communicate with government or school
officials or scan community "bulletin boards" if those services
were available on their telephone lines.

Public Pretty Much in the Dark About Strictures, Study Finds

      Amazingly, according to Dr. Harold E. Quinley, a senior
vice president for Yankelovick, Clancy and Shulman, the Westport,
Conn., research firm that conducted the survey for the RHCs, of
the 17,000 who participated in the survey, few knew that local
telephone companies could not provide the services described in
the survey, and most were surprised to learn that the reason the
services were unavailable was because of restrictions by the
federal government!
     "We are sure that the people we talked to did not know
(about the restrictions),"  Quinley told us.  He said surveyors
provided partial explanations of the restrictions to each person
taking part in the survey.  Some RHC lobbyists reported "victory"
in the last Congress with 2 anti-divestiture bills--one in the
House and one in the Senate--and see an early introduction of
revised bills this session.  However, even though members
described last session's bills as "highly charged" with "strong
interest on all sides,"  the bills did not get out of committees
because members were not compelled by their constituents to take
action, observers said.
     One House member, sympathetic to the RHCs' cause, said last
year that divestiture was "very esoteric" and not a subject that
was often discussed "at the dinner tables of middle America."
But the telephone companies hope that much will be changed this
session, said Sam Simon, a Washington-based telecommunications
consultant who heads Issue Dynamics Inc.  He said RHC lobbyists
"are already jockeying" to be in position when divestiture
legislation is revived.
     Simon said the holding companies--whose revenues were cut
when they were severed by the court from the parent company 6
years ago--"crucially" need the added incomes the restricted
services would provide.  But, Simon said, they may be content to
accept compromise legislation from Congress if a Court of Appeals
decision expected in the spring alters rulings Greene made
recently to uphold the 1984 restrictions.  "If for instance, the
court lifts restrictions against information services, the BOCs
might be satisfied with legislation that retains the other
restrictions," Simon said.
     But other observers aren't so sure. Catherine Sloan, who
monitors legislation for the Competitive Telecommunications
Association (CompTel), told us the RHCs would not likely be
satisfied with a compromise.  "They need the long-distance
service to provide the information services, and they need the
ability to research, develop and manufacture new technology to
support all their services," she said.

Legislation Could Result in New National Policy

     Mike Brand, a spokesman in Chicago for American Information
Technologies Corp. (Ameritech), one of the 7 RHCs, told us the
RHCs were "set up" to push for legislation that will eventually
result in a new national telecommunications policy.  He said the
holding companies rely on "substantial contacts" with Washington
legislators and "grassroots" campaigns in congressional districts
that urge telephone users to tell their Washington
representatives that they do not favor the restrictions.
     In past years, Ameritech has stuffed dividend envelopes with
bulletins urging its shareholders to write their congressmen
about the divestiture restrictions, involved educational and
public-policy organizations that rely on Ameritech research
grants and received unexpected help from well-known radio
commentator Paul Harvey, for its cause.
      Harvey, whose daily broadcasts reach a vast national
audience, told listeners "the Congress must be made to realize
that information is the lifeblood of contemporary commerce and
industry."  He said,  "The Baby Bells, although orphaned by Ma
Bell, have picked themselves up, dusted themselves off and
continue to serve the public and to profit and prosper."
      Brand said the endorsement--while appreciated--"was
completely Harvey's own doing" and that his dinner appearance
before Ameritech managers 6 days before the broadcast, for which
he received his normal $30,000 fee, did not influence the content
of Harvey's radio broadcast.

Lobbyists Should Seize on Association Opinions

     Simon, who presents seminars to Congress about issues facing
the telecommunications industry in behalf of Bell clients, said
the RHCs must gain support from national consumer organizations
such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) if
they are going to gain favorable legislation.
     But the AARP does not make up its official mind until later
this month, when the membership will be polled on the
telecommunications issue, said AARP senior policy analyst Larry
Fenster.  AARP--whose members are retired and live on fixed
incomes--is one of Washington's strongest consumer lobbies.  It
planned to reveal a "new in-depth telecommunications study on the
expanding information services and their impact on consumers and
policy choices at a press conference [Jan. 11].
     The Consumer Federation of America, which joined AARP in
that press conference, has been on record to oppose the relaxing
of restrictions, stating that the new services will mean higher
costs for basic voice services and the possibility of another
monopoly.
     But the major opposition comes from the American Newspaper
Publishers Association (ANPA), whose members have feared
competition from electronic classified and directory inquiry
services from phone companies for more than a decade.
     Not only have ANPA members appeared before Congress'
committees to speak against loosening the restrictions, but
editorials in members' newspapers consistently remind readers
(and members of Congress) that relaxing the restrictions might
well mean a move toward government control of the information-
generating process and a violation of the First Amendment.
     While the players align themselves for the legislative
kickoff, a smaller game--played at the U.S. Court of Appeals
where the RHCs are seeking legal relief from Greene's
restrictions--has produced strange teammates.
     The Justice Department--the same federal agency that carried
the burden of the government's year-long trial that shattered
AT&T's 100-year monopoly in 1983 and created the restrictions--
filed briefs recently stating the time may be ripe to relax those
restrictions.

In the End, MFJ Impacts Nation's Bottom Line, Justice Says

      Justice said in the brief that continuing Greene's
restrictions could be harmful to the telecommunications industry
that, Justice said, "measures in the billions dollars."  Justice
said that continuing the restrictions concerns the well-being of
the "country's entire national welfare and security."
     The brief justifies relaxing the restrictions because of
technological advances, developing global markets and the
corporate health of competitors that precludes one firm attaining
a monopoly position.
     Although not the major concern, the Justice Department cites
the administrative "burden" caused by more than 200 waivers the
RHCs have filed since 1984, creating heavy workloads for both the
Justice Department and the court system.
     Before the Court of Appeals can make a decision, 3 judges
must review thousands of pages of testimony and examine hundreds
of exhibits submitted during the lengthy court process.
Testimony taken in the 1987 triennial review alone--which is the
subject of the appeal--has created a document containing more
than 6,000 pages.
     Early last fall, hundreds of typewritten pages written by
dozens of attorneys representing many of the 80 different parties
interested in the appeal--along with exhibits--were submitted to
the court simply to request that each side present 2 hours of
oral argument to the court.  Those briefs took several months to
file and filled several folders in the clerk's office.  But those
arguments--granted after the court presumably reviewed the briefs
and examined the exhibits--were heard Dec. 6.
      They lasted exactly 4 hours.
     (Editor's note: The preceding article is second in a planned
series docu-menting proposed changes in the modified final
judgment and how such changes will impact the long-distance
industry.)

CONGRESS, BUREAUCRACY HAVE HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE WITH NEW PHONE
SYSTEMS

     While Congress and its bureaucracy may be wrangling over
national telecommunications policies later this year (see
preceding story), it is hoped that Hill and agency staffers will
be making clearer and more efficient long-distance and local
calls thanks to multi-billion-dollar technology now being
installed in Washington and 1,200 other government locales.
     When the final cutover from the old FTS long-distance system
is completed in May, nearly 1 million federal employees will be
using up-to-date fiber optics and the new FTS 2000 system.
     Two of the major suppliers, AT&T and US Sprint, were awarded
the 10-year contract by the General Services Administration (GSA)
in mid-1989 over the protest of MCI, a late-bidder that claimed
AT&T's prices did not reflect true costs.  MCI subsequently
threatened legal action.
      AT&T was given 60% of the contract and US Sprint the
remaining 40%.  Both vendors will have an opportunity to re-bid
the contract in its fourth and seventh year.
     The contract was awarded to supply basic voice service to
the agencies but allows the vendors to offer added voice services
(such as 800), video switched data services and digital
integrated services as needed that potentially raise the
contract's value to $25 BILLION over the 10-year life of the
contract, making it the largest federal civilian contract ever
awarded!
     Not only is the government's long-distance service being
improved, but 34 U.S. agencies and 130,000 federal employees
scattered throughout the Washington area have new desktop
telephones, switchboards, wiring and switches as a result of a
$282 million contract awarded last January to the Washington,
D.C.-based C&P Telephone Co.
     The goal of that new system--known as Washington Interagency
Telecommunications Service (WITS)--is to update government
offices with advanced technology and services available to the
private sector and the military. Complete installation will take
3 years.

Watchdog Agencies Keep Eye on Costs of New Systems

     While still in the hands of technicians and installers, the
systems nevertheless have the attention of the GAO [Congress'
investigative arm] that is overseeing the work to see that it is
done on time and according to the specifications of the contract,
and a Senate investigating committee that is concerned that the
contract's huge dollar value could generate waste and possible
irregularities.
     Ron Famous, a GAO evaluator, assures us that the first four
FTS switchovers--which started in October--have been on schedule
and on-site work problems, minimal, so far.  GAO also regularly
observes work progress being made by AT&T and US Sprint
technicians who--possibly for the first time--work side by side,
bringing the agencies on line.
     Jack Brock, a GAO spokesman, said a comprehensive breakdown
of the complicated FTS 2000 contract is being prepared for
members of Congress "so they will have an understanding of what
they bought."
     Investigators from Sen. John Glenn's (D-Ohio) Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee also are observing FTS' progress,
mostly  because of a 1988 investigation the committee conducted
that resulted in the resignation of a GSA executive who admitted
to contract irregularities with bidders for FTS service
contracts.

Investigation Tightened Contract Procedures

     That investigation--involving AT&T and BellSouth, both of
which were bidders on a dozen federal service contracts worth
about $55 million--tightened contract award procedures used by
GSA in awarding the new FTS and WITS contracts, THE LONG-DISTANCE
LETTER was told.
     Sureshar Lal Soni, the $60,000-a-year GSA executive,
allegedly "slipped" confidential AT&T bid information to
competitor BellSouth, where his daughter was employed while
contracts were being bid.  Soni later pled guilty to criminal
charges of accepting $400 in meals from BellSouth while BellSouth
and AT&T competed for contracts to service electronic tandem
network switches on the FTS system.
     Soni, who faced up to a year in prison and fines up to
$100,000, was fined $2,000 and placed on one year's probation
last April by a federal magistrate. Under terms of his plea
agreement, Soni resigned as director of GSA's Office of Network
Services, where he supervised the review of technical and cost
evaluations submitted by vendors seeking FTS contracts and is now
believed to be working for a private telecommunications company.
     Michael Corrigan, an investigator for the Governmental
Affairs Committee, said the committee's investigation turned up a
number of problems associated with telephone service contracts
and changes have been made in the agency's telephone contracting
procedures.
     He said that, so far, nothing appears irregular about the
new contracts, but the committee plans periodic reviews of the
projects.  "There's just too much money involved not to,"
Corrigan told us.

NATIONAL AUDIENCE FOR 900 SERVICE DOESN'T MATERIALIZE DURING
DECEMBER

     900's debut as a prime-time television attraction (TLDL,
November 1989, pp. 1-4) was less than successful last month with
only 21,000 viewers--out of an expected 175,000--paying $2 on
their telephone bill to participate in a national volunteer
recruiting drive backed by the White House, THE LONG-DISTANCE
LETTER has learned.
     Participants in the mid-December test that exposed 900
numbers to 290 million primetime viewers of 6 of America's most
popular television shows are meeting in California Jan. 20 to
determine--among other things--if the 900 telephone number is a
viable national marketing tool.
     The 900 numbers were flashed on the screen near the
conclusion of such popular programs as "Cheers," "Designing
Women" and "The Cosby Show," urging viewers to dial the number
and obtain the list.  The project's organizers criticized the
networks for not giving the number more exposure and not
providing storylines that gave the messages more impact.
     But while far short of the expected response, Jerry Michaud,
executive director for Prime Time to End Hunger, the project's
sponsor, said the project lost no money because the $2 telephone
charge covered by the caller's long-distance bill.  He said the
printing order was reduced when it became apparent to sponsors
that the response would not be high, we were told.
     Michaud said the project will be thoroughly critiqued at the
January meeting.  He expected network and telephone company
executives to attend.
     While the primary purpose was to determine if television
networks were effective ways to recruit volunteers, Michaud said
a "secondary" consideration was the effectiveness of the 900
number as a response media.

Long-Distance Carriers Disappointed in Response

     Long-distance carriers--including the Big 3 and Telesphere
Network Inc. of Oak Brook, Ill.--who participated, viewed the
project as a field test for a national 900 services and a way to
elevate the often-maligned 900 service to respectibility.
     "I think the telephone companies were disappointed that we
didn't have millions and millions of responses," said Glenn
Lebowitz, president of Optima Direct, a Washington-based
technical consulting firm that designed the 900 "hunger" network.
     Lebowitz, who said the network's technology lived up to
expectations, criticized the television networks for not exposing
the 900 number longer than 15 seconds and giving the message
"more impact" with viewers.  "I don't think 15 seconds gives
people enough time to absorb a telephone number," Lebowitiz said.
     Spokesmen for the long-distance suppliers had no comments
prepared about the project when they were queried just before
presstime.

NEW COMPANIES FIND INFO PHONES NOT MONEY MAKERS

     Neil Sleevi of Weston, Mo., and J. Russell Leatherman of Los
Angeles share something in common--they want to give telephone
calls away.  But the 2 entrepreneurs are in the embryonic stages
of developing telephone information services, and their give-away
schemes have--so far--been less than profitable.
     Sleevi told us he has not made "a single nickel" with Phone
Spots Inc., a plan he has to provide free, one-minute long-
distance or 3-minute local telephone calls to patrons at
airports, hotels or bus terminals.
     Leatherman and his partners have lost almost $1 million in
PromoFone Inc., a service for Los Angeles moviegoers seeking
accurate movie listings and starting times.  A New York City
PromoFone service also is available.
     Sleevi's free airport telephone call and Leatherman's movie
service also are similar in that they offer paid advertising
messages--pitched quickly and professionally between rings and
lasting less than 4 seconds--to pay the phone bills that make the
free call possible.
     Sleevi said in an interview with The LONG-DISTANCE LETTER
that he hopes to sell advertising on Phone Spots to businesses
located within a few feet of his free-call phone booth--an
airport florist, a newsstand or restaurant, for instance.

Pay Phones Being Offered as Marketing Ploy

     But Sleevi also is thinking big.  He is trying to interest
one of the country's Big 3 long-distance carriers to place a
Phone Spot payphone in an airport and offer free one-minute calls
home to patrons so they can assure families of a safe arrival or
deliver a similar message.
     Between rings and while the caller awaits his connection, a
message would remind the patron that the sponsor's long-distance
service is available for longer calls at other airport locations.
     Sleevi, who is discussing an airport market test this summer
with the phone giants, said surveys show 9 out of 10 people will
take advantage of a free telephone.  He said the advertising
message "in no way" delays the call and does not interrupt
conversation.
     Leatherman--a former rock musician--seeks rock stations or
show-business publications to welcome PromoFone users to his
movie service.  The short advertising message makes what
Leatherman calls "a needed public service" (movie information)
available to vast amounts of people.  So far, however, it only
pays the phone bills and some of the overhead.
     Leatherman said in an interview that for his service to be
profitable, it must attract "millions" of users.  He uses
billboards, small local circulation newspapers and television to
get PromoFone's telephone number (777-FILM) known, but was
dependent on the Los Angeles Times for its massive circulation.
He said he was caught off guard when the Times declared PromoFone
a "competitor" and refused his advertising.

GTE AHEAD OF THE GAME IN GETTING PHONE SERVICE ON BOARD FOR BOWL

     The upcoming NFL Super Bowl--scheduled for Sunday, Jan. 28
in New Orleans--is labeled a sporting event, but to GTE
technicians who have been wiring the mammoth Superdome for Super
Bowl XXIV since Jan. 4, it is a major telecommunications event.
     For the sixth consecutive year, GTE is providing all the
telecommunications service to the entire "Super Bowl community"
of participating teams, league personnel, the media, corporate
sponsors and fans.  A giant communications net that will cover 8
different official NFL locations in and near the stadium that
will be connected by 275 private telephone lines will also
include 6 consoles, 24 cellular telephones and a high-speed data
link to the NFL's New York headquarters.
     GTE also will provide telecommunications services to the
participating AFC and NFC team, 100 lines for the major
television and radio networks, approximately 430 telephone lines
for domestic reporters and another 30 lines for the foreign press
covering the game.
     Glen Miller, GTE Telecom's director of East Coast
operations, said planning for telecommunications services in the
giant Superdome began 15 months ago.  Preliminary budget work,
site surveys, ordering of dial-tone services, the hiring and
selecting of contract personnel, the setting up of offices,
transportation and hotel accommodations will be done long before
crews arrive on the game site.
     Last October, when the 1989 NFL season was in its infancy,
GTE had opened a 800 line that began taking service orders from
television and print reporters who plan to cover the upcoming
championship.  Miller said orders ranged from a simple private
telephone line to the complex, multiple-location telephone line
that includes multi-button sets and other special services.

Technicians on the Job a Month Early

     When technicians arrived in New Orleans Jan. 4, their first
duties were to test all the wiring, cables, telephone connectors,
common control equipment and other miscellaneous equipment in the
stadium.  Another function scheduled to be performed before
gametime is the training of on-site workers, management people
and others.  Miller said that while many GTE technicians have
worked the Super Bowl and other special events, their
responsibilities change each year or technology has changed to
require constant retraining and updating.
     GTE's Special Events Division provided telecommunications
services to such events as the 1988 Republican and Democratic
national conventions for the major networks, the Miss America
Beauty pageant, remote broadcasts for the "Today" show and
numerous sporting events.  The NFL's management service contract
with GTE is in effect through the 1993 Super Bowl.

NTIA INQUIRY SEEKS DATA FOR MAJOR TELECOM LEGISLATION

     What could turn out to be the nation's first total
telecommunications policy may be written from comments now being
sought by the Department of Commerce's National Telecommu-
nications and Information Adminsitration (NTIA); NTIA is the
principal telecommunications policy advisor to President Bush.
     NTIA published and released a 99-page notice of inquiry
(NOI) Jan. 9 in the Federal Register seeking comments from
industry sources and other parties on subjects ranging from rural
telephones to global competition.  Comments must be filed by
March 19; reply comments are due April 23.
     Janice Obuchowski, assistant secretary for the Commerce
Department and head of NTIA, said recommendations will be drafted
for Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher's approval and then
forwarded to the White House for consideration as the nation's
first total telecommunications policy.
     According to Obuchowski, NTIA's inquiry will:
      Examine the nation's telecommunications infrastructure;
      Consider the technological and market trends that determine
the industry's growth in this country and elsewhere;
      Evaluate ways in which telecommunications affects
international competition; and
      Assess government's role in promoting the development of a
telecommunications infrastructure.
     Industry observers are saying that telecommunications is as
important to the nation's production as transportation once was.
NTIA's study will determine the importance of telecommunicationas
to the country's economy and social welfare, Obuchowski said.
     Besides examining the importance of telecommunications as a
factor of production in the national economy, the inquiry raises
for discussion the links between telecommunications and economic
development in local, urban and rural areas.  It also will
examine the industry's role in such services as education, health
care and public safety.  The inquiry also seeks comment on
regulatory changes that might encourage improvements in the
industry, including modifications to the rate-of-return
regulation, depreciation practices, the AT&T consent decree,
cable TV/telephone company cross-ownership restrictions and open
network architecture.
     Further, the inquiry asks advice on ways of encouraging
competition to the local exchange companies while maintaining
current price levels for residential

THE CHANGING WORLD OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS

by William G. McGowan, chairman and CEO, MCI Communications Corp.
     Whether you want to talk about geo-political developments,
the economy, technology, science, social attitudes, business
management, careers, the arts or education--everything important
these days seems to be in a perpetual state of never-ending flux.
There can be little doubt that the times we inhabit are, indeed,
changing...and changing at breakneck speed.
     I would suggest to you that the communications technologies
we take for granted--radio, television, telephones, fax machines,
everything--really are revolutionary in nature.  They force
change in business and politics and throughout society.
     The old adage, "The more things change the more they stay
the same," just isn't true any more--if it ever was.  Nowadays,
it seems, the more things change, the more things change.
     Technology propels change.  And the world's ability to
innovate technologically is at an all-time high.  It's been
estimated, for instance, that 85% of all the scientists who ever
lived in human history are alive today.  Significantly,
imagination and technology have changed the way business views
the world.  What we're seeing today is a powerful trend toward
globalization of business and the erosion of geography, time
zones and national boundaries as stumbling blocks to economic
activity.
     Whether we like it or not, the future IS global.  Nothing
attests to this more than EC '92.  As you all know, this drive
toward a single market of 325 million people and a grossnational
product (GNP) of $4.5 trillion--about the same as the United
States--will "harmonize" major sectors of the European economy.
     The telecommunications sector in the EC is expected to more
than double in size over the next 10 years, growing from 3-7% of
the gross domestic product (GDP) among the 12 EC countries.  The
EC plan calls for public voice service and control of the
telecommunications infrastructure to remain in the hands of the
national monopolies, while value-added services are supposed to
be totally deregulated.

Admit It--There are no Domestic Markets Anymore

     One aspect of globalization that all businesses--especially,
I think, American businesses--need to learn very quickly is that
there are no entirely domestic markets anymore--anywhere.  For
any business that means, in effect, that you can run, but you
can't hide, from foreign competitors.
     Since I'm in the business, I'm proud to point out that
telecommunications service.
     Obuchowski said America does not have a "coherent"  national
telecommunications policy "because of the court situation," a
reference to U.S. District Judge Harold Greene's oversight of the
MFJ restrictions.
     Original comments and 7 copies should be sent to: Office of
Policy Analysis and Development, NTIA, U.S. Department of
Commerce, 14th St. and Constitution Ave., NW, Rm. 4725,
Washington, DC 20230. For further information, contact Alfred Lee
or Timothy Sloan, NTIA Office of Policy Analysis and Development,
202/377-1880.
     The notice of inquiry was announced at a press conference
Jan. 9. as a global economic force truly has come of age.
Foreign investments, international banking, cross-border mergers
and acquisitions--all have become commonplace and increasingly
vital elements of the global economy.  And telecommunications
provides the electronic infrastructure that allows it all to
happen.
     Economists recognize telecommunications as a strategic
industry because it meets the 3 basic criteria required to be so
designated.  First, a strategic industry must be important to a
country's national security.  Telecommunications clearly is.
Second, it must be R&D intensive.  Again, telecommunications
clearly is that.  And third, a strategic industry must have--I
love this phrase--positive externalities, meaning that a
strategic industry must produce spill-over economic benefits to
other industries.  It's clear that other industries derive
enormous benefits by using telecommunications.
     I believe the biggest future advantages of information
technology will come in the form of organizational health--
increased productivity, better decisionmaking, improved operating
efficiencies, enhanced responsiveness and reduced bureaucracy.
To compete against global competitors, companies everywhere need
to organize leaner, decide quicker, produce smarter and market
better.
     Recent events in China, in the Soviet Union, in Hungary, in
Czechoslovakia and, most dramatically perhaps, in Berlin, should
be seen as part of the political "whiplash" that occurs when
information is distributed widely and without official
censorship.

Today's Telecommunications Precludes the Rise of a New Stalin

     Glasnost may be a Russian word, but it is fundamentally a
concept born of the Information Age.  During his recent visit to
the United States, Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa admitted
as much.  He was asked how all of these reforms in Eastern Europe
came about.
     His reply was insightful.  He said, "That's a result of
civilization--of computers and satellite TV and other innovations
which present alternative solutions...Is it possible for a new
Stalin to appear today who could murder people?  It's
impossible."
     Information technologies are inherently democratic.  They
force decentralization and individualism.  They are designed for
expansion, for interconnection, for networking.  They have no
respect for barriers and roadblocks.
     Nothing as flimsy and porous as a concrete wall stands a
chance against information traveling at the speed of light across
a multitude of media--from radio and television to the
increasingly ubiquitous fax machine.
     Information technologies help people to absorb and put to
effective use vast amounts of information that would otherwise be
wasted.  Because of that, I couldn't think of a more interesting
time to be alive, or a more exciting industry to be a part of.

THE LONG-DISTANCE LETTER via NewsNet
January, 1990

TELECOM*USA, ALC SIGN LETTER OF INTENT TO MERGE OPERATIONS

     Telecom*USA Inc. and ALC Communications Corp, the fourth and
the seventh largest long-distance interexchange carriers
respectively, have signed a letter of intent to merge in April,
according to announcements made simultaneously this week by both
companies.  Telecom*USA, based in Atlanta, Ga., and ALC in
Birmingham, Mich., will merge into an unnamed subsidiary of
Telecom*USA, the announcements stated.
     Under terms of the letter, all outstanding capital stock of
ALC would be converted into units of Telecom*USA common stock and
cash.  Holders of ALC common stock and series B and C preferred
stock would receive units valued at $3 for each share.  Holders
of ALC series A preferred stock would receive units valued at $20
per share plus accrued unpaid dividends.
     O. Gene Gabbard, chairman and CEO of Telecom*USA, and John
Zrno, president and CEO for ALC, both expressed optimism about
the merger although Gabbard said he expected the move may have
"some dilutive effect" on Telecom*USA earnings this year.
     "However, we believe that the combination of Telecom*USA and
ALC will enhance our position in a rapidly-growing industry and
provide significant opportunities for network and cost
efficiencies," he said.  "Over the longer term, we expect these
efficiencies to add to earnings and create additional value for
shareholers, as has been the case with past mergers and
acquisitions."
     Zrno said that ALC's "strong presence" in the northeast and
upper midwest "complements Telecom*USA's existing strengths in
the southeast and midwest.
     "Through this combination, we anticipate offering a wide
range of Telecom*USA enhanced products and services to our
customers," he said.
     The proposed merger gives Telecom*USA access to ALC's 900
service, where it has staked a strong market.  Telecom*USA
already markets 700 and 800 services, a spokesman said.

Deal Contingent Upon Amending Previous Agreement

     The merger is contingent upon execution of a definite
agreement, and regulatory and shareholder approvals.  In
addition, the merger requires amending an existing 10-year
telecommunications agreement between ALC and Communications
Transmission Inc. (CTI), of Austin, Texas, which controls 55% of
ALC.  The amendment would permit the purchase of additional
transmission capacity from CTI at a fixed price in exchange for a
payment to CTI of $8.5 million.
     The proposed merger will bring 400,000 new subscribers to
Telecom*USA, more than doubling its subscriber base.  Spokesmen
would not confirm some trade press reports that claimed
Telecom*USA is expected to dissolve ALC and drop the name of its
long-distance company, Allnet, following the merger.

The United States remains deeply concerned about the
ongoing violence and killing in Burundi. Too many
people have lost their lives because extremist forces
have chosen to settle their differences through
violence rather than dialogue.

We continue to call on all Burundians to reject
extremism and to resolve their differences through
peaceful means. A constructive dialogue involving all
key political leaders is necessary to begin the
process of ending the violence in Burundi and
fostering national reconciliation.

The United States is watching events in Burundi
closely and will continue to work with the
international community to defuse tensions in Burundi
and prevent further violence. As we approach the new
year, the United States calls on the people of
Burundi to renounce violence and demand peace from
all parties.

The President is disappointed that the Congress has
chosen to override the veto of H.R. 1058, the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As he said
in his veto message, he supports the goals of
securities litigation reform and believes that there
should be an end to frivolous lawsuits, but is
concerned about how this legislation might affect
small investors with legitimate complaints. The
President hopes that the unintended consequences of
the legislation do not materialize, but if they do,
he will work for administrative and/or legislative
rememdies to protect small investors.

Beaty has remained active in community service

During his tenure as Clerk of the Court, Leonard was
a nationally recognized expert on issues involving
judicial administration, and he has written and

Remarks by the President at Congressional Meeting

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Remarks by the President at
Congressional Meeting
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295 12:52 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: I hope -- as you see, we're running a
little behind today, so I hope you'll forgive us if
we don't do a lot of questions; we have a lot of work
to do. But let me just say from my point of view, I
am pleased that our representatives met yesterday.
They did make some progress. Obviously, a lot of the
biggest issues remain. But the process seems to be
working and I'm encouraged, and I want to continue to
do it until we reach agreement on a balanced budget.
That's what I think clearly we all want. 

I would say here that two days before Christmas I
hope some way can be found to get the check for the
three and a half million veterans and the aid to the
8 million children who need it just to exist. And
there are almost half a million federal workers who
have been working who won't get their paychecks today
that they would otherwise get. So I think those
problems need to be addressed. 

But on the other issue, I at least believe that we
made some good progress yesterday and I'm looking
forward to the report today and continuing this
process until we succeed, until we get this job done.
 
Q Can we ask the leaders, Mr. President, if they will
get the checks out and --
 
Q Do you think the Congress should go home when
millions are denied subsistence checks over
Christmas?
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, let me just say, if I could
for a second, Mr. President, I think both the House
and Senate hope to get those bills down here today so
that the -- the AFTC and the -- as the President
mentioned the other day on television.
 
Q What are the chances of reopening the government,
Mr. Speaker?
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: I think we're going to talk about
that now.
 
Q Mr. Speaker, do you feel like a dog being wagged by
its tail? (Laughter.)
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: It's amazing you guys get paid for
some of these questions, on the eve of Christmas.
Merry Christmas. 

Q No, it's not my expression, it's the President's
analysis.
 
THE PRESIDENT: I never called the Speaker a dog.
(Laughter.)
 
Q No, I know you didn't.
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: And I'm deeply grateful.
(Laughter.) 

Q Mr. President, do you think you can get a framework
of a deal by Christmas?
 
THE PRESIDENT: I'm prepared to -- let me just say,
I'm prepared to just keep working. I think all of us
want to have Christmas with our families, but beyond
that, I'm prepared to keep working, and I'm going to
do everything I can to succeed, and that's what we're
going to talk about.
 
Q Mr. Speaker --
 
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. We really need to go to
work.
 
THE PRESS: Thank you.

of the Press Secretary -- Remarks by the President in
photo opportunity with congressional leaders
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295 9:50 A.M. EST

Q Mr. President, are you close to a deal today? 

THE PRESIDENT: Let me tell you where we are today. We
had a very long discussion yesterday. We discussed
almost all the issues where we had differences on our
plans financially, in terms of the dollars. And this
morning we're going to have an extensive discussion
of the Medicare policy. And then we're going to give
our staffs some instruction. We're going to meet
again on Tuesday and we're going to do our best to
work through this and come to an accord. 
 
My New Year's wish is that we'll get this balanced
budget plan and we'll do it in a way that protects
the things that we care about -- the Medicare, the
Medicaid, the education and environment, the other
issues, and we've been working at it. I've been very
well pleased and I think we've been somewhat
successful because we haven't said very much about
it. We've just got to keep working until we reach an
accord.
 
Q Mr. President, will you touch on -- negotiations -- 

Q Will you leave town today without reopening the
government, of the three --
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: I'm sure we'll be talking about
that, that's one of the things we want to get done
and get agreed to. So we're trying to work out how to
get the federal employees back to work -- we'd also
like to get them paid, I think that's an integral
part of getting them back to work. But as the
President said, I think, frankly, most of our success
so far has been that we've been in this room talking
with each other and not getting involved in
negotiating in public, and I think we've made a lot
of progress. 

Q To follow on that, sir, is it healthy to have the
House speakers talking on CNN yesterday on the --
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: Oh, that is nonsense. I told the
President on Friday that I was so favorable about him
in answering their big question on Evans & Novak that
I thought he'd want to see it. The fact is we're
working very well together. I was asked a question
about the campaign next year, and I suspect if you
ask Mr. Gephardt or Vice President Gore about how
they'll campaign next year, they'll give you similar
answers. We're negotiating very well from a
government standpoint in here and I think we have a
lot to be proud of. Our New Year's wish ought to be
that we get this done and give the American people a
balanced budget and the government paid for and back
to work.
 
SENATOR DOLE: The Senate is going to meet at noon,
we'll try to pass something to help the federal
employees. 

Q Are you closer?
 
SENATOR DOLE: Oh, we're about six feet apart.
(Laughter.)
 
SENATOR DASCHLE: We'll be a lot closer in a couple of
hours. (Laughter.)
 
THE PRESIDENT: We're working at it steady. Happy New
Year everybody.
 
THE PRESS: Happy New Year.

appropriate thing to do. I don't want to interrupt
the deployment in any way. You know, we've had a few
weather delays, but I'm here to get a briefing on the
deployment and what's going on and how we're doing.
I've got a few questions I want to ask. If it were
solely up to me, I would go tomorrow -- literally
tomorrow. But I think it's very important that I not
do anything which interrupts the deployment. I can go
as soon as it's consistent with the military mission,
and I will do that. 
 
Q What have you heard so far, even before this
briefing, on how the operation is going in Bosnia? 
 
THE PRESIDENT: I think our people are doing a very
good job. I think the others in IFOR are doing a good
job, and I think the people there, so far, are
receiving them well. But I've got some specific
questions, and that's why I want this briefing.
 
Q Do you think Senator Dole should go if you can't
go?
 
THE PRESIDENT: I think that all of us should consult
with the military leaders and do what is consistent
with the interest of our troops and the mission. 
 
Q That means no?
 
Q Mr. President, do you worry about casualties? 

THE PRESIDENT: Every day I worry about that, but I
think they're doing a very good job. They're showing
their training and their discipline and the integrity
of the plan in the way that they are working to
minimize casualties and maximize the effectiveness of
the mission.
 
Q Do you think the American people understand that,
understand the risks that are involved?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office of the Press Secretary --
Interview of the President by armed forces radio

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Interview of the President
by armed forces radio
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

THE PRESIDENT: First let me say that I have just come
from a briefing here at the Pentagon with our senior
military officials who are working on the mission in
Bosnia. We've also had a teleconference with General
Joulwan, getting the latest up-to-date briefing on
the conditions of the deployment. And I would say --
I should emphasize to you two things.
 
One is that notwithstanding some weather problems and
a few delays occasioned by Christmas traffic on the
rails in Germany, we're pretty much on schedule. And
secondly, and even more important, the attitude
toward compliance thus far in Bosnia by all parties
has been quite good. Now, it's early in the mission,
but so far the attitude toward compliance has been
very good and we're encouraged by that. And we think
we can stay on schedule for the separation of the
forces and the other elements of it.
 
And also, in this Christmas season, I'd like to
remind the people who serve our country that we are
doing this essentially for three reasons. First of
all, because we can do it, and when we can do
something like this it's consistent with our values
to stop suffering and slaughter on the scale we've
seen it in Bosnia. 

Second, because it's very much in our interest to
contain and end this war, to prevent it from
spreading in a way that can involve our NATO allies
on opposite sides and many other countries that are
critical to the stability of Europe. It's also
important for us to do what we can to promote a
stable and democratic and free Europe. We, after all,
have fought two world wars because we did not have
such a Europe; we had a long Cold War because we did
not have such a Europe. So it's in our interest.
 
And finally, it is critical to our ability to lead
the world for the next 10 or 20 years as we sort out
what the security arrangements of the post-Cold War
era will be. I can tell you that our leadership of
NATO specifically, and in general, our ability to
lead in the world toward peace and democracy is very
much tied to our willingness to assume a leadership
role in this Bosnia mission. 

I could see it on my recent trip to Europe -- whether
it was talking to prime ministers in Great Britain or
Ireland or Germany or Spain, or just to people on the
street. It means a lot to them to know that the
United States is still there working and leading and
being a good partner.
 
So, for all these reasons, I think this is a very,
very important mission to our country.
 
Q Thank you, sir. Mr. President -- after Operation
Joint Endeavor, what do you see as the U.S. role in
that area, formerly known as Yugoslavia? What will be
our role there? 

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think, first of all, we'll
still be there through NATO and whatever role that
NATO assumes in the general area beyond our NATO
member nations. But more importantly, I would expect
after this mission is over we will continue to have
American citizens, both people who work for and
represent our government, and people in the private
sector, going in and out of there helping in the
reconstruction effort, contributing to that,
supporting the political process in whatever way we
can.
 
But I think it is quite important that the NATO force
not become an occupying army. We're not dealing with
Berlin here. We're not -- all we're trying to do is
to give this peace agreement a chance to take hold.
And we have a very clear and limited mission. In
fact, I want to make sure that all of our folks know
that, as far as I know, this peace agreement is the
first one ever where the military annex to the
agreement was actually written by the military
commanders who were going to be expected to implement
it.
 
That is, the parties actually ask our military people
to fashion the military annex to the agreement that
was initialed in Dayton so that there would be a
limited, defined, strictly military mission.
 
Q Mr. President, do you agree with the premise that
Bosnia is really the first test of post-Cold War
policy?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think it's been tested in
other ways, but it's certainly the most significant
military test of our post-Cold War policy if you
accept the premise that what happened in the Gulf at
the Gulf War could have occurred during the Cold War
as well as afterward; that this is literally a
post-Cold War problem. Then it is the biggest
military test.
 
Q Does that mean that -- what is the success or
failure of this then mean to American foreign policy
10, 15 years down the line?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me just say I think the most
important thing here is that the United States was
prepared to lead and to work with our NATO allies. If
you remember, in the beginning when the Bosnian War
broke out, a lot of our European allies said, well,
we ought to take the leadership role here, we'll do
this; we'll do it through the United Nations. And
we've played a very strong supporting role through
NATO. After all, it's important that the United
States never forget that during these last four,
tough years we led in the conduct of the largest
humanitarian airlift in history; we led in enforcing
the no-fly zone, keeping the war out of the air, and
a lot of other things that were done, including
NATO's willingness to use air strikes to, first of
all, bring about a relatively peaceful 1994, and then
to bring about the conditions in which a peace
agreement could be made in 1995.
 
But what I believe this means, if we make this effort
and if we succeed in our military mission, even if,
God forbid, after we're all gone the thing should
come apart, at least we will be united in doing what
we can do to promote stability in Europe and to take
a stand for peace in the post-Cold War era.
 
If you remember when I sent our troops into Haiti
with a U.N.-led mission, and then when I left a
smaller number there when the United Nations took
over on schedule, I always said that we could not
guarantee the people of Haiti a future, they would
have to do that for themselves. The same is true for
the Bosnians. We cannot guarantee for them a future
without war. What we can guarantee for them is a year
without war, during which they can implement their
own agreement and in which time they can have
elections, they can begin the economic
reconstruction, they can begin to see the benefits of
peace, and then some equilibrium within the country
can be established from a security point of view.
 
But think it would be a mistake for the United States
or for NATO to believe that we should be going around
anywhere guaranteeing the results of peace agreements
which have to be guaranteed in the minds and hearts
of the people who are making them. 

So this will be a success for our alliance, for our
leadership, just by doing the mission. Obviously, it
will be a much, much greater success if the
humanitarian relief, the refugee relocation, the
economic reconstruction all are completely successful
and Bosnia has a permanent peace. That is the real
measure of success. But the main thing is we have to
define together where we must try and where we must
stand against chaos. And I think we've done a good
job of that here.

Q Mr. President, under what circumstances would you
order the U.S. forces to withdraw from Bosnia within
the next year, before the one-year mark?
 
THE PRESIDENT: The only circumstance that I can
imagine doing that is if the mission no longer
existed. That is, keep in mind, we are there not to
fight a war, we are there not to stop a war, we are
there to implement a peace agreement. We anticipate
that there will be violations of this agreement, but
that the leaders will not abandon it and that the
vast bulk of the people will not abandon it. So we
have to be prepared for some violations; we even have
to be prepared for some casualties, although I think
our people have trained and planned as hard against
problems for this mission as they ever have for any.
 
But that would not cause me to withdraw. If -- I
believe that NATO would determine, if all the
factions decided they wanted to go fight again, that
there was no longer a mission to perform.
 
Q Switching a little bit to the defense authorization
bill -- you have said you are going to veto it. The
bill includes a pay raise and a housing allowance
increase for military people. Since some of them are
headed off to Bosnia, are you concerned that not
getting the pay raise, not getting the housing
allowance increase would be detrimental to morale?
And is there some alternative? 

THE PRESIDENT: Very much. Yes, there is an
alternative. The Congress could send me a separate
bill with the pay raise and the allowances in it and
I would sign it in a heartbeat. I think, indeed I
hope that they will do one of two things -- I hope
they will either do that, or when I veto this bill,
assuming my veto would be sustained, which I believe
it would because there are some unconstitutional
restrictions on the President's authority as
Commander in Chief in this bill which compels me to
veto it -- so they can either send me the pay raise
and the allowance increase in a separate bill, or
they could delete the offending portions of the
defense authorization bill and send it right back to
me. They can do either one of those things. And I
would hope the Congress would promptly act to do
that.
 
I do not want any erosion of morale and spirit among
not only our people in uniform, but their family
members. I believe that we are completely united in
supporting the full pay raise and the allowance
increase. And I have done my best to budget for these
things over a period of several years.
 
I have visited a large number of our military
facilities, both in the United States and beyond our
borders. I have talked to a lot of people in uniform
about this. And I think it is a very important issue.
If we want to keep the very best people in our
military, we're going to have to see to the
quality-of-life issues. We've allocated a lot of
money for it over the next budget cycle, and I want
to release it, starting with these two issues.
 
Q Mr. President, on a slightly longer-term budget
issue, the Republican seven-year budget plan, while
it has more money for defense in the first couple of
years, actually targets less money towards defense
spending in the out-years 2000 and beyond. Secretary
Perry said earlier this week that that would force
him into the difficult decision of actually cutting
force structure to pay for modernization.
 
You've talked a lot about social spending in the
budget debate, but I haven't heard you talk much
about defending defense spending. Is that something
you're willing to give away to get a deal?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me say that I still hope
that I can work with Congress in a way that that
choice won't be necessary. It is true that they
front-loaded more defense spending than we did, which
made it very attractive to all the people who wanted
it in these years. But what we tried to do was to
have a balanced commitment. 
 
I think the worst thing that can happen to the
military is to be jerked around with these up and
down budgets and unpredictability. What we tried to
do is to get our folks together here and to say,
okay, what do we need over the next five years; what
do we need over the next seven years. The only thing
I can say to you, and I would say with some sense of
assurance is that our political system has shown a
willingness now to respond if there's a problem
created for our forces in uniform and for our
national defense.
 
I mean, I think -- one of the things you see that in
the last three years is we've had a remarkable
bipartisan ability to maintain a strong defense as a
part of our continuing engagement in the post-Cold
War world. And I think that everyone knows that the
military went through a significant downsizing with a
remarkable maintenance of excellence and morale, and
that now we have to sustain the system that we have
created. 
 
And so I would say to our forces, I'm going to get
the very best budget agreement I can. I hope we can
get an agreement. But if there is an alarming tailoff
in years six and seven I think it can be corrected in
the future. And I believe if we balance the budget,
get interest rates down, the economy will grow more
quickly. And one of the big differences between me
and the Republican Congress is that they have now
given me an economic plan which says if we do
everything they want, at the end of six or seven
years, interest rates and unemployment will be higher
than they are now. I find that very hard to believe.
I think that we're going to be better off, not worse
off if we do this, and we'll have more money,
therefore, to invest in defense.
 
So I would not worry too much about the out-years.
Whatever happens in this budget agreement, at least
as long as I am here -- and I can't conceive of
anyone else coming into this job, or anyone coming
into control of the Congress that would not try to
sustain a long-term plan for the military, because
that's what we've learned -- that if the military has
a plan they can do nearly anything, but we can't jack
around the plan. And we don't want to play games with
people's lives or with the national security. 

Q Mr. President, can I jump back to Bosnia for a
second and politics? How important do you consider
the success of the Bosnia operation to your own
political prospects? Is it a defining moment for you?
And secondly, from a tactical point of view, would
you mind if Senator Dole was the first senior
political presence in Bosnia on Christmas?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me answer the first
question. If you look at recent American history, the
evidence is that the success of the Bosnia operation
may not have much to do with the election in 1996,
but the failure of the Bosnia operation or the
sustaining of significant casualties could have a
great deal to do with it in a negative way. And
that's all. The conventional political wisdom is why
would the President do this; there's no up side and
tons of down side?
 
But I have to say, when you take a job, you have to
do what you -- you have to do the job. And to be
President at the edge of the 21st century, in a time
of dramatic, dramatic change in the way we work and
live and relate to each other, means that you can't
predict the future, and you just have to do what you
think is right. So for me, this was not -- once I
became convinced we could train for this mission,
that we could define the mission in the peace
agreement, that we could minimize the risks to our
troops, then the decision to me was not so difficult,
no matter what the political down side, because I
believe, in a time like this, you have to ask
yourself which decision would your rather defend 10
years from now when you're not in office if it goes
wrong? 
 
I would much rather explain to my child and my
grandchildren why the United States tried to stop
slaughter, prevent the spread of the war, maintain
NATO instead of destroy it, maintain the leadership
of the United States in the world for peace and
freedom. I would much rather explain why we tried to
do that than why, because of the short-term political
problems, we permitted the war to resume, it
expanded, NATO's alliance was destroyed, and the
influence of the United States was compromised for 10
years. 

I think it's obvious if you look at it that way --
what do you want to tell your grandchildren 10 years
from now -- that the United States is doing the right
thing. And the political risk is part of the price
you pay for being President. Anybody who doesn't want
to take any political risk at a time like this should
not run for the job.
 
Now, in terms of who goes to Bosnia when, I don't
think we should politicize it. Senator Dole and I
worked together to get the support that the Senate
gave to this mission. He expressed his reservations
about it, but he supported my decision as
Commander-in-Chief. I appreciated that. And
obviously, at the appropriate time, I have no
objection to either Senator Dole or anyone else, for
that matter, going to Bosnia.
 
The question is, when is the appropriate time. If I
had my way I would be spending Christmas Eve and
Christmas morning there. That's what I wanted to do.
But our commanders made it clear that when a
President comes into Bosnia, if I fly into that
airport at Tuzla, and then I go down to Sarajevo when
they're in the middle of this deployment, it would be
exceedingly disruptive. So even though I wanted to go
there to say to the American people I believe this
mission is on the right track, and most importantly,
to support the troops and to reassure their families,
I'm taking the advice of the military commanders. I
do not want to interrupt this mission. 

The mission's success is the most important thing.
And that's what I believe should guide everyone. I
think everyone -- there are different levels of
disruption that different trips would cause, and I
think we ought to try to just keep it nonpolitical. I
hope anybody that wants to go there that has a reason
to go, including Senator Dole, will be able to go at
the appropriate time. And that's the determination
that needs to be made.
 
Q Mr. President, you mentioned the safety of the
troops as being part of your decision a couple times
in that last answer. We're sending quite a large
force involved in the Bosnia mission. Some might say,
awfully large for a peaceful mission. How extensive
do you think the danger is to our troops there?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think there is -- let's look
at what the sources are. No one can -- the extent of
the danger depends on factors that we can't fully
predict. But I believe that we have minimized the
risks -- what are the possible problems. First of
all, if you look at what the United Nations went
through over the last four years, I think something
over 200 people lost their lives in Bosnia. But more
than half of them lost their lives in accidents. So
we have really worked hard to train against
accidents, to prepare -- to look at the roadways, to
look at the railways, to look at the airfields. We've
worked hard to minimize the loss of life or serious
injury due to accidents.
 
Then we know there are a lot of land mines there. I
got a very encouraging report today that the parties
themselves in many places are assisting us in
removing the mines. But there are a lot of places
where there are a lot of mines laid where the land
was first in one hands and then another, where we
don't have records of the mines, where people don't
have memories of them. So we have trained very hard
to deal with land mines. I think that's the next
biggest danger after accidents.
 
Then the third problem is people who fought in that
war who are either from the country or who came in
from without the country who may have either a
specific grudge against the United States or, more
likely, will just be frustrated because they don't
agree with the peace agreement that the leaders made,
and therefore, some -- and then, fourthly, there is
just the possibility of encounters that go wrong. The
only casualty we sustained in Haiti had nothing to do
with opposition to our being there. It was a man who
was literally a common criminal who ran through a
barrier, and there was an incident and he shot one of
our soldiers dead. 

So I would say that those are the dangers in order. 

Q Mr. President, I think that's all the time we have. 

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you and merry Christmas. I
appreciate what you do.

Press briefing by Mike McCurry

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Press briefing by Mike
McCurry
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295 6:10 P.M. EST

MR. MCCURRY: Hi. I wanted to appear briefly with my
colleagues here and give you a very short update
based on the guidance that we just got from the
budget principals, who obviously continue their hard
work in the Cabinet Room, sleeves rolled up, sheets
of paper flying back and forth, and coffee being
produced in copious quantities. I'm doing my color
since I don't have much substance to report.
 
Q How many --

Q Was it being consumed in copious quantities? 

MR. MCCURRY: The President, the Majority Leader, the
Speaker, the minority leaders and the others
participating agreed that they would work about
another hour tonight. They are working through a
series of difficult budget issues, but they clearly
are very serious about addressing those issues that
are on the table. They expect to work about another
hour tonight, take a break. 

The budget advisors group, which consists of Mr.
Panetta, Chairman Domenici, Chairman Kasich, and the
two ranking members -- Mr. Sabo and Mr. Exon -- will
reconvene on the Hill at approximately 8:00 p.m. or
roughly a half hour after they conclude here. They
will continue to do the type of work that they did
today, working through some of the issues that
they're attempting to analyze for the benefit of the
principals. And then, according to the President and
the others, they expect to reconvene tomorrow as
early as possible based on the advice they get from
the budget advisors who will meet later this evening.
We don't have a time or --
 
Q The principals?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The principals will meet again tomorrow.
We don't have a time set, although the preference is
to begin as early in the morning as they can based on
however late the advisors group works tonight. 
 
That's about all I am afraid I can report at this
point. By agreement, we're not going to attempt to
summarize any of the substance. As one participant
said, we obviously wouldn't be continuing to meet if
we thought it was going poorly. But other than that,
I don't want to characterize any --
 
Q -- no chance that the House or Senate would take up
the proposals that they mentioned in --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I really don't want to speak to that. I
think it would be more appropriate for you to direct
that to either the Speaker's or the Majority Leader's
-- but if you want -- 

Q Are there any plans for the --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I think you know the President's view.
The President's view is that it would be good to get
the federal government up and running, federal
workers back at their desk. 

Q But what about back pay?
 
Q But wait a minute, wait a minute. Can we get them
to answer the question of whether the House or Senate
will take up the issue tonight of --
 
MR. BLANKLEY: It has to be taken up in the Senate
first -- 
 
Q Could you go to the mike?
 
MR. BLANKLEY: Sure. I like that. (Laughter.)
 
MR. MCCURRY: Don't get used to it. (Laughter.) 

MR. BLANKLEY: It would have to be taken up in the
Senate first, and it's not clear whether the Senate
Democrats would be supportive. So we have to be
checking on that before we can move it --
 
Q Why wouldn't they?
 
Q They voted for it last time.
 
Q Why wouldn't they?
 
Q Is this because of the expedited --
 
MR. BLANKLEY: Well, it's not clear. That may be an
issue. So we're still checking.
 
Q What about the House?
 
MR. BLANKLEY: It will have to start in the Senate, so
we can't get out of the Senate.
 
Q But as of now, it is still the plan of the
leadership to try to push it through both chambers --
 
Q Tonight?
 
MR. BLANKLEY: We're trying to, but as I said, it
would have to start with the Senate. You need
unanimous support on both sides of the aisle there.
 
Q The Senate is still --
 
Q What is it that you would try --
 
Q I don't get this --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Would you guys calm down? One of you at
a time will ask a question.
 
Q What are you trying to put through tonight in the
Senate?
 
MR. BLANKLEY: What the Speaker mentioned earlier at
the photo op, which is to have basically the
provision that passed in the Senate last week, which
is attached to the Middle East act, that would bring
-- designate all government employees essential and
would not pay them, but would guarantee their pay
once there is a government up and running again, and
would also have an expedited procedure rule for the
Senate so that we could get whatever agreement we get
out of here moved to the Senate with alacrity. And
there's some speculation that the Senate Democrats
may not want to consent to unanimity on that point.
 
Q Do you know what the state of play in the Senate
is?
 
MR. HINE: The Senate is still in session, prepared to
deal with it, and Senator Dole may have more to say
on the floor once we're done here.
 
Q Logistically, Mike, what would you anticipate that
will happen at the end of the principals meeting?
Would you come out and say something or will they
return to the Hill, have -- 

Q Yes, what happens in an hour?
 
MR. MCCURRY: We did not cover that point. We will
either provide another brief readout which will not
be much different from this readout, or
alternatively, have some type of joint statement as
we did at the conclusion of the meeting last Friday. 

Q You wouldn't expect an appearance by the principals
here?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I don't expect an appearance by them
here, and I'm not aware of any plans by the
Republican leaders or the Democratic leaders to
attempt to do any type of readout tonight on meetings
or make any type of comment. There obviously -- this
is a work in progress, and the work will continue
tomorrow.
 
MR. HALLEY: On the continuing resolution -- I work
for Senator Daschle -- when this bill comes up, the
Democrats will object because of the fast track
procedures that are being attached to it that would
affect consideration of any budget bill. But at the
same time, we will offer a clean continuing
resolution to fully open the government, as we've
been trying to do for days. So the one that is being
considered by the Republicans, we will object to that
because of the expedited procedures that have been
attached to it. But we will offer a clean continuing
--
 
Q Does that mean you won't give unanimous consent
tonight to that?
 
MR. HALLEY: That's correct.
 
Q What's wrong with the expedited procedure? 

MR. HALLEY: It violates basically most of the
procedures of the Senate in terms of amendments and
debate, et cetera.
 
Q But hold on for a second. Didn't you vote for
something just like this before Christmas --
 
MR. HALLEY: No, that was the Middle East part of it.
There's three parts to this thing that's being put --
 
Q No, we're talking about just calling all the
workers essential. Do you have an objection to that?
 
Q That passed last Friday evening.
 
MR. HALLEY: No. There are three pieces to the thing
that are being put together by the Republicans. One
is deeming workers to be essential, which we agree
with that. Two is the Middle East initiative, which
we agree with that. What we will be objecting to is
the legislating of expedited procedures to -- that
would harm our ability to both amend and debate the
budget bill. And so we will object to that vehicle,
but then we will offer a clean continuing resolution
to open the government.
 
Q Well, when you mean a clean continuing resolution
do you mean to --
 
Q -- what the prospects for that?
 
Q Michael, what's the White House position on this
legislation with the three parts? Do you support the
Senate Democrats or the House --

MR. MCCURRY: The President indicated that, earlier
today, he wants federal workers back at their desks
and working. He wants the services of the government
available to the American people. And we understand
that there will have to be discussions on Capitol
Hill to make that happen quickly. We hope that that
will happen as quickly as possible.
 
Q In other words, he sides with the Republicans, not
the Democrats on this?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No. In other words, I very artfully
ducked the question. (Laughter.) 
 
MR. BLANKLEY: Let me just point out that the
provision that apparently the Senate Democrats are
going to block is the same expedited procedure that
you have on a reconciliation bill. And, obviously,
their concern would be that they wouldn't -- it would
get an agreement here that certain Democratic
senators might not be able to destroy the agreement
by a filibuster on the floor after the members here
have worked it out. So there's -- that's a procedural
question.
 
Q Tony, the Speaker is still against a clean CR, is
that not correct?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Listen, I want John to do -- and this is
-- our purpose here is -- my colleagues are here to
give you an update on the meeting that's going on
here. I think if they want to talk about the
procedural issues, which are important, and the
rights of individual senators to raise points, which
the White House acknowledges is a very important part
of the procedure on Capitol Hill, they should really
brief you up on Capitol Hill about those procedures.
 
Q But he has the right of rebuttal.
 
MR. HALLEY: Yes, thank you. But to restate, the
Democrats, as we've tried to do for weeks, are fully
supportive of opening the government and fully
supportive of that -- the piece of this, which is to
deem workers as essential. And so that's not the
issue.
 
The reason we'd be objecting to this procedural
notion is, again, because it would deny the ability
to amend and debate fully. And as we did in 1990,
there is a way to reestablish a reconciliation bill.
As you may recall, in 1990 after the agreement was
reached, we did another budget resolution that would
then trigger a reconciliation bill under the full
procedures of reconciliation. And so that option is
open to us. And we felt that, therefore, we did not
need to run around completely the entire budget
process with something that we'd do this evening.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Okay, anything more on the meeting going
on now before we exit?
 
Q Yes, Mike. Does the President intend or feel he
will need to before Senator Daschle and Senator Exon
leave the White House tonight, make the point to them
that apparently if everything is so close to
reopening the government, they should set aside --
does he intend to have a separate thing with them,
saying set aside your objection to this; I really
want you to do it?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, he has such good working relations
with them that I don't think he feels that there's a
need to cover that point.
 
Q There were briefings on the Hill earlier about the
areas that were covered at the budget advisory
report, or whatever it's called. Can you say whether
the leaders here essentially worked within that
framework? Did they go in it or out of it or -- 

MR. MCCURRY: Based on what I know -- I don't have a
complete readout of their entire discussions tonight.
They did review some of those issues that the
advisers dealt with today. They also moved into what
are referred to in their argot now as the tier three
issues, which are more difficult issues that are --
where the differences are more fundamental between
the sides.
 
Q Which one? Medicaid --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I'm just not -- we're not authorized to
get into the substance of their dialogue.
 
Q Mike, can you explain what the benefit would be of
this piece of legislation that's having its
difficulties this evening? It sounds as though what
you're talking about doing is essentially bringing
260,000 people back who then will join a bunch of
other people who aren't getting paychecks. They'll
all be getting their paychecks, there still will be
money for their designated agencies to --
 
MR. MCCURRY: We would prefer, obviously, any type of
continuing resolution that would reopen the
government. That's been the President's view all
along. We believe the government should be open. We
have believed for a long time there should be a clean
CR that would do so. But we're dealing, and we have
to be realistic about the environment we're dealing
with. And these gentlemen can speak better than I can
on the attitudes on the Hill. 
 
On the other hand, the effective legislation that
would except federal employees who are currently
furloughed from the furlough would be to incur a
legal obligation to pay them. That legal obligation
would be very useful to federal workers that need any
type of short-term loan to make mortgage payments or
who can produce that as evidence to a creditor that
they got the ability to pay bills that are due. I
think that would be at least some comfort to federal
workers. It would be far better for them to get a
paycheck, far better for them to go back to work, far
better for them to provide services to the American
people. That at least it's something, and something
is better than nothing.
 
Q So you don't mind if they try to amend -- they
block the ability to amend the --
 
MR. MCCURRY: As I just heard, that -- I could tell
from their discussion, that's way over my head. I
think there is some work, clearly, that Congress will
have to do on this. The President's view he stated
very clearly earlier; he would like to see those
federal workers back to work as quickly as possible. 

Q Any guidance beyond talks tomorrow?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, I don't have anything for the days
beyond that or what time they might finish tomorrow,
or would they finish in time for various people to
make travel plans. I don't have any guidance on that.
 
Q How are you going to let us know, Mike, if they're
going to meet and what time in the morning? All-call
or -- 

MR. MCCURRY: We will do an all-call tomorrow and also
put in on the recording as soon as we know what the
time is. But I would check in here. I think the
President still plans to do the radio address live
tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m., so you will -- at
least at that point --
 
Q Live from the talks?
 
Q You wouldn't expect it before the radio address,
would you, Mike?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I'm sorry, let me amend that. Just in
case they want to start earlier, if they end up
deciding they want to start earlier, there's some
chance that we might have to pretape the radio
address earlier in the morning. So check here
tomorrow morning.
 
Q What is it going to be on?
 
Q If Senator Dole give the rebuttal, will he do that
live --
 
Q Pass the mike around the table.
 
Q Is he going to do that from here?
 
MR. HINE: I think we're operating under the same
conditions that Mike on that. It's entirely possible
--
 
Q Mike, just to clarify -- you're not suggesting that
this measure that's being conducted this evening
would restore the government to full functioning.
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, it would -- our understanding is it
would allow federal workers to return to their work,
it would allow them to do certain accepted activity
that would be authorized by their individual
agencies. That would be some progress. It would allow
in some cases, my understanding is, for applications
to be processed. For example, one example is it's
conceivable to me under this legislation, unless my
colleagues disagree, that they might be able to begin
issuing passports again for people who wish to
travel, just as one example. 
 
Now, that's an activity that doesn't incur any
additional obligation to spend money on the part of
the government, but it allows some measure of
government services to be restored to the American
people. And that would be better than nothing, as I
said earlier.
 
Q Can you open the national parks under this? 

MR. MCCURRY: I don't know the answer to that. I don't
know the answer.
 
Q Sometime this evening could you get us a reaction
to -- the President's reaction to the Senate
Democrats stopping that process that you just
outlined?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I think I commented on that already.
They didn't say they were stopping it --
 
MR. HALLEY: We're not. We're -- 
 
MR. MCCURRY: They've got a plan to reopen the
government by a clean continuing resolution, which is
something, as you know, the President is strongly
supportive of.
 
Q What's the chance of getting a clean CR? 

Q Do you have any idea what the mood is in the room? 

MR. MCCURRY: Unless my colleagues would dispute this
characterization, they clearly are very serious in
purpose. As I said, many of them have their coats
off, they've got their sleeves rolled up, they've got
pens out and --
 
Q Why didn't they do that before?
 
MR. MCCURRY: -- they're working very seriously on the
relevant issues.
 
Q Is the Senate essentially in town?
 
MR. HINE: Yes, we're in session. We're in recess
subject to the call of the chair. 
 
Q So if there had to be a roll call -- you don't
expect a roll-call vote tomorrow, for example? If the
majority found it necessary to have a roll-call vote
to tamp down the Democrats thinking --
 
MR. HINE: I'm not certain that that's how events are
going to unfold.
 
Q Mike, why couldn't all of this have been done
Tuesday or Wednesday?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Tuesday or Wednesday -- you mean earlier
in this week? The process that was defined by the
principals last Friday, a week ago today, called for
the staff-level discussions and analysis to begin on
Tuesday and Wednesday, which occurred. It clearly was
very useful for that to happen because it's been the
premise for a lot of the work that occurred today,
and that the principals are doing now.
 
There was an alternative procedure that had been
discussed a while back. That was not available to the
President or the principals for reasons everyone in
this room knows. This is the process that was
available. This is the process that at the moment
appears to be working. 
 
Q A question for John, just to clear up the Senate
action. Does the Senate action -- say, it happened
tonight or tomorrow -- does that have to be by
unanimous consent, or can there be a vote on it,
which presumably could override the Democrats'
objection? And then could the Democrats, say,
filibuster to prevent a vote?
 
MR. HALLEY: No -- I mean, our intent is to -- I mean,
you would need consent at this time of day. Again,
our intent -- we've tried I'd say 10 times in the
last two weeks to pass a continuing resolution that
would open the government, and that's our position.
 
Q A continuing resolution, not just this deeming
measure? 
 
MR. HALLEY: Right.
 
Q You're talking about a real, live CR?
 
MR. HALLEY: Right, a complete opening. A real, live
put-people-back-to-work and pay them, and open the
agencies. 

MR. MCCURRY: This meeting will be over before the
briefing ends if we don't move on.
 
Q John, can you spell your last name?
 
MR. HALLEY: H-a-l-l-e-y.
 
Q Any idea when you might be able to give us some
guidance about Hilton Head?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It won't be tonight, and it will be late
in the day tomorrow. I just don't have any way to
give you any guidance.
 
Q Can you say how early could these talks -- 7:00
a.m.-8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I believe that will depend entirely on
how late Mr. Panetta, the chairman and the
congressional group works this evening. I think their
intent is to work rather late and that might make the
start not at the crack of dawn, but somewhat around
mid-morning tomorrow.
 
Q At 8:00 a.m., 9:00 a.m.?
 
MR. MCCURRY: And then I would suspect that the
President and the other principals would commence
shortly after that. So I don't -- my guess is around
mid-morning, but we'll wait and see and give you
guidance as we've got it.
 
Q Tomorrow the principals meeting would be back here,
not at the Capitol?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It sounded to me like the intent is to
meet here.
 
THE PRESS: Thank you.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Letter from Pres. to Speaker of
House of Reps & Pres. pro tempore of Senate

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Text of a letter from the
President to the Speaker of the House of
Representatives and the President pro tempore of the
Senate
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

December 21, 1995

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Mr. President:)

I last reported to the Congress on December 6, 1995,
concerning U.S. support for the United Nations and
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) efforts to
bring peace to the former Yugoslavia. In that report
I noted the success of our diplomatic efforts at
Dayton, Ohio, to assist the parties to reach a
negotiated settlement to the conflict in the former
Yugoslavia and reported the deployment of a NATO
"enabling force" and U.S. support forces in order to
lay the groundwork for the deployment of the main
body of the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR). I
am now able to report that on December 14, 1995, the
peace agreement that was initialed in Dayton was
formally signed in Paris.
 
Following the formal signing of the peace agreement
by all the parties, and consistent with our
consultations with the Congress, United Nations
Security Council Resolution 1031, and the North
Atlantic Council (NAC) decision of December 16, 1995,
I have ordered the deployment of approximately 20,000
U.S. military personnel to participate in the IFOR in
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, principally
in a sector surrounding Tuzla. Approximately 5,000
U.S. military personnel will also deploy as part of
the IFOR in other states of the former Yugoslavia,
principally Croatia. The IFOR, including U.S. forces
assigned to it, will be under NATO operational
control and will operate under NATO rules of
engagement. In addition, a total of approximately
7,000 U.S. support forces, under U.S. command and
control and rules of engagement, will deploy in
Hungary, Croatia, Italy, and other states in the
region in support of IFOR. These force levels are
those stated by U.S. commanders to be appropriate for
the missions assigned to them. 

The IFOR's mission, as outlined in more detail in the
summary of the operation plan (OPLAN), which I sent
to the Congress on December 11, 1995, is to monitor
and help ensure compliance by all parties with the
military aspects of the peace agreement. In
particular, IFOR will ensure withdrawal of the forces
of the parties to the agreed inter-entity borders
within an agreed period and enforce establishment of
agreed zones of separation between forces of the
parties. IFOR will also create secure conditions for
the safe, orderly, and speedy withdrawal from the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina of those elements
of the U.N. Protection Force not assigned to NATO.
Finally, within the strict limits of its key military
tasks, IFOR will endeavor to create secure conditions
for the conduct by other agencies and organizations
of tasks associated with the peace agreement. NATO
and U.S. military commanders believe, and I expect,
that the military mission can be accomplished in
about a year. 

Many of the U.S. forces that will deploy to the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be drawn from
the U.S. Army's lst Armored Division stationed in
Germany, including two mechanized brigades and an
aviation brigade. Other participating U.S. forces
include special operations forces, airfield
operations support forces, naval and air forces
previously assigned to support NATO's Operations
Sharp Guard and Deny Flight, and an amphibious force
in reserve in the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, a
carrier battle group will provide support for IFOR's
air operations.
 
All of our NATO allies are contributing forces as
well (except for Iceland, which has no military).
Non-NATO nations whose offers to provide forces to
IFOR are under consideration include Austria, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia,
Lithuania, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia,
Slovakia, Sweden, and Ukraine. These forces also will
be under NATO operational control and rules of
engagement. In total, approximately 60,000 military
personnel are expected to be deployed by IFOR to the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As in the U.S.
case, the non-U.S. contingents in Bosnia will in most
cases be supported by forces of their respective
countries at home and in nearby countries and waters.
 
I authorized these deployments and U.S. participation
in IFOR in conjunction with our NATO allies and other
troop contributing nations following the relevant
U.N. Security Council resolutions and NAC decisions
and as part of our commitment to secure the peace and
halt the tragic loss of life in the former
Yugoslavia. I have directed the participation of U.S.
forces pursuant to my constitutional authority to
conduct the foreign relations of the United States
and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. 

I am providing this report as part of my effort to
keep the Congress fully informed about developments
in the former Yugoslavia, consistent with the War
Powers Resolution. I remain committed to consulting
closely with the Congress and I will continue to keep
the Congress fully informed regarding these important
deployments of our forces.
 
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office of the Press Secretary --
Press briefing by Mike McCurry

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Press briefing by Mike
McCurry
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295 7:25 P.M. EST
 
MR. MCCURRY: Second verse, same as the first. Bye.
(Laughter.)
 
Q Do you know now how the President feels about the
Democratic move in the Senate?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The President believes that we'll able
to work -- given the cooperation shown today, we can
work something out that will allow federal workers to
resume their diligent service to the American people.
 
Q Tonight?
 
Q What's that mean?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It will be up to senators and leaders on
the Hill to resolve those issues, but we hope they
will.
 
Q Well, does he agree that the Democrats have a
point?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He understands the concerns the senators
have to make sure they've got the right protected to
debate very important budget matters and the very few
hours of hearings and debate devoted to aspects of
the Republican budget. And he well understands why
people are protecting the right to have further
debate. At the same time, he will encourage all
members of Congress from both parties to act quickly
to allow federal workers to return to their posts.
 
Q Mike, when you say work something out, does the
President -- is the President given to understand
that there will be something done today or tomorrow
to work something out to return furloughed federal
employees back to the job -- to their jobs? 

MR. MCCURRY: The sense the President got is that
congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle are
working urgently to solve the matter.
 
Q -- conciliatory to me.
 
MR. MCCURRY: -- let me tell you what I know about
tonight. They're taking a break. Mr. Panetta and his
group from the White House will return to Capitol
Hill, begin meeting with the so-called budget
advisers group, approximately 8:00 p.m. It's my
understanding they do not plan any further readouts
this evening. They are continuing to work through
issues that they then prepare for discussion by the
budget advisers. I anticipate that staffs are going
to be working throughout the evening and into the
morning to prepare discussion documents that will be
used by the principals tomorrow. They've agreed to
reconvene here at the White House at 10:30 a.m.
tomorrow. That's the principals group.
 
Q How does that affect the radio address? Still be
done live?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The radio address is going to be done
taped just to protect -- make sure we don't have any
-- because the President may be involved in
pre-briefs prior to the meeting. 

Q What's the subject?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It will be about the budget.
 
Q When will that be available, Mike?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He's taping it tomorrow morning, and we
expect it will be available just shortly before air
time.
 
Q Mike, the Republicans all left tonight without
comment. Did the meeting end in an atmosphere of --
 
MR. MCCURRY: It ended very amicably. And the
President, the Speaker, the Majority Leader and the
Democratic leaders agreed that the readout that you
heard earlier this evening would suffice for the work
that they did between roughly 6:00 p.m. and 7:20 p.m.
 
Q -- resolution tomorrow, Mike? What does it look
like?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Say again.
 
Q For the prospects of a resolution tomorrow. 

MR. MCCURRY: A resolution -- you mean a resolution of
issues or --
 
Q Yes.
 
MR. MCCURRY: They will make progress tomorrow, but I
don't -- the work they're doing, it would be very
hard at this point to predict that they would arrive
at any final agreements tomorrow. They've got a lot
of work to do tomorrow.
 
Q Do you this going, then, into Sunday?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Conceivably, yes. But that's not been
decided yet.
 
Q Do you have a reaction from the President to the
Daschle blocking this plan that --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Yes, we talked about that earlier. 

Q Is there a meeting with Panetta and the budget
advisers tomorrow morning before the principals
meeting? There was some talk about a 9:00 a.m.
meeting on the Hill before the principals came down
here. Was there any talk about that?
 
MR. MCCURRY: They may -- the budget advisers group
may reconvene tomorrow morning, but they -- that
would be prior to the 10:30 a.m. meeting --
 
Q Why did the President cut off a reporter from
asking Gingrich whether he had caved?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The President -- (inaudible) -- felt
that there had been any indication by the Speaker
that he had, quote, unquote, caved -- (inaudible) --
the President also thought he might give a better
answer than the Speaker might. (Laughter.)
 
Q What?
 
Q He wants peace to reign.
 
Q -- single issue was set aside as agreed upon or
anything narrowed substantially --
 
MR. MCCURRY: The procedure they've been using for
these discussions is that any element discussed and
any element that they reach consensus upon would not
change the admonition that nothing is finally agreed
until everything is agreed.
 
Q Your sense, Mike, about any travel plans the
President may have that could be tomorrow or more
likely Sunday now? 

MR. MCCURRY: I have no sense, but the President
seemed to be enjoying himself here as much as he
would in South Carolina. (Laughter.)
 
Q You have no sense of that?
 
Q -- answer to that question that nothing is agreed
until everything is agreed -- what you're saying is,
whatever differences they narrow today have no
permanent status because everything has to be agreed
to or--
 
MR. MCCURRY: As a common negotiating device, they
usually -- even as they work through complicated
issues, that they reserve the right at the end of the
discussion to go back and look at the entire package.
And they have done so here, and I suspect they will
continue to do so -- that they will go back and look
at the final package that they get, if they in fact
get one, before they agree that they've got a final
agreement.
 
Q But you -- as you agree, you guys are just checking
it off and moving on to the next one, and then --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Yes, but what they're doing -- they're
doing -- I mean, without getting into the substance,
because I'm not authorized to get into the substance,
they are working through a set of issues that have
been identified. The budget advisers today met, dealt
with a series of budget issues, not all of them, but
many of them. They were analyzed in some detail,
discussions papers were prepared. They were reviewed
today. The budget advisers will now go back up to the
Hill, continue to address elements of the budget
discussion. They will be analyzed, discussion drafts
will be prepared, and they'll work again on it
tomorrow. They're taking these issues serially as
they work through a series of contentious issues that
range from the -- starting with the less
controversial and moving to the more controversial.
And they clearly now are moving into areas that are
more controversial.
 
Q On the Hill tonight do you think there will be
action to get the workers back to work?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I cannot predict that. You've heard the
discussion of the representatives and the
congressional leadership earlier, and it will be up
to them to --
 
Q Mike, are there going to be simultaneous meetings
with the budget leaders up on the Hill, meeting at
the same time that the meetings down here are taking
place, or do they complete -- 

Q I think Tony Blankley said --
 
Q He did indicate -- Tony indicated that they'd be up
on the Hill, you know, working on churning stuff out
even for future issues -- even as --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Oh, yes, they have -- well, we have --
there have been staff -- staff work has continued
even while the principals are meeting, yes. In fact,
there's some -- staff has been available in the
Roosevelt Room in case there is a need for expert
advice on budget related issues, and they continue.
 
Q With Cabinet-level people? Will they be meeting
also at the same --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I wouldn't rule it out, but mostly the
people who are there are more staff level experts.
 
Q -- radio address subject?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It will be the budget situation
generally. It will also be, because it's the last
radio address of the year, it will be a review of
1995.
 
Q Mike, unrelated, is the policy out here changed at
all, or was that just a mis --
 
MR. MCCURRY: That was a regrettable misunderstanding,
and I believe we have got meetings going on right now
to straighten out --
 
Q That's not the first time it's happened today. It's
happened several times. 
 
MR. MCCURRY: I understand, and there's --
 
Q Some people decided not to provoke a fight and -- 

MR. MCCURRY: Right. They're working to clarify what
the ground rules are on -- (inaudible) -- because
they obviously -- 

Q Is the President going out tonight?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Say again.
 
Q Is the President going out tonight?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Not that I'm aware of. Is he? He is?
Pool alert -- that he may go out for dinner
apparently. 
 
Q Where?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Okay, see you all tomorrow.
 
THE PRESS: Thank you.

Net Farm Income May Rise in 1996, While Net Cash
Income Declines 
Net farm income is forecast at $37-$47 billion for
1996, compared with the $39 billion forecast for
1995. Both forecasts are below the 1990-94 average of
$44 billion. Expected high crop cash receipts and a
forecast increase in inventories of unsold feed
grains underpin the 1996 forecast. Net cash income is
forecast at $43-$53 billion, compared with $51
billion forecast for 1995. An important reason why
the net farm income forecast is generally upward and
the forecast for net cash income is generally
downward is that, in contrast to net farm income, net
cash income excludes changes in inventory. The degree
and direction by which inventories change can swing
widely depending on production and marketing
patterns.

Cash receipts from farm marketings are projected at
$184-$192 billion in 1996, up from the $184 billion
forecast for 1995. Both forecasts would be a record;
the previous high was $180 billion in 1994. Expected
large feed grain production and strong feed grain
prices stemming from tight world supplies explain
much of the higher 1996 forecast. Livestock receipts
are expected to remain flat.

Direct government payments for 1996 are forecast at
$3-$5 billion, while the 1995 forecast is for $6
billion. Expected high feed grain prices are the main
reason for the reduced forecast. Projected government
payments for both 1995 and 1996 would be the lowest
in the 1990's.

Total production expense, used to calculate net farm
income, is forecast at $169-$177 billion in 1996, up
from $168 billion in 1995. Part of the forecast
increase is tied to the expected rise in planted
acres. High forecast feed grain prices and fewer
requirements to idle acreage in order to be eligible
for government farm program benefits should encourage
heavy plantings. High feed grain prices could
increase feed expense for livestock producers, which
is of special importance because U.S. cattle numbers
in 1996 could approach the large levels last seen in
the mid-1980's. Higher nitrogen fertilizer prices
could increase costs for crop producers.

The value of agricultural assets is forecast at
$985-$995 billion for 1996, up 3 to 4 percent from
1995. About four-fifths of the increase is due to
rising real estate values. Expanding cash receipts,
generally good returns to assets, and favorable
interest rates are supporting continued growth in
farm sector capital investments. Farm business debt
could rise above $155 billion by the end of 1996, the
highest level since 1986. However, interest expense
could decline, as lower rates offset the rise in
debt. Overall farm debt in 1996 should be about 60
percent of what farm income can support, also the
highest level since 1986.

Given trends developing for 1996--higher crop cash
receipts, flat livestock receipts, smaller government
payments, and slightly lower net cash income: 
* Net cash income could decline proportionally more
on the smallest farms than on the largest ones. The
smallest farms traditionally earn a larger proportion
of their income from livestock sales and government
payments. 

* Farms that specialize in red meat production could
have proportionally larger dips in their net cash
income than other types of farms. Because they depend
on livestock for about 90 percent of their income,
farms specializing in red meat likely will face
higher feed expenses.

* Midwestern farms could have proportionally smaller
declines in their net cash income compared with farms
in other parts of the country. The Midwest is by far
the Nation's largest producer of corn and soybeans,
the crops for which cash receipts are forecast to
increase the most.

A special article in this issue looks at the
financial performance of U.S. farm business in 1994.
USDA's latest Farm Costs and Returns Survey, shows
that even though 1994 saw none of the adverse weather
that decreased production the year before, net income
from farming for the average commercial farm business
was up less than 1 percent. While the year-to-year
variation in average income was not statistically
significant, the composition of net income did
change. Government payments were down significantly.
The reduction in cash expenses offset the decline in
gross cash income and was enough for income to rise
from an average of $37,997 per farm in 1993 to an
average of $38,284 in 1994. In 1994, 6 percent of
commercial farm businesses were in a vulnerable
financial position based on their combined net farm
income and debt-to-asset ratios.

A second special article outlines the issues involved
in accounting for forestry product sales in farm
income estimates.

-ANC: ANC Secretary General's Christmas message

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-ANC: ANC Secretary
General's Christmas message
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:231295

We are now approaching the end of what has been a
very important year. It is during this year that we
observed the first anniversary of the birth of our
new democracy - an occasion marked by both
celebration and reflection.

1995 was no less significant a year for all our
people. It give us a glimpse of what the future holds
in store. This years achievements have provided us
with insight into the opportunities that await South
Africa in the coming years. It has at the same-time
given us a better understanding of the magnitude of
the task of reconstruction and development that still
lie ahead.

The African National Congress has always admitted
that no major transformation process can ever succeed
without the solid support of the majority of our
people in their organised formations and sectors. We
shall continue to ensure the constructive involvement
of all these in the reconstruction and development
programme. 

For indeed without their involvement the
reconstruction and development programme will lack
the mass content critical to its realization.

The single issue uppermost in people's minds, which
will continue to impede the effective implementation
of the RDP, and generates a negative perception of
our country in the outside world - is that of crime.
Antisocial behaviour - be it murder, both political
and criminal; car-hijackings; rape; robbery; child
molestation; or some other - must be seriously
addressed and eliminated. The sheer size of the
problem dictates that piecemeal methods will be
ineffective. It requires a comprehensive national
strategy for the prevention of crime. At the core of
such an approach is addressing the root causes of
crime.

The ANC, in government and outside government,
remains firmly committed to creating a safe and
secure environment in which families can bring up
their children; mothers can feel safe in their homes
and on the streets; and breadwinners can go about
their business without fear.

The Government of National Unity has already set in
motion a National Crime Prevention Strategy, linked
to the Community Safety Plan initiated by President
Nelson Mandela. These and other initiatives must
continue to draw the unequivocal support of all our
communities if we are to uproot.

On the economic front, we draw inspiration from the
economic growth and development hitherto unknown in
our country in the past twenty - three years. The
economy is now geared towards servicing the needs,
not of a section but all our people.

The constitution is being shaped by the need to move
from the inequities of the past and towards a climate
of peace, reconciliation and nation - building -
issues so close to our President's heart.

Our country, has effectively been transformed from a
pariah to a darling of nations of the world. We have
now taken our rightful place in all international
platforms: socially, economically, sporting,
cultural, diplomatic and in all other forms of
international relations.

The African National Congress, extends its heartfelt
congratulations to all South Africans who helped
shape the destiny of our country into the envy of the
world. In this season of goodwill we express our
condolences to those who lost their loved ones
throughout this year.

The ANC extends a message of peace and harmony, a
Happy Christmas and Prosperous New Year!

-BELL ATLANTIC: Maryland files rate plan to address
competetion -- Plan caps prices until 1998

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-BELL ATLANTIC: Maryland
files rate plan to address competetion -- Plan caps
prices until 1998
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

BALTIMORE, MD -- Bell Atlantic today proposed an
alternative regulatory plan that would regulate Bell
Atlantic's prices rather than the company's earnings.
The plan was filed with the Maryland Public Service
Commission and comes on the heels of legislation
passed earlier this year by the General Assembly
giving the Commission the power to adopt such a
regulatory approach.
 
"Our plan is a logical next step to replace
Maryland's current incentive regulation plan," said
Dan Whelan, president and CEO of Bell Atlantic -
Maryland. "It recognizes the competitive nature of
our industry today. It is pro-consumer,
pro-competition and pro-economic development."
 
Under the plan, services would be divided into five
categories: Access, Basic-Residential, Basic-Other,
Discretionary and Competitive. The Access category
includes services that provide connections to
long-distance networks. Basic-Residential includes
residential dial-tone lines, while Basic-Other
includes business services. Discretionary includes
optional services like Call Waiting, and Competitive
includes services provided by other vendors, such as
Speed Dialing.
 
Under the Bell Atlantic proposal, the rates for
Basic-Residential services would be capped for a
period of two years, and many business services for
one year. After that, rates for these services could
be increased or decreased annually, under a formula
that is based on changes in the Gross Domestic
Product-Price Index. 
 
"Our residential rates have been stable since 1985,
and this plan ensures that this stability will be
maintained," Whelan said. 

The plan is also designed to give Bell Atlantic
additional flexibility in pricing Discretionary and
Competitive services categories. For example, rates
for discretionary services, such as Call Waiting and
Caller ID, could be increased up to 25% annually or
could be reduced at any time, provided rates are not
reduced below costs. Competitive services such as
Speed Dialing, which compete with services offered by
Bell Atlantic's competitors, would be subject to full
pricing flexibility.
 
"This plan preserves the PSC's regulatory authority
to oversee telecommunications in Maryland, and
focuses on prices paid by customers, rather than
regulation of Bell Atlantic's earnings," Whelan said.
"The plan also guarantees that we will follow the
commission's service quality standards and maintains
relevant safeguards, such as pricing services above
costs to prevent anti-competitive behavior." 

Whelan said that Bell Atlantic's plan is also aimed
at keeping Maryland competitive with neighboring
states. Numerous studies have shown that regulatory
policies which allow a company to retain its earnings
can lead to a more aggressive deployment of new
telecommunications services--services that would
support Maryland's economic development goal of
attracting and retaining businesses and jobs. 
 
"Although Maryland is leading the nation in
introducing telecommunications competition, we are
the only state in our region that has not adopted a
more modern regulatory structure. It is therefore
important that we move forward prudently, but
quickly," he added.
 
Bell Atlantic Corporation (NYSE: BEL) is at the
forefront of the new communications, entertainment
and information industry. In the mid-Atlantic region,
the company is the premier provider of local
telecommunications and advanced services. Globally,
it is one of the largest investors in the high-growth
wireless communications marketplace. Bell Atlantic
also owns a substantial interest in Telecom
Corporation of New Zealand and is actively developing
high-growth national and international business
opportunities in all phases of the industry.

RDATE:281295

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:
Section 1511 of the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (hereinafter the "Act"),
requires that the sanctions imposed on Serbia and
Montenegro, as described in that section, shall
remain in effect until changed by law. Section
1511(e) of the Act authorizes the President to waive
or modify the application of such sanctions upon
certification to the Congress that the President has
determined that the waiver or modification is
necessary to achieve a negotiated settlement of the
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina that is acceptable to
the parties.
 
In accordance with this provision, I have issued the
attached Presidential Determination stating that the
suspension of the sanctions described in section
1511(a)(1-5) and (7-8) and in conformity with the
provisions of United Nations Security Council
Resolutions 1021 and 1022 is necessary to achieve a
negotiated settlement of the conflict. As described
in the attached Memorandum of Justification, this
sanctions relief was an essential factor motivating
Serbia and Montenegro's acceptance of the General
Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and
Herzegovina initialed in Dayton, Ohio, on November
21, 1995 (hereinafter the "Peace Agreement").
 
I have directed the Secretaries of the Treasury and
Transportation to suspend immediately the application
of these sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro and have
authorized the Secretary of State to suspend the arms
embargo at appropriate stages consistent with United
Nations Security Council Resolution 1021. The first
stage would be 91 days after the United Nations
Secretary General reports to the United Nations
Security Council that all parties have formally
signed the Peace Agreement.
 
The measures taken to suspend these sanctions may be
revoked if the Implementation Force (IFOR) commander
or High Representative determines that Serbia and
Montenegro or the Bosnian Serbs are not meeting their
obligations under the Peace Agreement.

-THE TENAGRA CORPORATION: New year could usher in big
computing problems

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE TENAGRA CORPORATION:
New year could usher in big computing problems
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

Brampton, Ontario, Canada -- Peter de Jager is one of
a growing number of computer experts that isn't
looking forward to New Year's day in the year 2000.

That is because 12:00:01 AM, January 1, 2000 could
mark the beginning of a serious problem for many of
the world's computer systems.

Most computers track the date by using a two-digit
notation system. The date January 1, 1996, for
example, would be recorded by a computer as:
01/01/96. This notation system, according to de
Jager, is the problem. 

"The two-digit date notation affects data
manipulation, primarily subtractions and
comparisons," explains de Jager. "For instance, I was
born in 1955. If I ask the computer to calculate how
old I am today, it subtracts 55 from 93 and announces
that I'm 38.

"So far so good. But what happens in the year 2000?
The computer will subtract 55 from 00 and will state
that I am minus 55 years old. This error will affect
any calculation that produces or uses time spans,
such as an interest calculation."

De Jager believes a number of Year 2000 related
problems may well manifest themselves in 1996.

"A large number of business processes, such as credit
cards, operate on a four year cycle. In 1996, it will
be interesting to see if any banks issue credit cards
with '00' as an expiration year. What could happen is
that ATM machines may think that the card expired in
1900 if only '00' is used to signify the year 2000."

While year 2000 problems are often associated with
large computing systems, it will affect desktop
computers as well. Many people that shut off their
personal computers on December 31, 1999 could be
surprised when they turn them on the next day to find
their computer's clock set at January 4, 1980 -
another strange error that experts predict will occur
because of the way internal clocks in computers
handle the rollover to a new year. 

Some experts estimate that the costs of reprogramming
computers to rid them of this flaw in the next four
years could total hundreds of billions of dollars.

Peter de Jager is an industry speaker on the topics
of managing the impact of technological change. He
was the first to actively speak about on the Year
2000 computer crisis to those outside the computer
industry. 

In April, 1995, de Jager partnered with The Tenagra
Corporation to develop the Year 2000 Internet
Information Center (http://www.year2000.com/) - an
Internet web site devoted to raising awareness of the
Year 2000 computer crisis. The web site contains
extensive information on the impending crisis,
including 10 white papers and nine vendors providing
Year 2000 solutions. Individuals visiting the site
can also download a free software patch to help PCs
cope with the date transition.

Founded in 1993, The Tenagra Corporation
(http://arganet.tenagra.com/) is Houston, Texas
company providing Internet marketing, public
relations, consulting and web site development
services.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Press briefing by Mike McCurry

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Press briefing by Mike
McCurry
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295 3:55 P.M. EST
 
MR. MCCURRY: Okay. All clear, right?
 
Q Yeah, right.
 
Q How come there's no meeting until next Friday? What
happened?
 
MR. MCCURRY: As you can tell from our statement, as
--in fact, can I have a copy in my statement so I can
just keep repeating what's in the statement?
(Laughter.)
 
Q We heard the President say that he's willing to
stay every day, work hard and so forth to get an
agreement. What happened?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He is. The key thing -- I'll do an
exegetical of reading this statement for you. The
good meetings that they had today refers to the two
meetings they had. They had a larger meeting in the
Cabinet Room and then the private meeting that the
President had with the Speaker, the Majority Leader,
the two Minority Leaders and Mr. Armey, too, I
believe -- George? Armey was there -- in the Oval
Office.
 
They build on the progress in yesterday's
discussions. That's an important observation because
you will recall that Mr. Panetta and Mr. Domenici and
Mr. Kasich designed a process yesterday by which we
dealt with some of the less controversial issues in
this budget dispute. That generated over a seven-year
period some $40 billion in savings in some of these
secondary areas. That was presented to the principals
today, and I think there was agreement that while
there's nothing agreed until everything is agreed,
that represented some progress and served as a useful
model of how we might resolve some of the larger
issues.
 
So the President and the other leaders agreed that
that process by which staff develops an analysis,
presents it to the budget advisors -- which is the
Panetta, Domenici, Kasich, Sabo, Exon group -- they
ought to work through this analysis beginning right
after the holiday and then present that back to the
principals a week from today, as they just did
yesterday in looking at the issues that they looked
at. And I think that's useful. 
 
There have been different ideas on how we might
advance this discussion, ranging from face-to-face
meetings to whatever, but they had a process, they
designed a process yesterday. It seemed to be
working. I think there was agreement, as you can tell
from this statement, that they ought to continue to
use that process to see if they could make progress
on these other issues.
 
Q No sense of urgency at all?
 
MR. MCCURRY: A great deal of urgency.
 
Q How can you say that?
 
MR. MCCURRY: A great deal of a sense of urgency. This
President would, above all else, like to see the full
services of the American government restored to the
American people. But everybody in this room knows
that's not going to happen because you've been
following -- presumably, you've been following the
debate in the House and the Senate today. So you just
know where we are on that. 

Now what we are going to do, since we can't get the
full services of the government restored, they are
going to deal with the most urgent situations that
exist. Those range from benefits checks for veterans
to income support checks for children who are
dependent on AFDC, to federal workers who are not
getting their pay. That was an area of very great
concern raised by the President and agreed to by most
of the leaders in the room.
 
And they are looking now at ways in which they might
be able to address that situation, despite the fact
that there doesn't seem to be agreement on Capitol
Hill for a CR that would be fully fund the
government. Everyone here knows that Democrats today
have offered on Capitol Hill clean versions of the CR
that would re-open this government. And you all know
what's happened to those measures. 

Q Well, would it come to a vote at all?
 
Q Mike, at the very least, does this mean that
there's no end in sight for the shutdown, at least
not until next Friday when the next meeting takes
place?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, there are ways in which we will
attempt to address the consequences of the shutdown.
We will continue our work day by day at OMB to
address the consequences of the shutdown. I believe
you will see as a result of this meeting today on
Capitol Hill efforts by the leaders to address some
of the specific consequences.
 
It certainly appears that there will be some
agreement on trying to get veterans' checks out on
time and trying to get income support payments to
children out on time. But we'll have to deal with the
most urgent consequences of the shutdown on a
day-by-day basis, doing what we can, working with the
Hill and getting legislation passed and doing what we
can do administratively under law as we did in the
last shutdown to address the consequences that
threaten life and health of the American people.
 
Q Well, so, the President -- this is a club over the
President which he is accepting, basically?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No. The club over the President that
they tried to swing was to insist upon him tabling a
seven-year balanced budget proposal scored by the CBO
in order to have exactly this type of discussion. And
that did not happen.
 
Q But, Mike, he has repeatedly said he would not
negotiate with a gun to his head, this sort of threat
of shutting down the government. But now he's doing
exactly that.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, it's the result of this
conversation today, while not removed, the gun was
clearly uncocked. 
 
Q Huh?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, they've taken some of -- whether
it's veterans' benefits or welfare payments or now
we've got some forward movement as a result of this
meeting on the issue of payments to workers who are
furloughed -- they're going to try to work through
some of these issues, and they've instructed staff to
look at ways that they could deal with that.
 
Q -- half-cocked, right?
 
Q Mike, was there a definite agreement that this
meeting today from the Republicans to go ahead and
move through on a limited CR basis all these urgent
matters as they come up? 

MR. MCCURRY: Well, it would be better given the
agreement that we've reached not to try to
characterize or spin the results of this meeting, for
you to direct that question to the Republicans.
 
Q And was there agreement to continue to -- 

MR. MCCURRY: The President was encouraged -- the
President raised those as urgent issues, and the
President was encouraged by the response.
 
Q What was the tone of the meeting?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Workman-like. Workperson-like.
 
Q What is the President going to be doing this
weekend?
 
Q Were there any women there?
 
MR. MCCURRY: In other words, they rolled up their --
they did, this was, in fact, exactly a meeting where
they rolled up their sleeves and went to work.
 
Q Did he ask them to open the government and they
refused?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He has done that repeatedly.
 
Q I take it the House is going to go into recess, but
there are different versions of this very narrow --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I cannot help you sort out what's
happening in the House and the Senate. We're
following that and trying to make heads or tails out
of that ourselves, but it's a very fluid situation.
I'd ask your congressional correspondents. 

Q What does the President do this weekend? How does
he advance it?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, he's confident that those who will
be working through some of the analysis of the issues
will be at work. There will be some staff level work,
but to be candid about it, the budget staffs at both
the CBO and the OMB have been working 24-hour days
for several weeks, and the President is going to give
our OMB staff and economists the Christmas holiday
off. They'll come back after Monday beginning working
on this analysis of issues. They'll present that to
the budget advisors group. That's the Panetta,
Kasich, Domenici, Exon, Sabo group. I expect they
will meet late next week and prepare the agenda and
the discussion for the principals a week from today.
 
Q What is the guidance on what he's going to do? Is
he still going to go to Camp David next week?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Since this is just developing, he
probably was looking for an opportunity to talk to
the First Lady about their plans. His plans are still
to be here through the 26th at least, and then the
option of going to Camp David from the 27th he'll
have to explore. I don't have an answer for you.
 
Q Is Hilton Head out?
 
MR. MCCURRY: If he goes down, I think -- he still has
an interest in going down and having a party with his
friends on New Year's Eve. But I don't know whether
he's going to be able to do that, or not.
 
Q Mike, in today's meeting, did the President ask
them to put the government back to work?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He addressed his concern as he did
publicly for all of you at the -- I mean, the answer
to that, obviously, is yes, because he did it with
all of you present at the beginning of the meeting. I
mean, he stressed that concern, he raised that
concern. They talked about it during the meeting. 

Q And they said no still?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The no came from the action on Capitol
Hill today, as you know.
 
Q Mike, the $40 billion that you talked about, did
the principals all agree to where that was coming
from and did they reach any agreement about where to
put it?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, they -- again, I would stress,
because I don't want anyone to misunderstand what the
White House is saying that nothing is agreed until
everything is agreed. They were satisfied they made
some progress on those roughly $40 billion worth of
savings generated by discussions they had on the wide
range of things they dealt with yesterday from
spectrum to banking, to financial, to transportation
issues, some of the other issues that they've dealt
with. That's a useful model. And then that goes into
further discussions. I don't have any detail breakout
of that. I can't specify that, and I won't specify
that.
 
Q Mike, is the President --
 
Q -- there's no Medicaid agreement?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Santa?
 
SANTA CLAUS: Ho-ho-ho-ho.
 
MR. MCCURRY: It's very good to see you.
 
SANTA CLAUS: Merry Christmas.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Merry Christmas. Let's do a couple more
questions, and then I'll turn the podium over to
Santa.
 
Q Is the President comfortable with the way this
thing ended? Would he have preferred more talks
tonight, obviously, on the weekend? Is it just done
now until next Friday?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The President would prefer to see the
government open, prefer to see the balance -- the
budget balanced now. But we are into a process that
we hope will resolve some of these issues and resolve
some of the differences that exist. These differences
still exist. It's not possible to achieve either of
those objectives today.
 
Q But this timetable is to give everybody a Christmas
at home, isn't it?
 
MR. MCCURRY: This timetable is to allow people to
work through issues that are deeply divided at the
moment and that apparently were not reconcilable
today.
 
Q Was the President willing to work --
 
Q Just one other thing, Mike, on another matter. As
you know, as a result of the compromise, those
Whitewater notes were released, went to the Hill.
Senator D'Amato and others have reacted. What's the
sense here about what the effect of this is? Does it
make things better, make things worse, prolong the
controversy, end it --what?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I concur fully on Mr. Fabiani's
statement. 

Q Mike, just to be clear here, are you saying that
the President was willing to work, but the members of
Congress wanted to go back home? I mean, who was it
who said we shouldn't -- 

MR. MCCURRY: The issue was not the desire to go back
home. The issue was the desire to try to make some
progress on these issues. And they clearly were not
going to write a seven-year balanced budget plan at
this meeting today. That was not in the expectations
for the meeting.
 
Q Well, how about next week?
 
MR. MCCURRY: What they have done is designed a
process by which we can get to that objective. 
 
Let me just take one or two more.
 
Q So the President was unwilling to work on Tuesday.
I just want to find out --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Look, that is not the case. The
President is more than -- would have been willing if
it was some prospect that this would have led to a
successful result to have worked all through the
holiday. That's not going to happen. It was clear in
this meeting that they're not going to bridge these
--
 
Q Well, did they tell him, we won't do it? 

MR. MCCURRY: It's clear that they weren't going to
bridge all the differences that exist and write a
budget that is a very complex document in the course
of a weekend.
 
Q Mike, explain what is the goal here now? Is the
goal to produce, as the Republicans want, as Armey
has said repeatedly, a bill -- a bill in the end that
they send to him that puts the government back to
work and it's a done deal? Or is the goal to get far
enough along to where the Republicans finally give in
and pass a CR? What's -- I mean, it's got to be one
or the other. 

MR. MCCURRY: The goal we have is to see the services
of the government fully restored. We can't achieve
that goal right now. What we can do right now is to
address the most urgent consequences of the
government shutdown. And we will do that, and we
believe today we've got some sense of cooperation
from the leaders in trying to address those most
urgent issues. I cannot predict for you now when the
continuing resolution or full funding or full
appropriations measures will pass that will fully
restore government. But I do know the President is
committed to working towards satisfactory solutions
that deal with the most urgent consequences of the
shutdown. 

Q But does the President believe that a CR will be
passed before there is a final agreement on the
budget deal? 

MR. MCCURRY: The President doesn't rule out that
possibility.
 
Q Mike, a follow-up --
 
Q Why?
 
Q -- do you think that federal workers will get paid?
Some of them have been told to start filing for
unemployment next week.
 
MR. MCCURRY: The one positive thing that came out of
the meeting is it was very clearly on the part of
everyone in the room concern about the status of
federal workers who are furloughed, federal workers
who are working as excepted employees who are not
going to get paid until there is funding. And also --
well, those are the two categories. And they -- in
both categories, there seems to be willingness on the
part of the leadership to explore remedies that would
allow them to be paid despite the shutdown. And that
was encouraging. We don't have an answer to that
problem yet, but there is some agreement that they
will look for ways to try to get paychecks to those
people, especially during this holiday season. 

Q Armey has said that they're not going to have any
votes at least until Wednesday evening, as they were
shutting down on the House floor. Given that you
wouldn't quarrel with the notion that the government
is going to stay shut down at a minimum, at least
until Wednesday night, or at least until Thursday
morning? 

MR. MCCURRY: I would not quarrel with that. I mean,
and he knows the House schedule better. That's
exactly the situation we're in. They're not going to,
despite the efforts by Democrats on the Hill to pass
a continuing resolution today, that's not going to
happen.
 
Q Mike, to follow on, do they go ahead, though, and
apply for unemployment, which will cost the
government even more? 

MR. MCCURRY: They will have to take the best advice
they can get from the Office of Personnel Management,
and they will know best the situation. Federal
workers should contact personnel advisers at their
agencies or look for notices from OPM on how to
handle those circumstances.
 
Q But are they all furloughed? I mean, how do they --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, there are 470,000 federal workers
who are working now. The federal government is
incurring a legal obligation to pay them. And what we
agree at the very least is that we ought to figure
out how to get paychecks to those people since we are
legally obligated to pay them one way or another. We
also are very concerned about people who are
furloughed. And we encourage that the Republican
leadership on the Hill have pledged to make sure
those people do get their pay restored. And we will
look for ways that we can do that, even advance full
appropriations or a continuing. There's no -- there
was no answer or solution to that problem today, but
there is some willingness to explore a way to deal
with that situation.
 
Q I don't want to go over old ground, but what you
may be hearing from us is you say there's a very
discernable sense of urgency, and yet here both sides
are taking several days off, and no meeting scheduled
until next Friday. And that's hard for us to put the
two and two together and --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, there clearly are some divisions
that exist here. You've been hearing them expressed
publicly all day. And having meetings throughout the
weekend that weren't going to resolve those
differences wouldn't be a fruitful exercise. But
they've designed a process here that they believe
will work. This is the one that worked yesterday, and
they believe it will work now. 

Q Were there any food fights?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I don't think they served any beverages
or refreshments.
 
Q When you say they believe, do you mean the
principals believe?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Yes, as they say in their statement,
they believe that the process that they used
yesterday to reconcile some of these issues worked.
And they believe that if they try to employ it for
the larger issues, they might get somewhere.
 
Q Mike, what's next up on the table? I mean, I assume
you're moving from the easiest or least controversial
issues to the tougher --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Substantively, I can't -- I can't answer
that question substantively.
 
Q Just one final process question. Did the form of
the discussions that have occurred so far suggest
that there's a kind of a component-by-component,
issue-by-issue approach to this budget in which,
while everybody may have a complete budget on the
table, those complete budgets become less relevant as
this process goes forward?
 
MR. MCCURRY: That's a very good question, Brit. I
can't -- since I did not participate in all of the
meetings and especially the Oval Office one, I can't
answer that completely. I can tell you that the
central elements of this budget discussion are now so
well-known to the participants in these discussions
that they can look at individual elements from some
of the different proposals out there -- whether it's
Breaux-Chafee, whether it's coalition, whether it's
Senate Democrat, whether it's the President's plan,
whether it's the original congressional resolution --
and know, based on what they -- take the element,
look at it, know, based on whatever the number is how
it would fit into an overall final agreement. 

So it's an interesting question and it probably is a
useful observation. There may be, if there's a final
agreement to be made, it's going to draw on a lot of
the different ideas that are out there.
 
Q Can I follow up on that Mike?
 
Q Is the President still going to pre-tape the radio
address?
 
Q There was a sense at the beginning of the week that
if this was bumped up to the principals --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Radio? We're going to do it live now. Do
we know the subject yet? Budget. 
 
Q If I could ask you a question to follow on Brit --
There was a sense at the beginning of the week that
if this was bumped up to the principals -- the
President, congressional leaders -- they took over,
they might be able to resolve it faster. Is it the
feeling now that the process you're talking about
would -- 

MR. MCCURRY: I don't know that I accept that
characterization. I don't believe that I've ever said
that. I don't know that anyone here at the White
House has ever said that. I believe it's been said
elsewhere that if the principals would get involved,
they might be able to resolve these issues quicker.
But that was always --
 
Q Well, they said --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I think that's correct. But I don't know
that that's ever been entirely clear.
 
Q Is it your feeling that the process that involves
the Chief of Staff and the chairs of the committees,
the process that they're developing works better?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, the point I'm making is that it
worked yesterday. We had an agreement -- remember, we
had an agreement to conduct some face-to-face talks
without preconditions, and that process failed
because it was not acceptable to a portion of the
House Republican caucus. Now we've got a process.
That process seemed to work yesterday in narrowing
some differences. And it's encouraging that they now
are going to employ this process as they work through
next week and then to prepare for the meeting -- 

Q What's the process?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It's the one that's defined in the
statement. And we've been through that four or five
times already. 

Q One thing you haven't said in the good meeting is
whether or not the principals themselves made any of
the decisions they were talking about having to make
going into the meeting. Everybody talked about making
tough decisions. Did they make any decisions today or
just agree on --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, the toughest decisions are those
that are dealing with the most controversial items in
the budget. And as you know, they didn't attempt to
resolve those today. 

Okay, anything else?
 
Q Yes, there's one more important point on
contractors. Contractors are not getting paid. What
happens -- 

MR. MCCURRY: I can't help you at that level of
detail. 

THE PRESS: Thank you.

-NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS SERVICE: Catfish
processing -- Highlights

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL
STATISTICS SERVICE: Catfish processing -- Highlights
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Estimates refer to November 1994 and 1995. Catfish
Processing Down 5 Percent Farm-raised catfish
processed during November totaled 34.1 million pounds
round weight, down 5 percent from November 1994. The
average price paid to producers was 78 cents per
pound for November 1995, unchanged from the last two
months and 1 cent above a year ago. Net pounds of
processed fish sold during November totaled 16.7
million pounds, an increase of 2 percent from the
comparable month in 1994.

Sales of fresh fish, at 6.91 million pounds, were up
6 percent from November 1994 and represented 41
percent of total sales. Frozen fish sales, at 9.77
million pounds, were down 2 percent from a year ago
and accounted for the remaining 59 percent of total
fish sales. Sales of whole fish represented 24
percent of the total, fillets accounted for 54
percent, and the remaining 22 percent were mostly,
steaks, nuggets, and value added products. The
November 1995 average price received by processors
for total fresh fish was $2.20 per pound, down 5
cents from last year. Prices for fresh whole fish
decreased 7 cents per pound to $1.63.

Prices for fresh fillets decreased 1 cent to $2.90
per pound. Total frozen fish averaged $2.48 per
pound, unchanged from November 1994. Prices for
frozen whole fish decreased 7 cents per pound to
$1.95, while frozen fillets at $2.82 per pound were
down 6 cents from $2.88 a year ago. Freshwater
catfish imports during September 1995 totaled 402
thousand pounds, up 25 percent from the 322 thousand
pounds imported the previous year. Ninety- six
percent of imports were from Brazil, with the
remaining 4 percent coming from Canada and Vietnam.
No exports were reported for September 1995. October
data were not available at the time of this release
due to Government furlough. If available they will be
included in the release on January 23, 1996. Import
and export data are compiled by the U.S. Bureau of
Census.

Catfish Processing Estimates Survey Procedures: 
Survey data for catfish processing are collected from
approximately 30 processors. All participating
processors must meet the minimum criteria of having a
capacity to process at least 2,000 pounds live weight
of catfish per 8-hour shift. The survey is conducted
entirely by NASS Headquarter's staff in Washington,
D.C. NASS field offices, however, are responsible for
keeping Headquarters informed of any new processing
operations in their state to ensure that the survey
coverage is as complete as possible. Processors are
contacted either by mail or telephone. Diligent
effort is made to ensure that all operations are
accounted for in the estimate. Estimation Procedures: 

The "Catfish Processing" report refers strictly to
farm-raised fish and excludes wild, captured fish.
Prior to summarization, questionnaires are compared
with the previous month's reports for comparable
placement of data, reasonable price levels, and
reasonable inventory carryover given the sales and
processing totals reported. Estimates are made for
those processors whose reports are not available in
time to be included in the release. These plants are
identified by an asterisk on page 5 of this release.
Estimates are normally based on the processor's
previous report and current conditions. Published
totals are a straight summation of the individual
reports and estimated data. Price items are weighted
by the associated volumes to compute weighted average
prices.

The published price for total whole fish, however,
reflects an adjustment to the round and gutted only
price to bring it to an equivalent dressed weight
price. If a plant uses a fiscal accounting system,
proration is used to convert reported data to a
calendar month basis. Only national level estimates
are published due to the limited number of plants
involved. Generally, individual items are not
published if there are less than three plants
reporting, or if any one plant has 60 percent or more
of the total.

One unique feature of the "Catfish Processing" report
is the listing of cooperating processors by name on
each month's release. This feature originally was
used to solicit industry cooperation in maintaining
coverage, but it has continued because of the
processors' overall acceptance of this policy. Import
and export data for frozen catfish fillets, which are
compiled by the Department of Commerce, are also
included in this report. Reliability: Catfish
processing estimates are based on a census of all
known active processors and, therefore, have no
sampling variability. However, estimates may be
subject to errors such as omissions, duplication, and
mistakes in reporting, recording, and processing of
the data. These errors are minimized through strict
quality controls in the edit and summarization
process, and a careful review of all reported data
for consistency and reasonableness.

Revision Policy:
Revisions may be necessary following a review of late
reports received from plants. Revisions of less than
2 percent of the existing published levels of any
category will normally not be made.

Definitions Used For Catfish Processing:
Average Price Paid to Producers - Refers to the price
of fish delivered to the processing plant door. Price
includes charges for any services provided by the
processing plant, such as seining and hauling, but
does not include any adjustments based on year-end
settlements.

Fillets - Boned sides of the fish, cut lengthwise
away from the backbone.
Fresh Fish - Fish intended for immediate consumption.
Also referred to as ice-packed.

Frozen Fish - Fish which are individually quick
frozen and glazed (IQF) or individually bagged and
bulk frozen.

Nuggets - Small fillets cut from below the rib
section of the fish. Usually includes breading or
added ingredients.

Round & Gutted Only - Fish with no processing done or
viscera only removed.

Round Weight - A term for fish live weight.

Steaks - Cross-section cuts from larger dressed fish.

Strips - Finger size pieces of fish cut from fillets.
Usually includes breading or added ingredients.

Whole Dressed - Weight of whole fish with only head,
viscera, and skin removed. Generally, 60 percent of
the live weight remains as dressed fish. Processing
data were compiled in cooperation with the following
processors:
* America's Catch Guidry Catfish Processors, Inc.
Amite River Industries Harvest Select Aqua Farm
Catfish, Inc. Lake's Farm Raised Catfish, Inc.
Carolina Classics Catfish, Inc. Pride of the Pond
Confish, Inc. Prime Line Catfish Co. Corbin Fish Farm
Seabrook Seafood, Inc. Delta Pride Catfish, Inc.
Simmons Farm-Raised Dorey Fish Co. Southern Farm Fish
Processors Farm Fresh Catfish Co. Southern Pride Fish
Breeders of Idaho Southfresh Farms Franklin Catfish
Superior Fish Processors Freshwater Farms, Inc.

* Estimated The next "Catfish Processing" report will
be released at 3 p.m. ET on January 23, 1996. The
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
prohibits discrimination in its programs on the basis
of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, age,

-COMPUSERVE: CompuServe membership hits 4 million
worldwide

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-COMPUSERVE: CompuServe
membership hits 4 million worldwide -- Heading into
the holidays, online service expects unprecedented
growth to continue
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

COLUMBUS, Ohio -- CompuServe Incorporated, the
industry s most extensive online information service
provider and the largest Internet access provider in
the world, today announced that its worldwide
membership to the CompuServe Information Service has
surpassed 4 million individuals. With more than
200,000 new members joining the service each month
and local dial-up access in more than 140 countries,
CompuServe officials are optimistic about prospects
in the new year.

New computer owners are realizing the value of the
online service and the Internet, said Bob Massey,
CompuServe s president and chief executive officer. A
computer that is not connected to cyberspace is like
a television without sound and color. People know
they need to be online, and CompuServe offers the
best value in the industry.

We are in an excellent position to continue our
unprecedented growth, Massey said. We have the most
extensive, most reliable global information network
in the world, and we are the world s largest Internet
access provider. We offer the deepest, broadest
content for new computer users and online veterans
alike. Plus, we keep making the service better. We re
adding outstanding content like TIME magazine,
exciting events like Mick Jagger online with voice
and video, and localized information for our members
around the world. 

Traditionally, the holiday season is one of the
biggest times of year for member acquisition in the
online industry. This year, more than 3 million
people are expected to get new computers. Our goal is
to reach 5 million members next spring, and we will
reach that goal, Massey said. For just $9.95 a month,
CompuServe members get 5 hours of access to more than
3,000 services, plus the Internet. Additional hours
are just $2.95 each. This announcement comes just one
day after CompuServe surpassed 500,000 members in
Europe, with 200,000 in the United Kingdom alone.
CompuServe is an H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) company.

Founded in 1955, H&R Block is a diversified services
company and the world's leader in tax preparation and
online information services. H&R Block Tax Services
handled almost one in every seven returns filed with
the Internal Revenue Service in 1995, serving 17.1
million taxpayers in more than 9,500 offices
worldwide. CompuServe operates the most comprehensive
online network in the world, providing services to
nearly 900 corporate accounts and more than 4.0
million users in more than 140 countries.

-NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ETHICS: NIE claim theres no
excuse for not preventing police corruption

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF
ETHICS: NIE claim theres no excuse for not preventing
police corruption -- Biggest problem is city hall,
not bad cops
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295

Orlando - Neal Trautman, Executive Director of The
National Institute of Ethics, states today that there
is no excuse for not preventing police corruption.
The true root cause of most of the scandals seen
throughout the nation today does not even lie within
the police department. In fact, the vast majority of
law enforcement officers are victims, not villains. 

Contrary to what the media has portrayed, the New
Orleans Police Department is not filled with greedy,
corrupt, drug dealing cops. The 100 officers I met
are some of the most sincere, dedicated officers I
have ever had the honor to instruct. The officers
here are not villains. They are victims. 

Political Cause #1 - Pressuring departments to hire
new officers without conducting an effective
background investigation. Many agencies, having had a
scandal, have been forced to hire people without a
thorough background investigation. History has taught
us that this usually becomes a "root cause" for
future corruption.

In addition to forcing the department to hire
officers without an effective background
investigation, other political influences led to the
destruction of their law enforcement. Money is
usually a very poor way to motivate employees. It
ceases to motivate people the moment they receive it
and often results in decreasing levels of dedication.

Political Cause #2 - Not supporting officers with a
fair salary. When officers are not paid enough to
support their families, common sense dictates that a
small percentage of normally good officers will give
in to the stress of being poor and the temptation of
easy drug money being so prevalent.

Political Cause #3 - Officers are understaffed and
overworked. Months and years of such pressure often
means that their original motivation of sincerity
evolves into the feeling that they are being used and
manipulated. 

Political Cause #4 - Politicians take actions that
demoralize officers. Unfair salaries, being
understaffed, not having enough time to provide
effective training, seldom being told that you are
appreciated; all create an internal culture that is
negative, cynical, suspicious and resentful. This, in
turn, leads to employees committing unethical acts. 

Political Cause #5 - Public officials created an
"internal culture" that causes unethical acts. Role
modeling is the greatest way to influence anyone's
behavior. When elected officials role model dirty
politics and hidden agendas, the police department
will usually have the same degree of shamefull
politics and hidden agendas which lead to corruption. 

The Solution:
1. Provide effective leadership training to replace
dirty politics with fair, respectful leadership.

2. Implement state-of-the-art, video and audio tape,
ehtical dilemma simulation training.

3. Implement an administrative process that prevents
unethical acts as opposed to simply reacting after
corruption occurs. 

Training is the vehicle that leads to the prevention
of scandals. The elected officials who created
circumstances that led to these events may have done
so because they didn't appreciate the consequences of
their actions. If so, then their education should
prevent the continued betrayal of integrity.

Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section
1511(e)(2) of the National Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160) (the
"Act"), I hereby determine that the waiver or
modification of the sanctions on Serbia and
Montenegro that were imposed by or pursuant to the
directives described in section 1511(a)(1-5) and
(7-8) of the Act, in conformity with the provisions
of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1021
and 1022 of November 22, 1995, is necessary to
achieve a negotiated settlement of the conflict in
Bosnia-Herzegovina that is acceptable to the parties.
 
Therefore, I hereby direct the Secretary of the
Treasury to take appropriate action to suspend the
application of the sanctions imposed on Serbia and
Montenegro pursuant to Executive Order No. 12808 of
May 30, 1992, Executive Order No. 12810 of June 5,
1992, Executive Order No. 12831 of January 15, 1993,
and Executive Order No. 12846 of April 25, 1993,

to the Congress. The property and interests in
property previously blocked remain blocked until
provision is made to address claims or encumbrances,
including the claims of the other successor states of
the former Yugoslavia.
 
I hereby direct the Secretary of Transportation to
take appropriate action to suspend the application of
the sanctions imposed pursuant to Department of
Transportation Order 92-5-38 of May 20, 1992,
Department of Transportation Order 92-6-27 of June
12, 1992, and Special Federal Aviation Regulation No.
66-2 of May 31, 1995 (14 C.F.R. Part 91, 60 Federal
Register 28477), effective upon the transmittal of
this determination to the Congress.
 
I hereby authorize the Secretary of State to take
appropriate action to suspend the application of the
sanctions imposed pursuant to Department of State
Public Notice 1427 of July 11, 1991, at the
appropriate time in conformity with the provisions of
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1021 of
November 22, 1995.
 
The national emergency declared in Executive Order
No. 12808 and expanded in Executive Order No. 12934
shall continue in effect. 

The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to
publish this determination in the Federal Register.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Memorandum of Justification for Presidential
Certification Regarding the Modification of the
Application of U.S. Sanctions on Serbia and
Montenegro

The Serbia and Montenegro sanctions program is a key
element of the President's policy aimed at bringing
about a settlement of the conflict in the former
Yugoslavia. The United States has continued to strive
during the past three years to ensure strong
enforcement of the sanctions on Serbia and
Montenegro. This has maintained the effectiveness of
the sanctions program, motivating the Serbian
leadership to come to the negotiating table. 

The General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, signed in Paris on December 14,
1995, produced agreement among the warring parties to
establish a single state of Bosnia-Herzegovina within
its pre-1992 borders. Bosnia will be governed by a
central government with constitutionally enumerated
powers over internal and international affairs and
will contain two entities. Along with resolution of
many thorny territorial issues, the parties agreed to
regional stabilization measures as well as to protect
human rights and fundamental freedoms and to hold
elections within the next year.
 
The agreement required more than two weeks of
intensive negotiations in Dayton. During the talks,
all sides were forced to make concessions on a range
of deeply held issues. The likelihood of sanctions
suspension was one of the key factors contributing to
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's agreement at
the talks. As the representative of Bosnian Serb
interests at Dayton, Milosevic's role was crucial in
reaching agreement. Sanctions relief was clearly
anticipated as a consequence of accord, and has
already taken the form of the United Nations Security
Council Resolutions 1021 and 1022, adopted by the
Council on November 22, 1995.
 
Before agreeing to sanctions suspension, we insisted
on a credible reimposition mechanism to ensure no
backsliding on the commitments made by the Serbs. If
the IFOR commander or High Representative determines
that the FRY or the Bosnian Serbs are not meeting
their obligations under the Peace Agreement, economic
sanctions may again go into effect against the Serbs.

Accordingly, we plan to leave the Sanctions
Assistance Mission infrastructure and monitors in
place.

Press briefing by Mike McCurry

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Press briefing by Mike
McCurry
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:311295 12:40 P.M. EST

MR. MCCURRY: Let me just tell you what's going on
right now. The President of the United States is
thanking individually the various members of the
budget staffs that have been supporting the
administration team during these discussions, folks
from Health and Human Services, Treasury, OMB, the
National Economic Council, Mr. Panetta's staff, those
that have done extraordinary work over the last week
and, as you'll be able to tell in a moment, have got
an extraordinary amount of work today and tomorrow.
 
The budget discussions today led to an agreement by
the principals to instruct staff to really summarize
the discussions they've been able to have over the
last several days, which resulted in exploring the
differences that exist in a range of areas from
income support programs to welfare, to tax issues, to
health care finance issues -- to really summarize
those discussions and draw together the places where
there appeared to be some agreement between the
Republican side, the administration and the
congressional Democrats; and then, also set forth in
more precise detail the areas that there clearly are
still differences. 
 
That will lead to a meeting that will happen here at
the White House Tuesday evening, either late
afternoon or early evening -- I suspect more early
evening -- between the budget principals. They will
reconvene, review the discussion document that is
prepared by staff over the next day and a half, and
they will begin, I think they all believe, the more
serious discussions of tradeoffs that exist on the
large issues that will be fundamental to a final
agreement. But they all clearly remain committed to
this process and the process is working. They are
making progress because they are defining the areas
of agreement and disagreement more clearly. And the
President's satisfied that they're making progress. 
 
The President also strongly encouraged the
congressional leaders to find a way to pass some
measure that would restore federal workers to their
rightful places of employment. He also wants them to
be paid, but he understands that those are -- there
are different points of view on that issue. He hopes
they can resolve some of these issues.
 
Q What's his point of view on that?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He believes they should be working, they
should be paid, and the government should be fully
open, as he said over and over and over again.
 
Q Any suggestion, any hint that they were close to
working some deal today?
 
MR. MCCURRY: They worked on it a lot. There was
considerable side-bar discussion during this meeting
between House and Senate staffers, and Senate
staffers between the Republican and Democratic side,
and that will lead to whatever action occurs on the
Hill shortly.
 
Q Did Dole and Daschle say they would --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I'm not going to comment on the business
that they need to do themselves on the Hill.
 
Q Mike, Tony Blankley said that there was one area
that was not covered in the walk-through. What is
that area? He said it was one major area.
 
MR. MCCURRY: I suspect -- can you run and check on
this? I suspect the answer to that is Medicaid. But
Barry will run that down.
 
Q They didn't act on that at all?
 
MR. MCCURRY: They spent a lot of time discussing
Medicare. The almost entire discussion today was
devoted to Medicare and different options. And what
the President and congressional leaders asked for is
something that really defines more clearly what the
policy choices are in Medicare given the respective
positions of the various budget proposals that are
out there.
 
Q Mike, in the event that there is some kind of deal
in the Senate, will there be any briefing here on
what -- the technicalities of what that means for the
government?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, if there's a final agreement in
Congress that would restore federal workers to their
jobs, OMB staff will be available to talk about how
that will affect any restart activities that they
have. But we'll direct that to OMB because they'll be
in the best place to analyze that.
 
Q Mike, can you confirm that as of yesterday they had
an agreement in principle to at least a packet of
savings of $100 billion in social spending?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, that would be -- that requires
some rough eyeballing that I don't think you can
really do under the circumstances. There are
different ways that you can look at the categories of
things they've done here. There are some areas where
there are clear agreements and they should be able to
rather quickly write the legislative language that
would lock in some of the things they've agreed to. 
 
There are other areas where it's a little fuzzier,
where there are some different options that exist and
you could get a range of savings depending on how you
calculate it. But my guess is -- I saw that comment
in one of the stories today; I think that was
probably a rough eyeball guess that someone made that
would try to put a numeric value on some of the work
they've done. Frankly, I'd caution people here
against using that kind of calculation because the
ranges are so large when you look at the big ticket
issues. There could be considerably more in savings,
depending on how you judge the progress they made on
some of these discussions. 

Q What are the differences on Medicaid without going
into detail? Are they financial or are they
philosophical? 

MR. MCCURRY: Both. 
 
MR. TOIV: Medicaid is the issue, but it was discussed
in the context of block grants, the whole block grant
issue, but not separately as a --
 
MR. MCCURRY: The fundamental dispute there is the
guarantee of health care coverage and the federal
entitlement and what happens if you block-grant it.
Now, that's a large issue and one of the issues
covered particularly as they dealt with domestic
discretionary spending, which they did both yesterday
afternoon and yesterday evening.
 
So I think that they've touched on that aspect of
Medicaid, but they haven't gone through all the --
they haven't gone through it in the same detail and
precision on that issue as they have some of the
other areas that they've looked at. Now, that will be
covered by some of the staff work. They are going to
take some look at issues related to that as they work
over the next day and a half. They'll be preparing
some side-by-side analyses of how the different
issues play out.
 
Q Are they working from the same base numbers? 

MR. MCCURRY: They're working from the same
calculation of what the budget impact is based on CBO
numbers, yes.
 
Q What's the point of all these hours of walking
through this? It seems to me we all know what the big
differences are.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, that's not necessarily true. I
mean, everyone knows what the big differences are and
what the big numbers look like on a single sheet of
paper. But remember, every one of those large numbers
is premised on fundamental policy decisions that have
a great deal of nuance and complexity associated with
them. And I think it's encouraging and the principals
are encouraged at how detailed these discussions have
been. They have looked item by item at these policy
implications of the large numbers. 
 
I think many Americans think, well, gee, you get
together in the room and you split the difference in
a simple arithmetic. That's not policymaking.
Policymaking requires attention to the detail that
underscores each of those numbers. And that's the
work they've been doing. 
 
Now, based on the very intense discussions they've
had, the staff can now summarize in a much more
detailed fashion what the specifics of a legislative
approach to a final budget agreement would look like.
That's encouraging because it means if they do reach
an agreement on a final budget package, the work of
assembling that and putting it in legislative
language would be considerably easier based on the
discussions they've had here. In a sense, one
participant compared this to something like a
conference committee on the Hill; they're doing much
the same thing they would do in a House-Senate
conference committee, looking at big issues,
discussing the policy differences, and then making it
possible for staff to write what amounts to a
conference report.
 
Q Are they getting a sense of how far away they are
from reaching some kind of final agreement? Are they
getting a sense of the kind of time frame they're
looking at?
 
MR. MCCURRY: They could be so near or so far away
because it will depend in part on what types of
tradeoffs they make on the large issues. They have
not attempted to take the big issues, as Hillary just
said that everyone knows are out there, and reconcile
them. They've approached this from saying, let's
narrow as closely as we can the differences that
exist and define better what types of tradeoffs will
exist once you've reached those big decisions. But I
suspect that by Tuesday night when they meet again,
they're going to start moving to those more
fundamental issues that will have to be embraced if
there's going to be a final agreement, which is why
right now it's impossible to say one way or another
whether they will actually reach an agreement.
 
Q -- an agreement in the order in which they'll take
up the big issues? Because, as you've said in the
past, you would prefer that the spending and the
final decisions on spending determine the size of a
tax cut.
 
MR. MCCURRY: I don't believe -- they have given a
list of specifics to the staff to address, but I
can't say for certain that the principals will work
through those issues in the same order -- that they
go from income maintenance through health care
finance issues to discretionary spending issues to
revenue issues. But I don't guarantee that that's the
order in which they will be addressed on Tuesday
night.
 
Q Would you say that they have finished stage one,
the walk-through process, then and are getting -- are
heading into stage two, the decision-making process?
 
MR. MCCURRY: They finished the walk-through process
during the course of the day yesterday, with the
exception of the more detailed discussion of Medicare
that they wished to have today. They are now
preparing for what amounts to the tradeoffs that will
have to occur.
 
Q Is the President ready to compromise and trade off? 

MR. MCCURRY: Well, the President is ready to continue
to discuss these issues in good faith.
 
Q In what context have they discussed Social
Security?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It has been related to many of their
discussions of health care finance, Medicare in
particular, and related in some respects to their
AFDC discussions since they're all covered by the
various titles of the Social Security Act.
 
Q Did they talk about it in terms of --
 
MR. MCCURRY: They've had -- I believe they had a very
brief discussion of the CPI issue, and there was not
instant resolution of that.
 
Q You said that there's a day-and-a-half discussion
beginning on Tuesday evening that concerns --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I'm sorry, it was a day and a half for
work now. The staff is going to be working -- one of
the reasons the President wanted to spend some time
with our courageous and noble staffers is they are
now going to work for the rest of the day today and
they're apparently going to start about 9:00 a.m.
tomorrow and they'll be able to work all day long
tomorrow. That's not going to be any -- we're not
going to arrange any press coverage of that, that's
just the work they're going to be doing, both
informal and probably getting together at various
points.
 
Q Going back to -- how would you characterize the
agreement so far money-wise? You won't say $100
billion. How would you characterize it -- issue-wise,
money-wise?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, they've made good progress. It's a
large sum of money, but it's not satisfactory --
wouldn't be sufficient to reach the balanced budget
goals. That would require some additional
decision-making that obviously wouldn't happen before
Tuesday night.
 
Q Can you offer any color or anecdotal details of
today's meeting?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, they continued -- we do the best
on food more than anything else. (Laughter.) They had
the traditional congressional meeting donuts back
today, for some reason. We were on a health food kick
yesterday, but today -- normally, when the bipartisan
congressional leadership meet with the President they
have wonderful donuts available. And they reappeared
and quickly disappeared during the meeting today.
 
There was a lot of kibitzing. As the result of being
together over the couple of days, there were moments
where the partisan sides are able to tease each other
or get little quips in on each other from time to
time, and there was a fair amount of that going on. I
don't have a specific example of that that I can
think of off my head, but there's some of what I
would describe as general ribbing back and forth.
 
The Speaker was concerned that we all make sure that
--he was concerned about a question he got in the
pool session this morning and he was nervous that we
not over-interpret those -- the appearance on the
Evans and Novak Show. Some of us watched that and
some of us managed to stay awake through it.
(Laughter.)
 
Q As he shouted Ron down -- did they discuss that? As
he shouted Ron down, did he and the President then
discuss that? 

MR. MCCURRY: No, they didn't. They didn't, although
the Speaker reached that with some of us and we
didn't take any offense at his remarks.
 
Q You didn't take any offense at the remarks at all? 

MR. MCCURRY: No. Compared to other things that he
says, they -- (laughter.)
 
Q Dole and Gingrich have said before that they see
Wednesday as sort of a deadline; they're going to be
adjourning Congress and reopening Congress. Is there
any sense that you'll know by Wednesday that you're
going to have a deal or you're not going to have a
deal?
 
MR. MCCURRY: You mean on this question of federal
workers and --
 
Q No, no, no. No, over the budget deal, the budget
negotiations.
 
Q The CR would expire -- I mean, they're saying that
you're supposed to have it finished in the first
session, which is --
 
MR. MCCURRY: In the statutory and in the first
session is on Wednesday, and clearly one reason
they're meeting Tuesday night is with that deadline
in mind. But I wouldn't predict at this point it
would be possible to get an outline of agreement by
Wednesday. Certainly everyone hopes to get an
agreement on a balanced budget as quickly as
possible.
 
Q I watched the back-and-forth there. The money that
we're not supposed to put a numerical figure on
that's not necessarily $100 billion, but is something
-- what does that concern? 

MR. MCCURRY: I made that so absolutely, magnificently
impenetrable, there would be no way you could answer
that. (Laughter.) Look, the reason is as you look
through these issues it could be -- they've got --
$100 billion is a rough estimate of some of the work
that were in the so-called tier two issues that were
being handled at the budget advisors level. That's
where it has come from.
 
Now, if you look at some of the other issue areas --
the so-called tier three issues -- where they've
identified some agreement in policy approaches,
they've got considerably more than that, I would
guess. But I can't put a dollar figure on that, nor
should I, because it's subject to further discussion.
And in any event, as we've said all along again, they
have to get agreement on a whole package before it
all matters.
 
Q Tier two is what? Tier two is nonentitlement,
discretionary --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Tier one -- they've defined issues as
they worked at both the staff and budget advisor
issues as tier one, tier two, tier three issues, as
they rank order some of the policy questions. And
just, for example, in the area of revenues I think
there were, what, Barry -- 70 separate issues that
they needed to examine.
 
Now, they range from -- tier one would be something
which there is a common approach both in the balanced
budget act, in the President's approach on policy
terms that's reflected in some of the other
discussion documents they've looked at, whether it's
Breaux-Chafee, whether it's Daschle, whether it's the
coalition budget, that there's some commonality
approach and they think they can lock in language
that would satisfy everybody. So, in other words, a
done deal; it looks like that will be easy to do. 

Tier two are areas where there are differences, but
they're fairly close. They can be significant policy
issues, but there are ways in which you could bridge
the gaps. And they concentrated a lot of work on the
tier two issues. And I think that's where they found
agreement that would take you beyond this mythical
$100 billion that was reported somewhere today.
 
And then tier three issues are the more fundamental
differences that really are central to getting final
agreement. And as I say, those are ones in which they
agree to sharpen up the discussion by really looking
for how you define and analyze the tradeoffs that
would have to happen in order to reconcile those two
or three issues. But that's work that will have to go
on on Tuesday. 

Q Does it have to be balanced down to a penny? I
mean, it has to be actually -- the numbers have to be
coinciding totally?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, they -- it's more -- the more
important issue and then more of these discussions
have been around the policy has to be agreed to, how
do you -- what's the policy going to be.
 
Q Are tax cuts on the table?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Tax relief for working families has
always been on the table.
 
Q I didn't ask that. I asked would tax cuts -- 

Q When this is all finished, for each of the major
topics they talked about will there be a figure for
each of seven fiscal years that will be the limit
leading to a zero deficit? 

MR. MCCURRY: Well, when it's all said and done and
they have a final agreement they will have a document
that then can be scored by CBO that could produce
that type of analysis, sure. 

Q Going back to -- can you characterize at all this
-- without the figure, what kind of subject areas
there are agreement? How will you characterize the
areas they have agreement on? You don't want to do it
money-wise. Subject-wise, anything besides --
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, that's a -- I mean, substantively
we're not -- that just is more fuel for a lot of
incorrect speculation. And as the Speaker made the
point today, that it has helped them that they've not
tried to score points in the public discussion of
these deliberations.
 
Q I just want to clarify -- if, for purpose of
discussion the President is talking about CBO
assumptions in all of these discussions, is he then
acquiescing to CBO's growth predictions, its interest
rate predictions?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Not necessarily. I mean, that might be
that the issue of how you define assumption, will
look at assumptions -- and more importantly, how you
decided when certain budget features would trigger on
or trigger off.
 
Q I'm sorry, could you run that past me one more
time? You're saying he is not in agreement with the
CBO -- 

MR. MCCURRY: I said that -- the question is about
assumptions, has he agreed to lock in the CBO
assumptions. I think that's still an area that the
principals could explore as they look at issues like
when certain budget features trigger on, trigger off,
how you measure that and how you look at impact. For
purposes of these discussions they have agreed to a
CBO evaluation on what the budget options are. I'm
not going to get any more specific than what I just
said, although I just gave you a very good hint.
 
Q In talking about Medicare today and trying to talk
about their differences of viewpoint on medical
inflation, what are they -- whose numbers are they
utilizing?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, for an informed discussion they
use -- they were relying on budget experts at CBO, at
HHS, they were looking at different types of
analysis.
 
Q Oh, this is the last tier thing where if you save
money on discretionary in the last years then you
have to trigger off, based on if you beat the CBO
assumptions?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, trigger-on, trigger-off is an
aspect of various budget proposals that are out
there. There are some in the coalitions, there is one
in the President's most recent offer. 

Q What's he going to do at Hilton Head?
 
MR. MCCURRY: In Hilton Head he's looking forward to
seeing his friends, first and foremost; spending time
with his family; having dinner with his friends
tonight and spending some time outdoors tomorrow.
It's been raining --
 
Q What time do you expect --
 
Q Mike, will he say anything on going out to the
helicopter?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, I think he wants to just get down
there and see his friends and have New Year's Eve
with people he's spent New Year's Eve with for the
last 12 years.
 
All right, happy New Year, everybody. Have a safe and
prosperous 1996.
 
Q Did they all wish each other a happy New Year? 

MR. MCCURRY: They did. Actually, they said goodbye to
each other, happy New Year to each other. There was a
little bit of discussion about travel plans for
everybody. I think, as you know, Senator Dole after
the senate session is going up to New Hampshire. 

Q Did the President wish him well?
 
MR. MCCURRY: There was some good natured discussion.
He's going for the first eve festivities, or
something like that. I would say that there continues
to be a good atmosphere in these discussions, but
everybody is realistic enough to know that there are
sharp differences that still exist and that there's a
lot of hard work ahead.
 
Q Any idea when they're going to actually be done
with any sort of an agreement on the seven-year plan
-- to they have a time -- can't do it by Wednesday?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, I think -- I think that everyone
understands -- the President is very cognizant of the
Speaker's concern about doing this within the
statutory calendar of the first session. In fact, the
President, at several points when it was suggested
there's going to be a lot of work that would have to
be done to get this discussion document together,
that it might not be done by Tuesday, the President
admonished everybody again and said it was very hard
to ask people to work on the holiday. But that
because of the Speaker's concern about January 3rd
and that date, that it was important to have a
meeting during the day on Tuesday, even if it had to
be late in the day. So we understand the importance
of that and that's why everyone is committed to
trying to work this through as quickly as they can.
 
Q Do you think there will be meetings between the
principals Wednesday, Thursday -- every day until
there's -- 

MR. MCCURRY: I can't predict. I'm taking it a day at
a day. I'll tell you what I know, they plan to meet
Tuesday night and we'll see where we go from there.
 
Q So they have until midnight Wednesday night,
Thursday morning -- or is that --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, that's not -- I want to make it
clear that's not a -- that's a date that's important
to the Speaker, for reasons that the Speaker can tell
you because it relates to the statutory deadline of
the first session, and it also relates to the
continuing resolution issue. But I think we need --
you know, from our point of view we just need to
continue to work to try to resolve the issues and do
it as expeditiously as possible.
 
Q Is it midnight Tuesday or midnight Wednesday -- 

MR. MCCURRY: You should ask the House Speaker. It's
their deadline, not ours. 
 
Thank you.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: The returning without approval of
H.R.1530

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- The returning without
approval of H.R.1530
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

To the House of Representatives:
I am returning herewith without my approval H.R.
1530, the "National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 1996." 

H.R. 1530 would unacceptably restrict my ability to
carry out this country's national security objectives
and substantially interfere with the implementation
of key national defense programs. It would also
restrict the President's authority in the conduct of
foreign affairs and as Commander in Chief, raising
serious constitutional concerns.
 
First, the bill requires deployment by 2003 of a
costly missile defense system able to defend all 50
States from a long-range missile threat that our
Intelligence Community does not foresee in the coming
decade. By forcing such an unwarranted deployment
decision now, the bill would waste tens of billions
of dollars and force us to commit prematurely to a
specific technological option. It would also likely
require a multiple-site architecture that cannot be
accommodated within the terms of the existing ABM
Treaty. By setting U.S. policy on a collision course
with the ABM Treaty, the bill would jeopardize
continued Russian implementation of the START I
Treaty as well as Russian ratification of START II --
two treaties that will significantly lower the threat
to U.S. national security, reducing the number of
U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear warheads by
two-thirds from Cold War levels. The missile defense
provisions would also jeopardize our current efforts
to agree on an ABM/TMD (Theater Missile Defense)
demarcation with the Russian Federation.
 
Second, the bill imposes restrictions on the
President's ability to conduct contingency operations
essential to national security. Its restrictions on
funding of contingency operations and the requirement
to submit a supplemental appropriations request
within a time certain in order to continue a
contingency operation are unwarranted restrictions on
a President's national security and foreign policy
prerogatives. Moreover, by requiring a Presidential
certification to assign U.S. 

Armed Forces under United Nations operational or
tactical control, the bill infringes on the
President's constitutional authority as Commander in
Chief.
 
Third, H.R. 1530 contains other objectionable
provisions that would adversely affect the ability of
the Defense Department to carry out national defense
programs or impede the Department's ability to manage
its day-to-day operations. For example, the bill
includes counterproductive certification requirements
for the use of Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat
Reduction (CTR) funds and restricts use of funds for
individual CTR programs. 
 
Other objectionable provisions eliminate funding for
the Defense Enterprise Fund; restrict the retirement
of U.S. strategic delivery systems; slow the pace of
the Defense Department's environmental cleanup
efforts; and restrict Defense's ability to execute
disaster relief, demining, and military-to-military
contact programs. The bill also directs the
procurement of specific submarines at specific
shipyards although that is not necessary for our
military mission to maintain the Nation's industrial
base.

H.R. 1530 also contains two provisions that would
unfairly affect certain service members. One requires
medically unwarranted discharge procedures for
HIV-positive service members. In addition, I remain
very concerned about provisions that would restrict
service women and female dependents of military
personnel from obtaining privately funded abortions
in military facilities overseas, except in cases of
rape, incest, or danger to the life of the mother. In
many countries, these U.S. facilities provide the
only accessible, safe source for these medical
services. Accordingly, I urge the Congress to repeal
a similar provision that became law in the
"Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1996."
 
In returning H.R. 1530 to the Congress, I recognize
that it contains a number of important authorities
for the Department of Defense, including authority
for Defense's military construction program and the
improvement of housing facilities for our military
personnel and their families. It also contains
provisions that would contribute to the effective and
efficient management of the Department, including
important changes in Federal acquisition law.
 
Finally, H.R. 1530 includes the authorization for an
annual military pay raise of 2.4 percent, which I
strongly support. The Congress should enact this
authorization as soon as possible, in separate
legislation that I will be sending up immediately. In
the meantime, I will today sign an Executive order
raising military pay for the full 2.0 percent
currently authorized by the Congress and will sign an
additional order raising pay by a further 0.4 percent
as soon as the Congress authorizes that increase.
 
I urge the Congress to address the Administration's
objections and pass an acceptable National Defense
Authorization Act promptly. The Department of Defense
must have the full range of authorities that it needs
to perform its critical worldwide missions.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office of the Press Secretary --
Press briefing by Mike McCurry

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Press briefing by Mike
McCurry
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295 5:20 P.M. EST

MR. MCCURRY: Several people said they needed more
than the paper that you now have available, so have
at me.
 
Q I need something on the budget.
 
MR. MCCURRY: You need something on the budget? Well,
we need a budget, period, so we can put the
government back to work --

Q Gingrich said a little while ago that he thought
that maybe you should negotiate every day until they
got an agreement. Is the President willing to do
that?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I thought the idea was that they were
going to lock everyone in a room and --
 
Q That was the freshmen --
 
Q What's your reaction to all that?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Whether we would be willing?
 
Q -- marathon talks?
 
MR. MCCURRY: We would be willing to lock the
President and the Speaker, the Majority Leader and
the Democratic leaders in a room until they get a
deal so long as we could lock the House Republican
freshmen out.
 
Q I may need Q-tips, Mike, but I can't hear what
you're saying.
 
Q Can you talk up, Mike?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Their approach has not been
constructive, because they had been insisting on no
compromises. For a negotiation of that nature to work
there has to be a give-and-take attitude and a
good-faith negotiation. We keep getting -- we've got
a particularly interesting idea here from Senator
Dole and from Speaker Gingrich that we just go ahead
and accept unacceptable appropriations bills and we
can talk about it later. That's putting the cart
before the horse and allowing them the opportunity if
they so choose to get up and walk away and leave us
stuck with bills that are not in the interest of the
American people. So there's a lot of -- the President
is concerned that we're getting back into a cycle of
shenanigans here rather than serious, good-faith
negotiations that will move us forward. 
 
The President has been working hard today, as you
know. He's withheld comment on some of these more
boisterous remarks. And he just wants to work
tomorrow, see if we can make progress on budget
issues, achieve the goal of a balanced budget, and
above all else, get our government open so the
American people get their government back. The
President was disappointed today to hear that the
Republican leadership assessment is that they will
force the American people to go at least six more
days with a lack of full government services as we
negotiate these budget issues. The President has
consistently demonstrated that he is conducting these
discussions in good faith. And he believes that
that's reason enough for the Republicans in the House
of Representatives to lift this shutdown of
government services.
 
Q Mike, have you heard back from your officials who
are at the budget talks today?

MR. MCCURRY: I don't -- I believe they're still
working. At last report, they were still working. And
the only thing we've heard is that they continued to
work in a productive environment. And they continue
to focus on how they can help the decision-makers
narrow differences tomorrow.
 
Q What time is the budget advisers meeting set for
tomorrow, and where will it be held?
 
MR. MCCURRY: We believe it's going to be around 10:00
a.m., 10:30 a.m. and on the Hill, we think.
 
The Congress is hosting tomorrow, so it will up to
them to announce. But we're planning for 10:00 a.m.
to 10:30 a.m. on the budget advisers meeting. Then we
intend to host the Democratic leaders here at roughly
2:30 p.m. tomorrow; and the full principals group,
including Representative Armey, the Speaker, the
Majority Leader, who will then be joined by the
Democratic leaders at approximately 3:15 p.m., 3:30
p.m., in that neighborhood.
 
Q And do you have an agenda for those talks? Is it
going to be on narrow items or broad-ranging policy?
 
MR. MCCURRY: What the team of staff people from the
Congress and the White House have been doing are
really shaping those discussions by looking at what
the different proposals are. Remember, this is about
more than dollar figures. It's also about the
policies that underscore those numbers. When you pick
a number and put it in a budget outline, it's not a
number picked out of thin air. There are policy
assumptions that underpin those numbers. And what the
-- what we believe the staff people have been doing
is looking at where those policy differences are and
sharpening up that discussion so the budget advisers
and the principals can have a more enlightened
conversation.
 
Q Are you saying he's going to meet Dole and Gingrich
at 2:30 p.m. and then broaden the meeting?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, I'm sorry, he's going to meet with
Senator Daschle and Congressman Gephardt at
approximately 2:30 p.m., and then they'll be joined
by the rest of the group later. 

Q And, excuse me, is there a session with the
President and Panetta here before Panetta goes to the
Hill? 

MR. MCCURRY: They will be talking at some point.
We're not certain when that will happen, but we
expect Mr. Panetta back in town sometime later
tonight.
 
Q Mike, both Gingrich and Dole seem to be talking
about tomorrow's principals talks carrying over until
Saturday and maybe even beyond that. Is that an
expectation the White House has? 

MR. MCCURRY: Well, we -- we hope they're right,
because that would reflect and be some sense of
optimism, and that would indicate that they are hard
at work and moving towards the goal of a balanced
budget, which is what the President desires.
 
Q Is it incorrect to say that the President's team,
having reviewed kind of what ought to go on the
table, has some new markers to lay down or has some
new ideas?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I believe that we are prepared to have
good-faith discussions. And, you know, we're willing
to bridge differences that exist as long as there's a
willingness on the other side to reciprocate.
 
Q Has the President done anything himself today to
personally move the process along -- like has he
talked to any of the Republican leaders on the phone?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He's continued to work on this
extensively. And he would prefer that we keep any
conversations that he may have had private.
 
Q So what's he done?
 
MR. MCCURRY: What?
 
Q So what's he done if he's been working so hard? 

MR. MCCURRY: He's been working with Director Rivlin.
He's been having some conversations. He's been
working hard. 

Q Are you denying he -- I mean, how do you say it --I
mean, you prefer not to -- I mean, you're saying he's
had some, but you just won't say who?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I said I would prefer to keep any
conversations that he may have had private, at his
request. 

Q Well, we're not asking you for the -- what the
conversation is; who did he talk to?
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, he didn't --
 
Q Did he talk to Dole and Gingrich?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He would prefer that I not say.
 
Q Did he protest the fact that they don't meet again
-- the House doesn't meet again until Wednesday?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He's very concerned --
 
Q -- to them?
 
MR. MCCURRY: -- very concerned by the statements from
the Republican leaders today that made it clear that
they don't really have any intention of moving
forward to open the government before next Wednesday.
The President believes the government ought to be
reopened now. And he believes the fact that they are
involved in good-faith negotiations to balance the
budget should be reason enough for Congress to pass
the necessary continuing resolution that would reopen
the government.
 
Q Gingrich says it won't pass the House -- just the
intention.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, the Speaker -- probably a very
candid assessment of the Speaker's read of the
sentiment of some his members. But he also pointed
out that 79 members apparently can hold hostage the
majority of the House, which is unfortunate.
 
Q What was the read here on the freshmen press
conference today where they said -- they sort of took
the stance of we just want to stay and get this done;
everything's on the table and so forth? Is that a
shift in your opinion?
 
MR. MCCURRY: It was a shift from the position they
took after we met with the Speaker and the Majority
Leader and worked through a way that we could both
reopen the government and have good-faith
negotiations and developed a formula to have the
President -- remember, the President agreed with the
Speaker and the Majority Leader to have exactly those
around-the-clock discussions. And that agreement fell
apart when those same House Republican freshmen
objected. So it sounds like it's a change of tune on
their part -- 

Q But what's going on?
 
MR. MCCURRY: -- and if it's a more constructive
attitude on their part, we welcome it.
 
Q Mike, is the President willing or unwilling to
compromise on funding levels for Medicare, Medicaid
and the size of a tax cut?
 
MR. MCCURRY: The President has always indicated that
he's willing to have good-faith negotiations. And he
understands that he can't rule out compromises. On
the other hand, he has repeatedly and consistently
made clear his fundamental priorities in this
discussion. They are now a matter of law because
they're in the continuing resolution. They have been
adopted by the Congress presumably. And they include
providing and continuing necessary funding for
Medicare and Medicaid.
 
Q What is the White House expectation tomorrow
afternoon that with Gingrich and Dole saying, you
know, if we can meet for two or three days we get
this hammered out, that tomorrow afternoon will be
the beginning of long negotiations over the weekend?
I mean, what's the White House expectation?
 
MR. MCCURRY: We share their abundant hope that they
can reach that --
 
Q Dole also said he was going to New Hampshire
Sunday, so --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, I noticed that the Speaker of the
House seemed to criticize him for that, but we
certainly wouldn't. 

Q Mike, Senator Dole also talked about bringing the
welfare --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Harold, how am I doing? (Laughter.) 

Q Terrible. (Laughter.)
 
MR. MCCURRY: All right, let's wrap this up -- our
intent is to give you a full lid when we're done
here, right? Have we checked on a full lid?
 
Q Mike, Dole also said that he was thinking about
bringing the welfare bill here tomorrow in the hope
that the President might sign --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Look, welfare reform is now a subject
we've had enormous volumes of discussion about with
this Congress. They know very clearly what the
President considers welfare reform. And they know
very manifestly that this ain't it.
 
Q Mike, why did the President not go ahead and sign
the executive order on the military pay raise today?
Is there's some technical issues he's waiting --
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, he did.
 
MS. TERZANO: -- it may have been signed already. It
wasn't signed immediately because we were changing
the --
 
MR. MCCURRY: We were conforming the text and doing
some other things necessary to make sure they had an
accurate submission. But as our statement earlier
indicated, he intends to put that forward. We should
have the -- we do have the text out now. 

Q Dole started talking about sending the
appropriations back and changing them a little bit.
Is that a -- I mean, he said it before, but he's
never said about changing them. 

MR. MCCURRY: I took that idea on a little bit
earlier, Kevin. I just said that that's not -- that's
not a constructive approach here. They're asking the
President to put the cart before the horse, to accept
unacceptable appropriations bills as a condition for
having discussions -- it seems. And that's not the
environment of good faith discussions that we've had
up to this point. 

Q But if they were willing to take out some of the
provisions in some of these bills that the White
House has objected to --
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, that -- they need to do a lot to
fix these appropriation bills, and they know that.
And most of what they need to fix are very essential
to the budget discussions that are being held; that's
why the President vetoed these appropriations bills
in the first place.
 
Look, they are feeling -- and rightfully so --
feeling a great deal of heat now for keeping this
government shut for 14 days. And they're trying to
indicate that they're doing something about that and
they're suggesting that, you know, if Clinton had
just signed these appropriations bills -- and I think
the American people know the President cast these
vetoes because he can't accept what he thinks are not
in the best interests of the American people. 

Q Didn't he take the defense appropriation and veto
the authorization?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He vetoed an authorization bill for the
specific reasons that he cited.
 
Q Right, but he took the appropriation bill, even
though it was $7 billion more than he wanted.
 
MR. MCCURRY: Well, he took a defense appropriations
bill and accepted it and signed it for the reasons
that he set forth. A defense authorization bill
establishes long term national security policy; and,
in this case, very clearly would commit the President
to an unrealistic and unnecessary Star Wars program.
And also, simultaneously, various elements that
infringe on his constitutional responsibilities --
unlike an appropriations bill that provides mirror
funding for programs that have already in many cases
been authorized in law.
 
Q My understanding of the budget negotiation process
was that they were going to deal with technical,
easier to resolve issues first, and then sort of
center in on the big core issues. Is that still the
case? Or are they now going to try to deal with --
because, I guess Dole said the opposite, we need to
get these core issues resolved now, then the rest of
the stuff will fall into place fairly easily.
 
What's the expectation of the order?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I don't want to dispute the Majority
Leader's interpretation. I mean, there are
fundamental core issues that everybody understands
and they are -- there are differences that exist
there and that's where the bulk of the hard work will
have to occur -- as when they get to the principals
level. 
 
In a sense, they are working through these issues
that we hope the staff has made progress on that
today. We hope the budget advisors can make further
progress to codify some of that work tomorrow. And
then that will have to be considered by the
principals because one agreement that they do have,
based on their prior conversations, is that none of
this package can be agreed to until all the elements
are agreed to.
 
But I think what the Majority Leader was suggesting
-- look, we've got to resolve these other issues and
the other parts of the puzzle fit into the final
agreement.
 
Q What is this business on good faith? Every time
either side opens his mouth they start -- if the
other would only operate or negotiate in good faith.
Is there no good faith at this table?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, we believe there is. We don't like
some of the things that happened today publicly, but
the President chose to withhold his fire and didn't
answer back some of these more boisterous remarks.
 
Q He sent you out --
 
MR. MCCURRY: I've been very temperate.
 
Q Has the President expressed to the White House
staff his strong and irrevocable preference --
everything else being equal -- to go to Hilton Head
for at least New Year's Eve, if he can so do without
being irresponsible in deserting -- ending
negotiations?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No. He said -- you know, he said on
balance he'd like to go and have a party with his
friends on New Year's Eve. But he'll only do that if
it seems like the right thing to do and it makes
sense at the time.
 
Q Does he have --
 
MR. MCCURRY: But he doesn't sound like it's
irrevocable and he has a lust for Hilton Head that is
insatiable and incurable. (Laughter.) I wouldn't be
surprised if he goes, I wouldn't be surprised if he
doesn't go.
 
Q Saturday is he clearing the decks to stay here and
work on budget?
 
MR. MCCURRY: He plans to be here on Saturday, at this
point. He would like -- I mean, his original -- as I
told some of you, his original desire was to try to
go down to South Carolina Saturday night. But he's
willing to delay that or cancel that if it's
conducive to getting a budget agreement.
 
Q But does he expect to spend much of Saturday
working with --
 
MR. MCCURRY: You know, we have no way of knowing. I
don't -- ask me tomorrow, this time tomorrow night
and we might have a better idea.
 
Q Mike, one last one. When you said that the
President chose to withhold his fire, that makes it
sound like he was at least angry at what Dole and
Gingrich were saying?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, he just -- you know, look, they sent
welfare reform down with great fanfare today, but the
world knows where President Clinton is on reforming
welfare. He wants to do it, but he wants to do it the
right way. He doesn't want to do it in a way that
takes it out on kids and makes it harder to get
people back onto work. And everyone knows that the
President's view of welfare reform, as he clearly
stated it to the Congress, does not make it possible
for him to embrace this type of measure. 
 
So they passed this with great fanfare, as if it was
actually going to mean something. And, you know, they
know it doesn't.
 
Q Will he continue to exercise this kind of
discipline about holding his fire by keeping the pool
outside the doors to cover --
 
MR. MCCURRY: When he feels it's the appropriate thing
to do, yes. If you prefer not to have the picture we
can, you know, cancel that kind of opportunity.
 
Q Well, it was humiliating.
 
MR. MCCURRY: We try to make sure everyone doesn't
have to stay cold.
 
Q If there was this goodwill that you talked about on
both sides, is it really a two or three day process
to work this stuff up?
 
MR. MCCURRY: No, no. I mean, he -- let's not
misinterpret what the Majority Leader said. He said
we could -- he said we could get an outline by two or
three days. No, there -- because of all the work, we
hope that some of the work the staff is doing will
make it possible to get a final agreement in a form
that can be passed by Congress quicker. But that's a
lot of hard work that goes into just doing that.

And even if the principals agree to the framework of
a budget, there will be -- take some time to draft a
final measure.

Q How long -- what's a more realistic assessment of
how long it would take?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I've heard Dr. Rivlin say it would take,
you know, maybe a week. I don't think anyone has ever
pinned it down. But our hope is that some of the work
that this -- that, you know, what the staff has been
doing in the last day is looking at exactly those
types of questions: What are the policy differences
that exist in that type of measure.
 
Q I'm sorry, when you say a week, do you mean from
the time they have an outline we can expect some sort
of -- 

MR. MCCURRY: Yes, that's a rough -- I mean, that's
not -- that was just a rough estimate at one point,
and she -- you know, it would depend on the
complexity of any agreement they reached or -- you
know, getting a --
 
Q But a week to do what? I didn't quite follow you. 

MR. MCCURRY: To actually draft the bill that would
have to be passed. They just have to be put in
legislative form and -- an outline is not the same
thing as specs they can write a bill off of. But
that's apparently what we think the other folks have
been making some progress on.
 
Q But it's your understanding that once there's a
plan in hand that they'll be willing to go ahead and
do a CR, correct?
 
MR. MCCURRY: We -- based on the Speaker's comments
today, it seemed to me that -- he said that if it was
clear to members of the House that there was an
agreement, that he would be able to proceed on
unanimous consent to get a CR.
 
You know, our view is that they know that when it's
working towards this end then they ought to decouple
the question in keeping the government open. But
that's been our view all along and it's been ignored
by the House of Representatives.
 
Q Do you think their feeling the heat more than you
are?
 
MR. MCCURRY: I think everyone is feeling the heat
because this is an outrageous situation. It's been
two weeks worth of government services lost to
Americans who need them. I calculated today, there
are 32,000 American families that have got their -- 

Q Oh, here he goes.
 
MR. MCCURRY: I'll do the whole list for you.
 
Q No, no, no. You can post it. (Laughter.) 

MR. MCCURRY: But just one example: 32,000 American
families who went -- you know, the end of this year,
looking forward to next year -- in many cases
probably giving up leases on apartments because
they're moving into their first homes, don't have
anywhere to go because they can't get their FHA
mortgages closed. That's not a good situation. I
think people in this room have probably been up
against, you know, a mortgage closing before -- and
these people are losing those opportunities.
 
And that's -- you know, that's one more small slice
of life in this shutdown, not to mention all the
federal workers and their families who aren't getting
paid -- all the contractors now who are losing
services, and they'll never regain -- there's no
legislation pending in Congress that restores
contracts or restores economic livelihood to people
who provide services to the government. 

So it's a bad situation and it's -- you know, one
thing that the Speaker said today which is manifestly
true, it was all unnecessary.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: President vetoes defense
authorization bill; Raises pay for military

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- President vetoes defense
authorization bill; Raises pay for military
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

The President today vetoed the fiscal 1996 defense
authorization bill, but took steps to ensure that the
military's uniformed men and women receive the full
2.4 percent pay raise that he had requested.

The bill would have constrained the President's
ability to carry out national security policy; forced
the deployment of a costly and unnecessary ballistic
missile defense system that would threaten the ABM
treaty; and interfered with his management of key
national defense programs. Moreover, certain
provisions would have raised serious constitutional
issues by restricting the President's authority to
conduct foreign affairs and to act as Commander in
Chief.

"I am anxious to have Congress delete the
unacceptable provisions in this bill and to return it
to me for my signature," the President said.

The bill would have provided for a 2.4 percent pay
raise for uniformed men and women. In light of his
veto, the President wanted to ensure that uniformed
men and women were not harmed as he worked to resolve
differences with Congress on the bill. 

Consequently, he is issuing an Executive Order today
that provides for a 2 percent pay raise, the most
that the law allows him to do. He also is sending
legislation to Congress today to implement a full 2.4
percent pay raise, giving the military full
comparability with civilian pay raises since civil
servants benefit from locality pay increases as well.
(The legislation also would increase two pay-related
allowances for uniformed personnel -- one for
housing, the other for food).

"I welcome separate action on the pay raise; I want
it to be effective on January 1 and I will sign it as
soon as I get it," the President stated. "We are
committed to giving the troops a full pay raise and
we ought to do so immediately."

Unacceptable provisions in the authorization bill are
numerous. Among the most important are the
requirement to deploy a costly, unnecessary ballistic
missile defense system in the U.S. by the year 2003,
which would put U.S. policy on a collision course
with the ABM Treaty. Also, the bill would restrict
the President's ability to conduct contingency
operations and require certifications to Congress of
command over such operations that infringe on his
authority as Commander in Chief.

The bill also would unwisely restrict the Nunn-Lugar
Cooperative Threat Reduction programs, direct
procurement to specific contractor facilities, force
unwarranted discharge of HIV-positive service
members, and restrict the ability of female service
members and dependents of military personnel to
obtain privately-funded abortions in military
facilities overseas. 

The President did note that the bill contains
important authorities for military construction,
family housing, acquisition reform, and management of
information technology which he hoped to see return
in an acceptable bill.

Statement by the President

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Statement by the President
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Today I have signed into law House Joint Resolution
136, which ensures that the Government makes
veterans' benefit payments to 3.3 million veterans
and their survivors without further delay. 
 
The resolution also provides funding for several
vitally important programs for children and families.
It continues funding for Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC), ensuring that nearly 9
million children receive benefits vital to their
well-being. It funds child care for about 600,000
children whose parents are trying to work their way
off welfare. And it continues funding for State child
support enforcement agencies to ensure that "deadbeat
dads" do not get a reprieve from supporting their
children.
 
In addition, H.J. Res. 136 provides authority for the
District of Columbia to continue full operations. The
resolution contains an objectionable provision that
would single out poor women by prohibiting the use of
District funds for providing abortion services. I
have opposed including this provision in the regular
fiscal year 1996 District of Columbia appropriations
bill. Nevertheless, H.J. Res. 136 allows the District
government to continue to operate without disruption. 

Although I welcome H.J. Res. 136, it is a poor
substitute for what the Congress should do
immediately -- that is, send me an acceptable
continuing resolution to reopen the departments and
agencies that are at least partially shut down
because they lack fiscal year 1996 appropriations.
Along with the Departments of Veterans Affairs and
Health and Human Services, they include the
Departments of Education, Labor, Housing and Urban
Development, Commerce, Justice, State, and the
Interior; the Environmental Protection Agency; the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and
the Small Business Administration. 

To be sure, H.J. Res. 136 prevents the serious impact
that the partial shutdown could have had on 3.3
million veterans and their survivors as well as
nearly 9 million low-income children. But the
shutdown continues to hurt millions of innocent
Americans -- from the 20,000 parents and students
each day who cannot apply for student aid, to the
2,500 moderate-and low-income working families each
day who cannot get their Federal Housing
Administration (FHA) mortgage loans processed.
 
The shutdown also has forced the affected departments
and agencies to furlough a total of about 280,000
Federal employees, throwing their lives into
disruption and raising their fears just as the
holidays approach. Federal workers, who are already
being asked to do their jobs more efficiently as we
downsize the Government, deserve better.
 
The congressional majority apparently wants to use a
partial Government shutdown to force me into
accepting their extreme budget plan. It did not work
last month, when the majority prompted an earlier
shutdown by not sending me an acceptable continuing
resolution. And it will not work now. 

The Congress should send me an acceptable continuing
resolution to reopen the Government, return to work
the 280,000 Federal employees who were furloughed
through no fault of their own, provide back pay for
these workers, and give the American people the
services they expect from their Government.

-HUMMINGBIRD COMMUNICATIONS LTD: Hummingbird acquires
Intranet solution provider Common Ground Software 

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-HUMMINGBIRD
COMMUNICATIONS LTD: Hummingbird acquires Intranet
solution provider Common Ground Software Inc. --
Acquisition provides Hummingbird with advanced
portable document technologies for building
organizational Intranets and information systems
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

North York, Ontario, Canada -- Hummingbird
Communications Ltd. (TSE: "HUM" and NASDAQ: "HUMCF"),
a worldwide technology and market leader in PC to
UNIX integration software, announces that it has
acquired Common Ground Software Inc., a leading
developer of advanced electronic document
technologies for organizational Intranets (Intranet-
an internetwork of Web servers and clients within the
company firewall). 

The acquisition significantly broadens Hummingbird's
product line by adding Common Ground's premier suite
of document authoring, management, and collaborative
documentation development technologies. The addition
of Common Ground technology further enhances
Hummingbird's ability to service the future needs of
its customer base, many of whom are building
Intranets. 

Hummingbird had previously licensed Common Ground's
technology for inclusion in Columbus, Hummingbird's
Intranet/Internet desktop suite. The combination of
Columbus, an advanced Intranet desktop suite for PCs,
with Common Ground technology and Hummingbird's
existing PC internetworking software products enables
Hummingbird to offer customers a highly functional
suite of tools and applications for building
enterprise-wide information systems and
organizational Intranets. 

"Common Ground technology is the missing link in our
Intranet strategy, and will form an integral
component of our advanced Intranet desktop suite,
Columbus. Common Ground's electronic document
technology offers more than just document authoring
and archiving tools(it provides organizations with a
highly functional platform for information management
and workplace collaboration," stated Fred Sorkin,
Chairman, President, and CEO of Hummingbird.

"The whole context for electronic document technology
has been changed by the explosive growth in
networking. As a leader in internetworking
technology, Hummingbird is ideally suited to the job
of marrying Common Ground's existing technology with
Intranets," said Nick Gault, VP of Engineering and
founder of Common Ground Software.

The total purchase price, payable in cash, is
approximately US $6.0 million. Under terms of the
agreement, Common Ground's key development and other
personnel will continue to be employed by
Hummingbird.

Common Ground's product suite includes a
platform-independent electronic portable document
technology, DigitalPaper, a collaborative document
authoring environment; Intranet/World Wide Web
publishing and archival tools; and utilities that
enable legacy documentation to be easily converted to
a portable electronic document format for
enterprise-wide and/or Intranet/Internet
distribution. 

Collaborative document authoring tools were found to
be highly desirable in a recent report by Zona
Research Inc., of Redwood City California that
surveyed organizations developing Intranets.
According to International Data Corporation, of
Framingham, Massachusetts, the compound annual growth
rate for advanced Internet/Intranet suites is 39.7%,
and is expected to reach US $134.1 million by 1996. 

Hummingbird Communications Ltd. specializes in the
development of PC-to-enterprise internetworking
software products and Intranet software solutions
that provide seamless integration within corporate
networks. Hummingbird products are sold
internationally by authorized resellers in more than
40 countries. The company is headquartered in North
York, Ontario, Canada, with offices in Mountain View,
CA, Raleigh, NC, and Washington, DC in the United
States, and Geneva, Switzerland, Munich, Germany,
Paris, France, and Maidenhead, United Kingdom in
Europe.

Common Ground Software Inc., specializes in the
development of electronic document distribution,
management and collaborative authoring software for
enterprise-wide information systems and
organizational Intranets. Common Ground pioneered the
electronic document technology market with the
release of Common Ground 1.0 in 1993, which featured
DigitalPaper one of the first portable electronic
document formats. The company offers products for

-U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE: Livestock, dairy,
and poultry monthly

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
AGRICULTURE: Livestock, dairy, and poultry monthly
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Dairy Prices To Be Mixed
Average farm milk prices in 1996 are expected to rise
slightly from this year. Skim solids prices are
projected to decline as production outstrips
commercial use, largely offsetting higher milkfat
values. Prices will average above a year earlier in
first-quarter 1996 as prices adjust downward from a
higher seasonal peak this fall. But are projected to
be near a year earlier during the second and third
quarters and are not expected to reach this year's
peak in the fall.
 
The support price for manufacturing grade milk will
rise 25 cents per cwt to $10.35 effective January 1,
1996. The increase was required under current
legislation because projected 1996 net removals,
adjusted for the increase in 1994 imports from the
1986-90 average, fell just under the trigger of 3.5
billion pounds, milk equivalent, total solids basis.
This is the first triggered increase since triggers
became a common feature of dairy legislation in the
early eighties.
 
Strong export demand for butter was the main reason
the projected surplus fell below the trigger level.
However, the support purchase price for butter cannot
legally be increased. Therefore, the support purchase
price for nonfat dry milk must increase 3.1 cents to
$1.065 per pound. The support purchase price for
cheddar cheese will rise 2.5 cents to $1.145 per
pound for 40-pound blocks and $1.115 for barrels. 

The increase in the support price is not expected to
affect average milk prices much, as higher nonfat dry
milk prices are not expected to affect cheese prices
significantly. Milk prices have averaged more than
$1.50 per cwt above the support price each year since
1992.
 
The early December crash in butter prices probably
was much sharper than needed to move surplus butter
into export markets. Aided by domestic stock
building, butter prices already recovered slightly
and are expected to run 20-35 cents per pound below
November's peak. Even though milkfat currently
accounts for less than one-third of the manufacturing
value of milk, potential swings in butter prices
could affect cheese prices.
 
Cheese prices are expected to decline gradually
through early spring but probably will have to remain
high enough to attract milk away from butter-powder
operations. This will make cheese prices particularly
sensitive to butter prices and milk output in cheese
areas. 

Nonfat dry milk prices rose considerably in November,
triggered by seasonally low production and possibly
low user stocks. However, expected expansion in milk
production in 1996 and smaller allowable Dairy Export
Incentive Program (DEIP) exports will keep powder
prices weak during most of the year.
 
Since 1990, retail dairy prices have risen about 1
percent annually, less than half the increase in all
food or all consumer items. This year, prices of
manufactured dairy products rose more than fluid milk
prices, largely because of continued relatively
sizable increases in prices of frozen desserts and
miscellaneous products. Retail dairy prices are
expected to rise 1-3 percent in 1996, following an
increase of less than 1 percent in 1995. Prices of
products containing more milkfat will tend to rise
faster than skim-based products.
 
Moderate Beef Expansion Continues
Preliminary cow slaughter estimates for 1995 strongly
suggest that moderate herd expansion will continue in
1996, resulting in higher beef production at least
through 1997. In spite of the sharp downturn in
lightweight feeder cattle prices this year, cow
slaughter as a percent of the January 1, 1995,
inventory was only 13.6 percent, up only marginally
from 1994 and below the industry liquidation level of
15 percent or higher.
 
Both beef cow and heifer slaughter rose 8 percent
from 1994, indicating a slowdown in the rate of
expansion is underway. Steer slaughter, on the other
hand, was up less than 1 percent, which is somewhat
surprising given the large number of Mexican feeder
steers imported from late 1994 through this past
summer.
 
Calf slaughter increased nearly 12 percent in 1995,
reflecting this year's larger calf crop and the
dramatic decline in lightweight feeder cattle prices.
Heifer calves may have accounted for a sizable
portion of the increased calf slaughter.
 
Beef exports are expected to remain strong in 1996,
insulating the domestic market from larger beef
supplies. However, continued high grain prices,
particularly if exacerbated by drought, would force
larger beef supplies on the market and increase
downward price pressure. 

Higher grain prices and poor winter wheat grazing
prospects are putting additional pressure on lighter
weight stocker-feeder cattle prices. But favorable
forage conditions in most areas and record hay
production are allowing these cattle to remain on
pasture or forage for additional weight gain.
 
Fed cattle prices in December were down about $2 per
cwt from a year earlier, with 750- to 800-pound
feeder cattle prices down $9 and 500- to 550-pound
stocker calves down more than $22. With larger feeder
cattle supplies carried over into 1996, and a larger
expected calf crop, good planting conditions next
spring and favorable crop development next summer
will be critical if lighter stocker cattle prices are
to avoid further declines. 
 
Choice beef supplies remain tight, with retail prices
up 6 cents per pound from a year earlier in November,
reflecting the strong hotel-restaurant and export
demand. All fresh beef prices were up less than 2
cents, with prices for most non-Choice cuts used in
calculating the composite price down from a year
earlier.
 
Pork Prospects Viewed Favorably 
Rising grain and protein meal prices over the past
month will add about $3 per cwt to the cost of
producing hogs. Cash breakeven costs when these
animals are marketed in the spring will approach
$43-$45 per cwt, compared with about $40 in December.
Each 10-cent-per-bushel increase in corn prices adds
about 40 cents per cwt to the cost of producing hogs.
 
Higher grain prices have not curbed recent optimism
in hog futures contracts. In early December, the
April, June, July, and August 1996 hog futures
contract were trading near $50 or above, offering
producers an opportunity to more than cover recent
grain price increases. Corn prices would have to
approach $5 per bushel for producers to view the
current market climate as overly bearish.
 
The premium currently carried on spring futures
assumes pork production is slated to trend lower over
the next 6 months. Using historical price- supply
relationships, estimated production next spring would
have to be held to about 4.175 billion pounds. That
is 275 million pounds or about 1.5 million head below
current production/slaughter projections. This would
have to be accomplished by either reducing
September-November 1995 sow farrowings or the average
number of pigs saved per litter. 

Both cases may be argued. Pig survival rates this
fall may have been lower due to heat stress last
summer. Higher grain prices may have squeezed
operating margins and caused farrowings to fall below
reported intentions for September-November. The
December 1 Hogs and Pigs report will be released on
December 28 and should provide additional insight
into 1996 production.
 
Egg Prices Exceptionally Strong
Lower egg production in the fourth quarter has led to
sharply higher wholesale and retail prices. Wholesale
prices are continuing strong in December. The 2- to
3-percent decline in egg production this quarter
should have caused prices to rise 10-15 percent
rather than 20-25 percent. Seasonal strength during
the holidays has probably contributed to a stronger
than usual increase in prices as retailers strive to
assure supplies will be available.
 
The number of eggs in incubators on November 1 for
egg-producing birds was 13 percent higher than a year
ago. These birds will be ready to enter the laying
flock in April and May, suggesting flocks will
continue expanding next summer. A return to 1995
flock size is expected by spring, with about 1-2
percent more eggs expected to be produced in 1996.
 
Egg exports are projected to increase slightly in
1996, as egg product exports increase more than the
decline in shell egg exports. Decreases in Export
Enhancement Program funds for shell egg exports are
mandated to decline under GATT.
 
Turkey Prices Weakening
Larger cold storage stocks of turkey parts in
November and slower movement of whole birds during
Thanksgiving have contributed to seasonally declining
turkey prices. Prices remain above a year ago, but
the difference has narrowed.
 
December production is projected to decline 2-3
percent from a year earlier based on one less
slaughter day. However, weekly production during the
month will be higher due to heavier slaughter
weights. 

Cumulative placements of turkey poults for
first-quarter 1996 slaughter are fractionally above
last year. Larger increases in poult placements in
early 1996 will be necessary to reach the forecast
4-percent production increase.
 
Broiler Production Forecasts Lowered
Production estimates for early 1996 have been lowered
100 million pounds because of the impact of last
summer's heat stress on the broiler hatchery supply
flock. Production of pullets for placement in the
flock appears to have been affected. Also,
hatchability of eggs continued to lag behind normal
levels into the fall. These factors have limited
pullet placements and are expected to limit
production increases in early 1996. 

U.S. poultry exports to Hong Kong are expected to top
1 billion pounds in 1995, up over 40 percent from a
year earlier. Hong Kong is the second largest market
for U.S. poultry products. Most of these exports were
transhipped to China. However, starting in late
November, the Chinese government cracked down on
poultry imports from Hong Kong, which had been
exported illegally or undervalued to limit tariff
payments. 

U.S. poultry exports to China are growing, but are
only forecast at 80 to 90 million pounds in 1995.
These products also include broiler parts such as
wing tips, feet, and necks, as well as bone-in dark
meat.

-NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR DEMOCRACY IN MEXICO: Concern
grows over  provocation of war in Chiapas'

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR
DEMOCRACY IN MEXICO: Concern grows over  provocation
of war in Chiapas'
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

The National Commission for Democracy in Mexico is
extremely alarmed by the Mexican government's growing
efforts to provoke a war in Chiapas. While the
Zapatista indigenous communities have worked to build
cultural centers to promote the dialogue with the
national and international civil society and to
strengthen the process for peace with dignity and
justice, the Mexican military has mobilized convoys
of armaments and soldiers and sought to provoke the
Zapatistas. 

The position of the Mexican government is that the
mobilizations are maneuvers related to the normal
rotation of deployed troops. However no one in the
area believes this. For example the Congressional
Committee set up by Zedillo and Bishop Samuel Ruiz'
committee, CONAI, have been carrying out marathon
negotiation sessions with the government regarding
its provocations in Chiapas.

The United States government is complicit in what is
happening as it has continued to provide
unquestioning economic and military support to the
Zedillo government in much the same way that it
supported former President Carlos Salinas,--Zedillo's
predecessor and mentor, and who has now been linked
with one of the largest international drug cartels.
This unquestioned support for the Zedillo government
is tantamount to cover-up of serious human rights
abuses, including the lack of any action by the State
Department regarding the attack on Cecilia Rodriguez,
a US citizen who on October 26th was raped by armed
men in Chiapas as a political act of intimidation. In
large part this cover up is to hide the failure of
NAFTA and the resulting profound social and economic
upheaval in Mexico. 

In response to this critical situation, the National
Commission has organized a U.S. delegation to
Chiapas.

Originally set up to participate in the Zapatista New
Year festivities, the delegation will now also serve
as human rights observers to document the Mexican
military's provocations and violations of human
rights laws. The Commission is also preparing a
Freedom of Information Request to bring to light the
extent and nature of US involvement in the
low-intensity war in Chiapas.

Cecilia Rodriguez' New Year Message
CHALLENGE FOR 1996
THE CONSTRUCTION OF CENTERS OF RESISTANCE

"These buildings being raised represent the work of
many people. They will be a place for cultural
events, where different communities can share as
brothers, share their customs. A center where all can
walk freely, as true brothers, sharing their
happiness and their presence. A place which allows
them to have exchanges of their social life,
expressed through a song or a dance.

That is why they are important. They sustain a sense
of community, brotherhood, unity, resistance. They
are also a space where the whole world, no matter
their place of origin can be received as a brother,
regardless of whether or not they are indigenous.
Honest people who wish to participate in the path of
our people.

We have never had a center like this. We did not have
them because each community felt separated, each
followed its own path to find the solution to its
problems. But now, with this new consciousness, the
need to become organized is necessary. We must build
something together. It is the truth that before among
our people, we saw each other as enemies, or as
strangers, without relationship to one another. Now
that barrier has been broken.

There has always been a common condition, but the
circumstances of an unjust social system during so
many years made our communities feel isolated,
destroyed its social base, its values. Now we have
recovered our unity. That is why they come from many
parts, tzotziles, tzeltales, choles and tojolabales,
to collaborate in the construction of a space which
we say is for peace... we do not hide the truth..we
are speaking of peace."

Comandante David
Clandestine Indigenous Revolutionary Committee EZLN
on the construction of the Centers of Resistance,
Chiapas, Mexico, 12-27-95
by Cecilia Rodriguez

It is now the practice of the Zapatista communities
to come together in gigantic democratic assemblies.
To organize themselves into massive human chains of 4
to 500 people to travel to a distant place in order
to construct hope. Together they agree to leave
behind their "personal" lives, because they know that
hope lies in the organization of each other, and the
concentric organization of others. They are
accustomed to walking patiently for ten or twelve
hours to come to a humid, rough-hewn auditorium and
then to sit and listen to one another, without
interruption, without self-destructive emotional
outbursts that sabotage a collective discussion,
without posturing and exaggeration. It is their
practice to wait, and wait and wait until together
they can give birth to a good decision, and then it
is their practice to work together, to surrender
their "individuality" so that it is possible to carry
out that decision.

That is their proposal for a "new democracy", a
living process which has worked well for them for
hundreds of years. They are able to carry it out
because their culture builds and reclaims a set of
common values and a shared belief system. This is not
an argument for cultural superiority, it is an
acknowledgement of the strongest reason for their
success and their continued survival.

It is the dusk of the old year, another small step in
humanity's crawl towards the 21st Century. Most
natural in all of us is to stand still for a moment
and reflect on the days that have slipped through our
fingers, on the decisions and plans and thoughts that
have guided our steps. From this examination should
come wisdom, skills for the good fight in the days
that come, inspiration and strength in order to
confront the difficulties of new undertakings.

For those of us who have worked together for a peace
with dignity in Mexico each day which has passed
since January of 1994 has been filled with
uncertainty, and joy in the midst of simultaneous
pain. The hands of the clock have always spun out of
control ticking off events and changes which slip
past us like objects in the swollen river of history.

We should congratulate one another for our tenacity
in denouncing an invisible war in spite of the
studied indifference of the mass media. We have as
well managed a modicum of faith, because while time
has worn away those driven by sheer emotion and
romanticism, many of us continue to work in the
simple belief that the work itself will teach us
better ways of doing things. Sometimes, by the seat
of our pants we have managed to gather the financial
and human resources necessary in order to fight back,
in order to say to the powers-that-be "We are here!
We reject your global project! We demand, together
with the Zapatistas, the power to decide our own
destiny!"

In spite of these accomplishments; we have failed
miserably at the most important and transcendental
lesson of the Zapatistas, their sense of community,
their willingness to work at one another's and our
side and build a new global project together, their
sovereignty and sense of self and independence in the
face of projects they consider deadly to their human
nature. Our ability to understand this, to undertake
certain tasks with clarity and patience will be the
elements which will determine whether we can move
forward in our struggle for peace with dignity in
Mexico in 1996.

Together, whether we like it or not, we confront this
global economic system where financial capital is
dominant. It is the portion of the economy most
dependent upon speculation, and corruption, it feeds
on mergers, and the concentration of power. It
provokes the elimination of national borders,
identities, spheres of production and governments
creating a global environment where vast financial,
industrial and political power can be concentrated in
the hands of a few. It is a profoundly undemocratic
economic system.

Its parasitic state has deteriorated to the point
where it can no longer afford, the "benevolent
capitalism" inherent in Keynesian economics. It
regresses, returning to the dramatic contradictions
and extreme vacillations dictated by the forces of a
market "liberated" by technocrats who argue that all
this suffering is "temporary", and that, upon the
integration of certain populations into the market
the benefits will befall all who can live that long.

Civil discontent and social change is anathema to
this economic hallucination, so it invests millions
in sustaining armed forces capable of controlling the
kind of discontent inherent in starvation, misery,
and extreme poverty. Financial capital has played a
dominant role for the past 50 years in the world, and
its phenomenal impact is manifest in the pillage of
entire continents in the pursuit of a quick profit
procured through short-term investments. We live in a
world where bankers prey on its resources like hordes
of locusts. We are mostly overwhelmed by its size and
its power.

Not so the Zapatistas. As hundreds of indigenous
communities organize to construct not just one, but
many new Aguascalientes, the government and the
military watch with extraordinary fear. They fear the
continuation of this intense dialogue which they have
maintained with the world since they emerged on
January 1st of 1994. They fear that this strange
disease called dignity, and the euphoric freedom
derived from risking everything in order to find
something new, will spread.

They watch in terror as hundreds of indigenous people
traipse to and from, machete in hand, lumber on their
shoulders, and smiles on their faces. They pace and
wonder as hundreds more prepare food for the
others--they have no inkling of how to explain such
extraordinary movements. Haunted by the spectre of
their own brutality they accuse them of military
preparations--how else does one elicit victory, how
else does one win this slow and silent war? What
could possibly result from a "dialogue", from such a
cultural exchange? They await, terrified that they
will be blown up by a corrido, their skulls crushed
in by hundreds of people dancing to La Valentina--
barracks disguised as cultural centers, unarmed
children brazenly confronting their tanks and
artillery... what a danger to their omnipotence!

They parade in their tanks bristling with their
weaponry, faces scrunched beneath their concave
helmets, yelling and waving their guns "we want war,
we want war now!" --and the Zapatistas continue to
mobilize, to build, to invite people to come and
exchange ideas and hopes and proposals for a new
nation, and indeed a new world. What the hell is to
be done with them anyway?

Follow their example. Take history by the horns and
say "No 70,000 people will die as they did in El
Salvador, no 250,000 as in Bosnia...we will seek the
path of reason until all avenues are exhausted, we
will force the path of reason because there are
millions of us and a few of them, we will disable a
war driven by rage and despair." Respond to their
call, strengthen that path of reason by not leaving
them alone. Help them build these cultural centers,
these Towers of Babel where we can bow and beam at
one another because although we do not share the same
language, we share the same dream, and that makes us
silly with happiness.

The cultural centers that the Zapatistas are now
building can provide us with the opportunities and
examples we need in order to go about a new path for
peace. Some can claim that pieces of this path were
pioneered during the war against Vietnam, and the war
in Central America, but just as we learned so did the
opposition.

We must rise to the challenge of imaginative
strategies. As the first people to rebel against this
global project, the Zapatistas have also pioneered
new strategies. That is why together, we must find a
way to implement them, and allow that experience to
nurture effective international strategies. That is
why these centers of resistance are an important
investment in peace and in the future.

UPON MY RETURN TO CHIAPAS
The success of the strategy of low-intensity warfare
hinges on the continued isolation of the EZLN and its
base communities. It is clear to me that the United
States State department is complicit in this
strategy, that behind the backs of the American
people, this country participates in the preparation
of a war.

In a recent story in the National Catholic Reporter
an anonymous source in the State Department
supposedly stated that they had offered to accompany
me to file a police report with the appropriate
Mexican authorities but that "I had refused". It must
be public knowledge that there has been no such
offer, there has been no communication of any nature
between myself and the State Department in regards to
the rape I was subjected to on October 26th of 1995.
It should also be public knowledge that Todd
Robberson of the Washington Post interviewed me under
the guise of publishing a full report on the
phenomenon of rape in Chiapas a few weeks after my
return. In spite of his continual assurance that a
report would soon appear none has ever materialized.
The latest information is that Robberson's post on
the Mexico City desk has apparently ended.

The advice of books and therapists tells me that a
full year is required to recover from this kind of
trauma. It has always been my theory that the State
Department would like for Mexico to appear serene and
under control until after the next administration is
put into office. Neither party can afford another
Bosnia-like disaster on their hands. I wish it were
possible to afford a full year of recovery. I wish I
could pretend that I am separate and better than
those thousands of indigenous women who labor under
the cruelest of conditions, who hope and dream as
fervently as I do for my own children, who suffer the
continual sexual harassment of military checkpoints,
and the humiliation of body searches.

I wish I could turn my head in indifference upon
learning that the Border Patrol now constructs
"holding pens" in preparation for what they assume to
be "hordes from Mexico" escaping the chaos which the
U.S. Treasury Department itself has created. I wish
pretend the Border Patrol does not chase our people
down the street as though they were animals. I wish I
were unable to feel the deep sense of shame that
comes when I listen to the level of corruption and
the cynicism which reigns in the party-state system
of Mexico.

If there is nothing else I can do with what is left
of me, I can say to this stupidity that rules both
our countries "You have not won. You may use
psychological terror, rape, torture, death, and media
manipulation but your time is limited. Your reign is
coming to an end, its end is inevitable, because it
is illogical, unproductive, contradictary to nature
and to humanity. We have also learned about
low-intensity warfare, and reached deep into our
souls to find the spirit of those who have lived on
this earth for thousands of years, to find that human
spirit that hungers for progress and for freedom,
that values human dignity above possessions.

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-ANC: President Mandela's
message on Christmas Day
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:251295

I am delighted to speak to all South Africans on this
Christmas Day.

Just as this period of goodwill is the time to thank
the Lord for the blessings on our nation in this past
year, it is also a moment of deserved relaxation with
our loved ones, especially the children. It is a time
for sharing.

As we enjoy this great moment, we should also
remember the children who do not enjoy the care of
parents or loved ones. There are many citizens, too,
who cannot fend for themselves, confined in hospital
or disadvantaged in many other ways. Let us show them
compassion during this period and beyond.

Each one of us should draw pride from our efforts to
bring sunshine into the hearts of others.

Let this Christmas period be the time for us to renew
our commitment to work together as one nation to
build a better life for all South Africans.

I send a message of love and peace to all fellow
citizens and our friends across the globe. Let us
embrace one another and build on the spirit of
reconciliation that has become the hallmark of our
rainbow nation.

As we rejoice in the wonderful year we were blessed
with, let us pray to be peacemakers and builders of a
harmonious nation. 

Let peace reside in all our hearts!

-NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS SERVICE: Hogs and
pigs -- Highlights

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL
STATISTICS SERVICE: Hogs and pigs -- Highlights
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

U.S. Hog Inventory Up Slightly U.S. inventory of all
hogs and pigs on December 1, 1995, was 60.2 million
head. This was slightly above December 1994 but 1
percent below the September 1, 1995, inventory. This
is the highest December inventory since 1980.
Breeding inventory, at 7.13 million head, was up 1
percent from both December 1, 1994 and September 1,
1995. Market hog inventory, at 53.1 million head was
slightly above last year but 2 percent below last
quarter.

*****

Beginning March 1996 the line up of the quarterly
estimating states will include Arkansas and Oklahoma
but will exclude Tennessee. The report will contain
an estimate for the each of the quarterly states, the
17 state region, the 33 annual state region, and the
U.S. total. Mt An 4 (12-95) The September-November
1995 U.S. pig crop at 24.9 million head was 2 percent
more than 1994 and 4 percent more than 1993. Sows
farrowing during this period totaled 2.99 million
head, only 9,000 head below last year. Litter rate
increases continue at a record level, with an average
of 8.34 pigs saved per litter for the
September-November period.

Last year the litter rate averaged 8.18 pigs per
litter. Hot weather late last summer did not
significantly reduce farrowings or litter rates. This
is largely due to increased production by larger
operations with environmentally controlled facilities
which minimize the affects of adverse weather. In
addition, market hog prices, relative to corn prices,
provided little incentive for herd reduction. Pigs
saved per litter by size of operation ranged from
7.45 for operations with 1-99 hogs to 8.64 for
operations with more than 2,000 hogs and pigs.

U.S. hog producers intend to have 2.92 million sows
farrow during the December 1995-February 1996
quarter, 1 percent more than the actual farrowings
during the same period last year and 1994. Intended
farrowings for March-May 1996, at 3.31 million sows
are 2 percent above 1995 but 2 percent below the 1994
period. The December-May intentions utilize 87.4
percent of the breeding herd, compared to 87.0 for
actual farrowings last year and the 5 year average of
86.7 percent. The number of operations with hogs
totaled 182,700 during 1995, down 12 percent from
last year and 19 percent below 1993. Places with
2,000 or more hogs on hand accounted for 3 percent of
the operations and 43 percent of the inventory. A
year ago 2 percent of the operations had inventories
over 2,000 head and accounted for 37 percent of the
inventory.

Considering all hog operations, currently 6 percent
control 60 percent of the total inventory. Revisions
All inventory and pig crop estimates for 1994 and
1995 were reviewed using final pig crop, official
slaughter, import, and export data in U.S. level
balance sheets. Based on the findings of this review,
no revisions were made to the inventories for June
and September 1995 along with the 1995 March-May pig
crop. This report was approved on December 28, 1995,
by the Acting Secretary of Agriculture and the
National Agricultural Statistics Service's
Agricultural Statistics Board.

-THE WHITE HOUSE: Remarks by the President in photo
opportunity with Congressional leaders

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Remarks by the President in
photo opportunity with Congressional leaders
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:301295 11:35 A.M. EST
 
THE PRESIDENT: I want to be brief today because we're
getting off to a little late start. We've got a lot
to do. I have three things to say. I think we made a
good start yesterday, we're making progress, and I
believe we need to open the government. I hope we can
agree to do all that.
 
Q Sir, do you know any more information on the
soldier who was wounded in Bosnia?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Our reports are sketchy and I have
tried to get an update, but what I do know is that
there were apparently two vehicles and four soldiers
involved. Only one was seriously hurt and he has been
medivacked to Croatia in a hospital there, and we
understand he's in stable condition.
 
But mines have always been our biggest concern and
we're working very hard on it, but that's what
happened. And we'll continue to monitor it and do the
best we can. The mission itself is going very well.
The people have received our soldiers very well and
I'm very well satisfied with the progress. And I'm
obviously very sorry this happened, but they're
making good progress on the mine problem, but it's
going to be difficult to get rid of them all. 

Q -- the measure to get the workers back that's going
to get through Congress?
 
SENATOR DOLE: Well, it passed the House. We hope we
can pass in the Senate today, so make some progress. 
 
SENATOR DASCHLE: We tried to pass a clean CR, one
without any conditions. And that was objected to, but
I hope we can work something out.
 
Q But isn't the fact now that the Democrats are
holding things up?
 
SENATOR DASCHLE: Not at all. As a matter of fact, as
I said, we passed a continuing resolution -- we had
no conditions. It sent people back to work, and that
was objected to. So we're not trying to hold anything
up here. We hope we can get some sort of an agreement
as early as today.
 
Q Well, what's it going to take to get a deal? 

SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, let me just something. I
think the President had a right -- we're glad to have
you all in. We have a lot of work to do. We made, I
thought, real progress last night. It is not easy. We
have very significant areas we have to work on, but I
thought the spirit was very positive. We don't just
want to get the federal workers back, we want to get
them paid. And in order to do that, I think we've got
to get this whole thing worked out. But I thought we
had a great start last night. And with you all's
permission, I think we can get a lot more done in the
next few hours. 

Q Mr. President, is the message from the Democrats
basically that they don't trust you?
 
THE PRESIDENT: We've got to go to work. Thank you
very much. 
 
THE PRESS: Thank you.

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Remarks by the President
Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295 3:40 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: I want to welcome the congressional
leaders back here after Christmas. We're going to
have, I think, a good meeting today, based on the
work that has already been done this morning. I
expect us to make further progress.
 
We will begin to deal with some of the difficult
issues today involving how we can balance the budget
and protect things like Medicare and Medicaid and
education and the environment, which I think are very
important. I believe we're proceeding in good faith
and I think we're making progress.
 
I do believe that we ought to move to reopen the
government. As you know, I feel very strongly about
that. The public services will begin to be
significantly curtailed. And, of course, I'm
concerned about the federal employees -- those that
aren't working who want to work, who are going to get
paid regardless, and those who are working who
haven't gotten paid who are going to run into some
very serious financial problems with their mortgages
and other things soon. So I hope we can get some
agreement to reopen the government so that these
problems can be averted.
 
Q Is there some room for compromise now that you've
had a little bit of time to think it over over the
holidays?
 
THE PRESIDENT: Well, we're -- I've gotten a
preliminary report. I think we'll have some more
progress this afternoon and then I expect we'll work
all day tomorrow. I'm prepared to spend whatever time
it takes to move as quickly as we can move. But some
of these issues are quite complicated in terms of
their impact on the American people. But I'm ready to
go and I think that all of us are.
 
Q Mr. Speaker, do you see any way of having an
agreement that can reopen the government without the
--
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: We'll discuss it this afternoon.
And I think that Senator Dole and Congressman Armey
and I have been trying to work out a way to both get
the currently nonessential employees deemed
essential, which Senator Dole began to work on last
week after our meeting here, and also to find a way
to possibly get everyone paid. We feel strongly that
federal employees ought to be back -- all the federal
employees ought to be at work. We know they want to
be, and it's not fair to them. And we also feel
strongly we ought to try to find some way to get
everyone paid. We also have an obligation under the
continuing resolution that was adopted about six
weeks ago to get a balanced budget by next Wednesday
morning, at the latest, at the end of the first
session of Congress.
 
So I agree with the President. I think there are
reasons to be cautiously optimistic. I wouldn't
exaggerate them, but I think we've made some progress
over the last few days, and I would hope in the next
two or three days we could basically get this done
and then have everything up and running and everyone
paid for while the staff work was finished out on the
actual technical details. 

Q Let me clarify, though, sir -- is there any way to
get the people back to work without resolving a
balanced budget plan? 

SPEAKER GINGRICH: There might be a way -- yes.
 
SENATOR DOLE: Yes.
 
SPEAKER GINGRICH: We're going to explore today some
ways to get that done by unanimous consent over the
next two days. But I think it takes working it out
together, and we haven't done that yet. 

SENATOR DOLE: Just let me add that we're sending --
we're in recess now in the Senate, subject to call of
the chair, and I hope to be able to give Senator
Daschle some language to look at this afternoon. And
I want to congratulate Congressman Armey for his
leadership on the House side with the Speaker,
because if we can work this out it could be done yet
today.
 
Q And have people back to work?
 
SENATOR DOLE: Well, it would go down to the President
as quickly as we could. It's a Middle East peace
facilitation act. It's the same language we passed
last Friday in the Senate deeming people essential.
And the third element of the package would be
expedited procedure, if we get an agreement, so we
can get it through the Senate in less than 60 days, I
guess. We just take the budget reconciliation
language and shorten the time and put that in the
resolution. 

SPEAKER GINGRICH: We'll try to get that down here by
sometime this evening if we can get it all worked
out. It's all got to be done -- our system is
complicated even at best, and it takes a little
while, but we hope to get it worked out today.
 
Q President Clinton, what's your reaction to that,
sir? 

THE PRESIDENT: I think the people ought to go back to
work and I think they ought to be paid. And I think
if we don't do it we're going to see some very
serious consequences that should not -- that neither
the public, nor the public employee should have to
endure. And I think we need to keep working at this
until we get an agreement. I'm prepared to work until
we get an agreement. We've just got to keep working
through it.
 
But these are complex issues. To protect Medicare and
Medicaid, education and the environment, the things
that are at the core of the resolution we adopted,
and get the budget balanced in seven years is not
easy to do. We're going to have to work at it.
 
Q -- the Republicans rejected last time? You thought
you had an agreement on something like this and the
House Republicans rejected it?
 
Q Why did you change your position, Mr. Gingrich? 

THE PRESIDENT: Wait, wait, wait. Let's don't ask any
more questions like that. We're trying to work this
out and I think -- give us a chance to meet today and
give them a chance to do their work; let's see what
happens.

Radio address by the President to the Nation

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Radio address by the
President to the Nation
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:301295 10:06 A.M. EST
 
THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Tomorrow is New Year's
Eve, a time for celebration, friendship and hope.
Nineteen ninety-five has been a good year for our
country, and the coming year can be even better.
 
In Washington, we all know this has been a year of
serious differences and profound debate over our
nation's future direction. But if we remain true to
our values, we will prove once again that in America
we can have serious differences without leaving deep
divisions. We know our nation is strongest when we're
true to our fundamental values, giving every American
the opportunity to make the most of their lives,
remembering the duty we owe to our parents and our
children, preserving our families and our
communities, keeping America the strongest force of
peace and freedom in the world.
 
In our effort to advance these values, 1995 has been
a time of real progress and concrete achievement. The
key to our strength is economic opportunity for every
American. In 1995, the ingenuity and hard work of our
people has kept the economy growing, steady and
strong. In the past 12 months the economy created
1.75 million new private sector jobs. In every month
the unemployment rate has been below six percent. All
told, since 1993, we Americans have created nearly
eight million new jobs. The stock market has broken
every record. The deficit dropped for the third year
in a row, for the first time since Mr. Truman was
President. Long-term interest rates continue to fall,
bringing lower mortgage payments for working families
and more affordable credit for small businesses and
consumers.
 
A growing economy and lower interest rates are why a
million new Americans became homeowners for the very
first time in 1995. There were more new businesses
incorporated this year than in any previous year. And
here in Washington, in spite of all of our
differences, we made some real progress on an
important issue -- political reform. At long last,
Congress passed a law which applies to themselves the
same laws they oppose in the private sector. And at
long last, after three years of effort, the Congress
passed lobby reform legislation, banning gifts to
congressmen and requiring extensive disclosure about
the activities of lobbyists.
 
Most important, our communities all over America are
coming together around our values again. In city
after city, in state after state, violent crime is
down; the welfare and food stamp rolls are down; the
poverty rate is down; even the divorce rate is down.
And for two years in a row now, the teen pregnancy
rate has dropped.
 
It hasn't always been an easy year for America. There
have been moments that tested our national community.
In the wake of the terrible bombing in Oklahoma City,
which took the lives of 169 people, our nation
reached out and recognized the bonds that hold us
together. Out of the ashes of that tragedy a new
sense of national spirit took hold. We affirmed once
again that all Americans are in it together. We
recognized once again that we can't love our country
and hate our government.
 
And a strong America has been the world's strongest
force for freedom, peace and democracy in 1995. Our
brave men and women today are in the snows of Bosnia,
helping to uphold the peace agreement to end the
worst bloodshed in Europe since World War II. And
from the cobblestone streets of Northern Ireland to
the sands of the Middle East, a strong America has
helped to bring peace to regions long torn by strife.
 
Yes, 1995 has been a good year for America. Our
people have accomplished a lot. And it goes without
saying, we still have one major task to finish to top
off the accomplishment of this year. We have to
finish the job of balancing the budget and to do it
in the right way.
 
As you know, for the last two weeks the Congress has
refused to pass legislation that would keep the
federal government open to serve the American people.
This has never happened before for this length of
time in the whole history of the republic. And it's
been very hard on three-quarter of a million public
servants who have to pay rent and utilities and
mortgage payments and buy food. And they're losing
pay at holiday time. And it's also cut off services
for millions of Americans who depend upon them.
 
This Tuesday, if the government is not open, clean-up
efforts will be stopped cold at 32 toxic waste sites
in neighborhoods around our country. Next week,
federal funds for unemployment insurance will begin
to run out, forcing states to scramble to find ways
to keep helping workers who have lost their jobs. And
the Meals On Wheels program to our senior citizens
won't go forward. Every day, nine of 10 work place
safety complaints go unanswered. And every day 2,500
people can't get guaranteed home mortgages. Every
day, thousands of young people looking for college
loans can't apply for them. If ever we needed a
reminder that our government is not our enemy, this
is it. 

Let me be clear: I am committed to balancing the
budget. Our administration already has cut the
deficit nearly in half, and I am determined to finish
the job. For weeks I've been working in good faith
with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to find
common ground, to balance the budget in a way that
reflects our values. Yesterday I met well into the
evening with Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader
Dole. And in just a few moments I will sit down with
them again, along with the Democratic congressional
leaders.
 
We are making real progress. We know that our work is
not done. We know we have much to do, so that the
American Dream will remain alive for every citizen,
and so that we can come together as a people, and so
that America can remain the strongest force for peace
the world has ever seen.
 
So on this New Year's, let's resolve that we will
balance the budget, but that we'll do it in a way
that will keep our country growing and that will be
true to our basic values. That is, we'll balance the
budget without gutting Medicare and Medicaid, without
deeply cutting education or the environment, without
raising taxes on working families. Let's resolve to
reopen the government and do it now. And let's
resolve to act without rancor or partisan bitterness
in the spirit of the new year and in the interests of
the American people. 

Nineteen ninety-five has been a year when we've been
true to the best of America. If we'll just work hard
and work together and follow our values, 1996 can be
even better. Hillary and I want to wish you and your
families a happy and health New Year. Thank you for
listening.

(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:
On September 21, 1994, I determined and reported to
the Congress that the Russian Federation is in full
compliance with the freedom of emigration criteria of
sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. This
action allowed for the continuation of
most-favored-nation (MFN) status for Russia and
certain other activities without the requirement of
an annual waiver.
 
As required by law, I am submitting an updated report
to the Congress concerning the emigration laws and
policies of the Russian Federation. You will find
that the report indicates continued Russian
compliance with U.S. and international standards in
the area of emigration.

Christmas Eve message to the troops in Bosnia

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Remarks by the President in
Christmas Eve message to the troops in Bosnia
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:241295

THE PRESIDENT: Merry Christmas, and best wishes to
all of you on this Christmas Eve. I am honored to
speak today to the men and women of Operation Joint
Endeavor -- in Bosnia, Croatia, Hungary and Italy; on
ships at sea and skies overhead; and those preparing
to deploy. I know that all around the world Americans
who wear our nation's uniform are listening, and I
want to wish all of them well, just as I know they
wish you well as you embark on this historic mission.
 
With me today are the families of seven Americans
serving in and around Bosnia: Lieutenant Colonel Bob
Norman of the 621st Air Mobility Control Squadron in
Tuzla; Command Master Chief Jim Sirles on the USS
America in the Adriatic; Sergeant William LeBright of
the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit on board the USS
Whidbey Island; Warrant Officer Willie Wade with the
586th Assault Bridge Company; Lieutenant Colonel
O'Malley Smith of the 353rd Civil Affairs Group;
Sergeant Mark Ackerman with the 114th Public Affairs
Detachment; and Linda Carsey, an Army Civilian
Contract Specialist on her way to Tuzla.
 
These families here remind us all of the Americans
we're sending to Bosnia. They're leaving their
families behind. And many of them are already far
from their loved ones this Christmas Eve. I want to
extend a special greeting to those families today. I
know that when we call on our troops to protect
America's interests and values, we also call on their
families. Their families' special sacrifice may not
make the headlines, but we could not be successful
without it, for as our troops stand up on America's
behalf, it is their families who stand behind them,
who keep them strong with confidence, support and
love.
 
These thoughts are especially close in our minds this
time of year. As Americans come together in this
season of peace, we know that you, the men and women
of Operation Joint Endeavor, are serving on a mission
of peace, the noblest mission of all. The pride your
families have in each of you is shared by all your
fellow Americans all across our nation. 
 
Ten days ago in Paris, the presidents of Bosnia,
Croatia and Serbia signed an agreement that turns
their troubled region from war to peace. Our nation
has an important interest in seeing that peace take
hold for the people of Bosnia, who have suffered so
much for so long; for the stability of Europe, which
is so crucial to our own stability; and for the
safer, stronger world we want to leave for our
children.
 
There is too much at stake in Bosnia today for our
nation to sit on the sidelines, and that's why we've
turned to you, our men and women in uniform. You
provide us with the power to meet threats to our
security. You have the strength to bring hope and
stability to people exhausted by war. We know, and
the people of Bosnia know, that you will get the job
done and that you will do it right.
 
Each side there wants NATO to help them safeguard the
peace they have agreed to make, and to help them live
up to their commitments to one another. They trust
you to create a secure environment so they can seize
this chance to rebuild their lives and their land.
They see in you how much can be achieved when people
find strength in their diversity. That is the power
of America's example.
 
I know this will be a demanding mission, but I know,
too, that you are up to the task. General Joulwan and
General Nash have assured me of that. And I have seen
it for myself. 

Earlier this month, I visited with the men and women
of Task Force Eagle in Germany. I saw in them the
qualities that all of you share, the qualities that
have earned our nation the respect and trust of the
entire world. Your training, equipment and
preparation are unequalled. Your reputation precedes
you. The most advanced technology protects you. But
just as important, you are strong in your character.
Time and again, without pause or complaint, you step
forward to serve our nation. 
 
In this new era of challenge and change, America's
obligation to lead for peace and human dignity has
remained as important as ever. In Bosnia, you, the
men and women of our Armed Forces, will bear that
charge with great honor. You will make the difference
between horror and hope, between a war that resumes
and a peace that take hold. 
 
I am proud to be your Commander in Chief and to thank
you on behalf of your nation. Your mission of peace
and goodwill in Bosnia reminds us all what this
season is all about for all people everywhere.
 
Tomorrow, on Christmas Day, and as long as you are
there, Hillary and I will have you in our thoughts
and prayers. May God bless and protect you and your
families and bring you success and a very safe
return. And may God bless America, the nation you do
so much to serve.

-RCMS: RCMS adopts DSDM methodology to implement
client/server projects in short time scales

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-RCMS: RCMS adopts DSDM
methodology to implement client/server projects in
short time scales
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

RCMS Computing Services Limited has announced that
its team of consultants has adopted the DSDM
Consortium methodology for the implementation of
Rapid Application Development (RAD) projects. RCMS
was a founder member of the Dynamic Systems
Development ethod (DSDM) Consortium which has laid
down a framework which enables organisations to make
up to 80 per cent time savings on client/server
implementation projects. 

RCMS has carried out several successful DSDM-based
RAD projects involving over 35 consultants. Examples
include projects for BUPA, the UK's leading
independent healthcare provider and Black Horse
Relocation Services, the UK market leader in
relocation anagement.

The DSDM approach to Rapid Application Development
assumes that no implementation project is built
perfectly the first time around but that it is
possible to produce 80 per cent of a solution in a
fraction of the time it takes to produce a whole
soluti n using traditional methods. The approach
takes advantage of an iterative approach which
encourages any previous implementation step to be
revisited as business requirements change at any
stage in the project. The DSDM Consortium was formed
in November 1993 to find a way of using RAD methods
more effectively to deliver business benefits.
Version 1.0 of the DSDM RAD methodology, launched in
February 1995, draws upon the collective development
and implementati n experiences of a large number of
companies involved in IT development projects. In
addition to RCMS, other founder members include
Oracle, IBM, Abbey Life, British Airways, and
Software AG. 

RCMS Computing Services Limited is one of the UK's
fastest growing systems and services integrators. The
company recently acquired the document management
company NBI Information Management Services Limited,
as part of its corporate growth objectives. 

RCMS specialises in developing client/server
enterprise-wide solutions for the corporate
marketplace and has achieved particular success in
the financial, manufacturing, retail and oil sectors,
with customers including The Royal Bank of Scotland,
Macro Group, Eagle Star, Black Horse Relocation
Services, BUPA, Abbey National, Amerada Hess and Bass
Taverns. RCMS is a major UK partner for leading IT
organisations, including Gupta, Thomson Software
Products, Oracle, Lotus, Platinum Technology, and
Micros ft.

Radio address by the President to the Nation

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE WHITE HOUSE: Office
of the Press Secretary -- Radio address by the
President to the Nation
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:231295 10:06 A.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. As you know, I have
spent the last week in intense discussion with
congressional leaders over how to balance the budget
in seven years. It's important to balance the budget
to lift the burden of debt from future generations. 

In the last three years, we've cut our deficit in
half, and we need to finish the job. But we have to
balance the budget in a way that reflects our most
fundamental values: increasing opportunity; asking
everyone to assume responsibility; strengthening our
families and the economy; and recognizing the duty we
owe to each other -- to our parents, our children,
and those who need and deserve our help. That's how
we've reduced the deficit since I took office --
cutting unnecessary programs, reducing the size of
the federal government by 200,000, reducing red tape,
but investing in education, the environment, research
and technology, protecting Medicare and Medicaid,
reducing taxes on the hardest-pressed working
families. It's worked. It's given us more jobs, more
new businesses, low inflation, and record economic
performance in the stock market and in many other
places. 
 
Now, that's how I want to finish the job of balancing
the budget. But even as we continue talking, I hope
Congress will agree to open the government and open
all the agencies that have closed so that we can end
the financial and emotional turmoil for more than
280,000 furloughed federal employees and 460,000
working but not getting paid federal employees.
 
In the spirit of the holidays, we should do
everything we can to put these people back to work
and to resume critical services the American people
need and deserve. Just last night, I signed
legislation that Congress passed yesterday to allow
3.3 million veterans and 13 million needy children
and their mothers to receive their benefits by
January 1st. That's a good start. I hope we can
resume all services as we work together to balance
the budget. 

Our talks are making progress. Yesterday we agreed to
resume our negotiations next week with the goal of
reaching an agreement as soon as possible. I am
confident we can end this impasse and pass a
seven-year balanced budget.
 
As we look back at this year, in this season of hope,
I think we ought to take just a little time to
reflect on the progress and accomplishment of
America. It should give us real optimism that we can
finish this budget job and go on to greater things in
1996. 

Nineteen ninety-five was a year in which our country
had the opportunity and the responsibility to play
our role as the world's premier peacemaker. Our
efforts opened the door to peace in places where only
rancor and war had previously existed. As a
peacemaker, not a policeman, we have helped the peace
process finally begin to take hold in the Middle
East, while we joined the world in mourning the
tragic assassination of Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin. We have done what Prime Minister Rabin
would have wanted us to do -- we've kept moving
forward.
 
And finally, it looks like Israel and Syria will sit
together in the United States to seek a way to
resolve their differences and live together
peacefully. We're also helping to bring peace to
Bosnia. The Dayton agreement and our decision to join
in the international effort to secure the peace in
Bosnia has given the people of the former Yugoslavia
a chance to rebuild their lives. After four long
years of horrible violence, America now has the
opportunity to lead in the effort to bring lasting
peace to that war-torn country and to stabilize
Central Europe as well.
 
In Northern Ireland, I saw thousands and thousands of
children beginning to celebrate their second
Christmas season of peace. And in Haiti, they will
soon celebrate the very first peaceful transfer of
power from one democratically-elected president to
another in the history of the country. And American
leadership helped to make both those celebrations
possible.
 
The seeds of peace are also sinking deeper roots
right here in America. We just learned that last year
our murder rate dropped 12 percent, the largest
decline in 35 years. Violent crime overall is down
five percent. Now, we know our work is far from done
on too many of our mean streets -- too many of our
children still are raising themselves, not being
taught right from wrong. There is still too much
crime and violence, and it's still rising among
teenagers in many parts of the country. But we are
beginning to turn the tide. And we do know what
works.
 
Much of the success is due to efforts in communities
throughout our country to get guns off our streets
and put more police on the streets, and to give our
young people something to say yes to as well as
something to say no to. More importantly it is due to
the outpouring of grass-roots community involvement
in all these efforts in the comprehensive fight
against crime and violence. 

People are getting the message that community
policing works. And it's up to every citizen to rise
up, reach out and link arms with local police to keep
their own neighborhoods safe and their schools safe.
Now, the progress we've seen is cause for hope. We
just have to keep working on it here at home.
 
From the Middle East to Northern Ireland, to our
troops in Bosnia, to our toughest neighborhoods,
America is leading the way to peace and
reconciliation. All around the world billions of
people look to America as a model of democracy and
freedom. And we should see ourselves as others see
us. We should finish the job of balancing the budget
and reopening the government in the spirit of
cooperation and unity so that we can continue to grow
and prosper together and be a force in the world for
peace and freedom. That is the spirit of the season
and the spirit of America.
 
Let each of us resolve to do what we can to be
peacemakers. Let us bring peace to every child who
deserves to be free from violence and full of hope.
And as we celebrate the birth of a child whose only
shelter was the straw of a manger, let us remember
the words of the Prince of Peace who said, "Blessed
are the peacemakers." We ask the blessings of this
peace for everyone. That is our prayer this
Christmas.
 
Thanks for listening.

and computer monitoring software

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-CHARLES RIVER MEDIA:
Internet WatchDog - Internet and computer monitoring
software -- Charles River Media releases tool to
assist parents, teachers and employers in monitoring
appropriate use of computers and the Internet
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:261295

Rockland, MA - Charles River Media announces Internet
WatchDog for PC and Macintosh computers. Designed for
managers, parents and teachers, Internet WatchDog is
a productivity and monitoring tool for the Internet
and personal computers. Internet WatchDog does not
censor what is being displayed, rather it makes a
record for later viewing by authorized individuals.
This multipurpose utility provides detailed
monitoring of any PC or Macintosh. For the first
time, parents, teachers and employers will be able to
view the activities taking place on their computers
without arbitrarily limiting access to the Internet
or creating a false sense of security by simply
"blocking" certain sites or keywords. As new sites
are added to the Internet everyday, it is impossible
to "block" unsuitable Internet activity. Internet
WatchDog allows the parent, teacher or employer to
monitor computer use - much like a telephone bill
enables the caller to see a listing of phone numbers.

Developed by Algorithm Inc., Internet WatchDog
functions by capturing screen and other information
"intelligently" while the computer is running. You
will be able to review a grid-like screen with a
series of thumbnail screen captures. For a closer
look, you can see any screen capture full-size just
by clicking on it. In addition, Internet WatchDog
records usage of all software applications - Internet
related or other computer activity. A password is
required to access the monitoring capabilities of the
program, and any attempt to circumvent or tamper with
the Internet WatchDog is also recorded. 

Features
* Helps you monitor the complete Internet -- Internet
WatchDog shows you all activity, regardless of the
type. Visit the World Wide Web (WWW), e-mail, file
transfer protocol (FTP), gopher, Internet relay chat
(IRC), or the ever popular material in UseNet
Newsgroups -- the Internet WatchDog is alert and
ready to go;

* Compliments existing blocking software -- Internet
WatchDog can monitor your PC computing system for
access to any of the current and/or future Internet
sites containing questionable material; 

* Includes "Tips for Parents" section on children's
use of the Internet;

* Internet WatchDog will "intelligently" determine
when to take snapshots of your screen so that
regardless of the activity (whether on-line to the
Internet or not), you will know how your computer is
being used;
* Runs in the background without interruptions;

* Tamper-evident with password protection monitors
and records any attempt to disable or elude the
program;

* Records which software applications were used and
when - Internet WatchDog can help you to determine
which programs are in use on a particular system.

* Locates graphics files - Internet WatchDog scans
the extent of your hard disk to help you find
suspicious graphics files, whether or not they are
hidden!

* Learning to use Internet WatchDog is simple - the
software includes a guided tour of features and
instructions;

* Free Technical Support - 800 number or e-mail
address.

-U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE: Sugar and sweeteners
-- Situation and outlook

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
AGRICULTURE: Sugar and sweeteners -- Situation and
outlook
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Summary
World sugar production and consumption for 1995/96
are forecast at record levels of 117.9 and 116.6
million metric tons, respectively. The implied
surplus of 1.3 million tons for 1995/96, together
with a somewhat smaller surplus estimated for
1994/95, allows a modest rebuilding of global stocks
and puts downward pressure on world prices. The
surplus in 1994/95 followed 2 years of sugar
deficits.
 
Since the September Sugar and Sweetener Situation and
Outlook report, world sugar production and
consumption were revised downward by 380,000 and
450,000 tons, respectively. The modest downward
adjustment in global production reflects reduced
production prospects for the United States, India,
Pakistan, and the Philippines that more than offset
the improved outlook in Brazil, France, China, and
Thailand. Also, downward revisions in key consuming
countries such as Brazil, Russia, and Indonesia, more
than offset increased consumption prospects by other
leading sugar users, mainly Mexico and Thailand.
 
With world stocks and the stocks-to-consumption ratio
expected to rise, world prices could face downward
pressure. The spot price in late 1995 is more than 2
cents a pound below a year ago. Prices averaged 11.94
cents a pound (Contract No. 11, spot basis) in
October, 11.96 cents in November, and 12.39 cents for
the first 11 market days of December (through
December 15). 

Brazil's sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated at
a record 13.0 million tons, up 5 percent from last
season because more cane is being used for sugar and
less for fuel alcohol. The increase in sugar
production, driven by the demand for exports,
occurred in the Center-South region. Sugar production
in the Northeast is forecast unchanged from last
season. Many processing facilities that had produced
only alcohol have been converted to regular sugar
mills with annexed distilleries for fuel alcohol
production. Brazil now has 370 processing facilities
to produce sugar and/or fuel alcohol from sugarcane.
About 25 produce only sugar, about 145 produce only
fuel alcohol, and 200 produce both sugar and alcohol.
Brazil's sugar consumption is forecast at 8.1 million
tons, the highest in Latin America and the fifth
highest in the world behind only India, the European
Union (EU), the United States and China. Brazil's raw
and refined sugar exports are forecast at a record
4.8 million tons, the world's largest.
 
U.S. sugar production for fiscal 1995/96
(October-September) is forecast at 7.49 million short
tons, raw value, down 5.5 percent from the record
outturn achieved in 1994/95. U.S. sugarbeet
production is expected to total 28.9 million tons, a
decrease of 10 percent from 1994. Area for harvest,
at 1.42 million acres, is 1.2 percent below last
year. The average yield, forecast at 20.3 tons per
acre, is 1.9 tons below last year. A cool, wet spring
got the 1995 sugarbeet crop off to a poor start and
lowered expectations. Yield-reducing disease problems
in Michigan and late season harvest problems in parts
of the Great Plains and in southern Minnesota, have
caused USDA to reduce the beet sugar forecast from
the September estimate by 300,000 tons to 4.1 million
tons, raw value, 393,000 tons less than the record
1994/95 crop. 

The decline in the beet sugar forecast is partially
offset by an increase in the forecast for cane sugar
production to 3.39 million tons, up 140,000 tons from
earlier forecasts due to the improved outlook for
sugarcane yields in Louisiana and Texas. Despite
these upward revisions, the overall outlook for cane
sugar is expected to be down slightly from 1994/95,
reflecting a further contraction in the Hawaiian
sugar industry.
 
The U.S. sugar consumption forecast remains unchanged
at 9.4 million short tons, raw value, up 90,000 tons
or about 1.0 percent from 1994/95. Demand growth
appears to be running only slightly ahead of
population growth, compared with the 1.6 percent
growth rate of recent years. Reduced demand growth is
attributed to encroachment of high fructose corn
syrup (HFCS) into traditional sugar markets and
weaker demand for confectionery and bakery
products--major industrial users of sugar. Sugar use
expanded an average of 164,000 tons per year over the
last decade (fiscal 1985/86-1994/95), following the
major contraction in sugar use in the early 1980's
due to the substitution of HFCS for sugar in soft
drinks.
 
Reacting to a tight supply situation and firm prices,
the Secretary of Agriculture, on November 9,
increased the fiscal 1995/96 tariff-rate-quota (TRQ)
for raw cane sugar by 330,693 short tons (300,000
metric tons). This action raised the TRQ to 1.56
million short tons, and total supply (carryin stocks,
production, and imports) to 11.0 million tons,
comparable with the 11.1 million forecast in
September. 
 
U.S. raw cane sugar prices averaged 23.21 cents a
pound in September and 22.67 cents in October
(Contract No. 14, nearby futures), more than 1 cent
above the level for the same months in 1994. Since
the quota increase, prices have remained firm,
averaging 22.60 cents a pound for November and 22.64
cents for the first 11 market days of December. As
indicated in USDA's press release of November 9
announcing the quota change, USDA will continue
monitoring import requirements and will adjust the
TRQ accordingly. 

Total U.S. corn sweetener use is expected to reach
11.2 million tons in fiscal year 1995/96 of which
U.S. production is expected to supply 98 percent. The
United States supplements domestically produced corn
sweetener supplies with imports, mainly from Canada.
USDA forecasts HFCS consumption at 8.0 million tons,
up 3.9 percent from 1994/95. The consumption forecast
for HFCS is based on projections of deliveries from
domestic production and imports. Using a U.S.
population of 269.2 million (including Puerto Rico),
domestic HFCS use is forecast at 59.3 pounds in
fiscal 1995/96, up from 57.7 pounds for last year,
and 45.2 pounds a decade ago. Per capita sugar
consumption is forecast somewhat higher at 64.6
pounds, refined basis.

HFCS-55 and HFCS-42 list prices averaged 18.96 and
16.92 cents a pound, dry weight basis, respectively,
for the period October 1994 through May 1995. For the
June through September period, prices for HFCS-55
averaged 18.51 cents a pound, and HFCS-42 prices
averaged 16.62 cents. In the past, prices moved up
sharply during the summer due to the high demand for
HFCS from the beverage sector which pushed processing
capacity to the limit. However, this past summer,
while demand was strong due to unusually hot summer
temperatures in many parts of the country, prices did
not move up. This reflects added corn sweetener
processing capacity--as much as 25 percent according
to some estimates--that has come on line in the last
year. With the very sharp downturn in this season's
corn crop, higher HFCS prices have increased. HFCS-55
prices averaged 19.68 cents a pound in October, and
20.84 cents in November and for the first 2 weeks of
December. For fiscal 1994/95, wholesale HFCS-55
averaged 18.81 cents a pound compared with 25.26
cents for refined beet sugar. The 6.45 cent price
spread between HFCS and refined beet sugar for
1994/95 contrasts to the 2.73 cents the year before.
For fiscal 1995/96, it is likely that the price
spread between HFCS-55 and sugar will narrow
somewhat. 
 
World Sugar
Overview
World sugar production and consumption for 1995/96
are forecast at 117.9 and 116.6 million metric tons,
respectively. 1/, 2/ The implied surplus of 1.3
million tons for 1995/96, together with a somewhat
smaller surplus estimated for 1994/95, allows a
modest rebuilding of global stocks. The surplus in
1994/95 followed 2 years of sugar deficits (figure
1). With world stocks expected to be higher coupled
with a higher stocks-to-consumption ratio, world
prices could face downward pressure. Current spot
prices are 12.4 cents a pound, more than 2 cents
below a year ago. 
 
Since the September Sugar and Sweetener Situation and
Outlook report, world sugar production and
consumption were revised downward by 380,000 and
450,000 tons, respectively. The modest downward
adjustment in global production reflects reduced
production prospects for the United States, India,
Pakistan, and the Philippines that more than offset
the improved outlook in Brazil, France, China, and
Thailand. Also, downward revisions in key consuming
countries such as Brazil, Russia, and Indonesia, more
than offset increased consumption prospects by other
leading sugar users, mainly Mexico and Thailand.
 
Production
World Record Production Forecast 
 
The 1995/96 estimate of world sugar production is a
record 117.9 million tons, raw value, 2 percent above
the revised 1994/95 outturn of 115.6 million, and 1
percent above the previous record of 116.4 million
set in 1991/92. This production forecast is less than
many other analysts are forecasting because USDA
expects India's output to decline. Sugar produced
from sugarcane is estimated at a record 81.5 million
tons, up marginally from a year ago. Sugar processed
from sugarbeets is estimated at 36.4 million tons, up
5 percent from last season.
 
Over the past decade cane, sugar production has been
trending up. The expansion from an average of 66.4
million tons annually during the second half of the
1980's, to more than 80 million tons the last 2
years, is largely attributed to growth in harvested
area. In contrast, yields and recovery rates have
been fairly steady at around 60 to 61 tons per
hectare and 10 percent, respectively. For 1995/96,
USDA estimates that a record 12.8 million hectares of
sugarcane for sugar will be harvested around the
globe compared with 10.9 million in the late 1980's
(figure 2). Among the major producing countries
contributing to the global expansion have been
Australia, Brazil, India, Pakistan, and Thailand.
 
Beet sugar area, in contrast, has generally declined
to a decade low of 7.7 million hectares in 1995/96,
compared with 8.6 million in the second half of the
1980's. The downturn was largely in the Russian
Federation and Ukraine. Higher recovery rates
reflecting improved seeds, heightened use of
production inputs, and greater factory efficiencies
somewhat offset the area decline. 

Production Prospects in Selected Countries:
Mexico--Sugar production during 1995/96 is forecast
at 4.3 million tons, down 7 percent from last
season's record output of 4.6 million. The decrease
primarily reflects the return to a more normal cane
yield of 72.5 tons per hectare, following last
season's unusually high yield of 78.4 tons per
hectare.
 
Brazil--Sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated at
13.0 million tons, up 5 percent from last season
because more cane is being used for sugar and less
for fuel alcohol. The increase in sugar production,
driven by the demand for exports, occurred in the
Center-South region. Sugar production in the
Northeast is forecast unchanged from last season.
Many processing facilities that had produced only
alcohol have been converted to regular sugar mills
with annexed distilleries for fuel alcohol
production. Brazil has 370 processing facilities to
produce sugar and/or fuel alcohol from sugarcane.
About 25 produce only sugar, about 145 produce only
fuel alcohol, and 200 produce both sugar and alcohol.
 
Cuba--The 1995/96 estimate pegs sugar output at 4.0
million tons, up 21 percent from last season's 50
year low of 3.3 million. The turnaround is due to the
increased availability of inputs, such as fuel,
fertilizers, chemicals, and replacement parts for
machinery. The inputs were financed by foreign loans,
secured by the anticipated increase in sugar output. 

European Union (EU)--Sugar production during the
1995/96 season is estimated up 3 percent from last
year, to 17.0 million tons, because of a 2-percent
increase in harvested area and improved yields. In
France, sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated up
5 percent, to 4.6 million tons, accounting for 27
percent of the EU total. The increase is due to a
5-percent increase in harvested area. For the second
consecutive year, France suffered through a hot, dry
summer which hit the sugarbeet growing areas
particularly hard. This limited beet growth and
resulted in a smaller-than-average beet weight.
However, because planting conditions were nearly
ideal, a record number of beets were sown per
hectare. In Germany, the EU's second largest
producer, sugar production during 1995/96 is
estimated at 4.2 million tons, 5 percent above last
year. The upturn reflects a 3-percent increase in
harvested area and a 5-percent increase in the
average beet yield. Although the hot summer weather
throughout the EU did not cause major damage to the
bulk of the beet crop, beets grown in the sandy-soil
regions of northern and eastern Germany were
adversely affected by the heat. Rains during the
latter part of August helped to offset part of the
moisture deficit.
 
Russia--Sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated at
1.9 million tons, 15 percent above 1994/95. Sugarbeet
production for 1995/96 is forecast at 19.0 million
tons, up 36 percent from a year ago. The increase in
sugarbeet production is due to a 38-percent increase
in beet yield per hectare compared with 1994/95,
which returns Russia's average beet yield to a more
normal level.
 
Ukraine--Sugar production for 1995/96 increased from
last season's drought-reduced crop, but remains well
below pre-independence levels because of a shortage
of farm equipment, low availability and high price
for farm chemicals, and poor maintainence of
sugarbeet factories.
 
China--Sugar production for 1995/96 is estimated up 8
percent, to 6.5 million tons, because of a
significant expansion in sugarbeet and sugarcane
area. In Guangxi, the province in China that produces
the largest volume of sugarcane, the area planted to
sugarcane increased 53,400 hectares; in Yunnan,
another major producing province, planted area is up
15,400 hectares. In total, the area harvested for
sugarcane is estimated up 8 percent from last season,
and sugar from cane is estimated up 6 percent to 5.3
million tons. China's 1995/96 sugar production from
beets is estimated up 20 percent from last year to
1.2 million tons. Harvested beet area is forecast up
16 percent over last year, to 672,000 hectares. The
increase in sugarbeet area is taking place primarily
in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Provinces. With a per
hectare yield 4 times higher than that of
Heilongjiang Province, Xinjiang is expected to
replace Heilongjiang as the largest producer of
sugarbeets this year. 

India--Sugar output is forecast to decrease in
1995/96 to 15.2 million tons, down 7 percent from the
record 1994/95 sugar crop of 16.3 million tons. A
month delay in the onset of the 1995 monsoon season
in many areas, combined with variable rainfall in key
growing states will likely lower cane yields. Also,
in 1995/96, the Indian government is expected to lift
gur (crude brown non-centrifugal sugar) stock holding
limits, which will likely decrease the volume of cane
diverted to centrifugal sugar production. Moreover,
cane diversion to the production of khandsari (a low
recovery centrifugal sugar) is expected to decrease
again in 1995/96, due to reduced demand for this
product from the alcohol industry. Overall, undefined
market and policy factors, such as those that
determine the diversion of sugarcane between gur and
centrifugal sugar, including khandsari, will play a
significant role in determining the final mill sugar
production level in 1995/96. Despite the expected
downturn, India is forecast to be the world's largest
sugar producer (excluding the EU).
 
Thailand--Sugar production for the 1995/96 season is
estimated at a record 5.7 million tons, up 5 percent
from 1994/95 because beneficial rainfall is likely to
result in a record-breaking sugarcane crop of 54.0
million tons. Additionally, crop quality is improving
in Thailand as growers increasingly switch to new
varieties that have higher sucrose content. The
number of factories in Thailand remains stable at 46
because the Government banned construction of
additional mills. However, the Government has given
permission to expand crushing capacities and to
relocate mills. As a result of this policy,
Thailand's milling capacity has greatly expanded. In
addition, a number of mills have been relocated from
cane-deficit zones in the Central and Eastern regions
to cane-surplus zones in the Northern and
Northeastern regions.
 
Australia--Sugar output for 1995/96 is estimated at
4.9 million tons, down 3 percent from last season's
record of 5.1 million. The area harvested in 1995/96
is pegged at 373,000 hectares, up 9,000 hectares from
last season. However, dry weather in some growing
areas reduced the volume of sugarcane produced. And,
unseasonal rains, which closed more than half of
Australia's mills for nearly 3 weeks midway through
the processing season, reduced the sugar content of
the harvested cane. Nevertheless, the decline in
sugar production in the drought-affected southern
growing regions during 1995/96 will be more than
offset by increased production in the expanding
Burdekin and northern growing areas (figure 3).
 
Consumption
Global Consumption Forecast Lowered
World sugar consumption in 1995/96 has been revised
down to 116.6 million tons, about 450,000 tons below
the September forecast. Slower than expected growth
in domestic sugar demand in Brazil, Russia, and
Indonesia account for most of the revisions.
Nevertheless, the revised record 1995/96 world sugar
consumption forecast is 2.1 million tons or 1.8
percent above the 1994/95 estimate. Increased sugar
consumption is expected in countries in Central and
South America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. The
rise is due to a mix of factors, including lower
prices, higher consumer incomes, population growth,
and rising demand for sugar containing products such
as soft drinks and processed foods. In Asia, which
today accounts for over 30 percent of world sugar
use, sugar consumption has increased more than 20
percent over the last decade, from 27.8 million tons
in 1985/86 to a forecast of 40.0 million in 1995/96
(figure 4).
 
Over the last decade, global sugar consumption growth
has been about 1.2 percent per year, down from 2
percent from the previous decade. In contrast to the
overall growth in global sugar consumption,
year-to-year growth has been weak or non-existent in
many of the world's industrialized economies in North
America, Europe, and Japan where population growth is
slow, sugar markets are mature, and alternative
caloric sweeteners and high intensity sweeteners are
popular. For 1995/96, sugar consumption growth in the
United States is forecast at only 1 percent, while
Canada's use is expected to decline due to increased
use of lower priced corn sweeteners and a fall-off in
exports of sugar containing products. The EU's sugar
use is relatively stagnant at 14.0 million tons, as
is Japan's at 2.4 million. 
In Central Europe and the countries of the former
Soviet Union, sugar consumption forecasts are
relatively unchanged between 1994/95 and 1995/96, but
are sharply lower compared with the late 1980's or
early 1990's. Many of these formerly centrally
planned economies continue to undergo painful
economic transitions, increased retail sugar prices,
and high unemployment. 

Trade
Trade Forecast Raised
The 1995/96 world sugar trade forecast was revised up
2 percent to 31.3 million tons. Increased export
prospects in Brazil, Ukraine, Thailand, and Cuba
account for most of the higher 1995/96 sugar trade
forecast, which is almost 1 million tons more than
the revised 1994/95 trade estimates. World sugar
trade in 1994/95 was revised due to higher export
availabilities in the EU and India.
 
Larger sugar export supplies in 1995/96 in Brazil,
Thailand, Cuba, Ukraine, and Guatemala will likely
account for most of the increase in world sugar
exports this season. These countries' higher exports
should offset lower forecasts for leading exporters
such as Australia and the EU. Anticipated lower sugar
production in Australia could hamper its export
availabilities, while the need to rebuilt stocks will
limit the EU's sugar shipments. In recent years,
Brazil, Thailand, and Australia have substituted for
decreased Cuban sugar exports in world markets
(figure 5).
 
Increased sugar imports in the United States, Russia,
and the Philippines will be a major factor in the
anticipated increase in world sugar trade in 1995/96.
China will continue to be a major importer.
 
The structure of world sugar trade continues to be
highly concentrated on the export side compared with
imports. The top six exporters for 1990/91-
1994/95--EU, Australia, Brazil, Thailand, Cuba, and
Ukraine--accounted for about 70 percent of world
exports. The top six importers--Russian Federation,
EU, China, United States, Japan, and South
Korea--accounted for about 40 percent of global
imports.
 
Total sugar trade over the past decade has oscillated
within a fairly narrow band between 27 and 33 million
tons. Nonetheless, sugar continues to be among the
world's most heavily traded agricultural commodities.
In 1994/95, about 26 percent of world sugar
production was traded, compared with 5 percent of
paddy rice, 21 percent of wheat, 14 percent of corn,
and 25 percent of soybeans. In contrast, 81 percent
of coffee production was traded. By volume, the 30
million tons of sugar traded in 1994/95 was exceeded
only by wheat (96 million) and corn (58 million), and
was about equal to soybean trade (31 million).
 
Of the roughly 30 million tons of sugar traded last
year about half was raw cane sugar and the other half
refined beet and cane sugar. Major raw cane sugar
exporters are Australia, Brazil, Cuba, South Africa,
and Thailand. Their markets include the United
States, Japan, and the EU and a wide set of other
countries--some of which import raw cane sugar and
reexport refined sugar--such as China, South Korea,
and also the United States. The EU has been the major
supplier of refined sugar, but in recent years
countries such as Brazil and Turkey have become
important sources of supply. Leading markets for
refined sugar continue to be the Middle East and the
Russian Federation. Over the past decade, refined
sugar trade has grown from about 9 million tons or 35
percent of world trade to about 15 million tons or 50
percent of the global sugar market last year.
 
Stocks and Prices
USDA forecasts stocks at the end of 1995/96 at 20.8
million tons, the highest since 1992/93. The
stocks-to-use ratio is forecast at 17.9 percent, up
from a low of 16.4 percent 2 years ago (figure 6).
Prospects of large crops this year will facilitate
the rebuilding of stocks in a number of countries,
including the EU, particularly France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Argentina, Colombia, and Zimbabwe. China
and India's stocks are expected to be large, allowing
China to reduce imports and India to export.
 
World spot prices for raw sugar (f.o.b. Caribbean
contract No. 11) averaged 12.39 cents a pound for the
first 11 market days of December (through December
15), compared with 11.94 and 11.96 cents a pound in
October and November. This compares with prices a
year ago of 14.57 for the first half of December, and
12.75 and 13.88 cents for October and November. 

Prices are likely to weaken into the spring due to
the outlook for a record 1995/96 global sugar crop,
and a further buildup in world sugar stocks. A
forecast record 1995/96 crop in Thailand and reduced
sugar consumption in Russia will make them key
countries to watch. Prospects for record 1995/96
global sugar consumption, relatively low world sugar
carryover stocks, possible higher imports by Russia,
larger 1995/96 imports by the United States, and
strong Middle Eastern import demand, could provide
support to futures prices in the next few months.
 
Analyzing world sugar prices for the past decade,
USDA data indicate years of low prices--6.0 cents a
pound in 1985/86 and 1986/87--coinciding with a
build-up of world stocks and 2 years--1989/90 and
1994/95--when prices moved up to near 14 cents a
pound when stocks were drawn down. However, a major
price spike did not occur, in fact the last major
price increase occurred in 1981/82 when world prices
averaged around 23 cents a pound. USDA believes the
conditions which led to past world sugar price spikes
have been largely removed since 1982. These changes
include:
 
* The bulk of import demand on the world market is no
longer from high-income, price-inelastic countries
but from poorer, price-elastic countries; i.e., they
have to stop buying when the price rises. o Corn
sweeteners now provide a viable substitute to sugar
in many countries (such as the United States, Japan,
and Canada). High intensity sweeteners are also a
factor in the United States, Japan, Western Europe
and China (i.e. unusally high use of saccharin in
recent years in China). The increased availability of
substitutes has greatly increased the price
elasticity of sugar demand; i.e. customers can switch
to the substitute if the prices rise. o Policy reform
has occurred in many countries (such as Australia,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Eastern Europe and
Mexico) which has increased price transmission to
internal markets.
 
Previous world sugar price spikes led to expansion of
global sugar capacity and periods of relatively low
prices. If there are no future world price spikes,
there also will not be the tendency for prices to go
as low. 

Colombia: Growth in Production and Exports
by Nydia R. Suarez*
 
*The author is an agricultural economist in the
Commercial Agriculture Division, Economic Research
Service, USDA.
 
Colombia has displayed strong sugar production growth
in the last 10 years, underpinned by expanded area,
improved yields, and increased use of varieties with
high sucrose content. Production jumped from 1.2
million tons raw value in the mid-1980's to a record
2.04 million tons in 1994/95. USDA's production
forecast for 1995/96 is 2.07 million tons. This
forecast assumes normal weather conditions and
yields, and only 1 percent growth in area. Expansion
may be slowing, as Colombian producers anticipate
lower world prices in the next few years.
 
Colombia's sugar production is concentrated in the
Cauca Valley where cane is planted and harvested year
round and cane milling is spread evenly throughout
the year. Thus, a relatively small cane milling
infrastructure is needed to produce the same amount
of sugar produced in other countries, giving Colombia
a competitive advantage. Colombia, Hawaii, and Peru
are the only places in the world that cultivate
sugarcane year round, Colombia being the largest
producer. Colombian farmers have continued their
efforts to raise yields to boost overall production
with the aid of the Cenicana Research Institute.
Sugar area cannot be expanded much more without a
drop in average yields. This is why the trend toward
greater use of disease-resistant cane varieties
continues. Experts in the field forecast that by the
year 2000 more than 60 percent of the centrifugal
sugarcane area will be planted to a variety that is
highly resistant to both rust and smut diseases.
Also, cane and sugar yield for this variety are
higher than the older varieties, and sugar extraction
yields are reportedly 12 percent higher. Colombia has
one of the highest productivity rates and one of the
lowest costs in the world. Colombia has consistently
been among the world's most efficient producers and
possesses one of the world's most competitive sugar
industries. According to cost data developed by LMC
International, Colombia ranked 6th among 62 world
sugarcane producing countries during the period
1987/88-91/92. From 1979/80 to 1991/92, Colombia
enjoyed total production costs that were nearly 25
percent lower than the global cane average.
Colombia's average factory costs were the lowest in
the world in 1987/88-91/92 due to its year-round
milling. Colombia also performs well at the field
level. Average field costs in 1987/88 to 1991/92 were
the 8th lowest among 62 world sugarcane producing
countries. This compared with a ranking of 26th from
1983/84 to 1987/88.
 
Besides centrifugal sugar, Colombia produces crude,
non-centrifugal sugar called panela. Although area
planted to cane for panela is almost 2 times larger
than the area for centrifugal sugar, panela
production is only two-thirds of the amount of
centrifugal sugar. Cane for panela production is
grown mostly by small farmers using traditional
methods. Their yields cannot compare with those
obtained by large commercial producers of cane for
centrifugal sugar who have access to modern
technology, equipment, and disease resistant
varieties. 
 
Colombia's centrifugal sugar consumption for 1994/95
is estimated at 1.22 million tons, up 3 percent from
the previous year and 6 percent higher than the
1985/86-89/90 average. In addition to the population
growth, sugar use increased because sugar retail
prices increased less than the growth in the consumer
price index. For 1995/96 and the next 3-5 years,
consumption is expected to increase about 2 percent
per year, the same as the population growth rate. In
addition, Colombia consumed more than 1 million tons
of panela. This amount varies with the price of
panela vis-a-vis white sugar. In September 1991,
panela and white sugar prices were the same, but 2
years later, the panela price was 24 percent lower
and by 1995, the difference is forecast at 40
percent. Another factor that affects consumption is
the unemployment rate. As it declines consumption of
white sugar increases as disposable income increases. 
 
Colombian sugar exports currently account for about
one-third of total output. Colombia began exporting
raw sugar in 1961 when world prices were attractive
and the country had plenty of exportable sugar.
Stimulated by favorable world prices, Colombia's
sugar exports grew steadily until 1982, and then
began to fall as world prices dropped. In 1987
exports were only 96,000 tons or 55 percent lower
than the previous year. Sugar exports during 1985-89
averaged a little more than 230,000 tons per year,
with the United States receiving almost two-thirds of
the total.
 
A shift in export distribution occurred in 1991 when
the Andean-Pact countries opened their borders to
certain products, including sugar. Exports to
Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela represent more than 50
percent of Colombia's exports for 1990-94. The United
States dropped to 26 percent. In January 1992,
Colombia and Venezuela established the Andean
region's first binational custom union to apply a
common external tariff. Colombia and Venezuela's
bilateral trade accord for several agricultural
commodities was expanded by the Group of Three (G3)
Agreement to include Mexico. Under this Agreement,
the Colombian Government is negotiating with Mexico
over the possibility of exporting Colombia sugar to
Mexico duty free in exchange for a gradual reduction
of Colombian import tariffs for fruits, vegetables,
pulses, and orange juice imported from Mexico. Major
changes in Colombia's trade policy orientation are
expected from either future NAFTA accession or
participation in a Western Hemisphere Trade
Agreement.
 
U.S. Sweeteners
Overview
U.S. Sweetener Market Expands
 
The U.S. caloric sweetener complex, the world's
largest and most diverse in terms of consumer
products, continues to expand in quantity and
variety. Use of refined sugar, corn sweeteners (HFCS,
glucose, and dextrose), honey, maple syrup, and
edible molasses in 1995, will likely total 19.7
million short tons, compared with 19.3 million last
year, and 15.5 million in 1985. This expansion
reflects growth in the U.S. population (including
Puerto Rico) to over 269 million in 1995, up from 242
million in 1985; increased income; and changes in
consumer lifestyles and tastes.
 
Total per capita use of caloric sweeteners in the
United States is forecast at 148 pounds in 1995,
compared with 146 last year, and 128 in 1985. Refined
sugar use in 1995 is expected to account for 43.7
percent of the total per capita use or 64.6 pounds,
while corn sweeteners should represent 55.3 percent
or 81.8 pounds. Growth of corn sweetener use per
capita continues to outpace the growth of sugar use,
a trend established over the last decade. 

In addition, caloric sweeteners are increasingly
supplemented by high- intensity (low-calorie)
sweeteners, mainly aspartame, saccharin, and
acesulfame-k. This segment of the industry is
changing rapidly because of new uses for high
intensity sweeteners approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), the prospective introduction of
new high intensity sweeteners, and growth in the
number and availability of "light" foods sweetened
with high-intensity sweeteners.
 
Domestic supplies of sweeteners are also supplemented
with imports of sugar, HFCS, honey, maple syrup, and
aspartame. Import levels change from year- to-year,
largely based on weather-related production
conditions, prices, and Government policy. U.S.
sweeteners are also exported in significant
quantities. For calendar 1994, U.S. exports of
refined sugar totaled 480,000 tons, raw value; HFCS,
118,000 tons; honey 8.3 million pounds; and maple
syrup, 569,000 gallons. 
 
The U.S. sweetener industry also generates valuable
byproducts. From the U.S. beet and cane sugar
industry, the key byproducts are molasses, beet pulp,
and bagasse from sugarcane milling. Domestically
produced molasses is used as an animal feed. Imports
supplement domestic supplies. Imports of industrial
or feed molasses were at a record 1.8 million tons
last year, but are expected to fall in 1995 due to
increased demand and higher prices in Asia and
Europe. A large share of beet pulp production is
shipped to Asian markets. Bagasse is mainly used as
mill fuel. The corn wet milling process, in addition
to sweeteners, produces the byproducts of corn oil,
corn gluten meal, and corn gluten feed. Corn gluten
feed, in particular, has a large market in the EU.
 
U.S. Sugar
Production
Beet Sugar Production Lower
U.S. sugar production for fiscal 1995/96
(October-September) is forecast at 7.49 million short
tons, raw value, down 5.5 percent from the record
outturn achieved in 1994/95. U.S. sugarbeet
production is expected to total 28.9 million tons, a
decrease of 10 percent from 1994. Area for harvest,
at 1.42 million acres, is down 1.2 percent from last
year. The average yield, forecast at 20.3 tons per
acre, is 1.9 tons below last year. A cool, wet spring
got the 1995 sugarbeet crop off to a poor start and
lowered expectations. Yield-reducing disease problems
in Michigan and late season harvest problems in parts
of the Great Plains and in southern Minnesota, have
caused USDA to reduce the beet sugar forecast from
the September estimate by 300,000 tons to 4.1 million
tons, raw value, 55 percent of U.S. sugar production
and 393,000 tons less than the record 1994/95 crop. 

The decline in the beet sugar forecast is partially
offset by an increase in the cane sugar forecast to
3.39 million tons, up 140,000 tons from an earlier
forecast due to the improved outlook for sugarcane
yields in Louisiana and Texas. Despite these upward
revisions, the overall outlook for cane sugar is
expected to be down slightly from 1994/95, reflecting
a further contraction in the Hawaiian sugar industry.
 
Over the past decade (fiscal 1985/86 - 1994/95), the
growth trend for U.S. beet sugar production has been
128,000 tons per year, while the growth trend for
cane sugar production has been 20,000 tons per year
(figures 7 and 8). Beet sugar has increased its share
of U.S. sugar production from 49 percent in 1985/86
to a record 57 percent in 1994/95. Growth in beet
acreage in the upper Midwest States of Minnesota and
North Dakota has been a major contributing factor in
the expansion of U.S. beet sugar production (figure
9). Cane sugar's reduced share is largely due to the
sharp contraction in Hawaii's production (figure 10).
 
Developments in the Beet Sugar Producing Region
For the 1995 Crop 3/

3/ The sugarcane harvest is still underway in all
sugarcane producing States. Detailed analysis of the
crop will appear in the March 1996 Sugar and
Sweetener report.

The 1995/96 sugarbeet harvest has been completed with
the exception of the upcoming spring harvest in
California. As of mid-December, beet processors
outside California are continuing their slicing
campaigns largely from piled beets. The major
remaining threat to the crop would be possible
deterioration of sucrose levels in beet piles over
the next several months due to alternating freezing
and thawing of piles which can occur during wide
swings in temperatures. This season's harvested
tonnage and sucrose levels were adversely affected by
weather and crop disease problems. Developments in
the various growing regions are as follows:
 
Great Lakes--Sugarbeet acreage in Michigan and Ohio
for 1995/96 was 204,200 acres, up marginally from
last year due to increased acreage in Michigan that
offsets a decline in Ohio. Yields were expected to
average 16.0 tons per acre, comparable with last
year, but 4 tons below the national average. Industry
sources indicate that sucrose content was 16.4 to
17.5 percent. USDA estimates total tonnage to be
processed at 3.28 million tons. Regional sugarbeet
processing plants concentrated in the Saginaw Valley
of Michigan (five) and Fremont, Ohio (one) began
their slicing campaigns in early October and will run
through the end of January in Michigan and
mid-December in Ohio. 

Agronomically, the 1995 crop proved challenging.
Significant spring rains in April and May delayed
plantings. However, beet emergence was excellent and
combined with closer seed spacing, provided above
average beet populations. Climatic conditions through
the summer months provided below normal precipitation
and above normal temperatures. Coupled with a heavy
infestation of root aphids in the Michigan growing
area, these conditions had a negative effect on
yields and beet quality. Despite wet conditions and
temperatures that were alternately too warm or too
cold, about 80 percent of the harvest was completed
by November 1. Most of the remaining beets were
harvested under wet and freezing conditions during
the first 3 weeks of November.
 
Red River Valley and Southern Minnesota--Sugarbeet
harvested area in Minnesota and North Dakota is
estimated by USDA at a record 625,000 acres for
1995/96, up 2 percent from the previous season and
equal to 44 percent of the national beet acreage.
Yields, however, are down in Minnesota by 10 percent
to 18.5 tons per acre and 9 percent in North Dakota
to 19.3 tons reflecting generally adverse conditions
both at planting and harvest. Total beet tonnage
harvested for the two States is estimated at 11.7
million tons versus 12.7 million tons for 1994/95.
Processing of the crop is underway at six beet
factories in the Red River Valley and one at an
adjacent area in southwestern Minnesota. The last
processing plant in the region is expected to
complete its slicing campaign by mid-April.
 
In the Red River Valley the 1995 planting season
experienced a late start due to excessive soil
moisture and wet spring weather. To offset expected
yield reduction due to late plantings, acreage was
increased 3 percent. After planting was completed in
late May, warm, humid weather with frequent rains
prevailed through August and September. Reflecting
the warm and moist soil conditions, root rot diseases
such as aphanomyces and rhizoctonia were more
prevalent this year. Also, cercospora leafspot
infections were reported to be the most severe since
the early 1980's. Restricted harvest started in
mid-September and full harvest started the first week
of October. Sugar content was negatively influenced
by excessive rainfall during harvest, an early
killing frost (September 23), and heavy cercospora
pressure. 

In the southwestern Minnesota growing area, wet
conditions in the spring delayed plantings. For
example, by May 2 only 13 percent of the crop was
planted versus the normal 52 percent. As a result,
yield expectations were reduced due to a lack of
significant early planted acres. Compounding the slow
start of the crop, heavy rains during late June and
early July caused severe retardation of root
development. In the summer months, temperature and
humidity conditions were ideal for development of
cercospora leafspot. Despite multiple applications of
fungicides, significant leaf damage resulted from the
intense infection which further reduced yield and
sugar accumulation.
 
Harvest was delayed until mid-September to allow the
crop additional time to mature. October was
punctuated with additional rainstorms, and finally
three snowstorms near the final week. Several growers
were unable to complete harvest before the soil froze
to a depth of 4 to 6 inches. This resulted in
additional lost acres and reduced tonnage, not all of
which are reflected in current USDA data.
 
Northwest--The Idaho and Oregon 1995/96 sugarbeet
crops were harvested from 216,000 acres, marginally
lower than 1994/95. Yields are estimated at 25 tons
per acre, down more than 2 tons from last year. USDA
estimates beet tonnage at 4.95 million tons for
Idaho, down 12 percent from last year's record, and
464,000 tons in Oregon, comparable with last year.
The slicing campaigns got underway at the region's
four plants (three in Idaho and one in eastern
Oregon) in mid-September and are expected to be
finished by early February.
 
A wetter-than-normal spring delayed plantings
somewhat. However, the wet conditions were favorable
for germination and crop establishment, resulting in
very good stands and high per-acre populations.
Cooler-than-normal temperatures prevailed throughout
the growing season and resulted in considerably
below-normal heat unit accumulation for the season.
While this retarded crop development, it also reduced
irrigation water demand. In addition, the season's
coolness created conditions less favorable for
yield-reducing rhizomania's development. Weather
during harvest was nearly ideal, facilitating a
relatively smooth harvest season and enabling beets
to go into storage piles for processing in good
condition.
 
In addition to the traditional growing areas, the
Northwest has a relatively new growing area in the
Moses Lake section of central Washington.
Approximately 7,500 acres were harvested in the Moses
Lake area starting in mid-October. Yields are
reported to be over 30 tons per acre, reflecting the
area's highly fertile soil.
 
Since this growing area does not have a mill close
by, beets are shipped by rail to Nampa, Idaho, and
Hamilton City, California, for processing. But a
November 3 industry press release indicated that this
mode of processing will change in the near future.
Columbia River Sugar Company, a grower owned
sugarbeet production cooperative based in the Moses
Lake area, announced that it has completed
negotiations with Holly Sugar Corporation, to
construct and operate a sugarbeet factory in the
Moses Lake area. The factory's initial slicing
capacity when it commences operations in 1998 will be
6,000 tons per day, and its design provides for
incremental expansion should market conditions
warrant. This will represent the first new beet
processing plant to be built in the United States
since 1975. 
 
Great Plains--Sugarbeet production results in the
Great Plains are mixed. Regional sugarbeet area
harvested, including the States of Colorado, Montana,
Nebraska, Texas, and Wyoming, totals 250,600 acres,
down 2.6 percent from last year. Yields are expected
to be somewhat below normal for the region, averaging
19.5 tons per acre. Total sugarbeet tonnage is
estimated by USDA at 4.88 million tons, 17 percent of
the national total, and 9 percent below last year.
The beet slicing campaign began in late September at
the region's 11 processing facilities: Colorado, 2;
Nebraska, 3; Wyoming, 3; Montana, 2; and Texas, 1.
 
In Montana the growing season was marred by a cold,
wet spring which delayed the emergence of the
sugarbeet crop. Hail storms plagued the area during
the summer months and freezing temperatures in late
September kept sugar content from reaching the record
levels of recent years, and yields were 15 percent
below the most recent 5-year average. Total tonnage
for the State is estimated at 1.22 million tons, 6.6
percent below last year. 

The sugarbeet crops in northern and central Wyoming
were subject to similar spring conditions, but the
summer growing season was nearly ideal. However, in
southeast Wyoming poor spring planting conditions,
coupled with adverse weather through the growing
season adversely affected the sugarbeet crop, and
harvesting results were poor. State-wide sugarbeet
production for Wyoming is estimated at 1.30 million
tons, up 18 percent from last year. 

This season proved to be particularly difficult
agronomically in Nebraska and Colorado, with
year-to-year yields falling 19 percent to 16.5 tons
per acre in Nebraska and 17.7 tons in Colorado. In
both States a cold wet spring accented disease
problems with higher incidence of seedling stress,
fusarium, and rhizoctionia. At harvest both areas
were hard hit by frost in late September, especially
to the growing area in western Nebraska. With the
short crop, processing campaigns will wind up during
the first 2 weeks of January in both States. 
 
In the southern part of the Great Plains, very little
moisture was received in the growing area around
Hereford, Texas during the summer months. Yields were
slightly below normal and due to a fall-off in
acreage--19,500 acres this season versus a high of
41,000 in 1990--total sugarbeet production is
expected to be only 429,000 tons compared with nearby
500,000 tons last year and an average of 837,000 tons
for 1990-93.
 
California--Sugarbeet agriculture in California
spreads from the Imperial Valley on the border with
Mexico through the Central Valley and to the Klamath
Basin straddling the Oregon line. Sugarbeet acreage
harvested continues to decline in California and is
estimated at 114,000 this season, compared with
annual averages of 151,000 for the first 5 years of
the 1990's and 201,000 acres during the 1980's. The
downturn this year is explained by heavy rains last
spring which delayed plantings and caused some plant
loss, especially in the Sacramento Valley, and the
availability to growers of more remunerative
alternative crops.
 
The decline in area will be offset somewhat by yields
that are the highest in the nation at 27 tons per
acre. Total harvested tonnage from California grown
beets is estimated by USDA at 3.1 million tons, down
25 percent from 1994. Sugarbeets in California are
processed at six plants, one located in the Imperial
Valley and five others located in the Central Valley.
These plants also process sugarbeets from the Klamath
Basin in Oregon, Central Oregon, and Washington.
 
In the Imperial Valley, the beet crop got off to a
good start as soil temperature remained above average
until early spring. The 1995 April-July harvest was a
record, yielding over 5.5 tons of sugar per acre
compared with a national average of 3.0 tons per
acre. In the Central Valley, the fall tonnage and
sucrose content were slightly below average. Next
spring's crop will be short due to rain delays that
prevented planting. In addition, the State has
experienced its driest fall on record along with
unseasonably warm temperatures, and these
developments could affect yields.
 
Consumption
Sugar Use Growth Slows
The U.S. sugar consumption forecast remains unchanged
at 9.4 million short tons, raw value, up 90,000 tons
or about 1.0 percent from 1994/95. Demand is forecast
to run only slightly ahead of the 0.8 percent annual
population growth, compared with the 1.6 percent
growth rate of recent years. The lower rate of growth
is attributed to encroachment of high fructose corn
syrup into traditional sugar markets and weak demand
for confectionery and bakery products--major
industrial users of sugar. Following the major
contraction in sugar use in the early 1980's due to
the substitution of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)
for sugar in soft drinks, sugar use has expanded an
average of 164,000 tons per year over the last decade
(fiscal 1985/86-1994/95), (figure 11). 
 
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 1995 sugar
consumption is estimated at 9.34 million tons, about
the same as use in 1993/94. Industrial users' switch
from traditional stocking patterns to just-in-time
delivery systems, which may be causing a one-time
reduction in apparent sugar deliveries. Crystalline
fructose use, while small, also may be taking some
sugar markets. Reduced transfers to sugar-containing
products for export also was a factor in 1994/95.
 
Sugar deliveries for confectionery and cereal/bakery
products in 1994/95 totaled 1.88 and 1.34 million
tons, refined value, respectively. Together these two
categories accounted for 64 percent of industrial use
and were down slightly from the year before. Growth
in sugar use by the bakery/cereal and confectionery
sectors had underpinned the growth in total sugar use
in recent years. The decline in growth in these two
key use categories is attributed to sluggish demand
for cookies, sweet goods, and confectionery,
including lower confectionery exports (figure 12).
 
Trade
Sugar Import Quota Raised
Reacting to a tight supply situation and firm prices,
the Secretary of Agriculture on November 9, increased
the fiscal 1995/96 tariff-rate-quota (TRQ) for
raw-cane sugar by 330,693 short tons (300,000 metric
tons) after the release of the monthly WASDE report.
This action raised the TRQ to 1.56 million short
tons, and raised total supply (carrying stocks,
production, and imports) to 11.0 million tons,
comparable with the 11.1 million forecast in
September as the reduction in the sugar production
forecast largely was offset by the TRQ increase.
 
According to USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, TRQ
imports for the first 2 months of fiscal 1995/96
(October 1-December 1) totaled 91,116 short tons. At
the request of several countries, USDA allowed early
entry of 1995/96 TRQ sugar. These early entries,
arriving before October 1, 1995, totaled 82,960 tons.
As of December 1, 1.395 million tons of TRQ sugar
were available for entry into the United States prior
to September 30, 1996.
 
As of December 1, 1995, all but about 200 tons of the
refined sugar tariff-rate-quota for 1995/96 set at
24,251 short tons (22,000 metric tons) had been
filled. There are also specialty sugar quotas for 23
countries, each allocated 79 tons. These specialty
quotas are not usually all filled. At the present
time several countries, including Japan and United
Kingdom, are not eligible to fill their specialty
sugar import quotas, since they have failed to give
assurance that no Cuban sugar will be transhipped in
their quota.
 
Over the past decade, the United States has remained
a major importer of sugar as growth in consumption
needs has largely offset upward trending domestic
sugar production. Total U.S. sugar imports averaged
2.0 million tons annually from 1985/86-1989/90.
Imports were composed largely of TRQ imports
averaging 1.45 million tons, and 511,000 tons of
quota-exempt imports for reexport as refined sugar or
in sugar-containing products. For the period
1990/91-1994/95, U.S. sugar imports averaged 2.1
million tons of which TRQ imports accounted for 1.6
million and quota-exempt imports 548,000 tons. 

Starting October 1, 1995 the United States has a
commitment, under the Uruguay Round Agreement, to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) to allow import access
for at least 1.256 million short tons per year at the
low tariff level of the TRQ.
 
The United States also remains a small, but
consistent exporter of sugar. These exports are
largely refined sugar produced from quota-exempt raw
sugar imported, refined, and reexported. For 1994/95
total exports were 502,000 tons of which reexports
were 445,000 tons. Despite the changes in trade with
Canada, U.S. sugar reexports in 1995/96 are expected
to drop only slightly because of favorable markets
for refined sugar in other countries, and currently a
large differential between raw and refined sugar
prices on the world market. Over the last decade,
(1985/86-1994/95), U.S. sugar exports averaged
494,000 tons annually of which reexports accounted
for over 95 percent of the annual total.
 
U.S. Canada Sugar Trade Developments
On November 6, 1995, the Canadian International Trade
Tribunal (CITT) ruled that sugar imports from the
United States, certain member States of the European
Union (EU), and Korea are being dumped in Canada.
Revenue Canada found dumping and subsidies in a final
ruling in September or October. The CITT ruled in
November that the dumped and subsidized sugar
threatened to injure the Canadian sugar industry. The
CITT also found that sugar imports from the EU are
being subsidized. The investigation was initiated in
March 1995 following a petition from the Canadian
Sugar Institute, and in July, Revenue Canada
announced a preliminary finding of dumping and
subsidizing in the case and imposed provisional
anti-dumping and countervailing duties. The CITT
ruled in November that, although the imports threaten
the livelihood of Canadian sugar refiners, no damage
had yet occurred. Any duties paid since July were
refunded, but the tariffs will apply from November 6. 

The anti-dumping duties on U.S. companies exporting
sugar range from 69 to 85 percent. The duties against
Korea were dropped due to the small volume of trade
involved. It is possible that this ruling may be
appealed by parties in the United States and/or in
Canada. The ruling effectively eliminates U.S. sugar
from the Canadian market. In 1994/95 the United
States exported 158,000 tons, raw value of refined
sugar to Canada including approximately 101,000 Tons
under the reexport program.
 
Stocks and Prices
Stocks Forecast Lower
U.S. sugar stocks at the end of fiscal 1995/96
(September 30, 1996) are forecast at 1.19 million
tons, down about 3 percent from the revised estimate
for fiscal 1994/95. Stocks reflect a projected total
supply of 11.01 million tons and total use of 9.82
million. The fiscal 1995/96 stocks-to-use ratio is
forecast at 12.1 percent, compared with 12.5 percent
for 1994/95. According to USDA's stocks and price
model, a 1-percent drop in the ending stocks-to-use
ratio has historically corresponded to a 0.3-cent a
pound rise in the New York price for domestic raw
cane sugar.
 
For the year ending September 30, 1995, stocks are
estimated at 1.23 million tons. This compares with
1.45 million tons estimated in September. The 217,000
ton decline in the stock estimate can be attributed
to downward revisions in supply variables, such as
production, and upward adjustments to use variables
such as exports. From 1985/86-1994/95, end of year
stocks and the stocks-to-use ratio averaged 1.42
million tons and 15.4 percent, respectively.
 
Sugar Prices Remain Firm
U.S. raw cane prices averaged 23.21 cents a pound in
September and 22.67 cents in October (Contract No.
14, nearby futures), more than 1 cent above the level
for the same months in 1994. Since the quota
increase, prices have remained firm averaging 22.60
cents a pound for November and 22.64 cents for the
first 11 market days of December. As indicated in the
November 9 press release announcing the quota change,
USDA will continue monitoring import requirements and
will adjust the TRQ accordingly.
 
U.S. prices of raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar
have remained relatively stable over the last decade
because of the U.S. sugar program (figures 15 and
16). Raw cane sugar prices averaged 21.96 cents a
pound between 1985/86-1994/95, with a low of 20.46
cents in 1985/86 and a high of 23.29 cents in
1989/90. Wholesale refined beet sugar prices averaged
25.74 cents a pound between 1985/86-1994/95, with a
low and high of 23.30 in 1985/86 and 30.14 cents in
1989/90, respectively. U.S. retail refined sugar
prices averaged 39.31 cents annually over the 10 year
period, ranging from a low of 35.12 cents in 1986/87
to a high of 43.08 cents in 1990/91. The spreads
between the low and high years for raw cane sugar
were 2.45 cents a pound, for wholesale refined beet
sugar 6.85 cents, and for retail refined sugar 7.96
cents.
 
Costs
New USDA Estimates on Processing Costs
In the winter and spring of 1994-95, ERS contacted
all beet and cane sugar processors to collect
processing cost information for the 1992 crops. Based
on these data, processing costs for the 1993 and 1994
crops have been estimated and previously published
processing costs for 1992 have been revised. For
beets, the traditional East (Red River Valley and
eastward) and West (all other) processing regions
have been maintained. For cane, however, Louisiana
and Texas have been combined to prevent disclosure of
confidential accounting data for the one factory in
Texas.
 
In fiscal 1993/94, a record 4.55 million tons of raw
beet sugar were produced, an 11-percent increase over
1993. Costs of processing this sugar rose 3.6
percent, averaging $35.06 per net ton sliced.
However, after accounting for credits for byproducts,
net processing costs averaged $26.50, a 2.7-percent
drop from 1993. This difference is explained by
increased returns from pulp and molasses offsetting
higher, primarily fixed, processing costs. Similar
relationships were found on a cents-per-pound basis.
Total processing costs rose in 1994 but were offset
by higher credits, even with a slight drop in sugar
recovery.
 
Over the 1992-94 period, total costs per ton of beets
sliced were consistently higher in the East than in
the West. However, this can be offset by the higher
sugar recovery rates in the East. On a
cents-per-pound basis, total beet sugar processing
costs were lower in the East. In 1994, recovery rates
narrowed and, while recovery was still higher in the
East, processing costs per pound of sugar were lower
in the West. 

Raw cane sugar production for fiscal 1993/94 was up
nearly 2 percent. U.S. total processing costs for the
1994 sugarcane crop averaged $19.22 per ton, up 2.3
percent from 1993. Most of the increase was due to
increases in the costs of materials and supplies for
cane transportation and factory repairs and
maintenance. On a cents-per-pound basis, costs rose
even more (5.1 percent) due to a 2.7-percent drop in
the average sugar recovery rate. 

There was considerable cost variation across the
major sugarcane regions. Florida is the major
producer and had costs of 6.98 cents per pound,
compared with Louisiana/Texas costs of 8.26 cents and
Hawaii costs of 11.345 cents. On a percentage basis,
Louisiana/Texas had the largest increase for the year
due to a nearly 9 percent drop in recovery rate.

After subtracting credits for molasses and other
byproducts, net processing costs ranged from 6.30
cents in Florida to 9.3 cents in Hawaii, averaging
7.22 cents at the U.S. level.
 
Adjustment to Production Costs
USDA has revised its sugarcane costs and returns
estimates published in the Sugar and Sweetener report
in September to account for yields on a net ton per
harvested acre basis rather than a gross ton basis.
This change will bring the estimates into conformity
with yield estimates published by USDA's National
Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in Crop
Production reports. 

The change has two effects:
* Gross value of production (price times yield) was
revised to reflect the change in yield. This also
affects the returns estimates which are the
difference in gross value of production and either
total cash expenses or total economic costs.
 
* Costs for land were reduced in the Louisiana-Texas
region. This is due to a change in the share rent
cost which is based on the imputed gross value of
production. Per acre cash costs were not affected.
 
The estimates for 1994 still remain preliminary in
that regional sugarcane prices will not be published
by USDA until January, 1996. When 1994 prices are
published, estimates will be revised to reflect the
new estimates. Until then, 1994 prices have been kept
at their 1993 levels.
 
USDA's latest costs of sugar crop production and
processing estimates, as well as sugar crop loan
rates, are provided in tables 31-39. 

U.S. Sugar Import Duties 1/
by Ron Lord*
 
1/ The words duty and tariff are used
interchangeably.

U.S. import duties on sugar agreed to during the
Uruguay Round negotiations of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) generally became
effective on January 1, 1995. 
 
October 1, 1995, the United States has agreed to set
an access level for sugar imported under the low duty
and the time period of the import quotas is fixed as
of October 1 through the following September 30. The
minimum low-duty tariff-rate-quota (TRQ) for raw cane
sugar is 1.231 million short tons, and for refined
sugar, 24,251 short tons, raw value. With either the
raw or refined sugar quotas, the Secretary of
Agriculture may reserve a TRQ quantity for the
importation of specialty sugars as defined by the
United States Trade Representative. The Secretary of
Agriculture has authority to set a TRQ higher (but
not lower) than the above minimum levels. For
example, on November 9, 1995, the Secretary announced
an increase in the raw cane sugar import TRQ for
1995/96 of 331,000 tons above the minimum level.
 
The low duty for raw cane sugar under quota, as
determined under Additional U.S. Note 5 of Chapter 17
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United
States (HTSUS), is 0.625 cents a pound, raw value.
This duty is waived for countries under the
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the
Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and the ANDEAN
trade pact. Thus the low duty on TRQ imports is
waived for all countries currently allocated a share
of the U.S. sugar import quota except Australia,
Brazil, Gabon, and Taiwan. There is a polarization
adjustment (i.e. an adjustment of the duty for
quality differences) on the low duty. For the
purposes of subheadings 1701.11 and 1701.12, "raw
sugar" means sugar whose content of sucrose by
weight, in the dry state, corresponds to a
polarimeter reading of less than 99.5 degrees.
 
The low duty for refined sugar under the quota is
1.66 cents a pound for 100-degree sugar. There is a
polarization adjustment for refined sugar testing
less than 100 degrees.
 
Any amounts of sugar imported in excess of the
announced TRQ levels pay the high duty. The high duty
is based upon a tariff equivalent to the quotas in
place during the period 1986-88, and is scheduled to
decline by 15 percent over 6 years to the year 2000.
For raw cane sugar, the base period duty was
established at 18.08 cents a pound, and the first 2
-percent reduction which took effect January 1, 1995,
resulted in a duty of 17.62 cents a pound for 1995.
The duty will fall to 15.36 cents a pound in the year
2000. The high duty on refined sugar is about 1 cent
higher, and will fall to 16.21 cents a pound in the
year 2000. There is no polarization adjustment for
the duties on sugar imported above the TRQs, but the
United States is considering a technical revision of
the HTSUS to provide for such polarization
adjustments. 

U.S. duties on sugar imports from Mexico are covered
under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
which became effective January 1, 1994. The duty on
Mexican sugar imported under the access provisions of
NAFTA is zero, and the duty for sugar above the
access provisions is 15.20 cents a pound in 1995.
This NAFTA high duty will decline to zero by the year
2008. 

Sugar imports from Canada are composed entirely of
refined beet sugar, since Canada's export control
regime only allows domesically produced sugar to be
exported. Sugar imported from Canada under the
provisions of HTSUS Additional Note 5 faces a duty of
0.20 cents a pound in 1995, and this will fall to
zero in 1998 as agreed to in the U.S.-Canada Free
Trade Agreement which became effective in 1989. The
available TRQ for refined sugar for 1995/96 is 22,426
tons, which is the announced total TRQ for refined
sugar of 24,251 tons minus 1,825 tons set aside for
specialty sugar allocations for 23 countries. In
fiscal 1996, this refined sugar TRQ is available on a
first-come, first-served basis.
 
Duties on HFCS between the United States and Canada
are low and scheduled to decline to zero in 1998. The
Mexican duty on HFCS from the United States is
scheduled to decline from a base of 15 percent (prior
to the implementation of NAFTA in 1994) to zero over
10 years, and in 1995 is 12 percent. Between October
1, 1990 and January 1, 1995 sugar imports from Canada
were not subject to quota. 
 
World and U.S. Corn Sweeteners
World Production
World Production Growing But
Remains Highly Concentrated
The world's leading non-sucrose caloric sweetener is
high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). HFCS is a liquid
sweetener which can be produced from a variety of
feedstocks provided they contain sufficient amounts
of starch. The most prominent source of starch in the
United States is corn, but some producers in Asia use
sweet potatoes or tapioca. In Europe, wheat and
potatoes are also used as starch feedstocks.
 
Globally, HFCS first started to make an economic
impact in the mid-1970's when sugar prices soared and
new technologies became available. The global sugar
price boom of the mid-1970's provided a much needed
protective umbrella for the first attempts to produce
HFCS on an industrial scale. Global sugar prices
boomed again in the early 1980's, at about the same
time that further major technological breakthroughs
occurred and proved that this alternative caloric
sweetener was commercially attractive even when lower
sugar prices prevailed.
 
While sugar prices have historically been the leading
reference value for determining the market
penetration of HFCS, sugar and HFCS are not perfect
substitutes. For example, sugar has a number of
bulking, texture, and browning characteristics which
make it the sweetener of choice for the
confectionery, bakery, and cereal industries.
World-wide, HFCS is competing primarily with liquid
sugar in carbonated soft drinks. The availability of
HFCS in liquid form creates constraints for storage
and trade. Transport of HFCS is costly and therefore
trade has been restricted to short-distance
exchanges.
 
According to leading international sweetener
analysts, some combination of five prerequisites are
usually necessary for successful development of an
HFCS industry.
* Import status for sugar and a high internal price
for sugar o Sufficient supplies of starch at a
reasonable net price o Well developed food production
and consumption infrastructure o Capital for
investment in research and development (R&D) and
plant and equipment
* Favorable government policy
 
A decade ago world HFCS production was estimated at
5.4 million metric tons, dry basis. By 1987,
production had expanded to 6.8 million tons, and for
1995 the forecast is 9.4 million tons, up 22 percent
since 1990. Globally, production remains
concentrated, with the United States accounting for
75 percent (7.1 million metric tons) of the world
total in 1995, Japan 8 percent (750,000 tons), and
the EU 3 percent (303,000 tons), followed by Canada,
Korea, Argentina and Taiwan at between 2 and 3
percent each. Together these seven countries are
expected to account for 96 percent of global HFCS
production this year.
 
While this year-to-year growth in global HFCS
production has been significant, its production and
use remains small compared with sugar. For example,
USDA's global sugar consumption forecast for 1995/96
is 117 million metric tons versus 9.4 million for
HFCS. Moreover, the outlook for the short run is that
the substitution of HFCS for sugar will remain
confined to a small set of countries and largely to
liquid sweetener markets. 

U.S. Production
U.S. Corn Crop Lower;
Corn Sweetener Output Continues To Grow
 
The 1995/96 (September/August) U.S. corn crop is
estimated at 7.37 billion bushels, down 27 percent
from the record high 1994 corn crop, due to reduced
area and lower yields. According to USDA's November
Crop Production report, 1995/96 corn harvested
acreage is estimated at 64.8 million, down 11 percent
from last year. The reduction reflects prolonged wet
conditions in the Midwest this spring which prevented
some plantings and delayed others. Based on
conditions as of November 1, the average corn yield
is forecast at 113.7 bushels per acre compared with a
record 138.6 bushels in 1994/95. The sharp decline is
due to a very hot dry summer in many leading
production States as well as production losses this
fall. For example, yield estimates were reduced in
Kansas due to damage from early frost. In Nebraska
and some other areas, high winds led to reports of
lodging and ear droppage. With generally favorable
conditions, farmers made rapid progress harvesting
corn in October. As of November 5, 87 percent of the
crop was harvested in the 17 major producing States
accounting for 94 percent of estimated production.
This compares with an average of 74 percent.
 
This year is shaping up as one of the tightest ever
for U.S. corn. With importers' buying continuing at a
breakneck pace, limited corn supplies and higher
prices are expected to have a larger impact on
domestic users despite strong potential demand.
 
According to the December World Agriculture Supply -
Demand Estimates (WASDE) report, domestic corn use
for 1995/96 is forecast at 6.28 billion bushels, with
feed and residual use taking 73 percent or 4.58
billion bushels, and food, seed, and industrial (FSI)
use the remainder, 1.70 billion bushels. Within the
FSI use sector, the corn grind for corn sweeteners is
forecast at a record 705 million bushels, 19.7
million short tons, up 1.7 percent from 1994/95. Corn
sweeteners represent about 9.6 percent of the
forecast domestic use of the 1995/96 crop, and 41
percent of FSI use. Over the last decade, corn use
for sweeteners have climbed from around 500 million
bushels annually to a record of over 700 million
expected this year. 

U.S. corn sweetener production in fiscal 1995/96
(October/September) is forecast to total 12.1 million
tons, dry basis, up 3.9 percent from the year that
ended September 30. This forecast reflects expanded
industry capacity and is based on recent growth
trends. Figure 19 provides a detailed flow-chart of
the corn wet-milling process yielding corn
sweeteners. 

HFCS production is forecast at 8.1 million tons, dry
basis, up 4.2 percent from 1994/95 and accounting or
about two-thirds of expected total corn sweetener
production for the coming year. For fiscal 1994/95,
HFCS production totaled 7.8 million tons, up 4.4
percent from the corresponding period in 1993/94.
 
Glucose syrup and dextrose are the other primary corn
sweeteners produced by the U.S. corn wet milling
industry. Combined glucose and dextrose production
for fiscal 1995/96 is forecast at 4.0 million tons.
This is up 125,000 tons from the fiscal 1994/95
estimate and accounts for about a third of total
expected corn sweetener production during fiscal
1995/96.
 
U.S. Consumption
HFCS Use Higher
Total U.S. corn sweetener use is expected to reach
11.2 million tons of which U.S. production is
expected to supply 98 percent. The United States
supplements domestically produced corn sweetener
supplies with imports, mainly from Canada. USDA
forecasts HFCS consumption at 8.0 million tons, up
3.9 percent from 1994/95. The consumption forecast
for HFCS is based on projections of deliveries from
domestic production and imports. On a per capita
basis, and using a U.S. population of 269.2 million
(including Puerto Rico), domestic HFCS use is
forecast at 59.3 pounds in fiscal 1995/96, up from
57.7 pounds for last year, and 45.2 pounds a decade
ago. Glucose syrup and dextrose deliveries are
forecast at 3.3 million tons, up 2.6 percent from
1994/95.
 
HFCS deliveries for fiscal 1994/95 totaled 7.68
million tons, up 3.5 percent from the preceding year.
HFCS-55 use is driven largely by demand by the
nonalcoholic beverage sector which normally accounts
for 90 percent of its total use. Tables 44 and 45
provide a breakout of HFCS-55 and HFCS-42 use by
major food use categories and beverages. For HFCS-55,
there appears to be only small growth in food
categories such as processed foods; with beverages
remaining the leading category of use. HFCS-42
depends on beverages for only about 40 to 45 percent
of its total use. Other food use categories in total
are more important and expanding, especially use in
processed foods, and the cereal and bakery category.
For 1995, soft drink use growth is estimated at 3 to
4 percent, somewhat below increases in recent years.
While summer soft drink use was reported to be
strong, price increases--mainly due to increased
costs for plastic and aluminum packaging--earlier in
the year dampened demand somewhat.

U.S. Prices and Costs
HFCS Prices Remain Low Through Summer
HFCS-55 and HFCS-42 list prices averaged 18.96 and
16.92 cents a pound, dry weight basis respectively,
for the period October 1994 through May 1995. For the
June through September period, prices for HFCS-55
averaged 18.51 cents a pound and for HFCS-42, prices
averaged 16.62 cents. Normally, prices move up
sharply during the summer due to the high demand for
HFCS from the beverage sector and because of tight
processing capacity. However, this past summer, while
demand was strong due to unusually hot summer
temperatures in many parts of the country, prices did
not move up. This reflects added corn sweetener
processing capacity, as much as 25 percent according
to some estimates, that came on line in the last
year. With the very sharp downturn in this season's
corn crop, HFCS prices have increased.
 
HFCS prices are consistently lower than refined sugar
in the U.S. market. For the 10 year period
1985/86-1994/95, wholesale HFCS prices averaged 20.76
cents a pound, dry basis, compared with 25.74 cents
for refined beet sugar. This price spread of nearly 5
cents is one major reason for the substitution of
HFCS for sugar in beverage and certain food markets.
Moreover, these HFCS prices are "list prices" and
likely do not reflect significant price discounts
received by major buyers.
 
Fundamental also to the growth of the corn sweetener
industry in the United States has been the abundant
availability of corn coupled with its relatively low
cost. The cost of corn as a raw material input can be
viewed either on a gross or net basis. The
wet-milling process creates three valuable
byproducts: corn gluten feed, corn gluten meal, and
corn oil. Sale of these byproducts generates revenues
that reduce the gross cost of corn. When corn prices
rise, so usually do the byproduct prices, partly
offsetting the effect of higher corn prices on corn
sweeteners. In the calculation of byproduct credits,
it is assumed 1 bushel of corn weighs 56 pounds and
produces 1.55 pounds of crude corn oil, 13.5 pounds
of corn gluten feed, 2.65 pounds of corn gluten meal,
and 33.33 pounds of corn sweetener, dry weight. Table
51 provides net cost of corn starch data through
November 1995. 

The Midwest price of number 2 yellow dent corn, the
grade used by wet millers, averaged $2.28 per bushel
for the first 9 months of fiscal 1994/95, compared
with $2.67 for the corresponding period in 1993/94.
The lower corn prices in 1994/95 reflected the record
corn crop. But corn prices have been rising in recent
months averaging $2.77 per bushel July-September,
$3.12 in October and $3.22 in November, reflecting
the forecast sharp downturn in corn production in
1995/96. The December WASDE forecast corn prices for
1995/96 to range from $2.95-3.35 a bushel, compared
with $2.26 per bushel for the whole season of
1994/95.
 
Net corn cost averaged $1.67 per bushel in October
1995 versus 1.27 per bushel for the first 9 months of
1995. For the previous decade (1985-1994), net corn
costs averaged 90 cents a bushel.
 
U.S. Honey and Maple Syrup
Production
Honey Output Unchanged
U.S. honey production in 1995 is estimated at 216
million pounds (108,000 short tons), practically
unchanged from 1994. Production of honey in the
United States have been hampered by a continued
decline on bee colonies. The number of commercial bee
colonies in the United States has gradually declined
from a peak of 5.9 million in the late 1940's, to 4.3
million in 1985, and to an estimated 2.7 million in
1995. Declining colony numbers are mainly due to
fewer easily accessible floral sources, increased use
of pesticides, increasing losses from mites, rising
production costs, and declining net income.
 
In addition, the migration of Africanized bees into
the southern United States may have contributed to a
decline in beekeeping, and therefore, reduced bee
colonies. Although the number of producing colonies
has declined over the past years, honey yields per
colony have increased. Yields per colony averaged 35
pounds in 1985, 62 pounds in 1990, and compared with
an estimated 78 pounds in 1994. The lower colony
numbers and higher yields likely reflect structural
adjustments in the U.S. honey industry in which
smaller producers continue to leave the industry,
while larger apiaries continue technological
improvements. More than one-third of all colonies in
the United States are located in California, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Florida. These
States continue to account for over half of U.S.
honey production.
 
Maple Syrup Lower
Maple syrup production for 1995 is estimated at 1.1
million gallons, down 17 percent from 1994. The
downturn is largely attributed to a fall-off in
production in Vermont, the largest producing State,
from 435,000 gallons in 1994 to 365,000 gallons this
year, due to less than optimal weather. To generate
the best sap flows, freezing conditions at night
followed by warm days are required. Production was up
somewhat in Maine, the second largest producer but
down in New York, the third largest producer. In New
York, the first sap run was reported March 4 and the
last April 1, with an average of 47 gallons of sap
per gallon of syrup. In 1994, the first and last run
were March 16 and April 11, respectively, average
yields were 41 gallons of sap per gallon of syrup.
 
Consumption
Honey Use Expected Lower
U.S. honey consumption has been increasing in the
last few years, due to population growth and
increased use by bakery, cereal, and health food
manufacturers. However, U.S. domestic demand for
honey in 1995 is forecast to decrease by 4 percent
based on lower supplies and higher prices. Household
consumption accounts for approximately 40 percent of
total U.S. honey domestic use. Honey for table use is
generally liquid, light color, and with mild flavor.
The United States is also one of the world's largest
markets for industrial honey, which accounts for
about 45 percent of total domestic consumption. The
food manufacturing industry, primarily bakery, health
food, and cereal manufactures, is the major user of
industrial honey. The food service industry, which is
comprised of restaurants, schools, hospitals, and
other institutional operations, accounts for the
remaining 15 percent of the honey consumed annually
in the United States. 

Maple Syrup Demand Trading Up
Maple syrup use continues to grow in popularity.
Total use was estimated at 4.0 million gallons in
1994, compared with 2.5 million in 1985. The upturn
in use can be attributed to wider marketing of
domestic output increasingly supplemented by imports. 
 
Trade
U.S. Net Honey Importer
Exports of U.S. honey in 1994 were 8.3 million pounds
or 4,171 short tons, 2 percent below 1993 shipments,
mainly due to increased competition from low priced
Chinese and Argentine honey in international markets.
U.S. honey exports in 1995 are forecast at 9.3
million pounds or about 12 percent above 1994
shipments. Although U.S. honey supplies are expected
to be lower in 1995, higher international prices,
combined with continued promotion campaigns in
principal U.S. markets, like those in the Middle
East, have improved U.S. honey export prospects this
year. Total U.S. honey shipments during the period
January-August, 1995, reached 5.7 million pounds, up
25 percent from exports during the same period last
year. Moreover, exports to date to important markets
such as Germany, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia are also
running ahead of last year.
 
About 55-60 percent of U.S. honey is exported in bulk
form, with the remaining 40-45 percent directed to
the retail consumer-ready market. Exports of
high-quality, consumer-packed honey have been
increasing in recent years due to increased world
demand and to promotional efforts under the Market
Promotion Program, which is administered by the
National Honey Board. 

U.S. imports of honey in 1994 were 123.2 million
pounds or 61,615 tons, 8 percent less than imports in
1993. Anti-dumping investigations regarding honey
imports from China, the major supplier to the U.S.
market, discouraged exports of Chinese honey to the
United States last year. Still, U.S. honey imports
from Argentina in 1994 increased for the sixth
consecutive year to 40.3 million pounds. 
 
U.S. imports in 1995 are forecast to decrease further
to 84.0 million pounds based on a new agreement
reached this year with China, which will restrict the
amount of Chinese honey imported into the United
States. Moreover, decreased world honey supplies and
higher international prices will likely discourage
U.S. honey imports in 1995. U.S. honey exports during
the period January-August 1995, were 58.6 million
pounds, compared with 85.8 pounds during the same
period last year. Moreover, imports from China and
Argentina, the two top U.S. suppliers, are running
behind last year's pace by 64 and 33 percent,
respectively. China, Argentina, Canada, and Mexico
have been the leading suppliers of honey to the
United States, accounting for nearly 90 percent of
U.S. honey imports. Honey imports account for about
30 to 35 percent of U.S. honey consumption. Over the
past decade (1985-94), U.S. honey imports have
exceeded exports by about 90 million pounds annually. 

Maple Syrup Exports Small,
Imports Growing
U.S. maple syrup exports continue to be small,
totaling only 569,000 gallons in 1994, and averaging
364,000 annually for the previous 5 years. In
contrast, imports of maple syrup, mainly from Canada,
were a record 3.3 million gallons in 1994 with annual
imports averaging 51.5 million gallons for the
previous 5 year average. The upturn in imports
reflects increasing demand for maple syrup in the
United States and the need to supplement domestic
supplies.
 
Programs and Policies
Honey Support Program Changed
The U.S. Honey Price Support Program was amended by
the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1993. The 1993
Act reduced the minimum honey loan rate from 53.8
cents a pound for the 1991-95 crops, to 50 cents a
pound for the 1994 and 1995 crops, 49 cents a pound
for the 1996 crop, 48 cents for the 1997 crop, and 47
cents a pound for the 1998 crop. The 1993 Act also
dropped the 1 percent (0.538 cent) nonrefundable
marketing assessment, which growers paid on each
pound of domestically produced honey. However, the
funding for the price support portion of the honey
program was eliminated for the 1994 and 1995 honey
crops. Also, the loan portion of the program is now
operating as a recourse, interest-charged loan
program. Loans are available for 9 months to provide
interim financing while a producer markets the honey.
Table 62 provides data on loan activity.
 
Chinese Imports Restricted
U.S. honey imports from China expanded steadily from
about 26.5 million pounds in 1989 to 75 million in
1993. In response to a petition from the American
Beekeeping Federation and the American Honey
Producers Association, the U.S. International Trade
Commission (ITC) instituted an anti-dumping
investigation on imports of honey from China in
October 1994. On November 14, 1994, ITC voted
unanimously to pursue a complaint that Chinese honey
was being dumped in the United States and harming
U.S. honey producers. After the ITC decides to accept
a case, the actual anti-dumping investigation is done
by the International Trade Administration, Department
of Commerce. After ITC found that honey from China
had been dumped in the United States, anti-dumping
duties on imports from China were established. 

In August 1995, the U.S. Department of Commerce and
the Government of China reached an agreement, which
suspends punitive U.S. anti-dumping duties and places
quantitative and a price limits on Chinese honey or
shipments to the United States. The agreement, which
covers 5 years beginning in 1995, will allow China to
export 44 million pounds (21,982 short tons 19,942
metric tons) of honey annually to the United States.
The agreement also established that Chinese honey
cannot be sold at a price lower than a reference
price, equivalent to 92 percent of the average unit
value of honey imported by the United States from all
other countries. The reference price will be updated
quarterly. Tables 58-64 provide supply use and price
statistics for honey and maple syrup.
 
World and U.S. High Intensity Sweeteners
World High Intensity Sweetener Use Continues To
Expand
World production and use of high intensity (low
calorie) sweeteners continues to expand around the
globe. While USDA does not have an independent
production survey system for high intensity
sweeteners, a prominent market analyst places
combined production of saccharin, aspartame, and
acesulfame-k at about 37 million pounds (table 65).
No public data are available for the other major high
intensity sweeteners cyclamate, sucralose, and
alitame. The approximate sugar sweetener equivalent
(SSE) to the major high intensity sweeteners is as
follows: cyclamate (30), aspartame (180),
acesulfame-k (200), saccharin (300), sucralose (600),
and alitame (2,000). 

The growth in the use of high intensity sweeteners
reflects their cost economics compared with sugar and
HFCS. One of the most notable features of the world
intense sweetener sector in recent years has been the
growing trend towards the blending of different
sweeteners with one another. From a commercial point
of view, one of the most important advantages of such
blends is their sweetening synergies. The sweetness
intensity delivered by a blend is nearly always far
greater than the sum of the sweetness potencies of
the individual sweeteners, enabling food and drink
manufacturers to realize substantial sweetener cost
savings. Moreover, blending often results in taste
synergies and enhanced stability.
 
For markets to grow, these products must first gain
approval by food safety authorities in various
countries. For example, both sucrolose and alitame
were approved for use in Mexico and Australia this
past year. In contrast, both products are awaiting
approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
for use in the United States.
 
Saccharin is one of the most widely used high
intensity sweeteners. It is approved for use in the
EU, Japan, China, Canada (for table top use and
pending approval in soft drinks and food), and the
United States. Saccharin has been low priced
averaging about 1 cent a pound SSE, in the United
States. It is widely used in China and Indonesia as a
substitute for sugar in soft drinks and other foods.
In the United States and Europe, saccharin is also
widely used in non-food uses such as toothpaste and
pharmaceuticals. 

One of the oldest and most widely used blends is that
of saccharin with cyclamate. Used on their own, the
taste profiles of these sweeteners are poor, both
having slight metallic after tastes. However, when
used together, the overall taste profile is much
improved. Moreover, because of sweetening synergies
that exist between the two sweeteners and low costs,
the potential cost savings are significant. However,
in some of the world's largest sweetener markets
regulatory barriers prohibit the use of one or either
of these sweeteners. For example, in the United
States and United Kingdom cyclamate have been banned
for use since 1969.
 
Aspartame has achieved wide-approval in the EU,
Canada, Japan, and the United States. Applications in
the United States include carbonated soft drinks,
refrigerated and non-refrigerated ready-to-drink
beverages, table top use, frozen desserts, yogurt,
and candies. Aspartame gradually loses its sweetness
in liquids as a function of time, temperature, and
pH. It also loses its sweetness when exposed to high
heat, as in baking. A new encapsulated form of
aspartame was recently approved by FDA for baking.
Encapsulation protects aspartame under high heat and
releases the sweetener only during the final stage of
baking.
 
Aspartame's advances in the U.S. market were spurred
largely by growth in demand for "diet" soft drinks,
despite its high cost--in 1989 $60-$70 per pound, or
36 cents a pound SSE. Since NutraSweet's patent on
aspartame expired in December 1992, the price has
fallen and currently is estimated at about $20-$35
dollars a pound, or 17 cents a pound SSE. While most
of the aspartame used in the United States is
produced domestically, dependence on imports is
growing. In 1994, the United States imported a record
5.9 million pounds (2,683 tons) valued at $92.4
million, most of it from Japan. The unit import value
was $15.62 per pound, or 8.68 cent a pound SSE (table
66). 

Acesulfame-k has broad approval for use in food and
beverages in the EU and Canada. It has not been
approved yet in Japan. In the United States it has
been approved for a number of food products such as
baked goods, yogurt, dry drink mixes, and as a table
top sweetener. Approval is pending for its use in
carbonated soft drinks. In the United States, its
price on a sugar equivalent basis is about 17 cents a
pound. In Europe an increasingly popular blend is
acesulfame-k and aspartame.
 
Competition in U.S. Soft Drink Market Between High
Intensity Sweeteners, Sugar, and HFCS
 
During the 1980s, U.S. sweetener analysts generally
believed that aspartame was not having much negative
impact upon the market for caloric sweeteners such as
sugar and HFCS. Instead, aspartame was competing with
saccharin. It was also felt that aspartame had played
a major role in revitalizing the diet beverage
market, but that these extra sales represented a new
form of soft drink demand, which was largely in
addition to the existing large non-diet or regular
soft drink sales. More recently, this view has been
changed. Analysts now believe that there is some
"cannibalisation" or substitution of the regular soft
drink market by diet products--that is, high
intensity sweeteners are competing directly with the
caloric sweeteners, sugar, and HFCS.
 
Ukraine's Sugar Industry: Recent Developments and
Prospects by Peter Buzzanell, Yuri Markish, and Roger
Hoskin

Note: This is the second in a series of three
articles on the republics of the former Soviet Union
that will appear in the Sugar and Sweetener Situation
and Outlook report. The first article, "The Russian
Federation: Sugar Industry in Transition" appeared in
March 1994. 

Abstract: Four years after the end of the Soviet
period, Ukraine remains one of the world's largest
sugar producers despite declines in area, yield, and
production. The processing industry is plagued with
outmoded equipment and production practices which
hamper productivity. To date, government
privatization efforts have meant no real change in
administration. High prices and falling incomes have
lowered Ukrainian sugar consumption. The country
remains self-sufficient in sugar and exports about
half of its production, mostly to other FSU
countries. Current tariff regimens, especially in
Russia, could favor the resurgence of raw sugar
imports for refining and reexport. 
 
Introduction
Ukraine's sugarbeet industry ranks as one of the
world's largest in terms of area harvested,
processing capacity, beet sugar production, and
trade. However, field and factory performance
continues to be constrained by high prices and
shortages of agricultural inputs, fuel, machinery,
spare parts, and low capital investment. The industry
is struggling with policy reforms as it adapts to the
country's shift from state planning to market forces.
The outlook for Ukraine's sugar industry, a key
component of the nation's rural economy and export
earnings, is being shaped by the lack of initiatives
to increase production efficiencies and the slow
reform of the industry's organizational structure.
 
Structure of Production and Processing--
Sugarbeets is a Leading Crop
Ukraine is the world's fourth largest producer of
sugarbeets and beet sugar behind France, the United
States and Germany. For 1995/96, USDA forecasts
Ukraine`s sugarbeet harvest from an estimated 1.43
million hectares, the largest of any country in the
world (table A-1). USDA forecasts Ukraine's 1995/96
sugarbeet production at 33.0 million tons yielding
4.0 million tons of beet sugar, raw value (table
A-2).
 
In recent years, sugarbeets have been processed in 19
of the Ukraine's 25 oblasts (similar to states in the
United States or provinces in Canada). Ukraine's
sugarbeet crop is sown in the spring and harvested in
the fall. Of more than 1.6 million hectares sown to
spring crops in 1995, sugarbeets accounted for about
6 percent. More than half of spring planted area was
devoted to grain crops such as barley, corn, and
fodder crops. Sunflowerseed plantings were also
somewhat larger than sugarbeets at 1.8 million
hectares. Although sugarbeets occupy less than 10
percent of cultivated land, the crop accounts for
about 30 percent of gross farm income and 15 percent
of net farm profits. Moreover, the byproducts of the
sugarbeet crop (beet tops, beet pulp, and molasses)
provide valuable animal feed to supplement fodder
crops.

Sugarbeets are grown on an estimated 7,500 to 8,000
agricultural collectives and farms spread across the
country. Key producing oblasts are located in the
central and western parts of the country, generally
near sugarbeet processing facilities (figure A-1).
Among the leading oblasts in terms of sugarbeet area
are Vinnytsya, Cherkasy, Khmel'nyts'kyy, Kiev, and
Sumy. Together these five oblasts account for over 50
percent of the total area in sugarbeets.
 
The Ukraine has excellent natural advantages for
growing sugarbeets, including fertile soil and a good
climate. Sugarbeets are grown in rotation with other
crops, particularly grains, and year-to-year changes
in beet area planted reflect the relative prices
received by farmers for sugarbeets compared with
other crops. Planted area in 1995 was 11 percent
below the average 1.66 million hectares harvested in
the late 1980's (table A-2). In part the decline
effects the disappearance of Soviet Union's central
planning schemes, under which the Ukraine was
obligated to produce sugar to meet the needs of other
republics of the former Soviet Union (FSU). The lower
acreage also reflects a shift to more profitable
grains or sunflowers, problems between sugarbeet
growers and processors, and removal of subsidies to
sugarbeet processing plants. While some traditional
sugarbeet areas have gone out of production, new
areas have come into production in the Crimea,
Dnipropetrovs'k, Luhans'k, and Kherson oblasts. Only
Zaporizhzhya oblast does not currently grow
sugarbeets.
 
In November, Ukraine's sugarbeet yields for 1995/96
were forecast at 23.2 tons per hectare, up from the
drought-reduced yields of last season but well below
the average 30.4 tons of the late 1980's. Recent
reports indicate the final result may have been
somewhat lower. Yields in the Ukraine in the late
1980's were about 5 tons below the world average of
about 35 tons (figure A-3). France and Germany
typically average yields of 42 to 45 tons per
hectare. Quantity and quality of agrochemicals and
other industrial inputs in these countries
historically have been several times higher than in
Ukraine. However, Ukrainian yields have tended to be
higher than in some neighboring East European
countries such as Romania, Bulgaria, and the Russian
Federation.
 
Ukrainian yields have declined since the end of the
Soviet period because of the declining use of
fertilizers and plant protection products. The end of
government subsidies of these inputs has led to
sharply higher prices and reduction of input use.
This season's production upturn represents a recovery
from 1994's severe drought.
 
In recent years, the productivity of Ukrainian
sugarbeet agriculture has been constrained by
problems with seeds, field equipment, chemicals, and
fuel. For example, sugarbeet seed has not been
available in sufficient quantities. Average annual
sugarbeet seed production is estimated at 17,000
tons, which is enough to plant 1.1 million hectares.
The three sugarbeet seed factories in Ukraine
(Vinnytsya, Lebedyn and Buryn) all are reportedly in
need of modernization. Foreign hybrids were planted
on about 60,000 hectares in the spring of 1995, 4
percent of total plantings.
 
Efforts to modernize the seed industry are underway.
To support breeders, each beet factory has to
contribute to a special breeding fund of the
Ukrainian Sugar Concern (Ukrsakhar), a
quasi-government agency. Five new Ukrainian-developed
hybrid seed varieties are expected to be released
soon. Domestically produced sugarbeet seeds were
given by the government to sugarbeet factories
without advance payment for the 1993-95 planting
seasons, and then distributed to farmers, also
without any advance payment. In 1995, seeds will be
reportedly paid for after the crop harvest at a cost
of 200 kilograms of sugar per hectare. Higher
yielding, foreign hybrid seed costs about three times
as much as Ukrainian varieties.
 
Fertilizer and pesticide applications have fallen
since the Soviet era due to higher prices, and
removal of subsidies to growers to purchase inputs.
Fertilizer applications to sugarbeet fields have
fallen from 300 to 450 kilograms per hectare in the
mid 1980's to 80 to100 kilograms in some areas for
the 1994/95 crop. Pesticide use has fallen to 20 to
30 percent of the amount applied during the Soviet
period. In the future, the rate of fertilizer, and
chemical use will be determined by their economic
benefit. Application rates are unlikely to return to
Soviet-period levels. Like the seed problem, the
reduced use of production-enhancing inputs has shown
up in lower sugarbeet yields.
 
Growers initially were unable to obtain credit for
the spring planting campaign in 1995. However, the
Cabinet of Ministers decided to ignore the Government
anti-inflation guidelines and requested the Ministry
of Industry to give fertilizers to sugarbeet farmers
last spring without prepayment. Final settling is
supposed to be done after growers sell their 1995
harvest, but is unlikely to happen. Given the
inflationary environment in Ukraine, the government
decision to delay payments represents a subsidy to
growers. 

Harvesting of sugarbeets normally begins in September
and lasts about 60 days, while processing can last up
to 100 days. According to Ukrainian government
sources, average losses from the previous five crops
averaged 22.5 percent. This staggering loss estimate
includes beets unharvested and those dug but not
delivered to factories. Despite the agronomic and
capital equipment problems, a return to more normal
weather helped Ukrainian farmers in 1995/96 to
harvest and deliver an estimated 33.0 million tons of
sugarbeets to processing facilities. While more than
20 percent below the 45 million ton average of the
late 1980's, the volume will exceed that of any other
country in the world. Harvests in France, Germany,
and the United States, for example, each are expected
to range around 26 million tons this season.
 
Grower-Processor Relationship
Currently Ukraine regulations presume that all
sugarbeets and byproducts (molasses and beet pulp)
are owned by the growers. Growers pay sugar factories
a processing fee ranging from 19 to 42 percent with
money, beets, or sugar. Sometimes shares of molasses
and pulp also remain with the factories. Payment is
done according to quality and quantity of beets,
taking into account data on sugar content and average
sugar losses at the factory through the entire beet
processing campaign. 
 
This season, for the first time, there appears to be
little or no state or government mandated contract
between growers and processors, and procurements
continue to be scaled back. Growers and factories
have to find their own markets for their output and
have to find supplies of inputs and equipment. The
contracts between farmers and processors are
understood to include pricing alternatives such as:
1) growers pay a fee to cover the processing and
storage costs of sugarbeets, and 2) sugar produced,
as well as molasses and pulp, remains the property of
the grower (after deducting storage losses) and the
factory retains part of the finished sugar as payment
for processing costs.
 
There are major disagreements between beet growers
and processors regarding the amount of sugar
processors should receive under barter agreements.
Processors want to implement a new regulation
stipulating that 51 percent of the sugar processed
belongs to the growers and the remainder to them. The
growers, in contrast, want a 70-30 percent split. As
a point of comparison, in the United States there is
generally a 60-40 percent grower-processor split,
with grower payments based on their individual sugar
content and the market price of sugar received by the
processor. In the western U.S. contract model, the
processor keeps returns generated from byproducts. 

Processing Facilities Need Modernization
Ukraine has one of the world's largest sugarbeet
processing industries. According to the latest
available statistics, there are 195 beet processing
plants located in 19 of the country's oblasts,
although several are not operational this season.

Total daily sugarbeet slicing capacity is about
500,000 tons, and beet sugar production capacity is
about 50,000 tons per day. In addition, Ukraine has
five raw cane sugar refineries strategically located
throughout the country, the largest of which is
situated at the Black Sea port of Odessa.

Sugarbeets are shipped to processing plants generally
located near growing areas. A large share of the
plants are clustered in the central and western part
of the country with the highest concentration in the
oblasts of Vinnytsya (41), Cherkasy (23),
Khmelnytskyy (17), and Kiev (15). By world standards
Ukraine's beet processing plants tend to be small.
For example, in the oblast of Vinnytsya, 9 of the 41
beet plants have a daily capacity under 1,500 tons;
25 have capacities of between 1,500 and 2,500 tons; 7
have capacities of between 2,500 to 5,000 tons; and
only 1 has a capacity of over 5,000 tons per day.
Only 17 plants, 9 percent of the total, have
capacities over 5,000 tons; and the national average
is 2,623 tons per day. In contrast, the U.S. beet
sugar industry's plant capacity averages 5,375 tons,
and 18 of the 34 U.S. plants have capacities over
5,000 tons per day. About 50 of Ukraine's beet
processing plants are characterized as in good
mechanical condition, 50 are in poor condition, and
the remainder are characterized as very poor. 
 
Ukraine's beet processing campaign usually starts in
mid-September and runs through mid-December. The
national average length of the processing campaign is
90 to 100 days, with some regional variation. While
portions of the industry tend to run efficiently,
large segments do not. By western standards
processing losses are high. Capacity utilization
levels during the short processing season tend to be
low due to endemic problems of insufficient beets and
lack of fuel to maintain plant operations. In recent
harvests, increasing transportation delays and lack
of coordination between growers and processors have
contributed to below-optimum throughput in factories.
High energy consumption has became a major problem
for the industry. Ukraine's exports of sugar to
Russia are tied to reciprocal arrangements for oil
imports, so the more oil required for each ton of
sugar, the more sugar that must be bartered to
Russia.
 
According to statements by Ukrsakhar, the Ukrainian
beet processing industry extracts about 72 percent of
the sugar content of sugarbeets entering the factory.
The vintage of equipment, lack of repairs and
maintenance as well as management practices in
handling beets from the field to the factory, all
contribute to lower recovery rates in Ukrainian
plants. While this extraction rate is similar to that
achieved in Soviet times in the late 1980's, it is
well below western standards. For example, in the
United States, plants normally extract over 80
percent of the sugar in beets, and if desugaring of
molasses is added, the figure goes to over 90
percent. However, the sugar content of Ukrainian
harvested sugarbeets is comparable to those of
western countries--over 16 percent. Thus, increased
efficiencies in the factories would reduce losses and
decrease costs. A good index to compare both field
and factory productivity levels is sugar produced per
hectare. As figure A-4 reveals, Ukraine's sugar per
hectare is well below levels achieved in France and
nearby Poland.
 
Yet, the sugar per hectare level in the Red River
Valley of the United States is closer to that of
Poland than France. This highlights the difference
between technical and economic efficiency. If inputs
or outputs are subsidized, then agriculture will
become very technology intensive; this may explain
the high sugar per hectare figure for France. If
product prices and inputs are not subsidized then it
may not be economically profitable to attain a higher
technical level of productivity. Ukraine's industry
is currently undergoing the removal of assets and
inputs that results when subsidies are ended, hence
the value of fixed assets is low, perhaps excessively
so. What the "optimal" use of these inputs is will
depend on costs and returns in a restructured
industry.
 
However, there is no evidence that reported changes
in ownership arrangements have meant any changes in
day-to-day administration. The Ukrainian government
scaled back procurement more out of an inability to
finance the program than out of conviction that it
should be ended. Presently, domestic sugar prices are
high, $700 to $800 a ton, well above world prices,
and stocks are ample. The fact that prices have not
fallen, suggest that growers and processors are
holding stocks because they believe that they will
eventually convince the government to ratify the
industry's high cost structure by some form of
subsidization or renationalization. 

Processing Facilities Privatization
Until 1991 all of Ukraine's processing facilities
were state owned and all the major strategic
decisions concerning plant investment and
modernization were made in Moscow and passed to Kiev
for execution. The state guaranteed a supply of
financial resources, raw material, energy, and
machinery to run the facilities. After the collapse
of the Soviet Union, central planning ceased, but the
state still owned the factories. 
 
To help solve some of the endemic problems of the
processing sector, the Ukrainian government has begun
to privatize plants and seek foreign investment to
help modernize the industry. As of the first half of
1995, 31 beet factories were reportedly privatized,
16 percent of the total. These sugar factories were
first leased, then privatized. An additional 72
factories have been leased.
 
Since early 1995, the Ukrainian Parliament has
shifted away from leasing to a direct
open-joint-stock company privatization method, with
participation of sugarbeet farmers. Regulations
require a 51-percent majority ownership by sugarbeet
farmers. However, there have been some problems with
this approach due to a lack of "farmer privatization
certificates." Moreover, there are some proposals to
renationalize factories already privatized because
the distribution of their shares does not correspond
to the recent regulations set up by the Parliament,
(i.e. farmers should hold at least 51 percent of the
shares). Ukrainian State Certificates are documents
provided by all Ukrainian state, private and
cooperative enterprises to each employee in these
organizations. Certificates are supposed to be able
to be sold for cash or traded for shares in other
enterprises. Some enterprise certificates are worth
more than others depending on the value placed on the
enterprise's assets. Some enterprises and farms are
prohibiting the use of certificates by their
employees for purchase of assets in other than the
employer's enterprise. Also the problem has arisen
that often there are not enough farmers at collective
farms with certificates to cover the required 51
percent of the factory assets. 

A major stumbling block to privatization is that the
government has set the price of these "assets" too
high and producers know it. Consequently, it is their
preference to invest their certificates in paper
assets rather than factories. Moreover, there is no
incentive to own factories that are virtually
bankrupt nor is there any incentive to buy if growers
and workers perceive that the government could be
persuaded to continue subsidization in one form or
another.
 
Foreign companies have shown little interest, to
date, in participating in joint ventures designed to
privatize beet factories. However, Ukraine is getting
some foreign investment for its raw cane sugar
refiners. Tate and Lyle Inc. of the United Kingdom,
has invested $15 million in a joint venture to
upgrade the Odessa refinery. The plan is to increase
sugar output from 750 tons per day to 1,500 tons. One
attraction of the project is that under current
regulations, Tate and Lyle can avoid the Russian
Federation's 25 percent import duty on refined sugar
by supplying refined sugar made in the Ukraine from
imported raw sugar.
 
Lack of foreign interest in Ukrainian processing
plants re-enforces the notion that the asking price
is too high given the uncertainty of the business
climate. Furthermore, given Russia's import duty
schedule for refined sugar, refining raw sugar could
be the most profitable segment of the industry,
depending on domestic sugar prices in Ukraine and
Russia, hence the foreign interest in refineries.
 
Marketing--Domestic Consumption and Exports
Per Capita Use Remains High
 
USDA forecasts 1995/96 sugar consumption in the
Ukraine at 2.25 million tons, raw value, down 50,000
tons from last year and 610,000 tons lower than the
annual average for the late 1980's and early 1990's
(1987/88-1990/91). For 1995/96, Ukraine's sugar
consumption is expected to account for 56 percent of
its production, not unlike the recent trend. Although
Ukraine is consistently a surplus producer, the
downturn in sugar use also has come at a time of
declining production.

Underlying the aggregate estimates are important
changes in per capita use. Ukraine's sugar
consumption averaged over 50 kilograms, refined, per
capita during the late 1980's, compared with 55 in
the EU and 20 worldwide during the period. The high
per capita sugar use reflected heavily subsidized
prices to consumers. Since the early 1990's sugar
consumption has fallen more than 20 percent because
of lower real income, higher prices, and increased
availability of sugar-containing product imports. 

The sources of sugar demand in Ukraine differ from
western countries. Commercial food processing and
other manufacturing account for about one-third of
total sugar use, compared with two-thirds or more in
the United States. In Ukraine, retail sales and
noncommercial home use account for about two-thirds
of total use. For example, a large share of
nonindustrial use goes for home preservation of
fruits, berries, and vegetables. In addition,
Ukrainians traditionally use sugar for homemade vodka
production. Some estimates show that about 5 percent
of the total sugar consumption goes for home
production of alcohol in Kiev, with a higher figure
in the countryside.
 
In 1991, after the demise of the Soviet structure,
the Ukrainian state sugar agency, Ukrsakhar, was
created. Ukrsakhar is responsible for sugar
distribution in domestic and export markets.
Currently, Ukrsakhar issues shipping notices to sugar
factories for sugar to be procured under state
contract.
 
Because both growers and processors are paid in
sugar, the amount remaining for disposal by the state
has been declining. Increasing shares of the sugar
crop are in the hands of farmers or processors on a
free market basis. For example, the volume of free
market sugar handled by farmers totaled nearly
300,000 tons, refined value, in 1992; 600,000 tons in
1993; and around 1.0 million tons in 1994. These
developments have created multiple domestic markets
for sugar.
 
World Ranking Exporter
Despite the downturn in export availability in recent
years, Ukraine remains one of the world's largest
beet sugar exporters, and only the European Union is
larger. For 1995/96, USDA forecasts that Ukraine will
export about 2.0 million tons, up 300,000 tons from
the previous year, but down sharply from the 4.2
million-ton-average achieved during 1987/88-1990/91.
The exports are expected to be composed of about 1.5
million tons of domestically produced beet sugar and
300,000 tons of imported raw sugar refined for
reexported sugar.
 
Sugar exports account for about one-quarter of
Ukraine's total agricultural exports, ranking second
only to grains, which account for about one-half of
total exports. Ukraine's other major agricultural
export commodity is sunflowerseed.
 
Of total beet sugar exports for 1995/96, 1.76 million
tons, or nearly 90 percent, are expected to be
shipped to Russia and other republics of the FSU. The
remaining 10 percent is expected to be exported to
neighboring countries. According to International
Sugar Organization (ISO) statistics for 1994, Ukraine
supplied nearly 40 percent or 1.5 million tons of the
total sugar imports of the FSU-12 and Baltic States.
The Russian Federation, Belarus, Uzbekistan, and
Azerbaijan were the major destinations in terms of
volume. For several FSU republics--Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Moldova, and Tajikistan--Ukraine accounted
for two-thirds or more of their sugar imports.
 
Non-FSU markets for Ukraine in recent years have
included Bulgaria, Romania, and China. With
Turkey--Ukraine's major regional export
competition--shifting from a net exporter to a net
importer position this season due to a fall-off in
production, Ukraine could capture an increased share
of the import markets in Albania, Romania, the former
Yugosolvia, Iran, and Iraq, as well as Turkey. In
1993 and 1994, Turkey exported 90,711 and 62,492
tons, respectively, to the FSU-12 republics of
Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russian Federation, Tajikistan,
and Uzbekistan. However, Ukraine likely will be
unable to fill the void left by Turkey in 1995/96
because of insufficient availability. USDA forecasts
1995/96 sugar imports by FSU-12 (excluding Ukraine
and Russian Federation) and Baltic States will total
about 1.8 million tons, raw value.
 
Ukraine's major trading partner has been Russia,
which mainly trades oil for Ukraine's sugar.
Traditionally, Ukraine has exported to Russia, the
world's largest sugar importer, a combination of
domestically produced beet sugar as well as imported
raw cane sugar refined in Ukrainian facilities.
During the 1980's, around 2.0 million tons of
imported raw sugar were refined annually. This raw
cane sugar, mainly of Cuban origin, was tolled in
Ukraine as part of the FSU's barter exchange of Cuban
sugar for Russian oil. In recent years, sugar
refining has been largely a commercial activity, with
volume depending upon the level of the refined
premium--the difference between the prices of refined
and raw sugar. As table A-2 reveals, imports of raw
sugar into Ukraine dropped sharply since the late
1980's, reflecting the fact that the refined premium
has generally not been high enough for toll refining
to be commercially viable.
 
USDA expects Russia's sugar imports to increase from
2.7 million tons in 1994/95 to about 3.0 million in
1995/96. According to Russian Customs Committee data,
in calendar year 1994, Russia imported 2.2 million
tons of sugar, of which Cuba accounted for 911,711
tons or 42 percent and Ukraine 681,502 tons or 31
percent. For the first half of 1995, (January-June),
Russia's raw sugar imports from Cuba totaled 364,757
tons, 59 percent of total raw imports. Ukraine
provided 508,439 tons of Russia's refined sugar, 81
percent of the total of refined imports.
Historically, Russia imported raw and refined sugar
in about equal amounts, but the share of raw sugar
has increased in the last 3 years, with 1995/96 raw
imports forecast at about 55 percent compared with 48
percent in 1993/94. The reason for this change is a
higher import tariff for refined sugar (25 percent)
compared with raw sugar (1 percent). Also since April
1995, imports of refined sugar have been subject to a
10-percent value-added-tax (VAT) and a special tax of
1.5 percent. The VAT on raw sugar, however, is 20
percent. However, the refined sugar import tariff of
25 percent does not apply to other FSU republics such
as Ukraine.
 
It is expected that 200,000 to 300,000 tons of raw
sugar will enter Ukraine during 1995/96 for refining
and reexport. Under Ukraine's tolling and reexport
regulations, imports of raw sugar for tolling have to
be re-exported within 90 days or be subject to the
Ukrainian import tax. Ukraine applies a 10-percent
import duty on either raw or refined sugar. A
20-percent VAT is also applied to raw sugar imports,
unless they are re-exported.

Ukraine's sugar import flows are controlled by
Ukrsakhar under an import license system. Ukrsakhar
is also responsible for export deliveries against
intergovernmental agreements with other FSU republics
and for refined sugar exports from imported raw sugar
based on tolling contracts with international sugar
trade houses. Export licenses are issued by the
Ministry of Foreign Trade.
 
Prospects for the Future
Industry in Transition
Ukraine's sugarbeet growers, processing sector
officials, and government policy makers continue to
try to bring greater economic incentives, production
efficiencies, and market reform to the country's
sugar industry. The outlook is uncertain with respect
to production, consumption, trade, and the
reorganization of the industry.
 
Production--The data clearly point to a significant
gulf between the technical performance of Ukraine's
sugar industry and those in Western Europe and the
United States. While this indicates the generally
poor state of Ukrainian sugarbeet agriculture, it
suggests that with application of appropriate
technologies (i.e. seed, fertilizers, chemicals) and
financial support, Ukraine could increase sugar
production. For example, assuming current area in
sugarbeet, a 15-percent increase in beet yields from
the late 1980's level to 35 tons per hectare--still
well below the level regularly achieved in western
Europe--would raise sugarbeet production to around 50
million tons. Assuming average recovery rates for the
past four seasons of 12.7 percent, beet sugar
production could total about 6.0 million tons, up by
nearly 50 percent from recent levels.

While a larger volume of sugarbeets would help the
general throughput problem of Ukraine's processing
sector, the industry is clearly in need of capital
investment and restructuring. One plan mentioned with
this focus concerns the building of a 12,000 ton
plant in Zhytomyr oblast and closing five small
nearby mills.
 
There are several factors that are likely to
determine the direction of production over the next
few years. On the positive side there are factors
that would encourage an increase in Ukraine's sugar
production. These include greater export
opportunities in Russia, other FSU countries, and the
world market. On the negative side there are factors
that could cause further contraction. These include
the immense needs in capital investments, the
increasing energy costs of the processing sector, and
a view that sugar production should be only large
enough to meet domestic consumption needs, and
resources should be shifted to more remunerative
crops or activities. 

Consumption--Ukraine's per capita sugar consumption
remains high. However, high sugar prices and low
consumer purchasing power are likely to continue to
curb demand growth until incomes improve. Ukraine's
population, now estimated at 52 million, is growing
slowly, so no significant increase is foreseen in
total sugar consumption. What may change over time is
a use pattern from one dominated directly by
consumers to one of greater consumption of
sugar-containing food products from an expanding
western-style food processing industry.
 
Trade--It is very likely that Ukraine could expand
sugar exports if it is able to raise production.
Assuming no change in consumption, production of
around 6 million tons would leave an annual
exportable surplus of around 4.0 million tons, the
same level achieved in the late 1980's. Markets are
available to Ukraine both within the FSU and in
neighboring countries. The magnitude of these exports
will depend ultimately upon such factors as the
industry's production costs, the price it receives
from world market sales, and the price it receives
from domestic sales. Moreover, the need to improve
the general quality of sugar for export will also
determine how competitive Ukraine will be in
international markets.
 
The role of tolling raw sugar for Russia is a
question mark. Russia will remain a large importer of
sugar. Ukraine has sugar refinery capacity and a
developed infrastructure for unloading raws and
shipping refined products. The level of exports to
Russia is likely to continue to depend on
intergovernment agreements on fuel and sugar, the
raw-refined price premimiun, and border taxes--such
as the waiving of the import tariff on refined sugar
from other FSU countries. 
 
Policy Reform--Ukraine's sugar industry faces many
underlying structural problems that have not been
addressed in the initial transition from the old
Soviet command economy. The privatization initiative
is an important first step for a long term
development strategy. However, it remains to be seen
whether this launches a new restructuring process
that will encourage investment and improve
availability of some of the inputs and technologies
available to beet sugar industries in Western Europe
and the United States. 

Unresolved is a comprehensive policy concerning the
country's sugarbeet factories. To cut the high cost
of sugar production, a large number of the small, old
sugar factories with low efficiency would have to be
closed. However, a sizable shut-down of factories
would increase rural unemployment. Clearly the
privatization and potential factory modernization
strategies will be pivotal to the future vitality of
the Ukrainian sugar industry. In addition, seeming
contradictions among different Ukrainian
Parliamentary acts pertaining to enterprise
privatization could seriously limit privatization of
Ukrainian agricultural enterprises.
 
Moreover, transition to a domestic market where
prices are based on supply and demand forces and
payments are made in currency is also essential.
These programs and policies will not be easy to
formulate or implement and the temptation to solve
the industry's underlying structural problems by
government intervention will remain strong.

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-TELEGRAFIX: Telegrafix
brings lightning-fast multimedia to Internet for
under $100 -- Free communications software and Web
access offered during release of new "RIP-2" online
publishing technology
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA -- Online publishers can create
television-style multimedia presentations that fly
through the Internet and ordinary telephone lines
with new software available now for under $100 from
TeleGrafix Communications Inc.

RIPaint-2 "universal online multimedia" publishing
software is based on the second generation of
TeleGrafix's world-standard RIPscrip (Remote Imaging
Protocol script) multimedia technology. Following two
years of development, RIP-2 technology brings
unparalleled speed and quality to online graphics.
Complex graphical information such as World Wide Web
pages can be transmitted and displayed at dazzling
speeds over low-bandwidth residential telephone lines
using low-speed modems. 

"RIP-2 is a telecommunications marvel that brings
sizzle to cyberspace. The graphics are gorgeous and
they travel through networks like greased lightning,"
said TeleGrafix President/CEO Patrick Clawson. 

RIP-2 technology dramatically speeds up transmission
and display of online multimedia by encoding graphics
as hyper- compressed ASCII text files that are as
little as one-tenth the size of other graphics
formats. RIP-2 also introduces many new elements to
online publishing, including multiple-column screen
layouts. RIP-2 is the only online multimedia
technology that can transmitted via the Internet or
any communications link without special protocols,
dedicated servers or other custom software. 

TeleGrafix also has released its new "shareware"
RIPterm v2.2. multimedia communications software, a
general-purpose communications program that also
operates as a HTML-3 and Netscape-compliant Web
browser when used with TeleGrafix's upcoming RIPweb
World Wide Web access technology.

A demonstration of RIP-2 multimedia can be viewed on
TeleGrafix's Vector Sector BBS at +1 714 379-2133.
RIPterm v2.2 and technical information can be
downloaded there and at http://www.telegrafix.com on
the World Wide Web.

RIP-2 COMPATIBLE WITH ANY COMPUTER ONLINE SYSTEM
RIPaint-2 is a powerful online publishing tool that
makes it simple for anyone to create multimedia
electronic newspapers and information services with
point-and-click and drag-and- drop simplicity. Online
publishers can create television-style production
effects with a powerful, easy-to-use WYSIWIG
multimedia editor that integrates JPEG photographic
images, complex SVGA graphics, text and digital WAV
sound into a single screen. The technology supports
16.7 million colors and can use Adobe and TrueType
style fonts. It uses the device-independent bitmap
(BMP/DIB) icon format to make screen images appear to
be virtually identical when viewed on both PC and
Macintosh computers.

The initial release of RIP-2 software is in DOS
format for speed, with a unique Windows-style
interface for point-and-click simplicity, and for use
with BBS and corporate online information systems.
Windows and Macintosh versions of RIP-2 products are
scheduled for release in early 1996, along with
"plug-ins" for Netscape and other popular Internet
browsers that will permit the viewing of RIP-2
multimedia on World Wide Web pages.

RIP-2 technology has been designed to operate with
any online system regardless of whether a particular
BBS or Internet server system manufacturer provides
support in its internal system architecture. Unlike
proprietary imaging systems, RIP-2 is fully
compatible with the Internet and any wired or
wireless communications networks that use 7-bit or
8-bit ASCII text. TeleGrafix will publish the RIP-2
multimedia language specification for use as an
international online multimedia standard in the first
quarter of 1996.

RIPAINT IS INEXPENSIVE, LIBERAL UPGRADE POLICY
RIPaint-2 multimedia publishing software is available
for US$99.95 through January 31, 1996. Customers
ordering during the introductory period will receive
a bonus of 25 complimentary copies of TeleGrafix's
new RIPterm v2.2 "universal client" multimedia
communications software, valued at $500, along with
free Internet and World Wide Web access. Customers
are free to resell the bonus copies of RIPterm and
keep all proceeds. On February 1, 1996, the price of
RIPaint-2 will increase to US$199.95, and the bonus
RIPterm gift will be discontinued.

Customers who purchased RIPaint v1.54 after March 1,
1994 are eligible for a free upgrade to RIPaint-2
with electronic documentation. Printed documentation
is available for an additional fee of US$20.
Customers who purchased RIPaint v1.54 prior to March
1, 1994 may upgrade to RIPaint-2 with electronic
documentation for US$34.95, and with printed
documentation for US$49.95. All RIPaint-2 orders will
be shipped in North America via Federal Express. A
shipping and handling fee of US$15 must accompany all
new orders and upgrade requests for U.S. domestic
customers. International orders and those from Alaska
and Hawaii are subject to higher shipping and
handling fees. TeleGrafix accepts American Express,
Visa and MasterCard. 

RIPTERM GOES SHAREWARE, SYSOPS & WEBMASTERS TO PROFIT
RIPterm v2.2 is being distributed as DOS "shareware"
for individual and non-commercial users, with a
US$19.95 registration fee. Commercial and government
organizations must license RIPterm prior to use, and
inexpensive site licenses are available.

Sysops and webmasters who join the new TeleGrafix
Associates Program prior to January 31, 1996 can
receive sales commissions by distributing RIP-2
software on their online systems, with no financial
risk on their part. 

Each TeleGrafix Associate will receive special
RIPterm shareware containing a unique identification
number for public posting on their BBS or Web system.
They will receive a sales commission of US$5.00 for
each copy of RIPterm originating from their system
that end-users register with TeleGrafix. A 10%
commission will be paid from sales of RIPaint-2 and
other TeleGrafix software products. Commissions will
be paid monthly in U.S. Dollars. No commissions will
be paid on the initial 25 complimentary copies of
RIPterm v2.2 that are included with all RIPaint-2
sales. There is no charge to enroll in the TeleGrafix
Associates Program. 

FREE WEB ACCESS TO TELEGRAFIX CUSTOMERS
Finally, TeleGrafix is providing free World Wide Web
access to customers who want to test drive the
company's experimental RIPweb WWW access technology
through January 31, 1996. RIPweb integrates Web
services into existing BBS and online systems,
providing speedy low-bandwidth connections over
ordinary residential phone lines. By eliminating the
need for consumers to have TCP/IP connections (such
as SLIP or PPP accounts) as a prerequisite for
Internet access, electronic publishers can greatly
expand their potential audiences.

Developed in partnership with X-Telnet Oy of Espoo,
Finland, RIPweb automatically translates HTML to
RIP-2 "on the fly," and supports HTML-3, including
tables, background images, text color and background
color specifications. The initial version of RIPweb
is written in Linux, and other UNIX versions are
under development.

To experience RIPweb's capabilities and enjoy free
World Wide Web access, RIPterm v2.2 users may dial
714-379-2134, and login as "guest." After an icon
download lasting about five minutes, users can travel
the World Wide Web without paying any Internet access
or time charges. Normal telephone toll charges do
apply.

RDATE:251295

HIGHLIGHTS:
Heavy snow from an early-week winter storm fell from
the Texas plains to Pennsylvania, bringing
much-needed moisture to small grain fields. Rain in
the southern Great Plains provided some relief to
wheat fields that were not already damaged from the
extended dry weather. In Florida, brief durations of
below-freezing temperatures did negligible damage to
citrus trees.

Low-volume irrigation continued in citrus groves
where leaf curl and wilt were evident. Harvest of
oranges for processing was active throughout
Florida's citrus region. Freezing weather burned some
of Florida's vegetable crops' leaves, but the extent
of the damage had not been determined. In the
southern Great Plains and the Delta States, minor
insect problems in small grains were reported in some
early wheat fields. Wheat in the Midwest was in
mostly good condition before the snow arrived. A dry
week was welcomed in the Pacific Northwest where some
standing water remained in low-land fields from last
week's storm. Light rainfall limited fieldwork in
northern California, while farther south, citrus
growers continued to pick fruit.

17 - 23, 1995 For additional information, call (202)
720-7917.

Highlights:
Quiet weather prevailed along the West Coast after
last week's major storm, owing to the development of
a jet-stream split over the eastern Pacific. Energy
coursing into the southern branch of the split jet
spurred the development of a significant storm. The
early- to midweek system eased drought in the central
and southern Plains, delivered heavy snow from the
Southwest to the Northeast, and dropped heavy rain on
the Gulf Coast States. In the storm's wake,
temperatures showed a remarkable uniformity,
resulting in above-normal readings in the North and
below-normal values across the South. Early in the
week, 4 to 10 inches of rain fell from eastern Texas
to northwestern Florida, causing widespread flash
flooding and minor river flooding. Two-day (December
17-18) totals reached 8.89 inches in Beaumont, TX,
8.84 inches in Lafayette, LA, and 7.68 inches in
Mobile, AL.

In addition to the heavy rain, severe weather,
including more than a dozen tornadoes, raked the
region. Meanwhile, urgently needed precipitation fell
across the central and southern Plains. In Lubbock,
TX, 0.45 inches of rain on Sunday ended a 75-day dry
spell, leaving the city 2 days shy of its
February-April 1972 all-time record. Dodge City, KS
measured 0.48 inches (5.0 inches of snow),
quadrupling their October 1 - December 15 total.
Storm-total snowfall on the southern Plains, whipped
by wind gusts in excess of 30 mph, reached 2.7 inches
in Amarillo, TX and 4.0 inches in Oklahoma City, OK.
Las Vegas, NM reported a maximum depth of 7 inches.
The northwestern half of the central Plains remained
critically dry, however. In Tribune, KS, only 0.13
inches of precipitation fell during the astronomical
autumn (September 23 - December 22), breaking a
record that had stood since 1939, when 0.18 inches
fell. Farther east, heavy rain fell as far north as
the lower Ohio River Valley, with heavy snow and ice
accumulations observed from the Midwest into the
Northeast.

December 18-19 snowfall topped 8 inches from central
Indiana to New England, driven by
north-to-northeasterly wind gusts that reached 43 mph
in Cleveland, OH (15.3 inches of snow) and 39 mph in
Indianapolis, IN (8.0 inches). In Youngstown, OH, an
11.6-inch total on Tuesday was their greatest
single-day December snowfall. The storm boosted the
astronomical-autumn snowfall to a record 25.4 inches
(three times normal) in Harrisburg, PA. Elsewhere in
the Northeast, snowfall included 10.0 inches in
Bridgeport, CT, 15.0 inches at New York City's La
Guardia Airport, and 15.7 inches in Portland, ME. The
storm dislodged remnant arctic air from northern
Maine that, on Sunday, resulted in minima as low as
-14 degrees F in Caribou and -9 degrees F in Houlton.
Although the storm stalled over southeastern Canada
after midweek, the resultant northwesterly flow
failed to deliver bitterly cold air.

East of the Rockies, the Nation's lowest temperature
after midweek was -12 degrees F, recorded on Friday
morning in Williston, ND. But the persistent flow
chilled the South, where on Thursday, Atlanta, GA
marked the first of 4 consecutive days with a high of
40 degrees F or below. On Saturday, the Nation's
highest reported temperature was 68 degrees F, in Key
West, FL. Farther north, cloudy, squally weather
plagued the Great Lakes States, where Pittsburgh, PA
spent 94 of the week's last 111 hours engulfed in
snow showers. Arctic air also remained absent from
the West, although in high-elevation valleys, lows on
Saturday morning dipped to -4 degrees F in Gallup, NM
and -12 degrees F in Ely, NV. Farther south,
late-week moisture streaked eastward, whitening the
southern Rockies and dampening Florida and southern
Texas. By Saturday morning, 4 inches of new snow
covered Red River, NM. Additional southern-stream
energy moved through southern California on Saturday,
delivering 0.77 inches of rain to Los Angeles.

-BELL ATLANTIC: Bell Atlantic ushers in new year with
$8 million in customer savings

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-BELL ATLANTIC: Bell
Atlantic ushers in new year with $8 million in
customer savings -- Touch-Tone price decreases by
one-third; other prices reduced
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:261295

CHARLESTON, W.VA. -- Bell Atlantic-West Virginia
customers will ring in the new year with $8 million
in savings, as the company is cutting by one-third
its prices for Touch-Tone service. Prices for two of
the company's local service plans also are
decreasing, and customers in several locations will
enjoy expanded unlimited calling within their local
calling areas.

Residential customers of Bell Atlantic-West Virginia
now will pay $1 a month for Touch-Tone service, down
from $1.50 a month. Business customers will pay $1.84
a month, down from $2.75 a month. These prices will
decrease by another third on Jan. 1, 1997, and will
be eliminated on Jan. 1, 1998.

In addition, prices will decrease for two residential
basic local service plans, Community Caller and
Frequent Caller. Community Caller, which offers
customers unlimited calling within their own
exchanges and measured calling to other exchanges in
their local calling area, now will cost $15 a month,
down from $15.80 a month. Frequent Caller, which
offers unlimited calling to all exchanges in a
customer's local calling area, will cost $29 a month,
down from $36.15 a month.

"These reductions are great news for hundreds of
thousands of our West Virginia customers whose
telephone bills will decrease," said Dennis Bone,
president and CEO of Bell Atlantic-West Virginia,
Inc. "These cuts, combined with price reductions
earlier this year for Bell Atlantic-carried long
distance calls and reductions as a result of prior
regulatory agreements, will save customers more than
$35 million a year by the end of 1998."

The latest price reductions are part of a 1994
agreement reached by Bell Atlantic, the West Virginia
Public Service Commission [PSC] staff and the PSC's
Consumer Advocate Division. This agreement provides
for continued price stability, with several price
reductions, through January 1998 while maintaining a
regulatory framework that provides Bell Atlantic with
incentives to continue to invest in its advanced
Mountain State telecommunications network.

With the current regulatory agreement, prices for
local service and Bell Atlantic-carried long distance
calls will have decreased or remained stable from
1985 through early 1998 -- nearly 13 years. 

Unlimited local calling areas expanded for certain
customers

In another change that becomes effective Dec. 31,
Bell Atlantic will expand local calling for its
Community Plus Caller customers in the following
exchanges:

* Calls between the Gilbert [664] and Iaeger [938]
exchanges. 

* Calls between the Fairmont [363, 366, 367, 368,
534] and Grafton [265] exchanges.

* Calls between the Hinton [466] and Meadow Bridge
[484] exchanges. 

* Calls made by customers in the Griffithsville [524]
exchange to the Hamlin [824] exchange.

Customers in these areas who subscribe to Bell
Atlantic's Community Plus Caller local service will
have unlimited local calling between these exchanges.

Bell Atlantic Corporation (NYSE: BEL) is at the
forefront of the new communications, entertainment
and information industry. In the mid-Atlantic region,
the company is the premier provider of local
telecommunications and advanced services. Globally,
it is one of the largest investors in the high-growth
wireless communication marketplace. Bell Atlantic
also owns a substantial interest in Telecom
Corporation of New Zealand and is actively developing
high-growth national and international business
opportunities in all phases of the industry.

Agricultural Prices Narrative

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL
STATISTICS SERVICE: Agricultural Prices Narrative
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295

December Prices Received Index Continues to Rise The
All Farm Products Index of Prices Received in
December was 107 based on 1990-92=100, up 1 point
(0.9 percent) from November. Price gains from
November for corn, hogs, soybeans, and eggs more than
offset price declines for broilers, turkeys, lemons,
and lettuce. The seasonal changes in the mix of
commodities farmers sell also can affect the overall
index level, but these changes were essentially
offsetting in December. Higher relative seasonal
marketings of wheat, tobacco, milk, and cotton offset
the effect of relatively lower seasonal marketings of
cattle, corn, soybeans, and grapes. Compared with
December 1994, the All Farm Products Index was 9
points (9.2 percent) higher. Higher year over year
prices for corn, hogs, wheat, and soybeans more than
offset lower prices for virtually all vegetables,
cattle, and calves. 

Prices Received by Farmers The December All Farm
Products Index was 107 percent of its 1990-92 base,
up 0.9 percent from November and 9.2 percent above
December 1994. All Crops: The December index, at 117,
was up 0.9 percent from November and 10 percent above
December 1994. Higher grain, oilseed, and cotton
prices in December more than offset lower vegetable
prices.

Oil-Bearing Crops: The index was 118, up 4.4 percent
from November and 20 percent above one year ago.
Higher prices for soybeans and peanuts more than
offset lower prices for cottonseed and sunflowers.
Soybean prices averaged $6.71 per bushel, up 32 cents
from the previous month. Dry weather concerns in
South America and good export demand are supporting
prices.

Food Grains: The December index, at 162, was up 3.2
percent from the previous month and 33 percent above
December 1994. Prices were higher for wheat and rice.
The December wheat price averaged $4.92 per bushel,
the highest since March 1974. Lower projected world
supplies and good export demand are supporting
prices.

Feed Grains & Hay: The December index was 132, up 5.6
percent from the previous month and 38 percent from
December 1994. Prices were higher for all feed
grains. The December corn price averaged $3.08 per
bushel, the highest since August 1984. The December
sorghum price averaged $5.66 per cwt, the highest
since November 1974. Tight supplies and strong export
demand continue to support feed grain prices.
Commercial Vegetables: The December index, at 93, was
9 percent below November and 42 percent below
December 1994. Contributing most to the monthly index
decline were lower prices for lettuce, celery, and
tomatoes pressured by ample supplies.

Fruit & Nuts: The December fruit and nuts index, at
84, declined 13 percent from the previous month but
was 17 percent above December 1994. Price increases
from November for apples, grapes, oranges, and
strawberries were more than offset by the effect of
lower grape marketings coupled with higher orange
marketings.

Livestock & Products: The December index was 96, up
2.1 percent from November and 6.7 percent above a
year ago. Higher hog and egg prices in December more
than offset lower poultry and cattle prices.

Meat Animals: The December meat animals index, at 84,
was up 2.4 percent from November and 1.2 percent from
December a year ago. The December hog price, at
$44.30 per cwt, increased $4.40 from November and was
$13.50 above the previous year. December weekly hog
slaughter levels have been running 5-10 percent below
year earlier numbers. December beef cattle prices
dropped slightly in December to $60.60, 10 cents
below a month earlier and $3.80 below December a year
ago.

Poultry & Eggs: The December index was 118, down 1.7
percent from November but up 15 percent from a year
earlier. Broiler and turkey prices declined
seasonally as demand typically increases for pork in
December. Both broiler and turkey prices are at
higher December levels than in recent years. Egg
prices continued to climb on strong seasonal use and
also are considerably higher than recent year levels.
Reliability of Prices Received by Farmers Estimates
Definition: Prices received represent sales from
producers to first buyers. They include all grades
and qualities. The average commodity price from the
survey multiplied by the total quantity marketed
theoretically should give the total cash receipts for
the commodity.

Survey Procedures: Primary sales data used to
determine grain prices were obtained from probability
samples of 2600 mills and elevators. These procedures
ensure that virtually all grain moving into
commercial channels has a chance of being included in
the survey. Generally, States surveyed account for 90
percent or more of total U.S. production. Livestock
prices are obtained from packers, stockyards,
auctions, dealers, and market check data from
AMS-USDA, private marketing organizations, and state
commodity groups and agencies. Inter-farm sales of
grain and livestock are not included since they
represent very small percentages of the total
marketings. Grain marketed for seed is also excluded.
Fruit and vegetable prices are obtained from sample
surveys and market check data from AMS-USDA, private
marketing organizations, state agencies, and
universities.

Summary and Estimation Procedures: Survey quantities
sold are expanded by strata to state levels and used
to weight average strata prices to a state average.
State prices are then weighted to a U.S. price based
on expanded marketings. Recommendations are prepared
by the State Statistical Offices and reviewed by the
Agricultural Statistics Board in Washington, D.C.
State recommendations are reviewed for reasonableness
with survey data, other States, and recent historic
estimates.

Revisions: For most items, the current month's price
represents a 3-5 day period around the mid-month.
Previous month's prices represent actual dollars
received for quantities sold during the entire month.
Revisions are published in monthly issues of
"Agricultural Prices" and in the annual summary
published in July. A schedule of monthly revisions is
published in the December issue of "Agricultural
Prices" and in the July annual summary.

Reliability: U.S. price estimates generally have a
sampling error of less than one half percent for the
major commodities such as corn, wheat, soybeans,
cotton, and rice. To assist users in evaluating the
reliability of prices received estimates for major
grain commodities, the "Root Mean Square Error" is
shown in the table on the next page. The "Root Mean
Square Error" is a statistical measure based on past
performance and is computed using the difference
between first and final estimates. The "Root Mean
Square Error" for the 5-month corn price is 0.2
percent. This means that chances are 2 out of 3 that
the current 5-month price of $2.47 per bushel will
not be above or below the final 5-month price by more
than 0.2 percent, or about half of a cent. Chances
are 9 out of 10 (90% confidence interval) that the
difference will not exceed 0.3 percent, or about
three-fourths of a penny.

respond to customer needs and to communicate the
values that characterise the company and its
commercial offer: freedom, ease of use, courtesy and
transparency. 

The new chain of stores is distinctly unique in both
its internal and external designs.  The floor plan
has been carefully laid out to ensure that customers'
pre and post sale needs are efficiently dealt with by
Omnitel staff.  Thus the store not only offers
handsets, accessories and an activation area but more
important, information and consulting. One corner is
dedicated to the company's                      
cellular service where customers can learn more about
Omnitel's tariff plans (Free Time, Night & Day,
Business Time); there is a display area for both
handsets and accessories; a counter dedicated to
service activation; a service area for post-sale
assistance where customers can pick up their
"complimentary emergency phones" should theirs
require maintenance.  In addition, customers can try
the Omnitel service by making a free telephone call

on Oftel licence review
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Mercury Communications responded positively to
today's publication by Oftel of proposals to amend
Mercury's operating licence.

Christopher Weston, Mercury's strategy manager said:
"Competition in the UK telecommunications market has
grown enormously since the end of the duopoly in
1991.  A 'slimline licence' will put us on an equal
footing with other operators in the market, give us
the freedom to compete more effectively and the
flexibility to meet our customers' individual needs.

"We also support the principle of replacing numerous
detailed licence obligations with a general licence
Condition to prevent and deter anti-competitive
behaviour. This would, in our view, provide
sufficient regulatory control in both the domestic
and international markets."

-HERO PRODUCTIONS: Master control, transmission,
production, post capabilities to be upgraded

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-HERO PRODUCTIONS: Master
control, transmission, production, post capabilities
to be upgraded
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:261295

Anticipating the growing needs of programmers and
producers, Hero Productions, the only full-service
international teleport, production and post
production facility in the southeastern U.S. -- and
one of a handful of teleports in the country to offer
automated master control services -- announced today
the launch of a 20,000-square-foot expansion and
acquisition plan, according to partners Robert Behar
and Daniel Sawicki. 

The strategy includes a new program origination
center, establishment of a tape library, and upgrade
of its post production suite and remote unit by
year-end 1995: purchase of its 23rd antenna, a
9.2-meter RSI, expected to be delivered in January
1996, and the addition of a 24th antenna soon after;
completion of a third studio 100'x50' with control
room by first quarter 1996; expansion of its
transmitter room and purchase of a second 12-channel
digital video compression system by June 30. and
equipping of a graphics suite by year-end 1996.

"The growing need for a facility such as ours that
can provide program origination in addition to
domestic and International uplink, production and
post production services. all under one roof,
dictated that we expand and upgrade our facilities to
accommodate future growth" said Behar, Hero
Productions president.

"With the first phase of our expansion, we will have
additional space to service uplink and master control
clients, in addition to greater studio, remote and
post capabilities!"

Hero Productions' new automated program origination
center will house three digital file servers with
over 630 gigabytes of on-line digital video and
stereo audio storage, In addition, the new
1,000-square-foot tape library will feature a
stat-of-the-art rolling shelf storage system and
computer database. 

According to Debar, Hero Productions' expansion also
is intended to capture a greater share of the
production and post production markets. 

"South Florida is attracting more production than
over before from West Coast- and New York-based
companies like Viacom and NBC.  In these prosperous
times, it's more important than ever that we develop
our facilities to meet the increasing demand," Behar
said.

Hero Productions, expanded post suite with new audio
booth was specifically designed to service the
everyday needs of programmers and producers cost-
effectively.  The facility's post capabilities are
based around an upgraded Calaway, CE200 editor with a
Microtime three-channel Impact DVE, Grass Valley 300
3 MIE.  Chyron Maxine character generator.  Beta, SP
BVW-70 and additional Sony VTRs.  The suite is
further equipped with a Yamaha PM1800 24-input audio
console and RTS communications,

"Our new Post suite will service most producers,
needs at less cost than other of the post suites
around town, and producers have the added value of
access to all of our other services," Behar said.

Hero Productions' 47 mobile unit has been upgraded to
include a Grass Valley 300 rotary wipe switcher with
back-up power supply and EMEM, and an Abekas A 51 DVE
with warp, and Abokas A-42 two-channel still store,
as well as a Yamaha PM1800 32-input audio console,
RTS communications, Digicart instant replay.  DAT

conditioning.  The remote unit is further equipped
with eight Hitachi SK cameras; an Abekas A-42 still
stare; a Chyron 4100 EXB With MGM, CCM and hard
drive, and Sony VTRs. 

The broadcast center's other offerings include
studios 60'X40' and 35'X30': four cuts-only edit
suites. two with standard conversion capabilities,
and fiber-optic and microwave transmission services. 
In addition, Hero Productions maintains long-term
leases on domestic and International transponders. 

The teleport currently uplinks 16 full-time signals.
including the newly-launched HTV, Travel Channel
Latin America, Discovery - Latin America, GEMS
Television, and Gamma Communications, which exports a

-SINGAPORE TECHNOLOGIES/SINGAPORE TELECOM: Singapore
& Chinese parties sign Asia Pacific comms agreement

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-SINGAPORE TECHNOLOGIES
TELEMEDIA/SINGAPORE TELECOM: Singapore and Chinese
parties sign agreement to provide mobile satellite
communications services in the Asia Pacific
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

Singapore Technologies Telemedia, Singapore Telecom
and four organizations from the People's Republic of
China today signed the Founders' Agreement for the
approximately US$640 million Asia Pacific Mobile
Telecommunications (APMT) project.

The four Chinese organisations are China Satellite
Launch & Tracking Control General, China Aero-Space
Corporation, China Unicorn Satellite
Telecommunication Co Ltd and China Telecommunications
Broadcast Satellite Corp.

Mr Lee Theng Kiat, President of Singapore
Technologies Telemedia, Mr Lim Toon, Executive Vice
President (International Services) of Singapore
Telecom, Mr Li Baoming, Director of China Satellite
Launch & Tracking Control General, Mr Zeng Qinglai,
Chief Engineer of China Aero-Space Corporation, Mr He
Feichang, Deputy Director of China Unicom Satellite
Telecommunication Co Ltd, and Mr Zhou Zehe, President
of China Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite
Corporation, signed the Agreement on behalf of their
respective companies.  The signing was witnessed by
Mr Mah Row Tan, Singapore's Minister for
Communications, and General Shen Chun Nian, Vice
Minister of China's Commission of Science, Technology
and Industry for National Defence. 

Seamless communications
APMT is a regional mobile satellite project providing
seamless mobile telecommunications services, through
National Service Providers in each country, in the
Asia Pacific region via a geostationary earth orbit
satellite system and a network of ground gateway
stations, The services include voice telephony,
facsimile and data transmission,

Communication is via handheld, vehicular or
fixed-site terminals.  Handheld terminals, the size
of normal cellular phones, will have dual-mode
facility to access either the APMT network or the
local cellular network.  The service will operate
through terrestrial cellular links where they are
available and satellite links where they are not. 
Users thus have the convenience of using their phones
almost anywhere in the region.

Residents and frequent visitors of areas where
cellular and fixed-line services are not available
will find APMT services most useful.  Frequent
business travellers in the region are also expected
to use APMT for roaming purposes.  Coverage will be
available from India in the west to Japan in the
cast, and from China in the north to Indonesia in the
south. 

Service to be launched in 1998
The APMT system is expected to be ready in the middle
of 1998.  A tender has been called for a turn-key
satellite system with a back-up satellite and
associated ground segment facilities.  The bids are
being evaluated and a decision will be announced
soon.

APMT services will be administered by Asia Pacific
Mobile Telecommunications (APMT) Satellite Pte Ltd, a
company incorporated in Singapore.  Initially,
Singapore Technologies Telemedia and Singapore
Telecom will share equally one third of the equity
stake, and the four Chinese parties will share two
thirds of the equity stake in the company.

APMT Satellite Pte Ltd will launch and operate the
APMT satellite system, coordinate with the National
Service Provider (NSP) of each country to set up the
necessary ground communications facilities and sell
air time to the NSPs.  Each NSP, licensed by the
local regulatory authority, will provide
interconnection to the local telephone network and
market and sell APMT services in its territory. 

Apart from capital injection by the six Founder
Members of APMT Satellite, additional funds will come
from external loans and internally generated funds
when the service is launched.  The Members are also
open to NSPs taking equity stakes in the company in
which case each Member's respective shareholding will
be reduced proportionately.

Growing demand
APMT will meet the growing demand for mobile phone
services in the Asia Pacific, a region of buoyant
economic growth and home to half the world's
population.  It has been estimated that the total
number of mobile phone subscribers in this region
grew by 96 per cent to over 15 million during the
year ending June 1995.

-DUN & BRADSTREET: More than 41,000 businesses
collapse in 1995

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-DUN & BRADSTREET: More
than 41,000 businesses collapse in 1995
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:291295

The drop in the annual rate of business failures in
Britain is disappointingly small accordingly to the
latest statistics on business failures in 1995
published today by Dun & Bradstreet, the business
information service.

41,303 business collapsed during 1995 as compared
with 43,598 during 1994.  The 5.3% drop is small when
compared with the 16-3% recorded between 1994 and
1993.  There was also a 4.6% increase in larger
company liquidations (from 16,335 to 17,280).  This
is the first increase in company liquidations for the
past three years.

More than 6,000 larger companies in London were
liquidated compared to 4,700 in 1994 an increase of
28%.  This large increase was in pan compensated for
by a 20% decrease in smaller business bankruptcies. 
But overall annual business failures in the capital
rose by 14%. 

NU Philip Mellor, D&B's Senior Analyst, said:
"There are worrying signs in these figures that
company liquidations are beginning to rise again in
the North and Scotland as well as in London, For the
past nine months we have witnessed an increasing
trend in company liquidations in the capital which
has now spread to other parts of the country.  It
remains to be seen in the coming months what impart
this will have on smaller companies."

During the last quarter of the year the number of
business failures in the North West increased by a
quarter from W to 1,054 and in the North East they
increased by 16% from 847 to 986, The disappointing
last quarter's figures meant there was little decline
in the overall business failure rates in both these
regions during the year.

In Scotland the business failure rate increased by
22% but because the law relating to bankruptcy in
Scotland differs to that in England and Wales, no
valid comparisons can be made between business
failure rates in Scotland and those in the rest of
Britain. 

Wales emerges as the region of the country with the
biggest decrease in business failures.  During 1995
the business failure rate dropped by 19% and there
were big falls in the business failure rate in the
south west (18.5%) and the South East (16.6%),

-INDUSTRY CANADA: Real gross domestic product at
factor cost by industry -- October 1995

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-INDUSTRY CANADA: Real
gross domestic product at factor cost by industry --
October 1995
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

Economic activity declined after growing moderately
during the summer months. Gross domestic product at
factor cost fell 0.3% in October, as domestic and
foreign demand retreated. The drop left production
0.3% below its most recent peak in January 1995. The
weakness was widespread, spanning several industrial
sectors.

Retailers suffered lower sales for a second
consecutive month. The weakness in consumer spending
was also evident in community, business and personal
services, as reflected in lower sales by lottery
corporations. Lower housing resales restrained growth
in the finance group.

Two sectors dropped the most: transportation and
storage services; and mining. These two sectors
accounted for approximately 45% of the overall
decline. Wholesale trade and the output of utilities
also receded. Manufacturing production and
construction activity were unchanged. 

Consumers reduced their spending once more
Retail sales fell 0.7% in October, after slipping
0.3% in September. Sales dropped in 11 of the 18
trade groups in October. Motor vehicle dealers posted
lower sales for a second consecutive month; after
slowing in September, the number of new vehicles sold
slumped 7.4% in October. Purchases of clothing
continued to fall, while spending on furniture and
household appliances eased for a second month in a
row.

Note to readers
The gross domestic product (GDP) of an industry is
the value added by factors of production when those
factors transform inputs purchased from other
industries into output.

Monthly GDP by industry is valued at 1986 prices. The
estimates presented here are seasonally adjusted at
annual rates. 

Widespread decline in wholesale trade
Wholesalers lost ground (sales fell 0.8%), after
gaining ground in August and September. As in retail
trade, sales of motor vehicles and parts and of
household goods deteriorated. Lower sales of
machinery and equipment and petroleum products
accentuated the overall decline. By contrast, grain
merchants and wholesalers of farm machinery posted
strong gains.

Mining sector slumped
After strengthening in each of the previous four
months, output in the mining sector fell 1.3% in
October. Production of crude oil and natural gas
decreased 0.6%. Natural gas production, which dropped
only marginally, has remained at almost the same
level since April 1995. With generally weak demand,
the price of natural gas has fallen steadily
throughout 1995. Although demand for natural gas
continued to weaken on domestic markets in October,
foreign demand has been firming up since August.

Coal production dropped 2.8%, following peak levels
of production between July and September. In October,
exports of coal returned to normal levels, but output
by thermal electric utilities fell sharply again.

Less drilling activity and lower production in base
metal mines also contributed to the weakness in the
mining sector.

Growth in manufacturing production paused
Manufacturing production was unchanged in October,
after improving during the previous three months.
Output was still 1.0% lower than its peak in January
1995. Production of primary metals and of electrical
and electronic equipment fell the most. Manufacturers
of paper and refined petroleum products also cut
their output.

Output in the wood industries continued to improve;
some of the production-mainly lumber-was accumulated
in inventories. Elsewhere in the wood industries, a
recent increase in the backlog of unfilled orders may
signal higher production in the coming months.
Manufacturers of chemical, plastic and metal
fabricated products were also among the producers who
raised output the most. Production of transportation
equipment advanced despite a decline in motor vehicle
assembly.

Output of primary metals fell 3.6% in October. The
weakness reflected a 6.6% decline in smelting and
refining of non-ferrous metals; production of primary
aluminum was affected by a labour dispute. Lower
nickel production accentuated the drop in the primary
metals industry.

Production of electrical and electronic equipment
fell 1.7%, reflecting a sharp decline in production
of office machinery. The decrease coincided with a
sharp drop in exports of office machinery and
equipment.

Manufacturers of pulp and paper products were
responsible for a 1.4% decline in the paper and
allied products industries. Foreign demand for pulp
tumbled in October, while shipments of newsprint to
the United States fell significantly. Despite the
strong declines in exports, manufacturers of pulp and
newsprint maintained production and accumulated
inventories.

Production of motor vehicle parts led a 0.8% gain in
transportation equipment production. However, part of
the production went into inventory, as motor vehicle
assemblers reduced their demand. In October,
production of motor vehicles fell in Canada and the
United States. Production in the aircraft industry
continued to gain momentum, however.

Growth in transportation services eased
Growth in transportation and storage services eased
(-1.5%), reflecting declines in air, rail and truck
transport. In rail transport, carloadings of most
commodities fell-especially alumina, coal and
containers-while carloadings of grain rose
substantially. A 2.4% decline in the transportation
of natural gas added to the overall weakness.

Activity in construction remains uncertain
Activity in construction was unchanged in October.
Declines in home-building and non-residential
construction offset a gain in engineering
construction. Home-building fell 0.9%, due mainly to
weakness in the construction of apartments.
Construction of single dwellings inched ahead and,
for the first time since June 1994, improved for two
consecutive months. In October, the number of
building permits issued rebounded, mainly for
multiple dwellings. Activity on non-residential
building projects fell marginally following strong
growth during the summer months. In October, activity
on industrial projects continued to rise, but
activity eased on commercial projects. 

Other industries
Output in the finance group advanced 0.2%, after
slipping 0.2% in September. Real estate sales fell in
several provinces for a second month in a row;
however, advances by securities brokers, mutual funds
and stock exchanges were enough to offset the drop.

The output of utilities fell a further 1.3%, as
demand for electricity and natural gas continued to
sag.

industry (15-001, $14/$140) will be released in

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-INDUSTRY CANADA:
Employment, earnings and hours -- October 1995
(preliminary)
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:221295

The number of people employed by businesses was
unchanged in October at 10,746,000. Employment
increased in business services and in finance,
insurance and real estate, but declined in retail
trade and miscellaneous services. Since January 1995,
businesses have added on average 12,000 employees to
their payrolls each month. This pace of growth was
50% slower than in 1994. Since the beginning of the
year, employment gains have been led by community,
business and personal services; manufacturers; and
retail and wholesale trade establishments. Public
administration was the only industry to report a
substantial employment decline during this period.

Provincially, the gains in employment since the
beginning of the year have been focussed mainly in
Ontario and British Columbia; to a lesser extent,
there have been gains in Quebec and New Brunswick.

Table: Employment gains from January to October 1995

Ontario                           51,000
British Columbia                  41,000
Quebec                            29,000
New Brunswick                      8,000

Employees' weekly earnings, after increasing by $4.75
in August, have since remained stable. During the
past year, employees' earnings have increased by only
$5.96 per week (+1.0%). During the same period, the
rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price
index rose 2.4%.

Higher than average earnings increases were
registered for employees in finance, insurance and
real estate as well as mining, quarrying and oil
wells. Employees in public administration and in
logging and forestry services saw their earnings
decline.

Manufacturers maintained recent gains
Manufacturers employed slightly more workers in
October, maintaining the strong gains of the previous
two months. This easing of employment growth
coincided with a dampening of manufacturers'
shipments, a contraction in unfilled orders and an
expansion of inventories. Manufacturers have been one
of the stronger sectors maintaining growth in the
economy in 1995. They have added 4,200 employees on
average to their payrolls each month since January
1995, compared with an average of 3,700 employees per
month in 1994. Average hours for manufacturing
employees paid by the hour have strengthened in
recent months, after following a declining trend
since the start of the year. Similarly, strong
earnings growth in August and September was
maintained in October, as earnings were unchanged.
These recent gains more than offset the drop in
earnings during the first seven months of the year. 

Growth stalled for retailers
Following no change in September, the number of
employees in retail trade fell by 11,000 in October.
The recent movement in retail trade employment has
run counter to the increasing trend observed since
October 1994. It also coincides with retail sales,
which fell in October after remaining stable in
September. The drop in retail employment and sales
was most evident in Ontario. Employees' weekly
earnings rose 0.4% in October to $346.06. Following
substantial monthly fluctuations, earnings in retail
trade returned to the April 1995 level.

Fluctuations continued in miscellaneous services
Fluctuations in the number of employees in
miscellaneous services, which began in the fall of
1994, continued in October with a decrease of 7,000
employees. (Miscellaneous services includes
amusement, recreation, personal, and household
services, membership organizations and other
services.) These strong monthly fluctuations left
employment down slightly from its August 1994 peak.
In October, the drop was concentrated in British
Columbia, and affected mainly amusement and
recreation services.

In October, weekly earnings for employees continued a
growth trend that began in April 1995. Average
earnings in miscellaneous services rose 0.8% in
September, to $394.45.

Employment declined again in public administration,
but at a slower pace 
The declining trend in public administration
employment accelerated between January and July 1995.
On average, this sector reduced employment by 3,000
employees per month during this period. Since then,
the rate of decline has slowed; the number of
employees declined by only 700 since July. During the
past three months, declines continued in federal and
provincial administrations. These were partly offset
by increased employment in local administration.
Weekly earnings for public administration employees
were 0.6% less than in October 1994.

Special trade contractors reduced employment
Construction companies cut employment by 4,000 in
October. The decline was concentrated among special
trade contractors, who reduced their number of
employees by 6,000. The declining trend in
residential construction employment since the start
of 1995 appears to have halted, as the number of
employees increased for the fifth time in six months.
This coincided with recent growth in the value of
residential building permits.

indicators are available from the standard tables in

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-ANALYSYS: A window on the
world telecoms marketplace
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

A second edition of a directory that has been
described as 'essential for decision-makers' has just
been published by telecommunications consultants,
Analysys. 

The World Telecoms Marketplace, 1996 opens a window
onto one of the world's fastest-moving industries. 
The directory and databook contains details of the
world's telecoms operators, service providers,
manufacturers and regulators, including the names of
senior staff.  More than 1900 organisations, 6500
named contacts, and over 135 countries are covered. 
It also has invaluable market data segmented by
product, region or company type. 

Dr Pekka Tarjanne (Secretary-General of the
International Telecommunication Union) states in his
Foreword to the directory that it supplies, "the
information which is essential for decision-makers
who need to make their way around the labyrinth of
the telecoms industry." 

Information is provided in a flexibly accessible
manner via cross-referenced indexes.  These allow the
user to discover information on the basis of product,
service category, geographical region, or individual
organisation.

It is the only directory of its kind produced by
dedicated telecoms consultants.  Editor Michael
Denmead said:
"The World Telecoms Marketplace 1996 has its roots in
the wealth of contacts and experience our consultancy
work has produced.  It is a single-source reference
for telecoms professionals, procurement managers, and
sales and marketing teams."

The World Telecoms Marketplace 1996 does not just
cover the major players and global service providers. 
It is a source of primary information on the small
and medium sized enterprises which increasingly
comprise an important part of the telecoms sector. 
These include the emerging mobile and new network
operators who are attracted by the opportunities
around the world which are being created by
liberalisation.  Also to be found within its pages
are the service providers and software development
companies which have sprung up to provide support
services based on the development of intelligent
telecoms networks.

-INFORMIX: Informix to acquire Illustra Information
Technologies

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-INFORMIX: Informix to
acquire Illustra Information Technologies --
Combination to give significant technology lead in
database market
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

Informix, the open distributed data management
company, today announced an agreement to acquire
Oakland, Calif.-based Illustra Information
Technologies, Inc., the leading supplier of dynamic
content management database software and tools for
managing complex data in the Internet,
multimedia/entertainment, financial services and
earth sciences and other markets. 

Approximately 12.9 million shares of Informix common
stock will be issued to acquire all outstanding
shares of Illustra.  An additional 2.1 million
Informix shares will be reserved for issuance in
connection with the assumption of Illustra's
outstanding stock options.  Informix currently has
approximately 135 million shares of stock
outstanding.  The acquisition of Illustra will be
accounted for as a tax free pooling of interest. 

The acquisition will enable Informix to integrate
Illustra's dynamic content management system into its
core parallel database technology, Dynamic Scalable
Architecture (DSA). Informix believes that this
technology integration will give the combined
organisation a significant market advantage over
competing database vendors in providing a powerful
database engine to support the next wave of database
applications - such as Web applications - which
require high-performance and scalability coupled with
dynamic content management capabilities.

Both companies realise that the Web is driving a
large and rapidly-growing new market for information
management.  This new market, which is driving a

Industry Comments on Informix/Illustra Announcement
"In looking for an information management solution to
support our Internet products, we surveyed the entire
database market and concluded that Illustra was way
ahead of the pack in terms of understanding and
supporting this emerging class of complex multimedia
data types. We needed an architecture that could be
adapted and extended to include any type of complex
data. both now and in the future.  Illustra was the
only company able to deliver this kind of extensible,
dynamic content management.  With the number of
online users growing 30% per month, we also needed a
high performance, scalable data management solution. 
Informix is the ideal complement to Illustra because
of its proven parallel processing capabilities and
ability to deliver very high performance.  Together,
they are truly the database for cyberspace."

Linda Dozier
Chief Scientist, NaviSoft division
America Online

"The emergence of multimedia and other complex data
types is driving the need for more processing power,
from the home, to the desktop and up through the
enterprise.  With this comes the need for a database
management system that can control all this rich data
and facilitate the development and deployment of
multimedia.  Both companies have been important
partners for us because of their technologies.  We
see Illustra as a primary enabling technology for
this next generation of computing applications. 
Informix has the scalability and parallel processing
features essential for making dynamic multimedia
content ubiquitous, whether its delivered on an
interactive entertainment appliance to the home, or
on a massively parallel computer to the enterprise."

Dave House
Senior Vice President and General Manager,
Enterprise Server Group
Intel

"This announcement is a major step forward for the
industry.  Historically, relational database
companies have done a great job with structured data
but haven't addressed unstructured content.  The
Internet revolution makes handling and manipulating
documents, images, video, and a wide range of other
unstructured media types extremely important.  The
combination of Informix and Illustra shows that
Informix is really stepping up to the plate on
providing state-of-the-art systems for handling
unstructured content to its customers and partners. 
In addition, the Netscape LiveWire Pro visual
environment does a great job of connecting Web
servers to relational databases such as Informix and
Illustra.  Netscape LiveWire Pro, in conjunction with
the Informix/Illustra database technology, will make
storing and manipulating data on the net easier than
ever."

-PSION: PSION HC120 handheld computers used by Thames
Water maintenance engineers

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PSION: PSION HC120
handheld computers used by Thames Water maintenance
engineers, meter readers and water quality staff
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

It's a tough world for the Psion HC120 handheld
computers used by Thames Water's maintenance
engineers, meter readers and water quality staff. 
The HCs have been dropped down manholes, flung from
the roofs of speeding vans and even stolen.  Yet so
far, Thames has not lost any data as a result of
these testing conditions. 

In 1991, Thames carried out a study into the new
systems the business needed to improve efficiency and
quality of services.  It found three areas collecting
water and waste water samples, meter reading, and
scheduling distribution work where portable computers
would help to streamline the process.  The company
talked to as many suppliers of handheld computers it
could find up to 30 and was impressively thorough. 

Psion met the three key criteria.  The first was the
functionality of the HC series.  The second was the
modularity of the Psion approach: applications and
hardware options such as modems, bar code readers and
memory packs could be added easily.  And third was
value for money.   The Psion HC was the only product
we looked at that met all our selection criteria,'
says Dr Mike Hanbury, manager of Business Systems
Division, a group set up within Thames Water's
Management Services Division.

Thames has developed its own software for its field
applications.  In November 1991 it began work on the
Mobile Job Management System, the handheld
counterpart of an application that ruins on an IBM
mainframe.  Essentially, it's a field engineer
management system adapted for the water industry.  It
allocates work, such as checking for leaks and other
possible problems. 
A customer agent at the Thames Customer Centre takes
reports of leaks and other problems of supply, and
raises a job on the mainframe if appropriate.  The
system allocates the job to a network services
technician, (the water board inspector of old).  It
is then downloaded to the technician's HC, either
directly, or from a supervisor's HC in the field. 

The technician completes the job, and enters the
details into the HC, from which they are transferred
to the supervisor's HC.  The supervisor returns to
the depot, and uploads the details to the main
system.  Within 24 hours full details are on the
mainframe, so if the person who reported the. fault
rings again, they can be told what has been done. 
The network services technician also collects
information from data loggers, supplied by Radcom,
which record water flow rates in the mains for
leakage control and similar data. 

Thames intends to transfer the data from the HC to
the mainframe over radio, an approach already used by
other Psion clients such as Bass Leisure Machine
Services for its field engineers.  "The things the
Bass engineers are doing in the field are obviously
totally different, but there isn't much difference in
the approach," says Hanbury. 

Full roll-out of the Mobile Job Management System was
complete by the beginning of this year, with 400
technicians handling more than 4,000 jobs every day. 
Water sample collection, with software once again
written by Hanbury's Field Information Systems team,
went live in October 1993.  Used by water quality
inspectors, this system interfaces with TAPS the
Thames Advanced Pre-scheduling System.  Inspectors
enter details of the sample collection point, time
and date.  Bottles containing the samples are bar
coded, and all internal bar code scanner in the HC is
used to link the bottle to the record.  Eighty of
these are now in use.

70 Thames meter readers began to use HCs on 19 July
1993.  The meter readers work from home, and use the
HC's internal modem to get details from the depot of
next day's 'walk' using their home telephones.  On
the walk itself, they record meter readings and ally
problems.  Once home, they send this data to the
Thames customer information system, where it is
available for billing and analysis.

Thames is now looking at another application, its
Planned Maintenance Services (PMS) system, for
mobile, paperless operation using the Psion HC.  Job
management and planned maintenance are quite similar. 
"If you were there on day one, you would probably
only build one system for both jobs, but they were
taken in as packages, serving different parts of the
business," says Hanbury.  "The PMS looks after fixed
assets such as pumps and other electrical or
mechanical systems."

Mobile planned maintenance will be used by those
servicing one of Thames' most exciting projects, the
London Ring Main.  Longer than the Channel Tunnel and
deeper than London Under-round, this huge main has a
bore of between 100 and 125 inches. The relationship
between Psion and Thames is important to both
companies.  'Bearing in mind that we've now got more
than 600 units out there, it's very important to our
business that we get the working relationship with
them right in terms of support, says Hanbury.  'It's
important that if we have a hardware problem, Psion
will fix it and fix it fast.  But to date, we haven't
had a true hardware fault.

The planned maintenance and job management systems
are good candidates for a mobile geographical
information system, using digitised large scale maps
of streets, mains, hydrants and manholes.  The Psion
HCs have the potential to display maps should Thames
decide to take this approach.

-PSION: Need a new pump sir?  We'll be round in
thirty seconds

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PSION: Need a new pump
sir?  We'll be round in thirty seconds
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

In the fast moving drinks market, having an edge over
the competition is vitally important.  In many cases,
this means investing in the very latest technology. 
But new machines bring their own problems and both
the customer and the consumer have to be convinced of
the benefits.

Landlords or pub managers may find that more and more
of their keg technicians arrive armed with computers
instead of pen and paper.  HP Bulmer Limited were one
of the first to "go techno" equipping their staff
with the top selling Psion handheld range.  And the
customers, initially reticent about the new
technology, became swift converts to the new system
when they saw the benefits it could provide. 

Bulmer's IT Manager, Robin Flower, tells the story of
a moody landlord who phoned the telesales desk of
Bulmer to ask for a Strongbow pump to be fitted in
his pub.  He put the phone down and saw a man
standing at the bar with a hand-held computer.
"Bloody yuppies," the landlord mumbled to himself and
strode forward to serve the computer-toting gent.
`Good afternoon," said the man, "I'm from Bulmer.  I
understand you're looking for a Strongbow pump?"

As the telesales staff had been typing in the details
of the landlord's request, a keg technician 200 yards
up the road from the pub had been accessing the
company's database at the same time from his Psion
handheld computer.  A coincidence?  Yes, but it shows
the customer service benefits computers can bring to
a company. 

Bulmer are the world's largest cider manufacturer and
they hold 45% of the cider market in the UK. 
Strongbow and Woodpecker are the top two cider brands
respectively and are served in some 60,000 pubs,
clubs and bars.  The company's database which holds
all of this information is affectionately known at
Bulmer as the "pub universe".  This database contains
vast quantities of information ranging from a retail
outlet's history right up to plans and profiles for
marketing future products. 

With only 33 keg technicians to manage their 60,000
outlets, the task of scheduling a day's work at
Bulmer was a huge one.  Apart from new installations,
there are maintenance audits to be carried out.  The
sheer size of Bulmer's "pub universe" - they have GBP
33 million worth of equipment in pubs and clubs -
makes it very difficult to manage and there were
instances where some of their equipment hadn't been
seen for over a year!

Bulmers sought a technological solution to the
problem. "We are the No. 1 cider manufacturer in the
world," says Flower.  "We want to stay one step ahead
of the pack to remain No. 1. With the Psion handheld
computer the whole scheduling process has been
simplified and streamlined, and the "pub universe" is
put to much better use." 

Nowadays there is no need for keg technicians to make
costly phone calls to the office to find out their
next jobs.  Using the Psion and a modem, up to three
days work can be scheduled, including suggested ways
to get there.  These more flexible routes not only
start and end as close to the technician's home as
possible, but have allowed the scheduling of spot
audits to check up on the company's "missing"
equipment. 

The benefits of using the "Keg Technician System" are
greater efficiency leading to cost savings.  "With
better journey planning and scheduling, Bulmer's keg
technician's call rate has increased from five to
nine calls daily and as a result, Bulmers can now
provide better customer service," Flower continues. 
Further benefits have been due to more regular audits
in the field helping reduce Bulmer equipment losses
from 10% to 7% per year.

Overall, Bulmer's has saved an estimated GBP 1m so
far on its investment of GBP 250,000 and is expected
to save a potential GBP 3m in total by using the
Psion "Keg Technician System".

RDATE:201295

Psion PLC, the international manufacturer of portable
computers and datacommunications products, will be
exhibiting at SERVICE MANAGEMENT EUROPE 1996, (stand
121). 

In April 1995, the Workabout product range was
launched for corporate industrial markets. This
product family provides a cost-effective solution for
applications at the lower end of the corporate market
place complementing the HC range and building oil the
success enjoyed for so many years by the Organiser
family in this area.  Initial market reaction to the
Workabout has been positive.  The Organiser 11 family
continued to sell well for a range first brought to
the market in 1986.

The outlook for HC Corporate products is for stronger
growth in 1995-6, with applications for railway
ticketing, field service, transport and inventory
management.  Interim results (for the six months
ended 30th June 1995) showed sales of the HC
Corporate products were ahead at GBP 3.98m (1994 -
GBP 3.60m).

Highlights are as follows:                            
                    1995        1994          CHANGE

* International sales up 46% to GBP 18.55m (1994 -
GBP 12.71m)
* Turnover in the US was up 65% at GBP 4.76m (1994
GBP 2.88m)
* Sales in the United Kingdom rose 37% to GBP 21.27m
(1994: GBP 15.57)
* Sales of the Series 3 and 3a were up 48% at GBP
24.74m (1994 GBP 16.73m) 

David Potter, Chairman, said today:
"During the first half, trading was at record levels,
margins improved and significant cash was generated. 
However, stronger growth was constrained by limited
supplies of certain semiconductors.  During the
second half, higher deliveries are promised but there
will also be substantial investment in both marketing
and research and development.  Demand levels are
strong and in August a third high-capacity
surface-mount production line was added at a cost of
GBP 1.1m. The outlook for the rest of the year is
good."

-PSION: Bass - facing up to the challenges of the
1990s

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PSION: Bass - facing up
to the challenges of the 1990s
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

The humble slot machine has become a permanent
feature in pub entertainment.  BLit behind the bright
lights, whirring reels and endless "nudges" lies a
highly sophisticated business. One of the major
players is Bass Leisure Management Systems (BLMS),
part of the Bass drinks group.  They have 42,000
machines spread across 10,000 sites and every week
400 of their staff count a staggering GBP 3 million
in cash from machines all around the country. 

Traditionally, when the cash was collected, the split
between BLMS and the pubs had to be calculated
manually.  "This process was open to errors as large
as 25 per cent," said Mike England, Computer Services
Manager at BLMS.  "We felt the answer was to automate
the collection system." BLMS examined some of the
finest high tech solutions available and chose the
Psion HC.

At the user end, the BLMS system consists of a small
hand-held terminal - no bigger than a calculator with
an in-built modem - and a till-roll printer with a
specially designed case. Information about the
machines to be visited and the terms and conditions
which apply to them is downloaded each night to a PC
at the BLMS depot.  The collectors then transfer this
information onto their Psion terminals either
directly from the PC or via the telephone. Collected
information is then up-loaded to the computer in the
same way. 

The immediate benefit was to the collectors. 
Chrissie Holt, the first collector to use tile system
said: "Psion have made our jobs so much easier. 
Everything we do now is self- explanatory.  We can
now do more work, cover more machines and it is much
easier to get things right first time!"

The biggest benefit to BLMS is cost savings with the
initial investment being recouped within two years
but other pluses have emerged also.  Psion terminals
provide managers with important information on
efficiency and we are able to identify problems early
and take appropriate action, for example, by
providing further training." 

The full benefits for BLMS are yet to come.  As well
as speeding up the process, it will produce cost
savings of GBP 80,000 a year on stationery alone.

CompuServe is aggressively developing more advanced
features to create a specialised business-oriented
service.  Businesses are invited to start now in Our
World and upgrade to the more advanced corporate
service when it becomes available.

"The World Wide Web is the next great frontier, and
everyone wants to stake a claim to some of that real
estate," said Rob Mainor, CompuServe's vice president
of product marketing and business information
systems.  "We're offering a free Web publishing
service to businesses now, then we'll follow it up
with more advanced business-oriented service in the
coming months.

"We've received tremendous feedback about how
flexible and easy-to-use our Web publishing tools are
for novices," Mainor added.  "That was not surprising
since new computer users were our target audience. 
The overwhelming demand from businesses demonstrates
the strength of the design of the Home Page Wizard,
since it works so well for both market segments"
CompuServe's home page authoring tools, the Home Page
Wizard and Publishing Wizard, are currently available
for free to members of the CompuServe Information
Service (GO HPWIZ).  Members can use the Home Page
Wizard or virtually any of the more advanced home
page creation tools on the market to build a page and
publish it in the Our World area on the Web. To date,
more than 17,000 personal home pages have been posted
in the Our World area by CompuServe members.  The
Home Page Wizard software package was downloaded from
the CompuServe Information Service over 35,000 times
in the first ten days of availability.

technology transfer news letter

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-EUROPEAN COMMISSION: New
look innovation and technology transfer news letter
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

The Innovation and Technology Transfer newsletter
published by the European Commission has been
relaunched.  The newsletter, which aims among other
things to help disseminate R&D information more
widely amongst potential users, now has separate
editions for English, French and German speaking
readers.  It presents its vast range of information
in a bright, accessible format that should open new
areas of interest to every reader.

Innovation and Technology Transfer is published six
times a year by the European Commission's Innovation
Programme, which aims to strengthen Europe's
innovation infrastructure and disseminate research
results to industry.  The emphasis is on providing
timely news relevant to these objectives and in-depth
case studies about successful projects.  This enables
readers to gain an insight into topics that directly
reflect their own concerns and requirements.

Readers who are not involved with the Innovation
Programme's work are given a chance to see how
successful and potentially useful that work can be;
those who are already benefiting from the initiatives
can gain from the cross-fertilisation of ideas and
results that characterises the nature of the
programme.  Innovation and Technology Transfer offers
subjects as diverse as 'cleaner magnesium
production', 'designing energy efficient offices' and
'planning for the future in IT'.  Some topics are
weighted towards industrialists and some towards the
research laboratory.  In all, it is a broad, lively
view of the wealth of EU research and technological
development activities, with the accent on
exploitation of these activities' results. 

The newsletter also publishes more general
information that is relevant to the Innovation
programme.  The Policy News section discusses new
initiatives and legislation.  The articles here bring
out the impact of policy changes across the EU; they
also provide a forum in which new programmes can be
announced. Innovation Programme News covers the
latest news from this programme, including details of
new measures to promote an 'innovation-friendly'
environment in Europe, and publications and
information services to assist with technology
transfer, as well as news on funding possibilities
offered by the programme. 

Summaries of important new publications and
announcements of conferences take up the final part
of each issue of the newsletter.  Availability
details are given for the publications and sources
for obtaining more information given for the
conferences. In fact. a feature of Innovation and
Technology Transfer is that throughout the newsletter
contact points are cited at the end of each article,
so that readers can easily see how to obtain further
information.  With the accessibility offered by
Innovation and Technology Transfer there is no excuse
for readers not to participate fully in the disparate
fields which come under the Innovation Programme
umbrella.

-EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  A guiding hand through EU
acronyms

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  A
guiding hand through EU acronyms
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

A new publication from the European Commission offers
help to those whose interest in European Union
research is sometimes hindered by the use of
acronyms.  An increasing part of research and
development vocabulary, the use of acronyms helps
reduce long-winded terminology and enables complex
ideas to be contained in simple phrases.  However,
where acronyms come together in large numbers, the
aim of offering simplicity is often overturned and
the meaning of the information can become confused.

'European Union R&D Acronyms' is a single desktop
reference tool for those wanting to know more about
EU RTD activities.  It is a facet of the EU's
commitment to spreading the message about its
research activities and opening up information to an
ever-increasing target audience.  The intention is to
ensure that as many people as possible have access to
the core information about EU research, to encourage
exploitation of results and participation in current
programmes. 

Within the dictionary the 4,900 entries are explained
in alphabetical order.  The entry for each acronym
also identifies the originating body and the general
programme area to which the acronym belongs.  This
extra information helps set the acronym in context
and provides a clearer idea of the background to the
project or programme to which the acronym refers. 
Users can not only establish the meaning of an
acronym but can ascertain the wider context implied
by its use. 

The dictionary is based on the information held in
one of the databases of CORDIS, the Community
Research and Development Information Service which is
operated under the European Union's Innovation
Programme.  It also serves as a means to alert
potential users to CORDIS and the other information
products offered by this service.  For existing users
of CORDIS the dictionary also offers a concise
explanation of the various subject codes found in the
databases and can thus be used as part of the query
forming process when interrogating CORDIS. Absolute
newcomers to EU RTD are recommended to register with
CORDIS for a more complete and current information
resource, although the content of 'European Union R&D
Acronyms' has a potential value for everyone
interested in this area of activity.

'European Union R&D Acronyms' is published by the
Office for Official Publications of the European
Communities at a price of ECU 25 and is available
from all the Office's sales agents in EU members
states and worldwide.

-INDEPENDENT TELEVISION COMMISSION: Viewing of cable
channels on the increase

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-INDEPENDENT TELEVISION
COMMISSION: Viewing of cable channels on the increase
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:231295

Cable and satellite channels have regained some of
the audience share lost in 1994, according to the
ITC's most recent survey of viewing in broadband
cable homes.  The share of viewing taken by cable and
satellite channels increased between October 1994 and
October 1995 from 34.9% to 39.6%, while BBC1's share
fell from 24.3% in 1994 to 21.2% in 1995.  Viewing
shares remained fairly constant for ITV and BBC2 over
the two years but Channel 4's share also fell by one
percentage point.

Sky One remained overall the most popular cable
channel, with a share of 4.8% although this share has
fallen from 6.6% recorded in 1994 and 9.6% in 1993. 
Indeed, in the league table of audience shares (table
1) Sky One dropped to third cable place for the first
time behind the Movie Channel (5.8%) and Sky Movies
(5.2%) within homes receiving these channels.

1995 has been a successful year for cable and
satellite channels targeted at the child audience. 
Children's viewing of cable and satellite channels as
a whole accounts for over half of their total viewing
(54.4% of 2 to 15 year olds viewing in October 1995
compared to 47.3% in October 1994).  The preference
for the "new" channels is even more pronounced
amongst the younger age groups with viewing of cable
and satellite channels accounting for 63.9% of
viewing amongst 2 to 9 year olds.  Most notably, the
viewing share for the Cartoon Network has risen
across all individuals from 2.0% in 1994 to 4.5% in
1995.

Amongst 2 to 9 year olds this share reaches 30.5%.
The recently launched Disney Channel accounts for
1.8% of total viewing rising to 6.2% of all
children's viewing (2 to 15 year olds), and 10.1% of
the younger age group (2 to 9 year olds).  The
Children's Channel, one of the longest running cable
and satellite channels. now re-launched as TCC, also
fared well in 1995.  Viewing shares amongst all
individuals doubled (from a 0.6% share in 1994 to a
1.3% share in 1995), while amongst children (2 to 15
year olds) this share rose to 5.1% of all viewing.

Other key results from the study are:
* The proportion of viewers with 2 or more decoders,
giving television sets in different rooms access to
the range of cable channels, increased from 28.4% in
1994 to 34.8% in 1995.  This benefits the more
specialised channels which may appeal to individual
members of the family.  Thematic channels such as the
Movie Channel, Sky Movies, Sky Sports and The Cartoon
Network, achieved greater audience shares in homes
with multiple set connections.  This increased both
the total amount of viewing in those homes, by 2.8
hours a week per viewer, and the cable and satellite
share, which rose to 41.9% compared to 38.3% in
single connection homes.

* Viewers in higher socioeconomic groups continue to
remain lighter viewers of cable and satellite
channels although this characteristic has become less
pronounced (a 33.2% share amongst AB viewers in 1995,
compared with a 24.1% share in 1994).  Cable and
satellite channels disproportionately favoured by AB
viewers in 1995 were Sky One, Sky Sports and
Nickelodeon.

* The socio-economic difference in viewing patterns
has become less marked over the years.  The heavy
skew towards DE viewing of cable and satellite
channels has declined from 54.1% in 1993 to 34.7% in
1994 and 38.1% in 1995 compared to an overall average
viewing of 39.6% in 1995.  DE viewers watched
proportionally more of Sky Movies, The Movie Channel,
UK Gold, The Cartoon Network and The Disney Channel.

* The amount of self-reported time spent viewing
television in broadband homes overall has decreased
slightly to an average of 25.13 hours per week in
1995, compared to 25.32 in 1994.  Amongst children
this tendency has been dramatically reversed with
overall viewing amongst 2 to 15 year olds increasing
from 19.95 hours in 1994 to 22.47 hours in 1995. 
This is largely accounted for by increased viewing of
child-friendly channels such as The Cartoon Network,
The Disney Channel and TCC, together with the
continued appeal of Nickelodeon.

* The level of expressed satisfaction with cable
television services remains very high overall,
although slightly lower than in 1994 (86.4% said they
were very or quite satisfied/pleased with the
services in 1995, compared with 87.2% in 1994). 
Satisfaction is higher amongst viewers in homes
subscribing to premium channels, with 92.3% of
respondents in homes receiving all three Sky Movie
Channels plus Disney stating that they were very
(32.1%) or quite (60.2%) pleased with the service.

Technical Notes
The ITC's study was undertaken by Continental
Research over a two week period in October.  It was
based on a total of 1,306 one- week diaries derived
from 653 respondents aged 2 years old and over
representative of broadband cable viewers in 39 cable
franchises in different parts of the country.  The
diaries covered the two weeks from Monday 16 October
to Sunday 29 October 1995.

This is the latest in a series of similar studies,
conducted by Continental Research for the Cable
Authority in 1990 and for the ITC in 1991, 1992, 1993
and 1994.  The ITC plans to publish a review of these
studies early in 1996.

Tables giving more detailed information are attached. 
Copies of the full report are available from
Continental Research priced GBP 150.00.

-WARRANTECH: Warrantech moves into UK

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-WARRANTECH: Warrantech
moves into UK
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:020196

Warrantech Corporation, the rapidly-expanding
provider of extended guarantees, service contracts
and database management services which has operations
in the USA, Canada, Mexico and Japan, has opened a
European headquarters in Marylebone Road, London. 

The move follows the acquisition by Warrantech of
Southwark-based Home Guarantee Corporation Pie and
the formation of Warrantech Europe Plc, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Warrantech Corporation. 
Home Guarantee Corporation plc provides UK homebuyers
and sellers with a range of extended warranty
products through members of The National Association
of Estate Agents (NAEA). 

In addition to Home Guarantee Corporation, Warrantech
Europe will comprise four other UK divisions -
Warrantech Automotive, Warrantech Consumer Product
Services, Warrantech Creditor and Warrantech Training
and Motivation.

From their Grove House headquarters in Marylebone
Road, the divisions will provide extended warranty
products on a wide range of equipment including cars,
business equipment, office and home computers, mobile
telephones, and major domestic appliances. 
Warrantech Europe will also provide a full database
management, marketing and customer care service for
clients in the automotive, financial, manufacturing,
retail and service sectors.

Major UK clients already include the NAEA, Office
World and the Hartwell Motor Group and the company is
currently in negotiation to provide extended
warranties and other marketing services to a number
of major UK and Continental companies.

One of the leading publicly-quoted warranty companies
in the U.S. (NASDAQ symbol: WTEC), Warrantech
Corporation is an associate company of American
International Group, one of the world's largest
insurance companies with global assets of more than
$100 billion.

Warrantech Corporation Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Joel San Antonio said the decision to
establish Warrantech Europe with a headquarters in
London was part of the Corporation's stated objective
to become the global leader in the provision of
innovative marketing and administrative services for
business. 

He said:
"We see the UK and the Continent as the next logical
step in our expansion programme.  As consumers become
more demanding about the products and services they
purchase, our range of extended warranty products
will give greater financial security to customers,
particularly on items such as homes, consumer
electronics and computers."

Donald Alcorn, Managing Director of Home Guarantee
Corporation, has been appointed Managing Director of
Warrantech Europe.  Mr Alcorn, who has worked in the
UK insurance industry for 30 years, said:
"Warrantech Europe is committed to providing
manufacturers., retailers and service providers with
a range of marketing and administrative services
which will enhance the value of the products they
provide to their customers." 

During the year ended March 31, 1995, Warrantech
Corporation increased gross revenues from nearly $47
million to over $71 million, whilst in the six months
to September 30, 1995, net revenues were a record
$43.41 million - a 40 per cent increase on the same
period last year.

-EUROPEAN COMMISSION: Background report -- Small
businesses in the European Union

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-EUROPEAN COMMISSION:
Background report -- Small businesses in the European
Union
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

INTRODUCTION
Small businesses account for a major share of the GDP
and employment of the Community and thus make a
significant contribution to its economy.  The
Community has long recognised their importance for
creating employment and stimulating growth.  Indeed,
the Treaty on European Union makes a specific
commitment to "encouraging an environment favourable
to initiative and to the development of undertakings
throughout the Community, particularly small and
medium-sized undertakings". 

The best way for the Community to stimulate
entrepreneurs and businesses is by improving and
simplifying the environment in which they operate. 
They need an environment which a@lows them to be
competitive in world markets, particularly vis a vis
the US, Japan and the fast-emerging economies of the
Far East. 

The Commission has drawn up a report' which gives a
comprehensive view of the measures taken at EU level
to improve the business environment and to support
the development of small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs).  The report also looks at collaboration with
the Member States, professional organisations and
other European institutions.

IMPROVING THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
A recent study from the European Observatory for SMEs
has estimated that the total annual costs of
administrative burdens for business in Europe were
between 180-230 billion ECUs, the equivalent of 3-4%
of EU GDR There is therefore a serious economic cost
which needs to be reduced. 

Assessing the impact of legislation on small business
The role of DG XXIII at the Commission, which is in
charge of enterprise policy, is to ensure that the
Commission is taking appropriate account of the
impact on enterprises, and in particular small
businesses, of any legislative proposals.  Account
must be taken not only of the compliance costs and
other burdens of a regulation but also the
administrative procedures or requirements which stem
from it.! Where appropriate, a business impact
assessment is undertaken which involves full
consultation and the setting out of often conflicting
interests of different business sectors.

The fiscal environment
The Commission has identified three priority problems
for small businesses as far as their fiscal position
is concerned: their capacity to attract adequate
financial resources, their capacity to respond to
administrative complexity and finally the problem of
change of proprietor.  A Recommendation on the
taxation of SMEs aims to ensure greater equity in the
fiscal treatment of retained or reinvested profits
between sole traders, partnerships and limited
companies and to lift the fiscal obstacles in the
transformation from sole trader or partnership to
limited company.  The Commission has also been
working on the transfer of ownership of SMEs. 

The financial environment
Amongst the initiatives to improve the financial
environment, a Round Table of bankers and small
businesses has been set up to improve small business
access to finance.  A Recommendation on payment terms
for commercial transactions aims to combat delays in
payment and a Directive has been proposed on
cross-border payments.  Directives on insurance have
been adopted which simplify the conditions of access
to insurance markets as well as the operating
conditions.  Two new financial instruments have been
put in place: subsidised loans for job-creating SMEs
and the European Investment Fund, (see below). 

The Internal Market
Efforts to improve the business environment are also
under way in other policy areas.  In general, the
Internal Market is seen as having a positive effect
on the business environments of small business.  It
is seen as providing a stimulus to overall demand and
business development and allowing for a reduction in
average production costs as a result of mark-et
expansion.  On the other hand, it has led to keener
competition and greater pressure on costs and price
as factors in competitiveness.  It may lead to a
certain, amount of restructuring in the short-run
while the positive effects materialise in the medium
to longer-term. 

Competition
SMEs have been freed from unnecessary administrative
burdens with exemptions and special regulations in
competition policy.  As far as state aid is
concerned, the Commission's traditionally favourable
attitude to state aid for SMEs was formalised by the
adoption in 1992 of a specific framework, to be
reexamined in 1995.  This framework provides Member
States with the option of granting aid, within
certain set limits, designed to encourage investment
by SMEs and to encourage them to improve their
competence through advice and information.  Member
States are dispensed from notifying the Commission of
very small sums of aid which it considers to have a
negligible impact on trade between Member States and
on competition. 

Energy policy
The Union's energy policy has a direct effect on the
development and Operation of SMEs since its
objectives are to meet the needs of individual and
industrial users at less cost and under circumstances
which ensure security of supply and environmental
protection.  The availability of energy at best
prices and on the best terms is a determining factor
in strengthening the overall competitiveness of the
economy and of SMEs in particular. 

Environmental policy
In November 1994, the Commission presented a
Communication on Economic Growth and the Environment
which underlines the need for market-based
instruments in the area of environmental policies,
such as eco- labelling, tax rebates for green
investments etc.  The idea is for companies to be
able to integrate environmental considerations in
their policies in a more flexible way.

PROGRAMMES AND SUPPORT MEASURES
A large part of Community support comes through
financial instruments, in particular the Structural
Funds, as well as Community programmes, such as the
research and vocational training programmes. 

Financial instruments
The European Investment Bank (EIB)
The EIB finances large-scale investments through
individual loans and modest investments, in
particular those of small businesses, indirectly
through its global loans.  Those global loans are
concluded with financial intermediaries operating at
the national, regional or even local level.  This
puts the EIB in a position to support smaller
investments which it would not be able to finance by
individual loans, for reasons of management
efficiency.  The field of application of global loans
has been progressively increased in order to adapt to
the development of needs and the diversification of
Community policies.  They usually concern investments
of small businesses in industry, services (notably
tourism and agriculture) and small-scale
infrastructure projects contributing to Community
objectives in the areas of regional development,
environmental protection, energy or transport.

In 1994 the EIB concluded global loans totalling ECU
3.281 million and credits on current global loans
amounted to ECU 2.763 million. 60% of this amount was
devoted to supporting SMEs, 90% of which employed
less than 50 people.  Since 1990 the EIB has provided
significant support to the financing of SMEs.  Nearly
36,000 have benefited from credits in a total of over
ECU 9.4 billion.  Over 80% of them are enterprises
employing less than 50 people and 90% less than 250
people. 

The EIB will now not only accelerate the financing of
infrastructure but it will also help job-creating
SMEs. 

The SME facility: subsidised loans for job-creating
SMEs
A mechanism for interest subsidies relating to ECU 1
billion in global EIB loans in favour of small
businesses was approved in April 1994 by the Council
of Ministers.  The interest subsidy of 2% per year is
applied for five years on a maximum loan amount of
ECU 30,000 per job created.  The SME facility should
allow 30,000 jobs to be created.  The mechanism was
implemented in September 1994 and by the end of April
1995, 48% had been allocated to some 2,100 businesses
and more than 23,000 new jobs are planned. 96% of the
volume of loans was granted to SMEs with less than
250 employees.

The European Investment Fund: loan guarantees for
SMEs
At the Edinburgh Council in 1992, it was decided to
create a European Investment Fund (EIF) aimed at
granting loan guarantees for projects relating to
trans-European networks! and for small business.  The
EIF concentrates its attention on those areas where
it can be complementary to existing sources of
finance.  It offers two main types of financial
products, financial guarantees and equity.  The
initial ceiling on the overall commitments of the
Fund has been set at 3 times its subscribed capital
but this may be raised at a later stage once adequate
reserves have been established.  The Fund will work
through appropriate financial intermediaries in the
Member States rather than providing direct guarantees
to individual SMEs. 

Structural Funds
Regional initiatives
On average 10% of the total resources of the European
Regional Development Fund are devoted specifically to
measures dealing with the promotion and improvement
of the economic environment of SMEs.  Funds go to
encouraging demand for services from small businesses
as well as to the supply of services to them. 

A so-called SME Community initiative, allocated ECU 1
billion for 1994-99, aims to contribute to the
internationalisation of small businesses and to
promote improvements in their competitiveness. 

Seven priority areas have been identified:
improvement of production and organisation systems;
environment and rational use of energy; cooperation
with research centres; access to new markets;
cooperation networks; strengthening vocational
qualifications and improved access to the financial
system. 

Twelve other Community initiatives also contribute to
the development of small businesses.  Amongst these
are REGIS which is concerned with the most peripheral
regions of the EU, RETEX which is designed to assist
enterprises in the textiles sector, URBAN which
targets urban areas and ADAPT which helps the labour
force to respond to the changing needs of the labour
market.

Other innovative forms of Community support include
global development subsidies.  These were introduced
in 1988 and are granted to an intermediary body for
carrying out a territorial development strategy which
it negotiates with the Commission and implements
under its own responsibility.  Between 1988-1993, 31
agreements were established for a total combined
amount of ECU 687 million. 

Social funding
Recognising that small businesses are a major source
of new employment, the Commission aims to encourage
entrepreneurial activity to stimulate the creation of
more SMEs.  The European Social Fund (ESF) has three
priorities: to improve education and initial
training; to increase competitiveness and prevent
unemployment by adapting the workforce to change with
continuing training; and to improve the employment
opportunities of the long-term unemployed.

The promotion of a more systematic approach to
continued training is planned to involve about ECU 6
billion during 1994-1999, or some 14% of total Social
Fund allocations. 

Other funds
Small businesses benefit from other Funds, such as
the Agricultural Funds and they are principal
beneficiaries of Community structural interventions
in favour of fisheries. 

Research and technological development (RTD)
Increased efforts are being made to facilitate the
participation of SMEs in Community research
programmes. Under the 3rd Framework Programme
(1990-94) a total of 6368 small businesses
participated in RTD programmes with a budgetary
commitment of ECU 1035 million or 22% of the total
Community financial commitment.

Within the Brite-Euram Programme (Industrial and
Materials Technologies) the Commission introduced two
schemes specifically for small businesses: the
feasibility awards which are aimed at SMEs with RTD
capacity who wish to play a major role in a large
multi-partner project and CRAFT which targets those
with little or no RTD means, enabling them to engage
third parties to carry out RTD work on their behalf.
80% of SMEs taking part in CRAFT are total newcomers
to EU RTD and 50% have no previous RTD cooperation
experience at all. 

About 920 separate SMEs participated in the
Information Technology programme ESPRIT III, with a
bud-et of ECU 1532 million for the period 1991-94. 
They carry out about 31% of the total of the relevant
work of the programme, up from 21% during the
previous programme.  In the next programme, running
from 1994-98, participation of SMEs will be further
encouraged.

The VALUE programme is aimed at promoting the spread
and effective use of results of scientific and
technological research in order to strengthen the
competitiveness of European industry.  SMEs have been
involved in 69% of the projects as contractor, 39% as
partner and 38% as participant. 

Under the fourth Framework Programme special budgets
have been allocated within the different programmes
for specific SME measures totalling over ECU 700
million, or 9% of the total budget of these
programmes.  In addition, SMEs will participate in
other actions within the mainstream research
programmes. 

SPRINT aims to stimulate innovation and technology
transfer, particularly in small businesses. 
Altogether 162,600 SMEs have benefited from the
SPRINT programme, either by purchasing, testing or
keeping informed of the new technologies.

EUROTECH CAPITAL is an initiative to encourage the
financing by private capital of high technology
transnational projects.  In 1994 the Eurotech capital
network comprised 13 members, covering the majority
of Member States, who had undertaken to invest a
total of ECU 202 million. 

From 1974-1989 half of the projects under the THERMIE
energy programme involved SMEs in a total of 2450
projects representing ECU 1.2 billion of financial
support.  The THERMIE programme for 1995-1998 gives
financial support to projects implementing innovative
energy technologies and to a whole series of
complementary activities including technological
stimulation of SMEs. 

While more than half the funds from the EURET
programme, which supports research in transport, has
gone to large enterprises, SMEs come second among
beneficiaries with 19% of the budget and 25% of the
number of participants.

Vocational training
In addition to the resources from the European Social
Fund (some ECU 20 billion for the period 1989-1993),
there are a number of programmes aimed at raising the
level of qualifications throughout the Community,
such as EUROTECNET, COMETT, FORCE and PETRA.  These
programmes were completed at the end of 1994 and
replaced by the LEONARDO programme which will run
from 1995-99. 

The EUROTECNET programme aimed to promote innovation
in vocational training resulting from technological
change and 18% of projects from 1990-94 targeted
SMEs.

The COMETT programme encouraged intra-Community
cooperation between university and business in the
field of technologies, particularly advanced
technologies.  About 75% of enterprises involved as
partners in one or more COMETT projects were small
businesses and 80% included at least one small
business.  Alto-ether it is estimated that 40,000
SMEs will have benefited directly from COMETT II
(1990-94), including at least 15,000 which have
received students on placements from different
countries.  As far as continuing training is
concerned, it is estimated that 200,000 small
business employees have taken a training course or
are using training materials. Furthermore, over 1000
SME intermediary organisations, such as chambers of
commerce or trade associations have participated in
the COMETT partnerships with a multiplier effect on
small businesses. 

FORCE had the objective of encouraging enterprises,
particularly small ones, to invest in continuing
vocational training.  Between 1991-93 2,250 small
businesses or groups of small businesses participated
in this programme as partners in more than two thirds
of the projects, directly or indirectly. 

The LEONARDO programme (1995-99) takes up three main
types of trans-national cooperation measures of the
earlier programmes: pilot cooperation projects,
exchange programmes and surveys and analysis.  It
includes an important innovation in that all measures
should have a trans-national character and a stronger
accent is put on disseminating and analysing the
results.

Environmental programmes
Out of 99 projects co-financed in 1993 under the LIFE
financial instrument for the environment, it is
estimated that 43 involved small businesses,
receiving 38% of the total granted. 

A number of actions have been pursued to help inform
small businesses about improving health and safety. 
The Commission has drawn up a document on risk
assessment in the workplace with one part
particularly devoted to small businesses.  A
self-audit method for health and safety at work has
been prepared to help heads of SMEs to do their
assessments.  A conference entitled "Taking risks and
working safely" was principally geared towards small
businesses and the European Agency for Health and
Safety at Work, which should come into operation in
1995, will pay particular attention to the special
problems of SMEs.  A proposed programme called SAFE
(Safety Action for Europe) will support projects to
promote improvements in safety, hygiene and health at
work, to improve work practice and to influence
attitudes in order to reduce accidents and
occupational diseases. 

The information market
The IMPACT programme(1991-95), targeting the single
market for information services, has undertaken
several actions in favour of small businesses.  In
1994 it implemented over 700 actions on awareness and
promotion of electronic information services.  Small
businesses need advanced methods of access to and
processing of information to become and remain
competitive.  Also the productive industry of
electronic information services is itself largely
composed of small businesses.

Out of the 160 contracts under the TEDIS programme
(Trade Electronic Data Interchange Systems) half of
the prime contractors are SMEs.  TEDIS promotes
electronic data interchange (EDI) standards and has
developed a network of 40 centres in various European
regions to stimulate the knowledge and use of EDI to
help small businesses.  TEDIS is also active in
several international cooperative ventures. 

Providing information for business
The network of Euro-Info Centres (EICs) provides
information for businesses in their region on the
various Community programmes and policies.  EICs have
played an important role in providing information on
public tenders and on research and technology
programmes.  The information and advice mission of
EICs puts them in a special position to understand
the actual problems encountered by SMEs in
implementing legislation or in participating in
certain programmes.  The Commission therefore
consults them directly or asks them to carry out
specific studies based on questionnaires circulated
to the SMEs in their region. Promoting business
cooperation and partnership

The Business Cooperation Network (BC-NET) was
established to encourage an awareness of increasing
business opportunities across Europe.  Its primary
task is to help identify other business partners. 
Other initiatives to promote business cooperation and
partnership include the Business Communication Centre
(BCC) and the Europartenariat and Interprise
programmes.  Europartenariat establishes contacts
between SMEs in different regions of the Community so
that they can conclude technical, commercial and
financial agreements. 

The European Enterprise and Innovation Centres
(EEICs), launched in 1984, are public/private
partnership structures which identify and select
entrepreneurs and projects which offer the most
complete range of services to enterprise and
accompany the firm during the start-up period.  There
are 70 fully operational EEICs throughout the EU
which have contributed to the creation of more than
2,800 businesses representing 16,000 direct jobs.

Pilot schemes
A number of pilot schemes are being undertaken by the
Commission in areas such as access to research and
technological development, access to public
contracts, standardisation and certification,
commerce and distribution and the craft sector and
small businesses.  The Commission will be supporting
the creation of 7 cross-border offices to help the
craft sector and small businesses develop
cross-border activities and overcome existing
barriers.

Following an audit of 842 small businesses, a report
produced by AFNOR (Association Francaise pour
normalisation) showed that the principles of the
single market and standardisation are generally very
poorly understood because of difficulties getting
access to information and because of the low
participation rate of SMEs in the work on European,
or even national, standards.  Small businesses have
difficulty formalising their quality procedures and
often make over-complex interpretation$ of standards
and set up cumbersome and expensive systems.  As
regards certification, there is still much work to be
done in completing the single market, in particular
on mutual recognition.  SMEs are often unfamiliar
with EC markings and see the cost of obtaining
certificates as a problem.

The Commission launched a pilot scheme in 1989 to
stimulate the creation of start-up capital funds.  It
has supported the establishment of 23 start-up funds
whose aim is to make capital available to firms which
are in the embryonic stage of existence and which
have great difficulty obtaining this on the market. 

Another pilot programme, Commerce 2000, aims to
encourage cooperation between small businesses by
establishing modern methods of management and new
technologies. 52 feasibility study projects and 6
pilot projects were selected in 1994, the results of
which should become available in the course of 1995. 

The Community has a multi-annual programme of work
for cooperatives, mutual societies, associations and
foundations in the EU.  The programme provides a
formal framework for EU action and aims to preserve
diversity in the sector, to encourage solidarity and
to help cooperative enterprises to respond to
economic development and social progress.

With a view to improving the available statistical
information, Eurostat, the EU's statistical off ice,
in conjunction with national offices, has begun to
collect all the financial information available on
enterprises in order to highlight the importance of
small business for production and employment.  In
conjunction with DG XXIII, Eurostat has published at
regular intervals its report "Enterprises in Europe"
which contains detailed information by sector of
economic activity and by payroll size on all the
enterprises in the EU. 

International cooperation
Programmes have been set up to stimulate and support
cooperation between enterprises in the EU and those
in EFTA countries, Central and Eastern Europe, the
former Soviet Union and Georgia, Asia, Latin America
and the Mediterranean.

In the context of the PHARE programme, the Commission
has supported the development of SMEs by providing
technical assistance in many countries.  Between
1990-93 the EU made a contribution of ECU 320 million
to countries of Central and Eastern Europe.

Within the framework of TACIS, which fosters links
between the EU and the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) and Mongolia, ECU 19 million has been
allocated to support small businesses in 1992, ECU 20
million in 1993 and ECU 12 million in 1994, a total
of ECU 51 Million.  The programme has been based on
the need to build up intermediary agencies to provide
assistance to existing entrepreneurs and those who
wish to set up businesses.

MEDINVEST is a programme to support the development
of small businesses in Mediterranean countries and
has a budget of ECU 12.2 million for 1993-95. 
ALINVEST, with a budget of ECU 18.5 million, aims to
facilitate commercial exchanges, technology and
know-how transfer and financing to the mutual benefit
of Latin American and European enterprises.

The ECIP (European Communities Investment Partners)
is a financial instrument for the developing
countries of Latin America, Asia and the
Mediterranean which facilitates the creation of joint
enterprises.  The orientation of the ECIP scheme is
towards SMEs.

Initiatives to develop contacts between SMEs are also
underway with China and Japan.  Given the importance
of the private sector for the development of African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States, the Fourth Lome
Convention provides for a vast range of instruments
which can be used to support SMEs in those countries. 
A large part of these programmes are also of direct
or indirect interest to European SMEs. 

COLLABORATION AND CONSULTATION
Consultation with business organisations
The Commission regularly consults and informs
associations representative of small businesses, the
craft sector and commerce at the European level on
Community activities specifically directed towards
them as well as on all subjects that may concern
them, like the Structural Funds, RTD programmes and
legislative proposals.  In return, these
organisations inform the Commission of their opinion
and a good partnership is established which allows
the viewpoints of business to be taken into account. 
In the commerce and distribution sector the
Commission systematically consults the Committee on
Commerce and Distribution, which was created in 198
1. 

Social dialogue
The Agreement on Social Policy which forms part of
the Maastricht Treaty requires new procedures for
consultation with the social partners as well as
conditions by which these collective agreements are
concluded. The list of social partner organisations
includes the European Association of Crafts, Small
and Medium-sized Enterprises (UEAPME), amongst
others.  The Commission has been in contact during
1994 with numerous organisations expressing
particular interest in SMEs, both at the
inter-professional level and at the sectoral level. 

The commerce and distribution sector, over 90% of
which is mad up of enterprises with less than 10
people, is represented by EUROCOMMERCE.  The
Commission has also enlarged its consultation to take
into account the needs of SMEs in the implementation
of the Structural Funds. 

Partnership with Member States
By mutual consultation and cooperation between the
Member States and between the Member States and the
Commission it is hoped that actions can be targeted
at SMEs so that their potential for growth and
employment can be better mobilised.

Collaboration with the other institutions
The European Parliament has emphasised that the
Integrated Programme in favour of SMEs and the Craft
Sector' is the result of the good collaboration that
it maintains with the Commission and that there is
now a global commitment and a strategy towards small
businesses.  It has also created an
Inter-Parliamentary Group on commerce and
distribution.

The Economic and Social Committee proposes carrying
out an evaluation of the effectiveness of existing
measures and an institutional strengthening,
according the political weight necessary to implement
Community policy in favour of SMEs.

The Committee of the Regions emphasises the
importance of coordination between the Community
programmes so as to facilitate access for SMEs and
the craft sector to research and training programmes. 
This is to be achieved by information, a
simplification of procedures, greater participation
of SME representative organisations and a
decentralisation of measures to the regional or local
level. 

Conclusion: In its report the Commission has
attempted to present the links and coordination
between the actions carried out under various Union
policies.  The coordination of Community activities
implies several levels: first within the Commission
services; then with the Member States and the other
European institutions; and then with business
circles.

The Commission will monitor the implementation of
programmes so that the declared objectives of greater
support for SMEs are effectively transformed into
concrete advantages for them.  The Commission intends
to ensure good cooperation with the other
institutions of the Union.  However, given that SME
policy is principally the business of national or
regional authorities, the role of the Commission in
coordinating the policies of the Member States is
limited to stimulating or orchestrating mutual
consultation and cooperation between them and with
the Commission with a view to ensuring more
effectiveness and a certain convergence of actions. 

Effectiveness of measures also implies good
coordination and a permanent dialogue with SME
representative organisations.

The Commission will reinforce coordination with all
its partners, the Member States, the European
institutions and the business organisations so that
the efforts of the Union in favour of small
businesses are converted into growth, competitiveness
and employment.

relations with the Baltic States

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-EUROPEAN COMMISSION:
Background report -- EU relations with the Baltic
States
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:201295

Introduction
The Baltic region, as well as being a major
commercial gateway to Russia, is a growing economic
zone in its own right.  A vigorous and open Baltic
Sea(1) economy will Provide new trading and
investment opportunities.  The political, economic
and security interests of the EU and the region will
be served by the fullest integration of the region
into the European and world economy.  To this end, EU
relations with Scandinavia have progressed with the
recent inclusion of Sweden and Finland as members of
the Union and relations with the three Baltic States
of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania continue to expand. 

EU relations with the Baltic States have progressed
significantly over the last two years.  Relations now
cover much more than simply trade agreements in
certain sectors.  The European Union has recognised
the wish of the Baltic States to become part of the
Union when the necessary preconditions for membership
are fulfilled.  To this end, the European Union has
signed Europe Agreements with all three Baltic
States.  As a consequence, the Baltic States now take
part in the pre-accession strategy in preparation for
eventual accession to the Union.  Latvia and Estonia
have already applied for membership of the European
Union(2).  The pre-accession strategy covers such
divers fields as Home and Justice Affairs, Foreign
and Security policy, political dialogue, internal
market and trade. 

Against all precedent, the future accession of the
Baltic States to the European Union will in many ways
not be as easy as the accession of any of the current
Member States.  Before accession, the new Member
States(3) already had enough expertise in specific
areas, for example law, to meet the requirement for
membership.  The application of the new legislation
and policies will be the most difficult thing for the
Baltic States.  Without detailed assistance from the
EU, the entire process threatens to take much longer
than necessary.  As a precondition to accession,
therefore, the EU underlines the importance for the
European Union to provide assistance in order to
enable these countries to establish the necessary
structures, introduce measures for implementation and
lay out an optimal set of policy and economic
incentives for economic operators(4).

Background
The Baltic States joined the Central and Eastern
European Countries (CEEC) strategy in 1992.  European
Union relations with the Baltic States, therefore,
falls under the Central and Eastern Europe pre-
accession strategy, under which many of the measures
are applicable to all CEE countries, including the
Baltic States.

The Agreements on trade and commercial and economic
co-operation concluded in 1992 with Latvia and
Lithuania entered into force on 1 February 1993.  The
Agreement with Estonia entered into force on 1 March
1993.  These agreements cover trade in certain
sectors.  The trade arrangements were supplemented by
framework agreements.  Annual arrangements for
fisheries Protocols and on trade in textile products
were also signed with Latvia and Lithuania. 

At the request of the Copenhagen European Council,
the Commission asked the Council for authorisation to
negotiate with the Baltic States to convert the
agreements on trade, commercial and economic
co-operation into Free Trade Agreements, with the aim
of concluding Europe Agreements when possible.  The
Free Trade Agreements would fit in with the
enlargement negotiations and would preserve
compatibility between Community acquis (established
Community law and practice) and the existing
agreements between the Nordic countries and the
Baltic States.  Free Trade Agreements for the three
States were signed on 18 July 1994 and came into
force 1 January 1995(5), replacing the trade aspects
of earlier agreements, as well as including political
dialogue. 

In order for the Baltic States to be included in the
preparation for accession, certain conditions had to
be met.  These include being able to satisfy the
three basic conditions of European identity,
democratic status and respect for human rights as
contained in the Treaty on European Union(6).  In
addition certain other conditions had to be met: the
existence of a functioning market economy, the
capacity to compete in the internal market of the
Union and the ability to take on the obligations of
membership including the adherence to the aims of
political, economic and monetary union. 

As early as 29 May 1995 the Council recorded that the
conditions had been met for the Baltic States to be
included in the strategy to prepare for accession as
defined by the European Council meeting in Essen. 
This has had the effect of allowing the Baltic States
to participate in the joint meetings under the
structured dialogue with the associated CEEC(7).

A key element of the strategy to prepare for
accession is the narrowing of the gap in preparation
of the associated States for integration into the
internal market of the EU.  Preparation for the
internal market is backed up by a variety of measures
designed to promote integration through the
development of infrastructure and of co-operation in
fields having above all a trans-European dimension
(including energy, environment, transport, science
and technology, etc.), and in the fields of common
foreign and security policy and of justice and home
affairs.  The PHARE programme, appropriately funded
within a multiannual financial framework in
accordance with the preparatory strategy agreed upon,
will provide support for this purpose.

PHARE and TACIS Democracy Programme
The process of trade liberalisation in the Baltic
States is one of the purposes of the PHARE and TACIS
programmes.  Projects under these two schemes include
measures to improve the ability of local
administration to handle trade flows, and by
developing export, credit and insurance facilities to
encourage regional trade.  The move towards
assistance to improve infrastructure and attract
investment is another priority of the PHARE
programme.  PHARE assistance to eliminate border
crossing obstacles in the Baltic region remains a
major instrument, for example, through the
development of the Via Baltica and the Helsinki-St
Petersburg corridor(8).

Aid from the PHARE programme continues to expand as
the following figures for 1993(9) and 1994(10)
demonstrate.

Financing from PHARE to Estonia amounted to 12 mECU
in 1993.  This breaks down as follows: 
* Education, training and R&D      1.5 mECU
* General technical assistance;
  miscellaneous                   10.5 mECU 

In 1994 this figure rose to 22.5 mECU and breaks down
as follows: 
* Private sector, SMEs             8   mECU
* Environment and nuclear safety   2.5 mECU
* Education, training and R&D      4.5 mECU
* Infrastructure:
  energy, telecommunications,
    transport, etc.                   6 mECU
* GTAF(11) & others                 1.5 mECU

Financing from PHARE to Latvia amounted to 18 mECU in
1993.  This breaks down as follows: 
* Education, training and R&D       2   mECU
* General technical assistance;
  miscellaneous                    16   mECU

This figure rose to 29.5 mECU in 1994 and breaks down
as follows: 
* Financial sector                 14.5 mECU

* Environment and nuclear safety    5.5 mECU
* Education, training and R&D       5   mECU
* GTAF & others                     4.5 mECU

Financing from PHARE to Lithuania amounted to 25 mECU
in 1993. This breaks down as follows: 
* Education, training and R&D       2.5 mECU
* General technical assistance,
  miscellaneous                    22.5 mECU

This figure rose to 39 mECU in 1994 and breaks down
as follows: 
* Financial sector                 14.5 mECU
* Environment and nuclear safety   1    mECU
* Education, training and R&D      6    mECU
* Infrastructure:
  energy, telecommunications,
    transport, etc.               16.5  mECU
* GTAF & others                    1    mECU

At the Corfu European Council meeting in June 1995
certain priority concerns as regards financial
assistance under the PHARE scheme were laid down. 
PHARE has been redirected towards supporting the
strategy for preparation for accession, so its
programming is being carried out on a multiannual
basis. Technical assistance must take into account
implementation of the White Paper on preparing for
integration into the internal market(12).  Assistance
under the programme has been extended to include
investment activity in the field of infrastructures.

One example of how the PHARE programme has recently
helped Latvia is through the provision of an
emergency assistance package of 2.5 mECU in order to
assist efforts to stabilise the banking sector
following the collapse of Latvia's largest bank, Bank
Baltija(13).  This programme is designed to assist
the sixteen banks in Latvia which are still trading -
following the effective closure of 31 other banks and
to provide assistance to the Bank of Latvia in its
on-site supervision activities in order to help
prevent any further deterioration in the current
situation.

The TACIS Democracy Programme forms part of the
European Democracy Initiative of the European
Parliament.  It seeks to support the activities and
efforts of non-governmental bodies (NGOs) in
promoting a stable open society and good governance. 
It also focuses on the difficult or unpopular aspects
of political reform and democratic practice.  The
general objective is to contribute to the creation of
a human rights ethos in the countries concerned
whereby the general public is made aware of the rule
of law.  It supports the acquisition and application
of knowledge and techniques of parliamentary practice
and organisation by cross-party groups of
politicians(14) and by parliamentary staff.  The
Democracy Programme also covers the strengthening of
non-governmental bodies and associations which by
their vocation and specific activities can make a
continuing contribution to the promotion of a
pluralist society, as well as the transfer of
specific expertise and technical skills about
democratic practices and the rule of law to
professional groups and associations in the countries
concerned(15). 

Europe Agreements
The Europe Agreements establish bilateral
associations between each of the European countries
and the EU. They are based on shared understanding
and values, and set the path for progressive
convergence in a very wide range of activities.  They
are valid indefinitely with short transition periods
for Latvia and Lithuania.  Because of the progress of
economic and political reform in Estonia there is no
transitional period for this country.

As each agreement is the result of a separate
bilateral negotiation, there are a number of
differences of detail.  The objectives and main
elements are however the same.  The Europe Agreements
cover approximation of legislation, economic
co-operation, financial and political and cultural
co-operation as well as including provisions on the
prevention of activities such as illegal immigration,
drug trafficking and illegal trade in industrial
waste.  The Agreements include matters of both
Community and Member State competence.  Each
agreement contains a clause on observance of
democratic principles and human rights and a clause
enabling either party to suspend the agreement at
short notice if the obligations attached to it are
not respected.  The Europe Agreements additionally
take account of developments in certain sectors and
accordingly recognise the increased importance of
multilateral political dialogue and contain a new
heading on co-operation in crime prevention and
provisions for the three Baltic States to take part
in framework programmes, in specific programmes and
in projects or other schemes set up by the Community
in various areas.

Europe Agreements with the three Baltic States were
signed on 12 June 1995(16).  Following ratification
by all parties, including each individual Member
State, the agreements will enter into force.  Since
the signing of the Europe Agreements the three Baltic
States take part in the pre-accession strategy. The
main elements of the Europe Agreements are:

* political dialogue
* recognition of the importance of the involvement of
the Baltic States in WEU, the NATO Partnership for
Peace Initiative and the European Stability Pact;
* bilateral political dialogue in the framework of EA
as well as multilateral political dialogue;
* structured relationship with EU institutions, as
defined by the Essen European Council. 
* economic activities
* free trade in industrial goods;
* preferential treatment of trade in agricultural
products including those already processed;
* liberating trade in many services;
* national treatment for establishment and operations
of enterprises;
* national treatment for bidding for public contract
awards according to Community procurement rules;
* movement of workers: prevention of discrimination
against workers from any partner country legally
employed in the other country;
* co-ordination of social security systems for
legally employed workers and their families; 
* right of establishment of companies and national
treatment or MFN status(17); free movement of goods;
* transport.
* rules and approximation of laws

Commitments by the Baltic States to introduce similar
legislation as that applying in the EU - where this
is not already the case - concerning:
* competition rules and public undertakings(18),
including a safeguard clause in the event of
balance-of- payments difficulties; protection of
intellectual, commercial, industrial property;
* liberalisation of payments and capital transfers in
respect of trade and investments(19); approximation
of laws in other areas affecting the implementation
of the Agreements. 
* co-operation(20)
* economic co-operation;
* industrial co-operation;
* environmental co-operation;
* educational and training co-operation;
* monetary policy co-operation;
* financial co-operation (continuation PHARE aid and
other financial support);
* cultural co-operation.
* crime prevention co-operation.
* institutions
* Association Council at ministerial level to
regularly examine progress in the process of economic
reform;
* Association Committee at senior officials level;
* Parliamentary Association Committee.

Structured Relationship
The Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 agreed
that the associated countries will become members of
the Union when these countries are able to assume the
obligations of membership.  The Essen European
Council of December 1994 adopted a strategy to assist
the CEEC in preparing for their accession.  This
includes, amongst other things, a series of regular
meetings at ministerial level ('structured
relationship with the institutions of the European
Union') and the elaboration of a White Paper
identifying what the CEEC need to do (legally,
regulatory, institutionally, administratively) in
order to participate in the open internal market.

Political dialogue has been on-going since 1993.  For
example, on 19 April 1993 the Community 'troika' had
a meeting in Copenhagen with the foreign ministers of
the Baltic States, in December 1993 Latvia's Minister
for External Trade and EC Affairs, Olgerts
Pavlovskis, met Commissioner Van den Broek in
Brussels.  Under the structured relationship,
however, meetings at higher levels have intensified. 

A number of ministerial meetings have been held in a
variety of areas, for example: the meeting of
Ministers for Foreign Affairs on 10 April 1995 gave
rise to exchanges of views on several political
issues of mutual interest.  Meetings at the level of
Political Directors and European correspondents were
organised, as well as numerous meetings at expert
level

* the meeting of ministers with responsibility for
the internal market met in June 1995 along with
Baltic State representatives.  The meeting discussed
and exchanged views on the Commission White Paper on
the preparation of the associated countries for
integration into the internal market;

* the meeting of the Research Council in June 1995,
at which stock was taken of the progress on
scientific and technical co-operation with the CEEC,
the alignment policy implemented by the associated
countries and the forecasts for their participation
in Community research programmes; 

* the Heads of Government and State of the associated
States were invited to meet alongside the Cannes
European Council in 1995;

The structured dialogue has continued under the
Spanish Presidency in the following fields: 
* Justice and Home Affairs;
* Transport;
* Agriculture;
* Education;
* Foreign Affairs.

Stability Pact(21)

The European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993
discussed the French proposal for an initiative to be
taken by the European Union in favour of a Pact on
stability in Europe.  This initiative is directed
towards assuring in practice the application of the
principles agreed by European countries with regard
to respect for borders and rights of minorities.  The
European Council agreed that recent events in Europe
have shown that action in these areas is timely and
appropriate.  It welcomed the idea of using the
instrument of 'Joint Action' in accordance with the
procedures provided for in the Common Foreign and
Security policy.

In the Common Foreign and Security Policy framework,
the Pact on Stability in Europe is intended to
promote preventive diplomacy and therefore is not
concerned with countries in conflict.  Initially, it
will be directed at those countries which have the
prospect of becoming members of the EU and with which
the Union has concluded or negotiated agreements. 
This includes the Baltic States.  The aim of the
initiative is to contribute to stability by averting
tension and potential conflicts in Europe, fostering
neighbourly relations and encouraging countries to
consolidate their borders and to resolve problems of
national minorities.

The inaugural meeting took place in Paris in March
1994.  The documents setting in train the process
which will lead to the conclusion of the Pact on
stability in Europe were concluded following a round
table discussion(22).  Countries participating were
those which make a particular contribution to the
initiative, countries immediately bordering on the
countries having association agreements and countries
with an interest in stability, in Europe by virtue of
their defence commitments(23).  Representatives of
international organisations concerned by the
initiative also participated(24). 

The European Union reaffirmed its will to mobilise
its economic and financial instruments as its
contribution to the success of this undertaking at
the Corfu European Council meeting in June 1994. At
the Cannes European Council meeting in June 1995, the
European Union further specified some of the
accompanying measures to be taken under PHARE along
side the Stability Pact.  These include, projects
concerning regional transboundary co-operation,
issues relating to minorities, cultural co-
operation, including, language training and
administrative training, and environmental problems. 

White Paper(25) on preparation of the associated
countries of Central and Eastern Europe for
integration into the Internal Market of the Union(26) 

The White Paper marks the beginning of a process.  It
provides a guide for the associated countries in
adapting their legal structures to those which are
needed for future participation in the internal
market. It sets out a logical sequence for adopting
the necessary measures and will enable associated
countries to draw up internal market work programmes
adapted to each country's own economic and reform
priorities.  It will also enable the European Union
to provide the kind of support which is most needed,
drawing on the necessary expertise in the Union's own
institutions, in the Member States and in the private
sector.

The White Paper(27) focuses on legislation which is
essential for the functioning of the internal market.
It shows the key measures in each sector and those
measures which should be tackled first, without
setting up priorities as between sectors, including:
* free movement of goods;
* free movement of services;
* free movement of persons;
* freedom of capital movements;
* competition policy;
* state aids.

It also describes in detail the administrative and
organisational structures which are required in each
sector if the legislation is to be effectively
implemented and enforced. 

The EU recognises that certain assistance needs are
common to all associated countries.  To this end the
Commission intends to establish a Technical
Assistance Information Exchange Office supported
through the PHARE programme.  The Office will be
located in Brussels and managed by the Commission. 
It will provide for the exchange of information and
will help ensure the adequate delivery of services to
the associated countries.  This includes Community
legislation, its transposition into national
legislation, legal terminology, translation, training
and exchanges.

The White Paper also highlights the current state of
play in the relationship between the CEEC and the
European Union, detailing the progress made to date
with legislative approximation and specific sectors,
including:
* company law;
* financial sector;
* agriculture;
* transport;
* competition policy;
* telecommunications;
* intellectual property.

Conclusion
The relationship between the European Union and the
three Baltic States has changed dramatically over the
last few years.  It has progressed from simple trade
arrangements to trade agreements and, this year, to
Europe Agreements.  All three states have expressed a
desire to become part of the European Union, Latvia
and Estonia have formally applied for membership. 
The IGC will address some of the questions
surrounding the accession of new Member States to the
Union in 1996. 

(1) The Baltic Sea region includes the Scandinavia,
Poland and Russia, as well as the three Baltic States
(2) It applied on 27 October 1995
(3) Austria, Finland and Sweden
(4)For example, the financial assistance allocated
through the PHARE programme 
(5)Estonia - L 373, 31.12.1994; Latvia - L 374,
31.12.1994; Lithuania - L 375, 31.12.1994 
(6)Articles F and O
(7)Presidency Conclusions, Cannes European Council,
26-27 June 1995 
(8)IP/94/994
(9) General Report on the activities of the EU 1993
(10) General Report on the activities of the EU 1994
(11) General Technical Assistance Facility

(13) IP/95/927
(14)Parliamentarians and elected representatives in
local and regional government
(15) See IP/95/1083 for specific projects financed
under the Democracy Programme 
(16) COM(95) 207 final
(17) Provisions are made in the Agreements,
especially for Latvia and Lithuania, for a number of
exceptions to the general principle of national
treatment.  Most are temporary 
(18) It is made clear in joint declarations that
special rights granted to come companies by the
Baltic States, particularly in the field of
telecommunications, may be retained for a limited
time under certain conditions
(19) To varying degrees, the three Baltic States have
already established full convertibility of their
currencies.  In addition, free movement of capital is
already possible as well as the fact that payments
relating to goods and services are already
liberalised
(20) For full list refer to text of Europe Agreements

1993 - Conclusions, Annex 1 - Stability Pact -
Summary Report; Speeches made by Commissioner Frans
Van den Broek: SPEECH/95/37; SPEECH/95/58
(22) There are two round tables, one for the Baltic
region and the other for the Central and Eastern
European countries
(23) Albania, Austria, Belarus, Bulgaria, Canada, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, the Holy See,
Hungary, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Moldova,
Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia,

(24) CSCE, Council of Europe, WEU, NATO and the
United Nations 
(25) COM(95) 163 final and COM(95) 163 final\2
(26) As an element in the pre-accession strategy, the
White Paper is not part of negotiations for accession
and does not prejudice any aspect of such
negotiations.  Accession negotiations will cover the
entire field of Community legislation and policy,
whereas the White Paper focuses on those Community
measures which create and maintain the internal
market.  In addition, the White Paper does not change
the contractual relationship between the EU and the
Baltic States, which is based on the Europe
Agreements.  As detailed in these agreements, the
approximation of legislation is monitored by a
specific Sub-Committee
(27) The annex to the White Paper provides a
comprehensive and detailed presentation of current EU
legislation relating to the internal market. 
Twenty-three different areas of legislation are
examined in turn

-INDEPENDENT TELEVISION COMMISSION: ITC statement on
ITN shareholdings held by Carlton and Granada

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-INDEPENDENT TELEVISION
COMMISSION: ITC statement on ITN shareholdings held
by Carlton and Granada
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

The ITC has considered a proposal drawn up on a
contingency basis under which both Carlton Television
and Granada Television would create two new
deadlocked companies owned by them to hold shares in
ITN which are in excess of the levels allowed in the
Broadcasting Act 1990.  After scrutiny of the plan
and taking account of legal advice, the ITC has
concluded that such a scheme, if completed by 31
December 1995, would not breach the provisions of the
Act.

However, the Members of the Commission believe that
such arrangements raise not only legal but also
important policy and regulatory issues.  It is the
view of the Commission that the proposed structure is
contrary to the spirit and intention of the
Broadcasting Act 1990.

As a consequence of the acquisition of Central
Television by Carlton Television and LWT by Granada
Television, the holdings of 18 per cent held by each
company increased to 36 per cent. The Act established
that there should be a limit of 20 per cent on any
individual shareholding by a deadline to be set by
the ITC.

The original deadline of 31 December 1994 for selling
the excess shares was extended by one year pending
the completion of a review by Ministers of a range of
ownership issues.  The Secretary of State for
National Heritage confirmed earlier this year that
the Government did not propose to raise the existing
limits on shareholdings in a nominated news Provider
and the ITC has stated that it expects disposal to
take place by the stipulated date of 31 December
1995.

The ITC regrets that Carlton and Granada are giving
active consideration to interpreting the ownership
rules of the Broadcasting Act in a way which in the
ITC' s view was not originally intended by
Parliament.

David Glencross, Chief Executive, ITC said:
"We have urged Carlton and Granada to reduce their
shareholdings to the level envisaged by the Act as
soon as is practicable, and in a way which is
consistent with both the spirit and the letter of the
legislation.

"We very much hope that the new broadcasting
legislation will address avoidance mechanisms of this
kind".

-PHILIPS: Czech Telecom uses technology from Philips
to increase the number of telephone lines

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PHILIPS: Czech Telecom
uses technology from Philips to increase the number
of telephone lines -- Philips awarded order worth DM
2 million for PCM MULTI multi-channel transmission
system
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

The Czech network operator SPT has awarded Philips
Transmission Networks in Nuremberg, Germany, an order
for the delivery of PCM MULTI systems.  The order is
valued at some DM 2 million.

PCM MULTI, the new multi-channel transmission system,
will enable the network operator SPT to make multiple
use of existing two-wire telephone lines.  This
capability is especially important wherever, due to
poor infrastructure, only one telephone line is
available, and yet a much larger number of lines is
required. 

Using the PCM MULTI system, up to eleven independent
analogue voice channels can be transmitted digitally
using the HDSL transmission technique via one
two-wire line.  The echo cancellation procedure with
the internationally standardised 2B IQ line code is
used for direction separation.  The PCM MULTI system
comprises a connection unit at the subscriber's
premises and one at the exchange.  PCM MULTI can be
used in both analogue and digital telecommunications
networks.  In the ISDN, a maximum of five telephone
lines are available.

The PCM MULTI units are powered via a central 48/60 V
exchange battery.  A power supply is therefore not
required on the subscriber side.  The bridgeable
distance between the connection unit at the
subscriber's premises and the exchange depends on the
subscriber line diameter.  Using cable with a
conductor diameter of 0.4 mm, a distance in excess of
3 km can be bridged.  Being so quick and easy to
install in existing telecommunications
infrastructures, PCM MULTI represents an affordable
way of extending the number of telecommunication
lines.

-PHILIPS: DM4 million high-bit-rate SDH and broadband
digital TV transmission system order from PTT Telecom

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-PHILIPS: Dutch operator
PTT Telecom awards Philips of Nuremberg order worth
over DM 4 million for delivery of high-bit-rate SDH
and broadband digital television transmission systems
-- The systems are ideal for the cost-effective
installation of broadband distributive networks
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

The Dutch operator PTT Telecom has awarded Philips
Transmission Networks in Nuremberg, Germany, an order
worth over DM 4 million to deliver SLE-16 SDH systems
with transmission rates of 2.5 Gbit/s and DIMOS
digital television transmission systems for bit rates
of up to 140 Mbit/s.

Using this combination of equipment, PTT Telecom will
be able to expand the coverage of its broadband
distributive networks still further at a
cost-effective price. TV and radio channels will be
transmitted in digital format via fibre-optic cable. 

DIMOS, the digital television transmission system, is
able to transmit one or more TV channels in PAL,
NTSC, SECAM or D2-MAC.  It can also be used to relay
radio channels and data.  The signals are transmitted
at a data rate of 140 Mbit/s.  As a result of the
high transmission quality, DIMOS is equally ideal for
exchanging channels between TV studios as it is -
when used in combination with SDH transmission
equipment - for feeding channels into broadband
distributive networks. 

Transmission in the long-haul network is achieved
using the SLE-16 SDH transmission systems.  These are
each capable of accepting sixteen DIMOS systems
simultaneously at the central feeding point.

Factors encouraging the network operator to deploy
the DIMOS and SLE-16 systems for setting up new
network structures include the quality of the video,
audio and data transmission, as well as cost
considerations.  By using different coding boards,
DIMOS can be adapted for a host of applications.  In
suitable networks, up to sixty TV and sixty FM
channels, plus two DSR packages (32 digital radio
channels), can be broadcast, for example.

-MESSE MUNCHEN: Munich trade fair boss Dr Werner
Marzin retires

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-MESSE MUNCHEN: Munich
trade fair boss Dr Werner Marzin retires
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:191295

* The Minister-President of the Free State of Bavaria
presented the President of Messe Munchen GmbH on the
occasion of his retirement with the Knight
Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the
Federal Republic of Germany

On November 30th 1995, Dr Werner Marzin, the longest
serving trade fair boss in Germany, celebrated his
departure from active professional life and his
transition into retirement in the company of
colleagues, partners and friends in Hall 23 of the
Munich Trade Fair Centre.

The importance of his work for the trade fair
business in Munich and worldwide was underlined in
speeches given by the Minister- President of the Free
State of Bavaria, Dr Edmund Stoiber, the Bavarian
Minister of Economics, Transport and Technology, Dr
Otto Wiesheu, the Lord Mayor of Munich, capital of
Bavaria, Christian Ude, and by the President of the
Chamber of Trades and Crafts for Munich and Upper
Bavaria, Heinrich Traublinger.  On this successful
evening, attended by more than a thousand guests, the
Bavarian Minister-President awarded the Knight
Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the
Federal Republic of Germany to Dr Marzin for his
"decades of successful work for the benefit of Munich
as a trade fair location and in the interests of the
trade fair business throughout Germany".

In 1964 Dr Werner Marzin joined the recently founded
Munich Trade Fair and Exhibition organisation, and he
has remained loyal to it for over 30 years.  Since
1968 he has also held the office of President of the
GHM, Gesellschaft for Handwerksausstellungen und
-messen mbH (Handicrafts Exhibitions and Fairs,
Organisation), since 1978 that of President of Messe
Munchen GmbH, and since 1981 also that of President
of IMAG, Internationaler Messe - und
Ausstellungsdienst mbH (International Exhibition and
Fair Service Ltd.). In this role he formed the
promotional umbrella organisation, MMI - Messe
Munchen International - and thus created a distinct
identity for Munich as a trade fair location. 
Honorary offices were also conferred upon him, such
as, for example, Member of the Steering Committee of
the UFI - Union des Foires Internationales (World
Federation of the International Trade Fair and
Exhibition Industry), Vice-President of the
Ausstellungs- und Messeausschuss der Deutschen
Wirtschaft (AUMA e.V., (Confederation of German Trade
Fair and Exhibition Industries), Member of the
Landesvorstand des Bayerischen Handwerkstages
(Regional Board of the Handicrafts Convention of
Bavaria) and Vice-President of the Export club of
Bavaria.  He was also honoured with many awards from
Germany and abroad for his services in the trade fair
business.

Dr Marzin will continue to put his long years of
professional experience at the service of Messe
Munchen through his involvement primarily in
neighbouring countries in Central and Eastern Europe
through the regional office of Messe Munchen in
Vienna.

The fact that Munich, a comparatively recently
developed trade fair location, now has a
comprehensive programme of major international trade
fairs and is at the forefront of worldwide
competition, is due in large part to the efforts of
Dr Werner Marzin.  Yet he has also fought for the
future of trade fairs in Munich.  His was the
initiative behind the building of the New Munich
Trade Fair Center, a modern trade fair site that will
secure the competitiveness of Munich as an
international trade fair location through into the
next millenium.

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-IPC MAGAZINES: Robert
Powell -- Cured by a carrott! in this weeks Woman's
Own
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:020195

They say carrots are good for you, but comedy cop
Robert Powell has revealed that his Detectives
co-star Jasper Carrott has much more serious healing
powers.

In this week's issue of Woman's Own, Robert reveals
for the first time how Jasper's touch cured him of a
painful ailment whilst filming one of their shows. 
He says: "I had something wrong with one of my eyes -
it suddenly became incredibly sore.  But Jasper
managed to get rid of it just by the laying on of
hands.  I was up and running very quickly."

But Jasper himself is very modest about the incident
and says: "It was probably a coincidence, although I
do believe everybody has the ability to heal.

"It's not a matter of belief, it's a physical fact. 
There's nothing particularly mystical or spiritual
about it.  Everybody has the ability, but some people
are better than others.  I wouldn't want people to
get the wrong idea about it, either - I'm not going
around healing people all the time.  But I really do
think that anyone can do it.  A mother instinctively
heals a child's knee by rubbing it, and it's just an
extension of that."

-MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE: Men's Health Awareness
Campaign -- Lose your gut in six weeks

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE:
Men's Health Awareness Campaign -- Lose your gut in
six weeks
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

More than half of all men in the UK are overweight,
but losing you gut is simple, says MEN'S HEALTH
Magazine.

The average beer gut - the type that's just creeping
over your trousers and making you wear your jacket
open - is about 6lbs of excess fat and if you aim to
lose 1lb a week you'll be back to the taut stomach of
your youth within six short weeks.

If you have a bigger belly problem, you'll just have
to keep repeating your six-week plan until you don't!

Now for the bad news.  To shift 1lb of fat you have
to lose 3,500 calories. This may seem a depressing
statistic, but if you see your beer gut as half -
pound packets of butter hanging around your middle
and picture losing two of those packets a week, a lb
a week suddenly seems like quite a lot! says MEN'S
HEALTH Magazine.

The equation for losing your beer gut is
straightforward - calories in versus calories out
through exercise.  Just work out how much exercise
you are willing to do and the rest of the calories
you have to cut from your diet. 

But remember, diet and exercise COMBINED is the most
efficient way to lose weight, so aim to lose 50% of
your calories from your diet and burn off 50% through
exercise, says MEN'S HEALTH.

Now get out your calculator and do your sum.  Firstly
work out how many calories you need to maintain your
weight.  An easy guide is to multiply your body
weight in kilograms by 35.  So, for example, if you
weigh 76 kilos, you need 2,660 calories to keep your
weight steady.

You already know that to lose one lb of fat you need
to lose 3,500 calories a week and that's 500 a day. 
This could mean you burn-up an extra 250 calories
through exercise and you cut 250 calories from your
daily diet. 

To find out how many calories you are going to burn
from exercise, consult the following table and
multiply the number beside your chosen exercise (s)
by your body weight in kilos to find out your hourly
calorie burn. 

Rowing                         9.5
Cycling (road 10mph.)     6 to 8
Cycling (stationary)      3 to 5
Stairmaster                    6
Weight-lifting                 3
Running (6mph)                10
Swimming                      10
Skiing                         7
Social football                2.5
In-line skating                7
Speed-walking                  4.5
Tennis                         7
Golf (carrying clubs)          5.5
Aerobics (low-impact)          5

For example, if you decide to cycle to work three
times a week and it takes half an hour, multiply the
figure for cycling (6) by your body weight and you
will find out your hourly calorie burn.  IE: Cycling
: 6. So 6 x 76kg (body weight) = 456 calories burned
per hour.  Therefore 1 1/2 hours a week cycling 684
calories burned.  As you need to lose 3,500 calories
a week, that still leaves 2,816 excess calories which
you will have to take out of your diet. That's 402
calories a day.  So, subtract 402 calories from the
amount you should be eating to maintain your weight,
2,660, and you will find out your new calorie intake
should be 2,258 calories a day.

To achieve weight-loss as well as cardiovascular
fitness, you should ideally aim to exercise three or
four times a week for around 30 to 40 minutes,
advises MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.  If you do less than
this, you will have to train very hard to get enough
calorie burn and you will be more likely to give up.

And remember, if you have been fairly sedentary for a
while, start exercising gently and build up
gradually.  Walking, cycling a-id swimming are ideal
starting off exercises because you can achieve a good
calorie burn without much risk of injury.

Food wise, you need to reduce your fat intake by
choosing low-fat versions of the basic foods (butter,
milk and cheese) and only eat lean meat cooked
without any added fat.  Make sure you cut right back
on pastry dishes, pies and chips and eat lots more
vegetables, energy-giving complex carbohydrates
(pasta, rice, potatoes and bread) and switch to fresh
fruit instead of fattening puds.

Be very wary of takeaways because they can be laden
with fat - even a lunchtime sandwich my be burdened
with high-fat butter and mayonnaise - and cut back on
beer.  At around 180 calories plus per pint, a
lunchtime pint plus a couple in the evening can mount
up to about 550 calories in a day!  Dry white wine
has far less sugar than beer or try spirits with a
slim-line mixer. 

Francis Cottam, the Editor of MEN'S HEALTH Magazine
says:
"It's not difficult for a man to lose his gut, but it
does take an organised effort.  Most men want to be
fitter, healthier and sexier.  A flabby out of shape
body signals poor health and low self-esteem.  A
well-toned physique radiates good health and
self-confidence. 1996 is the year for men to shape-up
for a better life. We'll show you how.`

-MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE: Reasons to be cheerful! -- 10
ways men can make themselves happy in 1996

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE:
Reasons to be cheerful! -- 10 ways men can make
themselves happy in 1996
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:211295

* TAKE A 'HAPPY DAY' OFF WORK
"For many British workers, the sneaky day-off under
the pretence of flu, migraine or botulism is me of
the most popular routes to temporary happiness," says
MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.  "And it's almost always
happier than a legitimate holiday, because there is
no pressure to have a great time, it's a day just for
you." In fact, a lot of sickness absence is simply a
stress-relieving exercise - you've worked hard m a
project and you need a day-off.  In Sweden, workers
are given a number of 'mental health days' by their
employers, which they can take without having to
phone in to say they've got the lurgy.

So next time you genuinely feel the need for a
stress-busting day-off, don't call it a 'sickie'.  Be
positive and call it 'a happy day'.

* HAVE A LAUGH
The very act of laughing helps you feel happy.  And
the sillier, the better, says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine. 
Research shows people who are most happy seem to be
eccentrics who don't care what the world thinks of
them.  Monty Python had it right all along. "When you
laugh, your whole body benefits from an internal
massage," says MEN'S HEALTH. "This relaxes muscle
tension, reduces stress in the nervous system, you
breathe deeper, you have greater circulation and
endorphin 'happy' chemicals are released." 

* DO THINGS THAT MADE YOU HAPPY AS A KID
Research has found that in average kids smile 400
times a day, whereas adults only times a day - so try
reverting to your childhood pleasure, says MEN'S
HEALTH Magazine. "Fly a kite, play Scalextric, go to
the seaside and build sandcastles or go ride your
bike.  For many of us, the times we remember being
happiest were Saturday mornings, with no school to go
to, the world to explore and a Raleigh Chopper to do
it on" 

* SMELL A 'HAPPY SMELL'
Of the five sense, smell is the me most directly
linked to the brain, says MEN'S HEALTH.  "The
olfactory nerve goes into the part of the brain that
deals with emotions, moods, hormone release and
primitive instincts.  Even by simply making you
breathe more deeply, essential oils can have a
beneficial effect.  Breathing well and feeling
relaxed is a pretty happy state to be in."

Choose an essential oil that is classified as
'uplifting' such as rosewood mixed with lime or a
coriander and lemon mixture - but don't heat ails
over a candle, you will simply cook up all the
residue and give yourself a splitting headache! 
Instead, invest in an Aroma Diffuser from the chemist
or evaporate the oils over a pan of boiling water.
You could also try frying some bacon and then
tantalise your sense of taste with a bacon buttie!

* GET FILTHY
It's not often nowadays that a man can enjoy the
honest pleasure of getting caked in filth.  But in
our modern world of order, cleanliness and desk
tidies, there's spiritual renewal to be had from
simply getting mucky, says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.

* DRIVE A TANK FOR THE DAY
Give a new meaning to road-rage.  Off-road centres
around the UK offer the experience of driving a range
of 4WD and ex-military  vehicles and a few have
tanks!  Driving a 55-ton Chieftain tank is
'absolutely brilliant' says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine. 
"You sit in a very small cab with your head poking
out of the top.  There is a real sensation of power
and control as you accelerate and all you see if you
go uphill is the sky."

* EAT HAPPY FOOD
If you really fancy a flake, have one.  The power of
chocolate is legendary, it's the all-purpose
happiness drug, says MEN'S HEALTH.  It contains
phenylethylamine, or PEA, a substance that is turned
into noradrenalin in the brain and could have an
addictive effect.  It has even been likened to the
feeling of 'being in-love'.  Chocolate is also high
in sugar and because many people suffer from low
blood-sugar which makes them feel mentally and
physically sluggish, lethargic and possibly fed-up,
chocolate can give you a quick lift for an hour or so
which can be positively mood enhancing. "A one or two
day detox can also work wonders, both mentally and
physically, but don't go on a water-only fast.  Eat
fresh fruit, vegetables and brown rice all weekend
and by Sunday evening, you will really feel on form. 
Your mental clarity will be good and your aches and
pains will have cleared up," says MEN'S HEALTH
Magazine.

* GET A NATURAL EXERCISE ENDORPHIN HIGH
Endorphins are naturally occurring morphine-like
opiates within the body and they are linked to
feelings of happiness.  Certain enjoyable activities
- love and sex, drinking alcohol and eating - can all
be linked to the production of endorphins, but none
is as effective as vigorous exercise. 

* GO AND LOOK AT SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL
Visit an art gallery.  Art provides mental
stimulation.  If you are feeling low, go and learn
something, expand your mind - it is a key to
happiness, says MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.

- WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS, INDULGE YOURSELF!
There are times when even the fittest, most
spiritually pure triathlon runners find true
happiness with a couple cans of beer, a chicken
Biriyani from the local takeaway and a night on the
sofa with a Van Damme video. "It's only one meal in a
week that might contain 21 of them so enjoy it and
don't feel guilty," says MEN'S HEALTH, "but don't
make it the norm." 

And remember, me of the highest causes of stress is
that people are waiting for happiness to happen, says
MEN'S HEALTH Magazine.  It's the Puritan Work Ethic -
we work hard now in order to buy future shares in
happiness.  For a man, it's part of the no-pain,
no-gain, no-such-thing-as-a-free lunch philosophy. 
So stop waiting for happiness to happen and think
about what makes you happy NOW.

PA group company, Two-Ten Communications' decision to
open a Web-site to carry all the traffic from its UNS
NewsWire service has opened a 'window' for
journalists who, up to now, have had to plough
through mountains of paper and fax press releases to
find their stories.

The Internet service - currently up to 50 stories on
weekdays and almost 90 on Budget Day - will gradually
extend to include all releases sent out by Two-Ten on
paper and fax on behalf of its 2,000 PR clients.

Until now, UNS - which carries general and business
news, features and advisories has only been available
to national and regional daily newspapers and major
news agencies and broadcasters.  Now, any journalist
can access it on the Internet, making the service
available to magazine journalists and freelance
correspondents and also to staff with a PC and modem
working from home.

"UNS on the Net" can be found at
www.twoten.press.net.
The Netscape facility 'client-pull' allows news
organisations to keep to up-to-date with news stories
as they are transmitted.  Managing Director, Paul
McFarland explains "Internet users recognise that a
drawback is the need for the user to go hunting for
news and updates.  Our service is designed so that if
a PC is connected to the Net and tuned to the Two-Ten
index, the page will automatically update itself
whenever a new story is released.  So, as with wire
services and Teletext, journalists can keep an eye on
the news without having to keep re-accessing." 

NOTE TO EDITORS:
Two-Ten is part of the Press Association group, which
includes PA News and PA Sport, the UK's leading news
and sport agencies.  Two-Ten's UNS news and picture
wire service is delivered via the PA satellite
network to national and regional daily newspapers and
major news agencies and broadcasters.

Two-Ten is the leading provider of media and
financial information and distribution services to
the Public Relations industry, employing 125 people
at its central London operation.  In addition, the
company has another 80 staff at its Wetherby
operational centre in West Yorkshire, which provides
a wide range of fulfilment and response services,
including subscription management, telephone
order-taking, storage, packaging and distribution.

-THE SCOTTISH OFFICE: The secretary of state's new
year message

M2 PRESSWIRE-2 January 1996-THE SCOTTISH OFFICE: The
secretary of state's new year message
(C)1994-95 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

RDATE:281295

In his New Year message to the people of Scotland,
the Rt Hon Michael Forsyth MP, Secretary of State for
Scotland, writes:- 
"My most striking memory of the past year is of the
first public engagement I carried out as Secretary of
State, when I attended the VJ Day ceremonies.  I was
privileged to meet some of the veterans whose
sacrifices won our freedom.  They were so unassuming
that it was difficult to realise that they had -
quite literally - save  the world from tyranny.  But
that is precisely what they did.

"VE Day and VJ Day left a lasting impression on me
and I found myself wondering during the following
weeks what fitting memorial we could create in
Scotland, in the 50th anniversary year of the
victorious conclusion of the Second World War, to
those who fought and in many cases lost their lives
in that conflict.  Then I became aware of the history
of the former Rowardennan estate on the east bank of
Loch Lomond.

"Because of its outstanding quality, this land was
purchased by the Government in 1950 under the terms
of the National Land Fund 'to preserve the natural
beauty of the area, safeguard public access and
utilise the land for forestry and agriculture'. 
Today the land is owned by Forest Enterprise and the
National Trust for Scotland.  At my request, these
bodies have agreed to undertake the management of the
area in partnership, with a view to creating a major
national monument. 

"I am pleased, therefore, to announce our intention
to establish the Ben Lomond National Memorial Park,
dedicated to the memory of all those who served our
country in the Second World War.  The Memorial Park
will be based on conservation principles, giving
priority to landscape, nature conservation and quiet
recreation.  An integrated management strategy will
include a project for increasing the native woodland
areas within the park.  It is our objective to ensure
that the Memorial Park is protected for all time as
an inalienable national property, permanently
dedicated to this purpose.

"We shall also be launching a national competition to
devise a memorial to the fallen as a focal point to
the park.  Future generations will be able to enjoy
this superb environment, while recalling the
sacrifices that were made to secure for us our
present liberties and quality of life.

"That inheritance can no longer be taken for granted. 
Once again our way of life is threatened - this time
by an enemy within.  The drugs epidemic is a scourge
as terrible as any medieval plague.  This country
strove in unity, as one nation, during the Second
World War to defeat tyranny.  We must find that unity
again to crush the drugs menace. 

"Let us, as a nation, make a New Year resolution that
1996 is the year in which we will turn back the tide
of drug abuse which is engulfing our young people and
threatening our civilisation.  Our aim is nothing
less than to win back Scotland from the drug culture
and liberate a generation.  That is of far more
importance than any party political objective.  We
must unite across party lines and across every age
group to drive the drug barons out of our
communities.  This is not a campaign: it is a
crusade.

"We must rediscover the spirit of wartime unity.  I
am delighted that the leaders of all the political
parties in Scotland are keen to join forces to launch
a major new national initiative against drugs. 
Scotland Against Drugs will seek to unite communities
in fighting drugs misuse. The success of local
anti-drugs campaigns, notably those run by the
Glasgow Evening Times and the Paisley Daily Express,
has paved the way to a nationwide effort.  Its
purpose will be to educate and dissuade young people
from taking drugs.

"It will be launched in January under the auspices of
the Health Education Board for Scotland, linking into
the work of agencies which are already involved in
the fight against drugs.  I hope that it will enjoy
the active support of every MP in Scotland, all the
media, the business community and the country at
large.

"Scotland Against Drugs will publish the facts about
drug misuse; support efforts against local drug
dealing; promote drug-free activities for young
people; and stimulate community attempts to combat
drugs. If we are to divert young people from drugs,
we must spell out one simple message: drugs are for
losers.  But that message will only have credibility
if young people see a real prospect of becoming
winners. We must work together to provide
opportunities for the next generation and the key to
that is partnership.

"In all our endeavours we shall gain strength from
working together. 1 have enjoyed the six months I
have served as Secretary of State, despite the heavy
workload, because I have discovered that, in this
office, you can make a difference - you can make
things happen. Scotland has huge reserves of talent
and enterprise.  But they need to be encouraged and
unleashed.  That is my objective: to help Scotland
fulfil its potential.

"I should like to thank all the people who have
already helped me in this task: the staff of St
Andrew's House and everybody across Scotland who
contributed to my consultation exercise.  Highland
Region and local activists gave invaluable help in
saving the Fort William sleeper service.  The Scotch
Whisky Association were doughty lobbyists and the
fruits of their work were seen in the Budget. All my
Scottish Conservative parliamentary colleagues stood
united, without exception, against the Bill to
introduce Double Summer time which would be very
unwelcome in Scotland; this united stance was clearly
decisive in depriving the Bill of Government support. 

"And there were many other partnerships: with the
doctors and others in the NHS who helped to shape the
policies that led to the rescheduling of Temazepam;
Locate in Scotland's success in securing the Chungwha
inward investment project; Scottish Screen Locations,
on a shoestring budget, helping to create a promising
Scottish film industry; and many more - too many to
be listed here.

"The Scottish economy is a success story.  The latest
export figures, for 1994, show a leap of almost 24
per cent over the previous year to more than GBP 14
billion.  We now export more per head than Japan -
who would have imagined that ten years ago?

"During the last year unemployment fell below 200,000
to its lowest level in 15 years; that means a happier
New Year for many Scottish households than was the
case in previous years.  Scotland's unemployment rate
has now been below that of the United Kingdom for
almost four years and long-term unemployment is
falling. 

"If I had one wish for 1996 it would be that all of
us in politics should realise we do not have a
monopoly of good ideas in any one party and that we
should try to find common ground.  I have tried to do
so in 1995.  One example is Campbell Christie's
suggestion of revamping the Scottish Economic Council
to serve Scotland better.  It was a good idea and we
took it on board.  Similarly, many good ideas on
devolution of power to local government were
contained in the paper submitted by COSLA last month. 
In 1996 we will make some of these ideas reality.

"My own resolution for 1996 is to make our country
safer.

Maintenance of law and order is the first duty of
government.  That is why, in the year ahead, we shall
be ensuring that the punishment fits the crime and
that criminals do not walk out of prison half-way
through their sentences.  Drugs can never be
tolerated in prisons; random drug testing is our
answer.  We must give strong support to the police. 
That is why we are putting 500 more officers onto the
streets and giving them the technological help they
need, such as DNA. testing facilities and automatic
fingerprint reading machines.  Let us make a
resolution that 1996 will be a very bad year for
criminals in Scotland. 

"The successes of 1995 point the way ahead for 1996. 
In a spirit of partnership rather than dissension we
must persevere in securing Scotland's interests and
liberating the talents and enterprise of our people
to make our country stable and prosperous.  That is
the spirit in which I ask you to join with me in
striving to make 1996, for everyone in Scotland, a
truly happy New Year."

"FUTURISTIC" MICROCELL PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK PROPOSED FOR
U.S.

     In the first proposal for microcell communication by a major
U.S. company, a subsidiary of Millicom, Inc. has petitioned the FCC
to set aside frequencies in the 1.7 to 2.3 GHz range for a new
mobile phone service based on microcell radio architecture.  PCN
America, Inc. said that its proposed Personal Communications
Network would be similar to the PCNs being proposed in the United
Kingdom and under consideration in Europe and Japan.  Millicom is
a member of a consortium (with Pacific Telesis International, Matra
Communications and British Aerospace Space Systems) that has
applied in the United Kingdom for a license for a PCN.  Licenses
are expected to be awarded in a few months, with service by 1992.
     The deadline for comments on the PCNA petition is December 18,
1989.  Reply comments are due January 3, 1990.
     The basic concepts of PCN, said PCNA, are:
     1) The network should link persons, not stations;
     2) It should allow voice, data and image transmission; and
     3) It should make the most efficient possible use of the
frequency spectrum.
     Applying these principles, PCNA proposes to install a
nationwide network of microcell radio base stations wherever people
congregate.  These would include business and residential
neighborhoods, and in office buildings.  The PCN technique includes
handoffs from cell to cell permitting slow speed mobility (but not
while driving).  PCNA proposed low-powered, wallet sized handsets
that would be activated by a smart card inserted by the user.
Since the smart card is personalized to each user, the network
would recognize the identity of a caller for billing purposes.  A
user away from home would be able to receive as well as initiate
calls if he or she logs in at a network base station and notifies
the network of his or her willingness to accept calls from all or
a particular class of callers.  PCNA said that the intelligence in
the network, combined with the ability to locate any user who has
logged in, will permit the "ability to reach a party with a
communication of a type specifically tailored for receipt by that
party" regardless of his or her location.  The PCN microcell radio
system would be well adapted for cordless PABX's in office
environments.
     The network architecture would be based on the Signalling
System 7 protocol (SS-7) which will allow such "futuristic"
features such as selective call ringing and rejection, virtual
private networks, "wide-area" Centrex, and ISDN features.  To
maximize spectrum reuse, PCNA proposes to use CDMA or similar
spread-spectrum techniques, rather than the TDMA used in DECT or
the FDMA used in the British CT2 system.
     The Chief Engineer of the FCC, Dr. Thomas Stanley,  commented
that his agency welcomes proposals such as this, and is already
engaged in an in-depth study of the concept of personal
communications systems.  He said that the FCC expects to issue a
Notice of Inquiry in the spring of 1990, and the PCNA petition
would be considered in the context of that inquiry, along with
another petition filed by Cellular 21, Inc. for a CT2-type
Telepoint system.
     PCNA  has proposed a service that is far in advance of the
CT2-based  Telepoint system being implemented in the U.K., and
proposed for the U.S. (see separate stories), and could cut into
the cellular market if it can be brought in at a reasonable price
(only the market for the cellular users who must have phone service
while driving will be immune).  CT2 does not allow for calls to be
received, and cannot be used for data or fax transmissions, far
less allow the Centrex-type features promised by PCNA.
     PCN would have convenience and cost marketing advantages over
cellular.  As a low-powered radio (around 10 milliwatts) the
handset would be much smaller than current  models - around half
the size and weight of the Motorola 950 Microtac model, if the
British Telepoint phones are a guide, and its batteries would last
perhaps ten times as long.  PCNA did not estimate the cost of
either hardware or service over the proposed PCN, but since
hardware prices and investment costs per subscriber of a CT2
microcell system are far below those of conventional cellular, it
seems likely that a PCN could significantly underprice cellular.
     Installation of a nation-wide PCN is not around the corner,
but must await the conclusion of the FCC inquiry into personal
communication systems.  According to Dr. Stanley, that inquiry will
probably take about a year from its start in the spring.  If the
FCC then approves the concept and allocates frequencies,
applications for licenses will be accepted.  Some kind of lottery
system is likely if the volume of applications is great.  Only
after some applications are granted would construction of the
network start, and this timetable could be set back if the FCC
decides to await the outcome of the World Administrative Radio
(WARC) conference scheduled for 1992.

U.S. COMPANIES PLANNING MICROCELL NETWORKS

   In addition to Millicom, Inc. (see lead story), at least three
United States companies are  preparing to set up microcell
communications systems - two using the CT2 technology developed in
Great Britain, and one seeking to overlay a microcell radio
technology on existing cellular systems.  A third approach to
Telepoint based on the Digital European Cordless Telephone standard
(DECT) is slated for trials on an interim basis by Ericsson Radio,
Inc.  All of these approaches have potential to create Telepoint
networks across America.  CT2 has the advantage of being already
operational in the U.K. and of requiring very low capital
investment, but has little or no radio spectrum immediately
available.  Additionally, as an out-bound only system, CT2 may not
satisfy the needs of U.S. users.  The existing cellular systems
already have frequencies available and are two-way, but adding
cells is expensive, and cellular operators may not be willing to
give up frequencies for a lower-priced service.  DECT is
intermediate between the CT2 and cellular concepts.  It uses
microcell technology to provide two-way call, but is more expensive
than CT2, and cannot be used while driving.  Each approach has its
proponents, and the competition between them will be worth
watching.  The two major differences between CT2 and cellular-- CT2
is outgoing only (outside of the home), and cannot be used while
driving -- means that Telepoint's target market will be different
from that of cellular.  Additionally the anticipated low cost of
each handset (perhaps $150 at first, eventually going to $75 or
below) focusses Telepoint's appeal on a different segment of the
population than cellular.
     The companies initiating trials are:

Corporate Technology Partners

     CTP is a group of venture capitalists in San Diego seeking to
assemble capital, technology and know-how for a Telepoint network
based on the CT2 system in operation in the United Kingdom.  It
claims to have most of the capital and hardware arrangements in
place for a trial system.  Tests of a prototype will begin in the
first half of 1990, claims Charles Mason, the president of CTP.
The test will use handsets and base stations purchased from a
British manufacturer, transmitting in the same 864-868 MHz as the
U.K.,band on an experimental basis.  If the trial is successful CTP
anticipates installing Telepoint systems on a city-by-city basis in
the United States.

International Mobile Marine.

     IMM is preparing to conduct a test of a Telepoint system in
cooperation with a cellular telephone operator, using cellular
techniques and frequencies.  Initially one microcell will be
established then a pilot program with several cells in a
metropolitan area.  George Calhoun, President of IMM, which is
based in Philadelphia, said that he expected the experiment to be
conducted in the first half of 1990.  While his company has already
conducted some one-cell trials in Philadelphia, he wants to have a
more realistic test using many more handsets in an urban
environment.  IMM's experimental system will use TDMA digital
technology, with separate transmit and receive channels, and using
cellular frequencies.  The initial trials will focus on voice
capability only, but eventually , according to IMM, Telepoint will
accommodate data transmission up to 128 kbs and fax.
     IMM's aim is to develop a base unit, not the handset.  IMM
seeks the best parameters of a system that will work in congested
urban areas.  Calhoun said that while some cellular operators would
not want to give up any of their precious frequencies to set up a
Telepoint system, if the peak period for cellular traffic turns out
to be different from the peak period for Telepoint traffic, then
cellular  frequencies could be economically used for both services.

Cellular 21.

     Like CTP, Cellular 21, of Rutherford, N.J., will be working
with CT2.  Matthew Edwards, the president, said that it has already
received experimental licenses at 864 MHz, and is conducting field
tests with 1,000 Ferranti Phone Zone telephones.  Additionally,
Edwards plans field trials in New York City, on the street and in
the subway system.  He said that if the pocket telephones could
provide acceptable transmission quality in the noisy subway
environment, and on the street directly below the huge radio and TV
towers on top of the Empire State Building, he could be assured
that they would work anywhere.

BRITISH TELEPOINT NETWORKS LAUNCHED

     In the United Kingdom, two of the eventual four Telepoint
mobile phone services have started in London and, hesitantly, in
other cities too.  British Telecom was first with its Phonepoint
network, followed by Ferranti's Phonezone.   Mercury
Communications' Callpoint is due to appear within a few weeks, and
the fourth service from BYPS, a consortium of Philips, Barclays
Bank and Shell, will follow in early 1990.
      Handsets currently cost the equivalent of $310 or so, sign-on
fees are $40 and monthly subscriptions to a service cost $14 (it
varies only a little between the services) although costs are
expected to drop gradually during 1990.  The usage rates are 13
cents per minute local and 37 cents per minute national, about 20%
above coin phone rates.  They are considerably below cellular
rates, which are 60 cents per minute, local and national.

Telepoint Features

     So far there are just two Telepoint handsets, the Phonezone's
and one made by Shaye Communications being used by both Phonepoint
and Callpoint.  BYPS expects to offer CAI standard phones from day
one - the reason they cite for their later launch timetable.  Also
to offer handsets in 1990 is Obitel, a joint venture of Racal and
Plessey.
     Telepoint handsets operate at 864-868 MHz with 40 channels per
public base station although most base stations will initially
operate with 2-4 channels activated until traffic picks up.  The
CT2 technology uses FDMA digital transmission between handset and
base, which permits interference-free calls with high audio
quality.  The small size of the cells allows high spectrum
efficiency, since the 40 channels allotted to Telepoint will be
reused at each cell.  In dense urban areas, the cell size can be
reduced from the standard 200 meters, allowing more users per
square kilometer.  Features of the handset can include
national/international call barring, remote disablement of lost or
stolen handsets and self diagnostics on base stations.

Networks are Growing

     Both the live services have started small, with some 300 base
stations in London and one or two other areas at their launch,
though both have increased the base station population since then.
Phonepoint, for example, has raised its end 1989 forecast to 1500
base stations in operation.  However both services have promising
base station contracts.  Phonezone for instance has a contract to
place base stations in all London Underground (subway) stations -
62 in the central city area alone.  Post Offices have been signed
by Phonepoint and both have contracts with hotels, service areas,
airports, banks and restaurants.    Nevertheless, it seems to us
that in the race to be first, Telepoint may have been tempted into
launching prematurely.
     The eventual target for full saturation is for the user to
never be more than 500 meters from a Telepoint in urban areas or
ten minutes' drive on main roads. To achieve that would require
hundreds of thousands of sites across the UK - Phonepoint says that
agreements already in place give them potentially 30,000 or more.
Both services admit that users will be slow to come forward until
a critical mass of sites exists, but there is no concurrence on
what that level may be.  Projections for 1995 usage by Telepoint
operators and financial analysts have ranged from 800,000 to 6
million subscribers.
     Another major block to growth is the lack of standards - the
first three Telepoint services are incompatible.  A Common Air
Interface (CAI) will allow handsets to be used on more than one
service when it comes into existence in mid-1990, but users will
have to subscribe to both services, increasing the cost.
     The government license obliges all Telepoint services to
introduce roaming, though it could be two years away yet.  Then
subscribers to one service will be able to use another service's
base stations, presumably at slightly higher call charge rates than
usual.

PROJECTED INCOME STATEMENT OF U.K. TELEPOINT SYSTEM

   The following table is an estimate of the financials of a U.K.
Telepoint operator, neither the largest nor the smallest of the
four Telepoint operators.  An underlying assumption is that there
will be approximately two million Telepoint subscribers in the U.K.
by late 1995.
     Service revenues include registration fees, monthly subscriber
charges and usage fees, and expenses include sales/marketing costs,
customer service (including billing), system operation and
maintenance, network charges, G&A and depreciation.

UK'S CHRISTMAS DIP DOES NOT MEAN REAL CELLULAR SLUMP, SAYS INDUSTRY

The disappointing figures for new UK cellular connections recorded over
the run-up to Christmas do not reflect a real slump in demand for
cellular services in the UK, according to leading figures in the
industry.

They argue that while the total of 222,900 net connections made last
month represents a 25-per-cent decline on the record-breaking 300,000
figure achieved in December 1994, this does not mean that there has
been a significant tailing off in consumer interest.

They point out that the December decline has disguised the fact that
connections for the year as a whole were much higher than they were in
1994.  The UK's four network operators added a total of 1,886,009
customers in January to December 1995 -- a 22-per-cent increase over the
1,544,033 added in the previous year.  But in 1995 the demand was
spread out more evenly.

The aggressive competition between dealers, retailers and off-the-page
companies during 1995 soaked up much of the demand for cellular
telephones in advance of December.  ``In 1995, it was a sale every
month,'' said Nigel Salomon, marketing director of service provider
Securicor Cellular Services, ``how much more could happen at
Christmas?''

Executives say that many of the telephones bought in December 1994 were
gift purchases which led to disconnection when their new owners
received their first bills.  They hope this December's new customers
will ``churn less but make more calls,'' according to David Savage,
chairman of service provider Astec Communications.

Who's number one? Vodafone's market leadership is under pressure from
its nearest rival Cellnet, which by the start of this month had only
33,009 fewer subscribers.

On January 1, Vodafone had a total of 2,333,009 subscribers compared to
Cellnet's figure of 2,300,000.  Cellnet has been gradually eroding its
rival's lead.  December was the sixth consecutive month in which it
connected more net new customers than Vodafone.  In December it gained
89,100 net new customers compared to Vodafone's 53,800.

Vodafone faced a major challenge from Cellnet this time last year but
responded aggressively to see off the challenge.  It will be hoping
that last week's launch by service providers of its restructured GSM
tariffs will have a similar effect this year (Mobile Communications,
185/1).

Cellnet is thought unlikely to respond immediately to Vodafone's new
package of per-second billing and ``bundled'' tariffs, which are
similar to the existing packages offered by Orange.  Bundled tariffs
offer customers a certain number of calls as part of their monthly
subscription charge.  Cellnet has tested such tariffs but does not
appear close to a launch.

Cellnet last month withdrew its under-performing Frequent Caller Plus
Budget Plan, the bundled GSM-only tariff for business users which has
not proved popular.  The tariff will no longer be offered, although
existing subscribers can stay on it.  It offered a monthly subscription
charge of #45 in return for either 100 minutes of calls at peak rate or
200 minutes at off peak, or a combination of the two.

Orange's dream Christmas: Although Cellnet is Vodafone's main rival in
terms of total subscribers, one of the main reasons for the slowdown in
its performance is the competition it faces from smaller rival Orange.
Orange is focusing on the business market, which is much more important
to Vodafone than it is to Cellnet.  In December, Orange made 50,000 net
new connections, making this the third month in a row that it has
pushed Vodafone close on new connections (Mobile Communications,
183/7).

Orange now has 380,000 subscribers and is close to overtaking its
nearest rival, Mercury One-2-One.  This company, which signed up 30,000
subscribers in December, now has 397,000 subscribers.

Overall, Vodafone trailed Cellnet on total connections over the 1995
calendar year, with 695,009 against 740,000.  It also lost out to its
rival in 1994, making 585,911 connections compared to Cellnet's
664,122.

Last year, Orange and One-2-One added 280,000 and 171,000 net new
subscribers respectively.  This compares with figures of 100,000 and
194,000 respectively in 1994, reflecting a considerable advance by
Orange but a disastrous slump for One-2-One.

Third quarter: Vodafone lost out particularly badly in the most recent
quarter, October-December, when it connected 143,000 net new
connections -- well down on the predictions of industry analysts --
against Cellnet's 215,000.  These compare with figures of 186,000 and
281,200 respectively in 1994.

Cellnet, however, showed a significant increase in churn in the last
quarter of 1995 compared with the same period last year -- although its
net figures were down on 1994 its gross connections were up over the
previous year, 379,500 compared to 369,500.  Vodafone's churn also
increased.  Gross connections for the last three months of 1995 were
286,000 compared to 313,000 last year.

SPAIN FOLLOWS ITALIAN MODEL IN CELLULAR COMPENSATION PLANS

The Spanish government has drawn up a series of proposed measures
designed to compensate Airtel, the country's second GSM digital
cellular operator, for the Pta85 million ($702 million) fee it had to
pay to secure its licence.

The government, which is understood to have finished putting together
draft proposals on December 28, is currently working with Airtel to
produce a final version of the plan.  The two sides expect to reach an
agreement by the end of next month, if not before.

This rate of progress so far appears to have been acceptable to the
European Commission, which had originally told the Spanish government
to come up with a compensation plan by the end of December (Mobile
Communications, 183/1).

The Italian government, which was set a similar timetable by the EC, is
one step ahead.  It has already completed its package of similar
measures to compensate Italy's second GSM digital cellular operator,
Omnitel, for its L750 billion ($475 million) licence fee.  This
package, which was announced on December 22, was worked out in
agreement with the EC and is expected to receive its formal approval at
the end of this month.

The two governments would have faced legal proceedings before the
European Court of Justice if they had failed to comply with the EC's
demands.

Spanish plan: The Spanish proposals centre on three core measures:
reducing by up to 50 per cent the interconnection rates that Airtel has
to pay to use the network of the state-controlled Telefonica; allowing
Airtel to build its own infrastructure or to use alternative infrastr-
ucture; and awarding Airtel a concession to build and operate a
personal communications network (PCN) based on the DCS-1800 standard.
The first two measures are based on suggestions put forward by Airtel
itself last summer (Mobile Communications, 176/3).

The proposals have been drafted under the aegis of Rienaldo Rodriguez,
the director general of the communications branch of the ministry of
transport and communications, who was appointed to the task at the
beginning of November.

At the moment it is unclear whether the Spanish government intends to
adopt a mixture of all three measures, although this is considered
highly likely given that the Italian government's EC-sanctioned package
is based on a combination of almost identical elements.

Airtel -- which is owned by Airtouch of the USA (15.8 per cent), BT (6.3
per cent) and a group of leading Spanish banks, utilities and
construction groups, and which  launched commercial services on October
3 (Mobile Communications, 179/1) -- had connected 8,000 subscribers by
December 1, and 15,000 by the start of this month.  Telefonica Moviles,
the cellular arm of Telefonica which was charged no fee for its GSM
licence, launched its digital service in July, and had connected 23,000
customers by December 1 and 37,000 by January 1.

The EC told the Spanish government last July that it would have to come
up with measures to enable Airtel to compete on an equal basis with
Telefonica Moviles.  It placed a similar requirement on the Italian
government in respect of Omnitel and its state-controlled counterpart
Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM).

The EC considers the imposition of steep licence fees on new entrants
to the market to be potentially discriminatory if the incumbents do not
have to pay fees for the licences they already hold.  It says that in
order to rectify the situation, the governments concerned should either
extract a licence fee from the incumbent cellular operators, or
introduce measures that will compensate the new entrant for the money
it has already paid.

Italian package: The Italian package, which was announced by
telecommunications minister Agostino Gambino, provides for Omnitel's
interconnection fees to be reduced by 25 per cent this year and by the
same amount next year, which is expected to produce savings in the
region of L60 billion over the two-year period.  The first reduction in
interconnection fees took effect on January 1.

Omnitel will also be granted a licence to offer PCN services based on
the DSC-1800 standard, and will be allowed to use alternative
infrastructure as soon as legislation is in place to enable this.

Omnitel says it is ``happy'' with the compensation package, a reaction
that has surprised several analysts who do not consider it a
particularly good deal.  Telecommunications analysts with merchant bank
Robert Fleming Securities note that the L60 billion savings from
reduced interconnection fees hardly match the L750 billion that Omnitel
paid for its GSM licence in March 1994 (Mobile Communications, 146/3).

In respect of allowing Omnitel to use alternative infrastructure,
analysts point out that this is allowing Omnitel no more than the
freedom to which it would be entitled anyway, given that the Italian
government says it wants to liberalise alternative infrastructure this
year in line with the timetable being pushed through by the EC (Telecom
Markets, 277/1).

The Italian government has already stated its intention to award
licences for PCN services by the middle of this year (Mobile
Communications, 181/1).  But when Gambino announced the plans in
October there was no indication that a licence would automatically be
awarded to Omnitel.  At the time it was said that one licence would be
automatically granted to TIM and a second put out to competitive
tender.

Under the new deal, Omnitel will not be allowed to offer commercial PCN
services until 1998, and neither TIM nor any other competitor will be
allowed to start PCN services before Omnitel has done so.  This puts
back the start of PCN by about a year.  Last October, Gambino intimated
that services would start on January 1 1997.

Omnitel -- whose major shareholders include Olivetti (41.3 per cent),
Airtouch (11.7 per cent) and Bell Atlantic (11.6 per cent), and which
started commercial services on December 7 (Mobile Communications,
184/6) -- says that by January 7 it had signed about 50,000 subscribers.
 TIM had 417,855 GSM subscribers on January 1, and says that on
December 22 alone it signed 23,633 new digital subscribers.

Omnitel is now is the process of expanding its Spazio Omnitel retail
stores.  The first four were opened on December 15 in Milan, Florence,
Genoa and Brescia.  A further 20 stores are scheduled to be opened
throughout Italy by the end of this year, many through franchising
agreements.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S MOBILE DIRECTIVE IS FINALLY ADOPTED

The European Commission yesterday (January 10) adopted the Article 90
directive to liberalise mobile services and networks (Mobile
Communications, 184/3).  A political decision had already been taken on
December 20 but formal adoption was delayed by translation
difficulties.

The directive will come into force before the end of February.  Once it
comes into force, the member states will be given nine months in which
to notify the Commission of the appropriate national measures taken to
implement the provisions.

The directive requires member states to abolish all exclusive and
special rights in the mobile communications market and, wherever this
has not yet been achieved, to establish open and fair licensing
procedures to authorise the launch of GSM, DCS-1800 and Digital
European Cordless Telecommunications (Dect) standard services.  The
number of licences should only be limited by `essential requirements'
such as spectrum efficiency.

Restrictions on current licensees will also have to be raised to allow
them to extend their services from one frequency into another.

In particular, the entering into force of the directive will mean that
member states will not be able to refuse to allocate licences for
public access or telepoint applications for systems operating on the
basis of the Dect standard.

Similarly, member states will not be able to restrict the combination
of mobile technologies, in particular where multistandard equipment is
available.

Nor will member states be able to refuse to allocate DCS-1800 licences
to either new operators or existing GSM operators.  But this aspect of
the directive will not come into effect until January 1 1998.  The
delay is being granted in order to give member states the option of
allowing new DCS-1800 operators time to establish themselves before
existing GSM operators jump in.

Operators will also have the right to provide their own infrastructure
and to make use of alternative infrastructure provided by third parties
such as utility companies.  The Commission believes this to be
particularly important as it estimates that the cost of leasing
transmission capacity currently accounts for between 30 per cent and 50
per cent of the revenues of a second operator.

Member states with less developed networks -- Portugal, Greece, Spain
and Ireland -- will be able to apply for derogations of the directive
for up to five years.  Luxembourg has already made it clear that it is
not interested in any derogation.

Alternative networks: The Article 90 directive to open up alternative
networks and establish full competition is currently being examined by
various working groups and is likely to be adopted in February (Mobile
Communications, 184/3).

OLIVETTI SHARE ISSUE FULLY SUBSCRIBED

Olivetti says that last month's L2,257 billion ($1.42 billion) share
issue, which closed on December 15, was almost fully subscribed with
99.8 per cent of the offer taken up.  It intends to invest a
significant proportion of the money in Omnitel.

LUXEMBOURG GETS SET TO AWARD SECOND GSM CELLULAR LICENCE

The Luxembourg ministry of communications this week invited potential
bidders to register initial expressions of interest in the country's
second GSM digital cellular telephone licence, which is to be awarded
later this year.  It says that eight or nine parties have already come
forward.

The ministry will not reveal who the parties are.  But the Luxembourg-
based Millicom International Cellular confirms that it has expressed an
interest in the licence while Airtouch of the USA says it is
considering doing so.

Interested parties will eventually be asked to put forward proposals
for an integrated GSM/DCS-1800 service.  But the ministry says that it
will award an integrated licence only if it receives a submission which
is sufficiently convincing.  Otherwise the licence will be GSM-only.

However, the ministry will not be able to issue a tender, let alone
grant the second GSM licence, until parliament has agreed to end the
monopoly of cellular services that is currently enjoyed by the state-
owned P&T, which is already operating a GSM network alongside an older
NMT-450 analogue network.

The cellular monopoly will be broken through enacting a new
telecommunications law which is intended to liberalise the country's
extremely closed market in advance of the European Union deadline of
allowing full competition by January 1 1998.

The new telecommunications law will among other things create an
independent regulatory authority.  However, the ministry of
communications says it has no immediate plans to allow new operators
into any sector other than digital cellular.

The government expects to present the new legislation to parliament
this spring, and is confident the bill will be passed by the summer.
At this point it will be able to issue an official licence tender,
leading to the award of two GSM licences later in the year.  One will
automatically be given to the P&T, while the other will be awarded on a
competitive basis.

The P&T will be eligible for an integrated GSM/DCS-1800 licence.  But
like the bidders for the second licence, it will have to put forward
proposals to justify this.  Otherwise it will get a GSM-only licence.

The ministry has not yet revealed detailed licence terms, but it did
give a broad overview of certain elements when it announced its licence
plans towards the end of last month.  The process will involve the
payment of a competitive licence fee, although the ministry stresses
that this will be just one aspect of the selection procedure and that
it will not be running an auction.  Other important elements will
include the speed of each bidder's proposed network roll-out and the
nature of its tariff proposition.

The P&T will have to pay a licence fee to match the one paid by the new
entrant.  If both operators get the same type of licence, the fees will
be the same.  If one gets a GSM licence, and the other gets a GSM/DCS-
1800 licence, then the P&T fee would be adjusted appropriately.

The ministry is considering an integrated GSM/DCS-1800 service because
Luxembourg, with a population of 390,000, is too small a market to
support two GSM networks and two DCS-1800 networks as well.

The P&T's GSM network, which was launched in July 1993, had about
27,500 subscribers by the start of this month.  The NMT-450 system,
which was launched in 1983 and has been in decline for some time, had
about 160.

The only private involvement in the cellular market at the moment is
through four service providers, which sell GSM services but not
analogue ones.  One of these, Mobilux, is equally owned by the P&T and
by MIC.  The other three -- CMD, LTM and Satcom -- are wholly private.

WEST EUROPEAN MARKET HITS NOVEMBER SLOWDOWN

November proved to be a disappointing month for the west European
cellular industry, with a relatively slow rate of growth, according to
figures collected by Mobile Communications.

These show that the market added 769,721 net new subscribers during the
month, taking the total from 20,797,135 to 21,566,856, representing
growth of 3.56 per cent.  The end-month total is 63-per-cent higher
than the 13,231,421 reached at the end of November 1994.

The November growth figure compares with the October figure of 808,689
(4.05 per cent) and the September figure of 708,037 (3.67 per cent).

The equivalent growth figure for November 1994 was 494,680 (3.7 per
cent) (Mobile Communications, 162/5).

The figures would have been influenced by the slow rate of growth in
the UK -- Europe's largest cellular market.  In the UK the November
total of net new subscribers was 158,500, much the same as in November
1994 when 165,000 were added (Mobile Communications, 162/2).  The UK
growth rate for November was 3.15 per cent.

Not all UK operators are experiencing the same growth.  DCS-1800
operator Orange is adding almost as many customers as the much larger
Vodafone (Mobile Communications, 185/2).  Orange added 30,000 net new
customers in November (to take its total to 330,000) compared to 42,500
for Vodafone (to take its total to 2,279,209), 69,000 for Cellnet
(total 2,210,900), and 17,000 for Mercury One-2-One (total 367,000).

An increase in GSM handset prices in Norway following the end of a
``commission war'' has caused growth to slow to about 3.83 per cent,
well down on the spectacular growth rates over the summer (Mobile
Communications, 179/6).

The fastest growing markets in November were Ireland (9.36 per cent),
Luxembourg (7.17 per cent), Spain (6.05 per cent), the Netherlands
(5.48 per cent), Italy (4.69 per cent), Cyprus (4.40 per cent), France
(4.21 per cent), and Germany (4.08 per cent).

The Irish market has been particularly boosted by the growth of GSM
subscriptions.  The price of handsets has fallen substantially
following an increase in commission payments by Eircell, which is
preparing to face competition for the first time following the award of
a second GSM licence to Esat Digifone last October (Mobile
Communications, 182/1).  Increased coverage has also boosted the
attractiveness of GSM.

In Italy, Spain and the Netherlands the launch of new GSM services has
contributed to the growth of local GSM markets as well as stimulating
cellular markets as a whole.

INDIAN GOVERNMENT FINALLY AWARDS REGIONAL GSM LICENCES

The Indian government has finally issued cellular licences for all of
the 18 regional concessions where bids were placed, a process that was
thrown into disarray by the imposition in November of a cap on the
number of licences that any one operator could hold.

Several groups have not yet paid the first instalment of their licence
fees, which were due on December 18.  But the delays are understood to
be temporary and therefore not a cause for concern.

Groups that have yet to pay include Modicom for its Karnataka grade A
licence circle for which it offered Rs13,930 million ($393 million),
the third highest bid placed (see table).  The Modicom group has also
not yet paid the first instalment of its Punjab grade B licence circle,
which cost it Rs12,660 million.

All of the second-highest bidders have agreed to the government's
requirement that they match the fee placed by the highest bidders, as
set out in the initial tender process (Mobile Communications, 179/3).

Under the terms of the licence cap, a single operator can hold no more
than three licences in the grade A and B licence circles, which are the
most attractive.  But there is no limit on the number of licences it
can hold in the less attractive C circles (Mobile Communications,
183/4).

The only groups hit by the cap were the US West-BPL group and Modicom.
US West-BPL originally looked set to win five licences and Modicom four
licences, all in grade A and B circles (Mobile Communications, 177/1).

The operators were obliged, when decided which licence options to give
up, to retain those in circles where they had been the highest bidder.

Modicom originally bid the highest in Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan and
Utter Pradesh East.  So it had the choice of which of these licence
options it should give up.  It decided to relinquish its option on the
Rajasthan licence, which passed to Aircell Digilink, and to hold on to
the other three.

But it was forced to give up Utter Pradesh East because its net worth
did not meet the minimum holding limit set down by the Department of
Telecommunications for any operator wishing to hold more than two of
the top ranked licences.

US West-BPL bid the highest in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and the second
highest in Gujurat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.  So the group was
obliged to keep the first two, and then had the option of deciding
which of the second two to relinquish.  It chose to retain the licence
for Maharashtra (Mobile Communications, 185/16).

CZECH GSM LICENCE CONTEST ATTRACTS WIDE INTEREST

The competition for a 49-per-cent stake in one of the two GSM digital
cellular telephone licences that are being awarded in the Czech
Republic has attracted initial expressions of interest from a total of
18 companies (Mobile Communications, 180/1).

The list of companies which have put in requests for tender documents
and submitted contributions to the consultation process contains
several leading operators from Europe and North America and a number of
local companies.

The potential bidders include DeTeMobil, the McCaw International
company run by cellular billionaire Craig McCaw, Telesystem
International Wireless of Canada, TeleDanmark, France Telecom, RWE
Telliance, Skoda-Mannesmann, Southwestern Bell International, Telenor,
Telecom Finland, Stet International, AirTouch, Vebacom, Tokyo-based
communications company Domen, Czech energy distributor Czechkom Plus,
Czech energy generator CEZ, and two other Czech companies JITY and
Telekomunikace Montaze.

Many of the companies on the list are now involved in negotiations to
form consortia before the final deadline for applications at the
beginning of February.  TeleDanmark and Telenor have already announced
that they will be making a joint bid, with TeleDanmark taking the lead.

A government-appointed committee will evaluate the bids during February
and March.  Following the submission of its recommendations a final
government decision is expected to be made before the end of March.

The winner will become the junior partner to the state-controlled radio
infrastructure operator Ceske Radiokomunikace, which has already been
given a 51-per-cent stake in the new operating organisation that has
been awarded one of the GSM licences.

The other GSM licence has already been promised to the existing NMT-450
operator Eurotel -- which is owned by Czech telecommunications operator
SPT (51 per cent), US West (24.5 per cent) and Bell Atlantic (24.5 per
cent).  A 27-per-cent stake in SPT is held by a joint venture between
KPN of the Netherlands and Swiss PTT Telecom.

Bidding process: Any consortium bidding for the 49-per-cent stake
alongside Ceske Radiokomunikace will have to be controlled by a foreign
company because the government has specified that a leading role must
be played by a `qualified operator' with a minimum of 300,000 cellular
subscribers.

According to Vladimir Sedlacek, director of telecommunications policy
at the ministry of economics, the main criteria for choosing the
winning consortium to partner Ceske Radiokomunikace will be the ability
to deliver low tariffs, good coverage, quick roll-out and high levels
of investment.  The licence fee will be set low to reflect these
priorities, at about $12 million or $13 million.

POLISH GSM CONTEST LIMPS ON

Meanwhile, there has been a much less enthusiastic response to the
contest for two GSM licences in Poland, with only three consortia
submitting bids by the closing date of January 3.

One consortium contains Polish oil refiner Petrochemia Plock, copper
mining group KGHM Polska Miedz and the Polish Power Grid Company in
partnership with TeleDanmark and AirTouch.

Another includes Polish state-owned chemical company Ciech Warszawa,
together with smaller Polish partners alongside Stet.

The third is led by Polish trading company Elektrim together with other
smaller partners and US West.

The winning bidders are expected to be announced by the end of
February.

The number of contenders has been limited partly by the shortage of
sizeable Polish partners capable of taking the required 51-per-cent
domestic stake that a bidding consortium must have in order to qualify
for the contest (Mobile Communications, 180/9).  Another factor has
been the size of the licence fee, with bidders being asked to pay
Ecu100 million ($78.54 million) at the outset and additional annual
payments after that.

Bidders may also have been frightened off by the legal dispute between
the Polish government on the one hand, and France Telecom and Ameritech
on the other.  The two foreign operators, which partner the state-owned
telecommunications operator Telekomunikacja Polska (TP) in the
country's existing NMT-450 Centertel cellular operator, say that the
government has gone back on a promise to award Centertel one of the GSM
licences (see below).

One potential contender which did not submit a bid was the consortium
headed by Polish computer company Optimus and including Telecom
Finland, Veba Telecom, Kinnevik of Sweden and Millicom International
Cellular of Luxembourg.  This group collapsed just before Christmas
after the foreign partners pulled out, citing the high licence fee as
the reason.

CELLULAR LOSERS MOUNT LEGAL ACTION

This week France Telecom followed Ameritech in announcing that it would
take legal action against the Polish government for failing to honour a
1991 pledge to grant Centertel a GSM licence (Mobile Communications,
180/9).

Both operators have asked the International Court of Justice in the
Hague to set up arbitration proceedings.

France Telecom is seeking around $500 million in damages to compensate
it for investment in Centertel's infrastructure as well as the loss of
future earnings.

The Polish government is believed to have suggested to the Centertel
partners that it could instead offer them the DCS-1800 licence it is
planning to award towards the end of 1996.  However, the decision of
the two foreign operators to initiate legal action suggests that
neither was impressed by this proposal.

THIRD GSM OPERATOR FOR ESTONIA

A third GSM licence was awarded in Estonia on December 18 to the
Ritabell joint venture between Millicom International Cellular (48 per
cent) and Estonian media company Levicom (52 per cent).  Luxembourg-
based Millicom International Cellular has management control over the
joint venture.  The new service will be launched in the second half of
1996.

There are already three networks in Estonia, run by two operators.
Semi-state-owned Eesti Mobiiltelefon -- which is a consortium of Eesti
Telecom, Telia and Telecom Finland -- runs an NMT-450 network (launched
in 1991) and a GSM network (launched in 1993).  Radiolinja Estonia runs
a GSM network (launched January 1995).  At the beginning of October,
Estonia had a total of 25,400 cellular subscribers and a penetration
rate of 1.6 per cent (Mobile Communications, 183/5).

Millicom says that Estonia may be a small country but that it is
showing a lively rate of growth and is capable of supporting a third
GSM operator.  It suggests that a GSM network in the region may require
only 10,000 to 15,000 subscribers to be viable.

FCC STAGES BILLION-DOLLAR PCS FREQUENCY AUCTION

The second Federal Communications Commission auction of Personal
Communications Services (PCS) radio frequencies in the USA had
attracted top bids totalling $1.38 billion by the end of last week.

The largest single bid of $225 million was submitted by North Coast
Mobile Communications for the New York licence area, the largest on
offer covering a potential 18 million users.

The highest total bids came from PersonalConnect Communications, the
venture backed by cellular billionaire Craig McCaw, with offers
totalling $278 million in five licence areas.

In this `C' block auction, which is aimed at entrepreneurs rather than
major telecom-munications players, the country is divided into a total
of 493 licence areas, known as Basic Trading Areas (BTAs).  The winner
in each BTA, roughly the size of a US county, will receive 30 MHz of
radio frequencies.

Last year, the FCC sold off 30 MHz of radio frequencies in its `A' and
`B' block auction but in far larger licence areas known as Major
Trading Areas (MTAs).  This auction, which attracted bids from the
industry's major players and lasted three-and-a-half months, raised a
total of $7.73 billion (Mobile Communications, 168/8).

The C block auction, which started in December and will probably run
for at least another month, started with 293 companies and still has
255 on board.  When it is finished, the FCC will decide when to sell
off the smaller D, E and F frequency blocks of 10 MHz each.

LATIVIAN AUTHORITIES TO SELECT WINNER OF GSM LICENCE

Latvia: Meanwhile, the Latvian authorities are due at the end of this
month to select the winner of the contest for a second GSM licence.  A
decision had been expected at the end of 1995.  There are five
applicants for the licence, including consortia led by Millicom
International Cellular, Motorola and Radiolinja of Finland.

The only operator in Latvia at present is Lat Mobilais Telefons -- a
joint venture between Telia, Telecom Finland and three Latvian
companies -- with a NMT-450 network launched in 1991 and a GSM network
launched in January 1995.

CELLULAR STAKES IN LITHUANIA

Millicom International Cellular also holds a 24.95-per-cent stake in
Lithuania's second GSM network, Mobile Telecom-munications, which was
launched on October 25.  The other shareholders in Mobile
Telecommunications are Telecom Danmark (24.95 per cent) and Lithuanian
international gateway operator Lintel (46.6 per cent) as well as two
small Lithuanian shareholders.

Millicom International Cellular also holds a 24.5-per-cent stake in
Lithuania's first cellular operator Comliet, which launched an NMT-450
service in 1992.  The other shareholders are the state-owned Vilnius
Telephone Network, Lithuanian manufacturer Antenna UAB and Telecom
Danmark.

The country's third operator is Omnitel, a joint venture between
Motorola and several private Lithuanian investors, which launched a GSM
service in March 1995.

CANADIAN GOVERNMENT PLAYS SAFE WITH PCS LICENCES

The Canadian government awarded four national personal communications
service (PCS) licences on December 18 (Mobile Communications, 181/6).

Two national 30 MHz licences were awarded to Clearnet PCS and Microcell
Network and two national 10 MHz licences to the two existing cellular
operators, Rogers Cantel Mobile and Mobility Personacom Canada (which
has actually been given 12 regional licences to be held by the
affiliates which own it).

Industry Canada, the federal department for industrial affairs, had the
option of awarding up to six national licences in total and was widely
expected to do so.  Its decision to award only four leaves two national
blocks of frequency unallocated -- one of 30 MHz and one of 10 MHz.  No
official explanation has yet been given for the decision.  But Industry
Canada is due to publish a report later this month outlining its
reasons and also giving details of the licence conditions and the
spectrum transition policy which have not yet been released.

The Industry Canada decisions also represent a more mainstream approach
than expected.  During the contest, the department had stressed that it
wished to encourage innovation and competition as priorities, and that
it was willing to consider dividing up the frequency blocks on a
regional basis (Mobile Communications, 174/3).  But it is believed to
have been disappointed by the lack of new ideas exhibited in the
submissions.  These tended to be fairly similar, retaining a strong
high-mobility voice-telephony emphasis.  As none of the outsiders
distinguished themselves sufficiently technologically, the licences
ended up going to the safe options.

Clearnet PCS and Microcell Network were generally held to be two of the
three main candidates for national 30 MHz licences (Mobile
Communications, 181/6). The third favourite, TeleZone, a telepoint
licensee in which Bell Atlantic and AirTouch are strategic investors,
received nothing.  It has already announced that as a result it will be
laying off half of its staff.  It is believed that the company is
considering an appeal and may close down completely if it does not
obtain a licence.  Industry Canada says that there is no formal appeal
process, but that it is always possible to make representations.

Commentators suggest that TeleZone did not win a licence because it did
not provide a sufficiently regional focus to its application.

Clearnet PCS is a Canadian operator of enhanced specialised mobile
radio (ESMR) services in which substantial stakes are held by Motorola
and US ESMR operator Nextel.  Clearnet has still to make a technology
choice.  It has been trialling Nortel's GSM-based PCS technology and
Motorola's Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology in Ontario.

Microcell Network is a telepoint licensee (Mobile Communications,
163/6) with shareholders including National Telesystem (which has a
controlling stake in international operator Teleglobe), Sprint Canada,
CUC Broadcasting and others.  Microcell Network is thought likely to
opt for a GSM-based PCS system although no technology decision has yet
been announced.

Existing cellular operators Rogers Cantel and Mobility Personacom
Canada did as well as they could expect with 10 MHz each.  They were
unable to apply for 30 MHz blocks because they are subject to a
spectrum cap (Mobile Communications, 174/3).  No technology decisions
have yet been announced by these two operators.  Both are expected to
make use of the new spectrum to relieve areas of high congestion on
their existing networks.

There is speculation that the 40 MHz of spectrum that Industry Canada
has held back might also end up going to Rogers Cantel and Mobility
Personacom Canada once their spectrum caps expire in three years' time.
 According to one industry commentator this solution would give new
operators Clearnet PCS and Microcell Network a head start but would
then at the end of the three-year period create a level playing field
with each of the four PCS operators ending up with 30 MHz of spectrum.

PCS services are expected to be launched by 1997 at the latest,
initially in the main urban areas of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.
This would initially involve cellular voice services although more
innovative applications are likely to be introduced at a later stage.

TWO COULD BE COMPANY FOR VODAFONE AND AIRTOUCH

A merger between AirTouch of the USA and Vodafone of the UK, the
world's two leading international cellular operators, would offer
considerable benefits to both, according to an investment report from
UK securities house Robert Fleming.

The report, published at the end of last month, argues that a merger
would create major economies of scale, particularly in Europe where the
new company, which Robert Fleming calls AirFone, would run cellular
networks in virtually every country.  Airfone would also have a major
presence in the US and Asia-Pacific regions.

In Europe, the merged company would be in a strong position to extract
better interconnection terms from fixed network operators or even,
depending on EU regulations, to build its own long-distance and
international links to carry cellular traffic between its national
operations.  Such a move would substantially improve margins on calls.
In addition, a merged company would be able to generate increased
revenues from users roaming across Europe by requiring its customers to
roam only to its own networks, thus reducing the scale of outpayments
made to other operators.

The two companies would also have a stronger say in the running of the
Globalstar satellite venture, in which both are currently involved as
individual shareholders.

Robert Fleming foresees little opposition to a merger from existing
shareholders, many of whom, such as US financial institutions Fidelity
and Capital Research, are already investors in both companies.

Discussion of the merits of a possible AirTouch-Vodafone alliance --
which is not thought to be an imminent prospect -- is the result of
investor concern over the weakness of Vodafone's share price since
November.  This weakness, which has been largely caused by fears about
the increased level of competition that Vodafone is facing in the UK,
has led to concern that the company could be becoming undervalued,
prompting analysts to examine a number of ways in which the real worth
of the company could be more properly realised.  But any proposal for a
merger would probably have to wait at least until the retirement of
Vodafone's chairman and chief executive, Sir Gerry Whent, in two years'
time.

Other recent analyst suggestions on how to unlock Vodafone's value have
included proposals for a demerger of its international business from
its UK operation.  It is argued that this would allow the hidden value
of the international business to be realised.  But a demerger is
dismissed by Robert Fleming as unrealistic, on the grounds that such a
move would run counter to the global trend for consolidation in the
cellular industry and would also expose Vodafone's relatively weak
position in the UK.

More likely is the idea of spinning off individual foreign operations
in which Vodafone holds a stake.  Aside from profitability, Vodafone
would also have to secure the support of other shareholders before a
flotation could take place.  Candidates for such a strategy, which
would not happen at least until next year, would include Greek GSM
operator Panafon and Vodafone's Australian GSM operator, which is also
called Vodafone.

ONE IN FOUR USERS UNHAPPY

One in four of those cellular users who pay their own bills now regret
buying their telephones, according to a survey by the Consumers'
Association which criticises poor quality service and unreliable
equipment.  The results of the survey -- which involved questioning
thousands of users of all types, but excluded from the analysis those
users for whom the bills are paid by someone else, such as their
employer -- is published next month in the association's two-monthly
Consumer Policy Review magazine.

The survey also criticises the contracts that service providers offer
to users.  This is already the subject of an Office of Fair Trading
inquiry (Mobile Communications, 184/1).  The OFT wrote to nine service
providers in November, telling them to change their contract terms, or
risk court action.  Some of these service providers have responded, but
it is unclear whether all of them have done so.  The OFT has yet to
take further action.

ORANGE FLOAT PLANS

Hutchison Telecom UK, the parent of Orange, has confirmed the formation
of a bank syndicate to underwrite the initial public offering in the
mobile operator later this year.  Global co-ordinators Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson and Goldman Sachs will lead the sale.  Senior managers
in the UK and Europe will be ABN Amro Hoare Govett and NatWest.  Lehman
Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette will manage
the offering in the USA.  HSBC and a few other banks with a strong
presence in the Asia-Pacific region will handle the sale in the rest of
the world.

The offering now appears likely to take place in the second quarter of
1995, rather than the first quarter, which is thought to have been
Hutchison's initial wish.

Hutchison Telecom, owned by Hutchison Whampoa and British Aerospace, is
valued at about #2 billion but its owners are not expected to sell more
than a 25-per-cent stake.

WAVELENGTH SET TO OFFER NATIONAL PAMR SERVICE

The UK will have a second national public access mobile radio (pamr)
operator from the start of next month with the launch of an expanded
service by regional operator Wavelength.

The company has linked together its existing regional networks, which
cover 70 per cent of the UK's population, in order to offer a UK
service in competition with National Band Three.

Up to now, Wavelength's coverage has had significant gaps, for instance
between Birmingham and Manchester.  These will now be bridged by
providing coverage on major roads linking its regional networks -- an
arrangement which is allowed under Wavelength's regional licences.

The company will continue to target the traditional pamr market of
transport or service companies and will not attempt to branch out to
consumers.

``Wavelength's move should boost competition in the UK pamr market,''
said one observer.  ``National Band Three has better coverage and
capacity because it has more transmitters and leased lines.  But
Wavelength, with less infrastructure, might be cheaper.''

Wavelength, which has 5,000 users, has been expanding since its
takeover in 1994 by Telesystem International Wireless (TIW), a Canadian
company that invests in mobile communications ventures (Mobile
Communications, 156/6).

In the autumn of 1994, TIW won six out of nine regional pamr licences
awarded by the Department of Trade and Industry (Mobile Communications,
159/5).

UK RADIO AGENCY SET TO LICENSE DIY SERVICES

The Radiocommunications Agency will next week (January 18) allow UK
users to run their own limited mobile radio services when it issues the
first licences for Short Range Business Radio (SRBR) services.

The new licences, which will cost #30 for three years, will enable
users to use analogue SRBR handsets to provide themselves with radio
and paging services over a range of up to 400 metres, without the need
for infrastructure.  The technology is suitable for locations such as
building sites, hospitals or industrial estates.

The agency expects eventually to be issuing about 500 licences a year,
although by this week it had received only one application.

The licences should prove attractive since the only cost of the new
service, after having paid the licence fee, will be the purchase of
handsets and paging units.  Users do not incur any airtime, connection
or rental costs.

Motorola will next week launch Handie-Com, the first SRBR product
range.  Motorola was one of the main manufacturers behind the much-
delayed technology.

SRBR is linked to a similar technology, known as Digital Short Range
Radio (DSRR), which the Department of Trade and Industry had wanted to
see implemented as long ago as 1990 (Mobile Communications, 184/11).

A NEW NAME, AN EXPANDED MISSION

Dear Subscriber:

     Welcome to the inaugural issue of Mobile Communications
Report, incorporating the former Mobile Satellite Reports -- and
much more.

     In introducing Mobile Communications Report, we're responding
to the clear mandate of our satellite readers to expand our
coverage of nonsatellite mobile communications.  The mobile
satellite industry always has been best understood within the
context of its "allied and competing" industries (as we had dubbed
them in our regular Mobile Satellite Reports feature).  Now,
responding to your requests and to the rapid changes taking place
in mobile communications as a whole, we have created Mobile
Communications Report.

     Our mission is simply stated:  To continue to provide the
industry with the sharpest, most concise and most accurate news and
analysis anywhere.  It's what Warren Publishing has been doing for
more than 50 years.  We will remain the acknowledged authority on
the mobile satellite industry.  We'll apply the same standards to
our fuller treatment of terrestrial mobile communications.

     A final pledge:  Mobile Communications Report, like all of
Warren's publications, never will be something that adds to your
burden of keeping up.  You already have "too much to read."  We
pride ourselves on providing newsletters that our readers want to
read -- because our work is thoughtfully planned, accurately
written and meticulously edited.

     I would love to hear from you, with both comments and
questions.  My number is 202-872-9202, ext. 245.

     Sincerely,
     Daniel Y. Warren
     Associate Publisher and 
        Senior Editor

SECOND FCC PCS AUCTION AT TWICE BIDDING PACE OF FIRST ROUND YEAR
AGO

     Long-delayed Block C PCS auction set fast pace, with 293
companies seeking 493 licenses through first 4 rounds 2 weeks ago,
easily eclipsing pace for first round in 1994 when bigger, richer
companies sought 99 licenses.  Round 4 ended Dec. 21 with
$1,209,613,496 in net revenue vs. $678.9 million through same stage
in earlier auction.  Although licenses cover same territory,
industry observers suggested smaller service areas in Block C
coupled with repeated delays in launching sales may be contributing
to faster pace.  "There is a lot of pent-up demand for these
licenses," said Kathleen Ham, chief, FCC Auctions Div.  Auction was
to resume Jan. 5 if govt. shutdown has ended.

     Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) auction for 1,040 licenses,
more commercial and less glitzy industry, slowed "to a crawl" and
FCC was forced to move Stage 2 bidding rules until after holiday
break, Ham told us.  SMR bidding through 13 rounds ended with
$166.9 million in net revenue from high bids, although Atlanta
Trunking's erroneous bid of $125 million skewed numbers.  Without
withdrawal of payment owed by Atlanta Trunking, net revenue is
$60.6 million, FCC said.  Ham said Stage 2 rules require companies
to bid on 75% of eligible pops, compared with 50% in Stage 1, or
face reduction in eligibility.  Auction staff will review bidding
pace after sale resumes -- Jan. 2, if govt. has reopened -- she
said.

     Interest in PCS Block C licenses grew as legal delays pushed
back start from April to summer, then fall and finally to Dec.,
with further one-week delay in first govt. shutdown.  Ham said
pent-up demand combined with 2-week hiatus for holiday probably
contributed to aggressive bidding.  Wireless Bureau Chief Michele
Farquhar said:  "This shows that good things come in small
packages."  Ham said experience acquired in first action also may
contribute to speed of bidding in current sale.

     Block C licenses could generate greater value based on smaller
territories compared with A and B Block licenses, which raised $7
billion from 18 bidders.  Ham said speculation has focused on
revenue possibilities that would increase for smaller licenses. 
Larger A and B territories, such as N.Y. and L.A., covered more
than one state, requiring substantial buildout.  Block C is geared
to Basic Trading Areas (BTAs), with 10 BTA licenses for each MTA.

     Industry analyst Herschel Shosteck offered additional reason
for size of opening round:  Block C companies are vehicles for big
companies to expand existing cellular or PCS holdings, using
ability to hold up to 49% of Block C bidder as minority Partner. 
"This is a facade for the big boys to take another crack at it," he
told us.  "It all has to do with ideology."  For example, he said
U.S. AirWaves, headed by former U S West executive John DeFeo, has
backing from MCI, which has loaned company $25 million.  Wireless
entrepreneur Craig McCaw acquired 25% of Personal-Connect
Communications of Seattle.  To qualify, companies had to have
revenues under $125 million for last 2 years, and assets below $500
million, but Shosteck said several companies had up-front payments
-- in cash -- of more than $50 million.  AirWaves paid $81 million
and NextWave, which is thought to have Qualcomm as backer, $79
million.  At end of auction, he said, small companies that bid
"will sell out" to larger companies, leading to news stories on
success of entrepreneurs.

     Analysis of Round 4 bids showed PCS 2000, P.R.-based company,
still would pay premium for its licenses of $11.24 per pop compared
with other leaders bidders' $7.50-$9.  Company also bid $46.5
million ($11.24) in Boston and $46.3 million ($11.24) in
Washington, D.C.  For example, GWI PCS offered $112.5 million for
L.A. ($7.73 per pop) and $48.9 million for San Francisco ($7.59),
DCR PCS offered $70.3 million, $8.58.  NextWave bid $53.1 million,
$9, in Philadelphia, and $37.8 million, $8.03, in Detroit.  In
Block A & B auction, Pacific Telesis bid high of $21.39 in L.A. and
San Francisco, Poka Lambro $1.83 for Wash.-Mont. and Guam.  Most
paid $10-$15.

U.S. POSITION ON FUTURE STRUCTURE OF INTELSAT IS IMMINENT

     U.S. is set to finalize position on future structure of
Intelsat as soon as it returns from shutdown, Michael Fitch of
State Dept. Office of International Communications & Information
Policy (ICIP) told recent FCBA conference in Washington.  When U.S.
position is completed, he said, process of changing organization
can be accelerated.  U.S. has proposed creating one or more
separate Intelsat affiliates to compete for new services such as
mobile, direct-to-home, VSAT, other broadband applications. 
PanAmSat has said organization should be split into 3-4 companies
to ensure fair competition.  ICIP head Vonya McCann said "there's
no question that if member governments created [Intelsat and
Inmarsat] today, they would be different."  She said belief when
international satellite organizations were established that single
nation or company couldn't operate satellites has been "shattered"
by advances in technologies and economies.

     PanAmSat lawyer Henry Goldberg said that "given the
marketplace, we don't need intergovernmental treaty organizations"
to provide satellite capacity.  Comsat Gen. Counsel Warren Zeger
said current plan would have 51% of affiliates owned by
non-Intelsat signatories.  Similar Inmarsat affiliate -- ICO -- is
owned almost entirely by Inmarsat and its signatories.  Zeger said
issues involving ownership and governance of affiliates should be
resolved in time to conclude situation at Assembly of Parties in
1997.  Goldberg told us after panel that he doubts U.S. is still
considering divestiture, but is hopeful it will decide on creating
multiple affiliates instead of just establishing single affiliate
for new services.

     On separate issue, industry again rejected auctions as means
of resolving mutually exclusive applications in satellite area. 
Auctions in U.S. "could set off a chain reaction" across world,
Iridium Vp Leo Mondale said.  Systems such as Big LEO that Iridium
proposes "will never get investors because of the uncertainty" of
costs and ability to acquire licenses in auctions, he said:  "What
we're really concerned about is the open-endedness of the auction
process."  Auctions in more than 200 countries could kill satellite
programs, Comsat's Zeger said.

     Mark Grannis, FCC International Bureau legal adviser, said
auctions are fast and efficient and asked whether there's better
way to resolve mutual exclusivity.  While panelists didn't offer
alternatives, we're told industry was prepared to offer several at
Bureau's scheduled policy roundtable that was cancelled because of
govt. shutdown.  Roundtable tentatively has been rescheduled for
Jan. 10 at FCC hq.  Sources said members of Satellite Industry
Assn. haven't reached consensus on what policies to advance, so
companies will offer their ideas individually.

BOEING'S ZENIT-BASED SEA LAUNCH VENTURE GETS ORDER FROM HUGHES

     Hughes ordered up to 10 launches from Boeing, which plans to
use Ukrainian Zenit rockets launched from sea-based platform to
beat prices offered by other providers.  U.S. signed agreement on
Dec. 15 that will allow up to 20 American-built satellites to be
deployed on Ukrainian boosters.  Under accord, Boeing-led Sea
Launch consortium can launch up to 15 satellites and Ukraine itself
as many as 5.  Boeing is lead partner in Sea Launch, which plans to
market launch service to global customers.  Hughes, which said
first flight will be in 1998, was awarded $1-billion contract to
launch satellites of Inmarsat affiliate ICO, which Hughes is
building.  It said it's considering using Zenit for one or more ICO
satellites.

     Hughes signed similar agreement with McDonnell Douglas to use
its planned Delta 3 rocket for up to 10 launches in 1998-2005
period.  "Sea Launch is another solution to what we see as a need
for assured access to launch vehicles and launch slots over the
next few years," Hughes Space & Communications Chmn. Donald Cromer
said.  He said Hughes launch costs will be reduced because, among
other things, Sea Launch will maintain home port in nearby Long
Beach, which will reduce shipping expenses.

     Sea Launch consortium will be licensed under authority of
FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (OCST), Dir. Frank
Weaver told reporters Dec. 19.  Home port for Sea Launch is Long
Beach and launches will be from special ship operating in
international waters using Ukrainian Zenit boosters.  Weaver said
OCST derives its authority over company because Boeing is U.S.
corporation that has critical role in project.  Situation is
different from Lockheed Krunichev Energia (LKE) venture that
launches Western payloads on Russian Proton, Weaver said, because
Lockheed's role is limited to marketing.  OCST doesn't license LKE
launches.  Weaver said OCST will inspect Sea Launch hardware and
procedures to ensure safety, and additional approvals may be
required from other U.S. agencies such as Coast Guard and Maritime
Commission.

     Ukraine is allowed to launch up to 20 U.S.-built satellites,
Weaver said, but final number depends on how robust international
launch market is over next few years.  He said low-end projections
indicate there will be about 20 internationally competitive flights
per year, with high-end figure around 30.  Under agreement, if
market averages 24 launches in 1996-1999, Ukraine can fly up to 5
satellites itself and international joint venture with key U.S.
partner (such as Sea Launch) can send up 11 geostationary birds. 
If there are 24 or more launches per year on average during period,
Ukraine can fly up to 6 satellites, while venture has authority to
launch 14.  Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites will be handled
separately, but Weaver said U.S. intends to ensure that American
providers are given "fair consideration."  Globalstar has deal
(part cash, part contribution of services) to launch several of its
LEO satellites on Zenit.

     Meanwhile, Weaver said OCST plans to release first part of
2-part notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in March on proposals
to streamline and simplify procedures at federal launch ranges and
to detail financial responsibilities of govt. and private sector
for commercial launches.  He said date for release of 2nd NPRM
hasn't been determined, but OCST will propose rules for procedures
at "purely commercial spaceports," which have been proposed in 5
states.  It also will include proposed safety rules for planned
reusable launch vehicles, he said.

FCC PROPOSES COMPENSATION POLICY FOR LEC-WIRELESS INTERCONNECTION

     FCC proposed compensation arrangements for LEC-wireless
interconnection that would mandate interim use of "bill-&-keep" as
reimbursement method.  Under bill-&-keep, each carrier terminates
calls for others at no charge.  Commissioners said at final meeting
of 1995 that bill-&-keep isn't ideal system, but speed is of
essence.  Comr. Quello warned that "search for an economically
perfect system would be the enemy of the economic good."

     Common Carrier Bureau Chief Regina Keeney told commissioners
that interconnection is becoming increasingly important "as the
infrastructure evolves into a network of networks" and agency is
concerned that current FCC policies "aren't enough."  Current rules
require "mutual compensation" but don't set more specific
requirements.  Beauty of bill-&-keep is that it's "administratively
simple," Keeney said.  It doesn't require setting up new billing
systems.

     At present, more calls flow from wireless to wireline, meaning
LECs may have to bear more costs under bill-&-keep, but that
situation is changing.  Wireless companies, on other hand, have
complained that LECs are charging them inflated prices for
terminating their calls.  "There's a real danger" that without FCC
action, telephone companies will be able to impede development of
PCS through high prices and delays, Comr. Ness said.

     Although it considers bill-&-keep "preferred" solution,
Commission will seek comments on other options such as setting
uniform rate, charging whatever LECs charge neighboring LECs to
terminate calls, picking up one of various state solutions.  Comr.
Ness said she would be willing to listen if someone came up with
better system "but it's got to be less regulatory and it's got to
be speedy."

     Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn. (CTIA) praised FCC
compensation proposal that it said would result in decreased fees
to wireless customers and increased competition.  CTIA said that
under current practice, wireless providers are required to pay LECs
for terminating calls that originate on mobile phones but LECs
don't pay wireless carriers for terminating their calls.  CTIA
Pres. Thomas Wheeler said that in 1994 wireless carriers paid LECs
more than $800 million to terminate their calls.  "Such a fee can
only act to impede development of wireless as a competitive local
exchange service," he said.

     Commissioners took pains to emphasize that they weren't
stepping on toes of state PUCs.  Fact that FCC has authority to set
compensation arrangements was mentioned several times -- as was
eagerness to keep states in loop.  "We have a good relationship
with the state commissions and we don't want to lose it," Chmn.
Hundt said.  "We want to work with them."  Key issue affecting
state PUCs is how FCC rules will apply to termination of intrastate
traffic.  Commission invited comments on whether it should adopt
interconnection model that isn't binding on state regulatory
commissions or whether it should opt for mandatory model.

     Commission tentatively concluded that information on
LEC-wireless interconnection arrangements should be made public and
will take comments on how to do that -- through tariffing, public
disclosure report or other approach.  Agency also will seek comment
on whether new rules should apply to interconnection between LECs
and all commercial mobile radio services or should be limited to
arrangements between LECs and 2-way providers such as PCS, cellular
and specialized mobile radio.  Other option would limit rules to
interconnection between LECs and PCS providers.

     Personal Communications Industry Assn. (PCIA) Vp Mark Golden
called FCC action "an important step for making a right that
existed in the rulebooks happen in the marketplace."  He applauded
Commission for "doing something fast and simple" rather than
following "a long, drawn-out process in search of the perfect." 
Comcast said action "may be the single biggest step the FCC has
taken so far to promote local telephone competition."

     Group of 4 Chinese organizations and 2 Singapore companies

     Group of 4 Chinese organizations and 2 Singapore companies
announced plans to create regional mobile satellite system called
Asia Pacific Mobile Telecommunications (APMT).  Backers of
$640-million project include China Satellite Launch & Tracking
Control, China Aerospace Corp., China Unicom, China
Telecommunications Bcst. Satellite, Singapore Telecom, Singapore
Technologies Telemedia.  APMT has requested proposals for 2
satellites and ground facilities.  First launch is planned for 1998
on Long March.  System will compete against Aces project backed by
consortium of Indonesian, Thai and Phillipine companies and
AfroAsia system backed by Indian concerns.  Aces has contract for
Lockheed Martin satellite, AfroAsia will deploy Hughes bird. 
Singapore Telecom withdrew from Aces project but still is part
owner, along with Hughes and others, of American Mobile Satellite. 
However, that doesn't necessarily mean Hughes has edge in
competition to get contract for APMT satellite, analyst Tim Logue
of Reid & Preist said.  "Hughes doesn't have a sweetheart deal," he
said.  Entry of 3rd regional MSS provider in Asia raises questions
about whether market will support that many systems.  Logue said: 
"It's remarkable that 3 geostationary satellite-based systems are
planned for launch by the end of the century for Asia.  There may
be market enough for all to prosper, but the question is -- what
market share does that leave for the Big LEOs?"  He said Big LEOs
have significant investment from region, which will host 6-way
fight for MSS business, "but it's a big continent."

     Ill. Circuit Court, Chicago, dismissed Health & Environmental

     Ill. Circuit Court, Chicago, dismissed Health & Environmental
Sciences Group (HES) and Dr. George Carlo as defendants in lawsuit
brought by Debbra Wright, who charged cellular telephone caused
brain cancer and who accused industry of conspiracy to conceal
evidence.  Judge Paddy McNamara said Wright case, originally filed
against Motorola, included substantial evidence but nothing linking
HES to conspiracy.  He's expected to issue written opinion this
month and rule in March on similar charges Wright filed against
Wireless Technology Research (WTR), which also is headed by Carlo
and set up by industry to study health effects of cellular phones. 
WTR said all allegations should be dismissed because "they are
based on the same key factual issues the judge has now resolved...
WTR believes that lawsuits such as the Wright case are wasteful
attacks on the scientific community, that they slow completion of
the research necessary to answer the public's questions about the
health effects of all wireless technology and that these tactics
could themselves pose threats to public health if they delay
implementation of any interventions that may prove necessary."

     Atlanta Trunking Assoc. filed request for waiver at FCC

     Atlanta Trunking Assoc. filed request for waiver at FCC
seeking to avoid substantial withdrawn-bid penalty in specialized
mobile radio auction (SMR) after intended $125,000 bid became
$125-million error.  Company said bid filed electronically carried
3 extra zeros.  In waiver request, it asked Commission to consider
size of company and nature of mistake in granting waiver.  Full
Commission will have to review request at end of auction, lawyer
Diane Law said.  Under FCC rules, company that withdraws bid is
liable for penalty based on difference between withdrawn offer and
eventual high bid at end of sale.  Company earlier bid $1,100 for
same license, designated P frequency block;  high bid before error
was about $100,000, submitted by FCI 900 -- which is Nextel. 
Atlanta Trunking resubmitted $125,000 bid in Round 10, FCC said. 
Efforts to contact company, part of Southland Corp. and SMR
operator at 900 MHz in Atlanta, were unsuccessful.  Meanwhile,
Commission said software used to report activity on 1,040 SMR
licenses has glitch preventing quick reporting and summarizing of
auction results on daily basis, and Round 12 and 13 results for
Dec. 20-21 were delayed.  Net revenue in Round 13 Dec. 21 increased
0.85% to $166,880,732 from 97 new bids.  On Dec. 20, total was 
$165.5 million, with 105 high bids and 112 eligible bidders.  In
final round of year, Paging Network offered $13.2 million for 87
licenses, including high bids of $925,000 in N.Y., $575,000 in L.A.
and Detroit, $545,000 in San Francisco.  Geotek had $10.8 million
in high bids on 179 licenses, and FCI 900 -- Nextel -- had $10.3
million on 222.  Auction resumes Fri.

AIRFONE FOUNDER JACK GOEKEN SEEKS FCC O.K.
FOR AIR-TO-GROUND PASSENGER DATA NETWORK

Sending facsimiles, receiving pages, checking stock quotations,
obtaining flight information, confirming rental car and hotel
reservations and playing computer games will be possible from your
airline seat if the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approves
a new data network. In-Flight Phone Corp. (IFPC) in Oak Brook, Ill.
on December 14 filed a petition with the FCC to establish a
nationwide air-to-ground data network.

  In-Flight was established by Jack Goeken, the founder of Airfone,
which has installed passenger phones on thousands of airplanes.
Goeken also was one of the founders of MCI Communications Corp.

  The company has asked for a developmental/experimental license that
would be the forerunner of a commercial digital data-only service in
1990. IFPC plans to install a 6" x 4" LCD on the back of each seat,
above the drop-down tray. Buttons that are dedicated to specific data
applications would be positioned around the screen. Also, an RJ-11
jack would be installed next to the LCD.

  A small phone -- dramatically smaller than the current GTE Airfone
model -- would be attached on the side of each seat, says Dimitrios
Lalos, vice president of engineering at In-Flight. A raised
alphanumeric keypad and cursor keys would be included on the back of
the phone's handset. A PC to control the onboard network would be
installed on the aircraft.

  In its FCC filing, the company says six data services for
passengers will be test marketed:

  1. Stock quotations selected  by passengers from New York and
Chicago exchanges.

  2. Video games, where passengers use cursor keys on the telephone
handset to control the actions. To avoid complaints by passengers who
might be bothered by the sounds emanating from the games, users will
have to use headphones. The game chips probably would be stored in
In-Flight's onboard PC.

  3. Connecting flight information that might be displayed 30 minutes
before the plane lands.

  4. Radio paging for passengers who register with In-Flight via
their seat computer after boarding the plane. Passengers could
receive alphanumeric pages from callers using a toll-free telephone
number. IFPC would control the airborne paging operation; the company
hasn't discussed any tie-ins with existing national or local paging
companies.

  5. Obtaining airline information from the North American Official
Airline Guides.

  6. Miscellaneous services, such as catalogue shopping, accessing
databases with laptop computers and sending faxes. Initially, faxes
will only be outgoing, from an In-Flight fax machine on the aircraft
or through a passenger's own PC-based fax card.

  The company also sees a large demand for making or reconfirming
hotel and rental car reservations. The LCDs will include several
buttons that are dedicated to specific applications, including
reservations. Step-by-step instructions would be shown on the LCD.

  In addition to these third-party services, the airline crew could
use the system for transmitting messages to passengers. These
messages could include the traditional pre-flight safety spiels, the
choices of meals and beverages and, possibly, advertising.

  The prices for many of these applications haven't been set, but the
company is looking at about $2 per transaction, says Bob Rubens, vice
president of airline relations at IFPC. For example, $2 would be
charged for confirming or reconfirming hotel or rental car
reservations. Receiving radio pages during the flight might be
cheaper, perhaps $2 for an unlimited number of messages, says Rubens.
Additional charges might be assessed for priority service to skip
ahead of the queue.

  The first network would operate with frequency shift keying at
1,200 bits/second, upgrading in 1991 to 9,600 bits/second, says
Lalos. In-Flight's proposal calls for building 25 ground stations
near major airports and 17 at other locations in the United States.
All the stations would be near GTE Airfone base stations.

  IFPC has requested the use of one subchannel from each of ten
channels used by Airfone under Airfone's experimental license. The
channels would be in 849/850 MHz and 894/895 MHz. Each of the 800 MHz
channels is divided into 31 subchannels, but the first subchannel is
not now used by Airfone, Lalos says.

  Every subchannel pair would be 6 KHz incoming and 6 KHz outgoing --
for a total of 120 KHz. Airfone has been allocated a total of 4 MHz
for its phone service.

  In-Flight is requesting this relatively small bandwidth allocation
because it wants to get up and running as quickly as possible; by
using Airfone's existing network, it can do so. IFPC is concerned
that other companies could beat it to the punch with services to keep
passengers entertained.

  Methods of providing in-flight movies, games and information
services have been under development for several years by such
companies as Avicom International, Air Vision and Transcom. They've
all explored tie-ins with air-to-ground telephone service.

  (Mobile Data Report's first issue in September 1988 featured an
item on Air Video, a Toronto firm developing an "Entray" computerized
game screen.) In-Flight has discussed the possibility of joint
ventures with these firms.

  "This revolution in the in-flight aircraft environment cannot be
realized, however, without the development of an ATG [air-to-ground]
network which can provide the data communications necessary to
support new services sought by the airline industry," says IFPC's FCC
petition.

  Although In-Flight has asked the FCC to use Airfone's frequencies,
Goeken really prefers to obtain his own channels. After five years of
service, Airfone's allocation is still considered developmental. The
FCC is expected to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in February
or March that would provide a permanent allocation.

  The possibilities include: giving the entire 4 MHz to Airfone,
allocating 2 MHz to Airfone and 2 MHz to another licensee or allowing
several companies to share the 4 MHz. Obviously, Airfone would prefer
to receive the entire allocation. In-Flight also wants a piece of the
spectrum for voice service.

  In August, IFPC filed comments at the FCC for an air-to-ground
service that would use 2 MHz. The comments replied to a Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking issued by the Commission. IFPC is also talking up
the sharing option, where possibly more than two companies would
offer service on 4 MHz.

  In addition, In-Flight is considering the possibility of offering
its services via an existing satellite vendor, says Rubens. He
declines to name the vendor, but Inmarsat's satellite network could
probably transmit the data.

                              *********

                   Goeken's Travails With Airfone

  For years, Jack Goeken has been talking publicly and privately
about offering data and other value-added services over Airfone. When
he was at the helm, Airfone had conducted a few experiments with
transmitting data. The company used modems to transmit electronic
mail and electrocardiographs. A few years ago, Goeken had announced
that the "next generation" of Airfone telephones would include an RJ-
11 jack.

  However, GTE decided not to provide a computer connection. In fact,
it decided not to offer a variety of services that Goeken had wanted.
In February 1989, he resigned from the company and filed a breech of
contract suit against Airfone, seeking release from the non-compete
clause of his contract.

  The DuPage County [Ill.] Circuit Court ruled in favor of Goeken,
stating that GTE Corp. and GTE Airfone had "committed numerous
material breeches of the stock purchase agreement." As a result,
Goeken is free from all of the stipulations in his contract and is
legally able to establish a competitive air-to-ground network.

  GTE Airfone is working on reply comments for the Federal
Communications Commission on In-Flight Phone Corp.'s data network
and, therefore, won't discuss Goeken's plans. However, "we definitely
see that there is a demand out there [for air-to-ground data
services] and we're cognizant of that fact," says Kevin Petschow, a
public relations spokesperson for Airfone.

  What type of data services would Airfone offer? "We're still in the
early stage of figuring that out," Petschow says.

HUGHES AIRCRAFT ENTERS MOBILE DATA MARKET
AS SYSTEMS INTEGRATOR FOR RUGGEDIZED USES

  A familiar name in the military hardware market is entering the
mobile data industry as a systems integrator. Hughes Aircraft in
Carlsbad, Calif. is developing a line of "portable information
equipment" for military and commercial applications that generally
require rugged products and relatively fast data rates.

  The new venture is under the aegis of Hughes' industrial products
division and will capitalize on the company's expertise in building
cathode ray tubes and other types of displays, test equipment and a
variety of electronic gear.

  As part of its entry into mobile data, Hughes obtained the
exclusive worldwide rights to develop military and heavy-duty
commercial products using Reflection Technology's Private Eye display
(see Mobile Data Report, September 11, 1989).

  Private Eye allows users to view a 12-inch image floating in front
of one eye while looking through a tiny display with the other eye.
The display, which features red characters on a black background, is
contained in a 1" x 1" x 3" device that can be held up to the eye or
attached to headsets, eye glasses, etc.

  Reflection Technology sees its product as supplementing or
replacing a variety of displays or hard copy output, such as pager
LCDs, laptop computer screens and paper printouts from facsimile
machines.

  By wearing the device attached to a headset, doctors could see
readouts from medical monitors or scanned images, stockbrokers could
watch especially important real-time data without having to look at a
specific CRT and military field commanders could scan computer
projections and maps while watching the battlefield action.

  Eliminating traditional displays or paper output would
significantly reduce the size and weight of computer devices while
increasing the battery life, says Jim Bradley, assistant division
manager of Hughes' industrial products division. Bradley is program
manager for the company's portable information equipment venture.
Private Eye offers a "unique way" of displaying images with a
satisfactory resolution in a small package and with low power
requirements, he says.

  However, Hughes won't "fall in love" with any display; it will use
whatever is appropriate, Bradley says. Another appropriate technology
for certain mobile data is computer voice recognition. By building a
device that recognizes voice commands, the keyboard could be
eliminated. This further decreases size and weight.

  These advances in display and voice recognition technologies will
produce new types of products that will create new markets for which
today's heavier computers are now unacceptable, he says.

  Although the military is an obvious market for portable data
devices, "we know it takes ten to 12 years to get anything into the
field," he says. There's good and bad news for companies that want to
sell this type of equipment to the military. On one hand, funding for
new projects is less than in previous years. On the other hand, the
Department of Defense (DOD) is placing increasing emphasis on
computer-aided maintenance and logistics.

  For both military and commercial use, Hughes sees a significant
market for "portable maintenance manuals," ranging in size from
products that can hang on a belt to more sophisticated handhelds.
With radio frequency links, maintenance personnel can access host
computer databases. Indeed, some DOD people have been describing the
maintenance manual of the future as a laptop computer that you carry
around, says Bradley.

  Agilis Corp. in Mountain View, Calif. has been talking about this
application since the company was founded. Agilis' rugged mobile
computer is the type of product that Hughes has evaluated. Neither
Hughes nor Agilis will comment on the potential of a formal
relationship.

  However, if Hughes wants products that can be attached to a belt,
Agilis would have to develop smaller products. Interestingly, Roger
Higgins, vice president of marketing at Agilis, has been speculating
(just humorously?) about "computers that you wear."

  Hughes isn't an expert in commercial RF networks; "we're a hardware
manufacturer," Bradley says. He's is especially interested in spread
spectrum transmission because it doesn't require a license from the
Federal Communications Commission. Agilis and Telesystems SLW in Don
Mills, Ontario are among the companies with spread spectrum products
for mobile local area networks.

IBM MIGHT DEBUT TERMINAL IN FIRST QUARTER
FOR HIGHER-END TERRESTRIAL, SATELLITE DATA

  IBM, which has been working on a mobile data system for
Consolidated Freightways, will publicly announce its new mobile data
computers sometime during the first quarter of this year, says John
Pemberton, program director for mobile technologies at the Gartner
Group, Inc. in Stamford, Conn. In an online alert to his clients,
Pemberton says Geostar Corp. might be the first customer for IBM's
vehicular PCs, which would supplement Sony Corp.'s satellite
receivers.

  An article in the January 3 issue of The Wall Street Journal
reported that IBM's product is likely to replace Sony's receiver.
That was a misquote, says Pemberton. IBM's computer will be targeted
at customers who want a more powerful machine, he says. (Of course,
IBM is known for developing numerous products in its laboratories
that are never commercially marketed or are sold only to a limited
number of customers.)

  Sony is "definitely in the [mobile satellite terminal] business for
the long haul," says Shelley Donlon, marketing administrator at Sony
in Park Ridge, N.J. The company will continue to develop terminals
for Geostar, though it has no plans to produce units for other
satellite vendors, she says. Sony won't comment on IBM developments.

  Before releasing his predictions, Pemberton didn't receive any
direct confirmation from IBM, he tells Mobile Data Report. That's
certainly not unusual, since IBM rarely says anything about products
before they are announced. What was somewhat unusual to Pemberton,
though, was that sources at the computer giant not only didn't refute
his claims but seemed to have encouraged him to publish them, he
says.

  Pemberton says he was spurred to make the announcement
some of his clients who were briefed by IBM about the product. For
example, IBM contacted a delivery company with more than 50,000
vehicles that might participate in a pilot program. Several companies
contacted by Mobile Data Report said IBM had asked them to visit Boca
Raton, Fla. where the developmental work is being conducted.

  It's no secret -- though the parties involved have treated it as
one -- that IBM has been developing a mobile computer for
Consolidated (see Mobile Data Report, September 11, 1989). Some 100
vehicles in Cincinnati are testing the system, which includes
dispatching and vehicle location. For Consolidated, Etak is
developing a positioning system based on map matching and Loran-C.

  IBM's mobile units supposedly will work with satellite positioning
networks and terrestrial systems. The computers probably will be
compatible with specialized mobile radio networks, such as Motorola's
Coverage Plus data system, Pemberton says. Coverage Plus was
announced last year -- possibly to counter the publicity over Ram
Mobile Data's 50-city Mobitex network -- but will not be available
until later this year.

  Pemberton says today's 20,000 mobile data terminals have created a
market of $50 million. By 1995, two million mobile satellite
terminals worth $4.15 billion might be sold. IBM could realize more
than $1 billion from the sale of terminals, he says. The computer
firm's entry into the market would bring the benefits of its Systems
Application Architecture and electronic data interchange into the
mobile environment, says Pemberton.

  Other mobile data companies -- such as Motorola, Electrocom
Automation and Kustom Electronics -- promote their compatibility with
IBM systems. But IBM's ability to provide a total host computer-to-
mobile workstation solution, integrating software and hardware, would
be a powerful incentive for existing IBM shops to choose Big Blue's
mobile PC. The majority of traditional mobile data customers, in
trucking, delivery, public safety and field service, use IBM
products.

  Also, if sources are correct, IBM's product will be sort of a
downsized PS/2. Though Motorola and Electrocom provide the ability
for portable PCs to access their proprietary mobile data systems,
they do not offer a DOS machine. Only Agilis now markets DOS-
compatible mobile computers. Agilis' product is a portable that can
be mounted in a vehicle; IBM's computer is expected to be a vehicular
unit, not a portable.

SUCCESSFUL BETA TESTING REQUIRES CAREFUL
PLANNING, INTEGRATION FOR TRUCKING FIRM

  The key to developing a worthwhile test of a satellite messaging
and location network is to quickly integrate it into a company's
existing computer dispatching system -- not to use just one
standalone PC. That's the view of Tom Burns, senior director of
quality, at Midwest Coast Transport (MCT), which is testing
Transtrack's meteor burst network (see Mobile Data Report, November
15, 1989).

  In June 1989, the Sioux Falls, S.D. trucking company tested a
mobile satellite network. It was either Qualcomm or Geostar, but
Burns declines to identify the company. Equipment was installed in
eight of MCT's 600 vehicles. The host software was installed on a PC
which wasn't interconnected to MCT's computer dispatching system.

  As a result, dispatchers had to leave their seats to use the PC,
which would display the trucks with the satellite equipment.

  "Unfortunately, it just sat in a corner....No one ever used it,"
Burns says. The trucking company employs about 20 dispatchers during
peak times and they were just too busy to spend much time at the PC's
keyboard. However, the standalone PC method might work better at
smaller firms, where the dispatchers aren't as busy, he says.

  This time, Midwest aims to conduct a much better trial and is
"doing a lot of upfront work" to determine how to implement the test.
Most importantly, Transtrack's communications/messaging software will
be integrated into the IBM 38 computer terminals that are used by MCT
dispatchers. A dedicated PC will be needed, but only as a link
between the IBM 38 and Transtrack -- not as a dispatch terminal.

  Also, all of Midwest's dispatchers will be taught how to use the
system. During the previous test, only a few dispatchers were
trained.

  To accommodate Midwest and other customers, Transtrack is modifying
its network to provide real-time transmission of messages from
vehicles to dispatchers. Currently, customers' host computers have to
dial Transtrack's networked 80386-based PCs to obtain messages.
"That's one of the things that I do not want," he says. Receiving
messages quickly is important to Burns, but the modifications are
behind schedule.

  In general, though, he's pleased with Transtrack's service and
responsiveness. "They're very customer oriented....They are very nice
to work with," he says. He's also pleased with the company's pricing,
which is significantly less than Geostar's or Qualcomm's.

  Transtrack's onboard equipment will cost some $2,500 less than
satellite messaging and vehicle location systems, says Burns.
Transtrack charges about $2,000 for its onboard terminal, $30/month
for system access and six vehicle location updates an hour, $.10 for
short, pre-programmed status messages and $.02 per character for free
form text, says Jim Feeney, president at Transtrack. On average,
customers pay $45/month for airtime.

  Dispatching over any RF network is "going to cut down on our phone
bill tremendously" because drivers won't have to use a payphone to
contact the office, Burns says. Monthly telephone bills of $30,000-
$35,000 are not uncommon.

  MCT also expects the system will let its truck drivers get more
sleep. Today, drivers can put in a full day's work and have to stay
awake late at night until notified when another load is available.
With Transtrack, the driver could sleep in the cab until he is
notified. Burns has suggested to Transtrack that it increase the
sound level of its alarm. With an idling engine and a snoring driver,
the present alarm isn't loud enough, he says.

  Other companies scheduled to test the network include the Denny's
restaurant chain and USX, a delivery service. Transtrack's primary
competitor in providing lower cost location and messaging services is
Pegasus Message Corp. in Herndon, Va. Like Transtrack, Pegasus'
network is based upon meteor burst transmission.

INTERCONNECTING DIFFERENT TERMINALS, LAPTOPS
TO STANDARD COMPUTER PROTOCOLS TO MARK '90S

  Maps and specialized databases on CD-ROMs, faster cellular modems
and new SMR hardware and software are some of the developments just
introduced or expected in the early 1990s.

  Predicting certain mobile data trends is not difficult. Customers
generally want to integrate their existing host-computer software
into any mobile network. Also, existing and potential users are
increasingly interested in taking advantage of the power of laptop
computers for mobile applications. And, the network operators and
manufacturers are going to give them much -- if not all -- of what
they want.

  From the presentations of speakers at Waters Information Services'
"Connectivity in Mobile Data Networks" conference -- representing
many of the industry's leading-edge network operators and hardware
vendors --  it was obvious that compatibility with existing software
and computer protocols are major goals. At the conference in
Washington, D.C., even Motorola emphasized its desire to allow any
terminal -- dedicated or laptop -- to access its Data Radio Networks.

  Compatibility with IBM mini and mainframe architectures, local area
network architectures and the Open System Interface platform is being
pursued vigorously. Yet no single mobile data standard is likely to
emerge for the foreseeable future. For example, companies that are
well known for landline computer products, such as modem
manufacturers, are introducing their own error correcting standards
into the mobile arena.

  Few, if any, mobile data technologies during the next couple of
years will be appropriate or inexpensive enough for the mass market.
However, the introduction of lower cost vehicle navigation products
as part of a driver information system installed in higher-end
automobiles will generate consumer awareness in the early to mid
1990s.

                                Etak

  The president of Murdoch Magazines, which owns the map making firm
of Etak, knows "instinctively" that drivers will want more travel-
related information in the 1990s. "I don't believe you can research
these things," says John Evans, president at Murdoch. In the 1990s,
perhaps in 1992, at least one automobile manufacturer will begin
offering driver information systems that contain databases on CD-
ROMs, says Evans.

  Evans declines to discuss which company will offer such a system,
but General Motors is Etak's exclusive licensee in the United States
for providing equipment to the automobile marketplace. G.M., along
with virtually every other major automaker, has been working on cars-
of-the-future containing cellular phones, facsimile machines,
navigational systems and a host of computer-related add-ons.

  Using Etak's digitized maps and map software, companies will begin
offering databases on CD-ROMs, including the location of and
information on hotels, restaurants, gasoline stations, tourist
attractions and do-it-yourself tours catering to specialized
interests. The data will be displayed on either stand-alone CRTs or
built-in monitors. The success of his vision is dependent upon the
commercial introduction and acceptance of computer displays in
vehicles.

  He envisions motorists being able to obtain subscriptions to a type
of CD-ROM-of-the-Month-Club. Advertiser sponsorship of CD-ROMs will
be vital to generate revenues to sustain this market's growth, Evans
says.

  As a subsidiary of one of the largest publishing firms in the
world, Murdoch Magazines has a great deal of experience in selling
newspaper and magazine advertising, he says. The publishing firm owns
five automotive magazines in the United States and Europe, which
could be used to promote a vehicle location/CD-ROM system.

                               Modems

  "We think having a higher speed modem is very critical to the
success of the mobile office," says John Fox, senior program manager
at Telebit, Inc. in Oak Brook, Ill. With Telebit's Cellblazer modem,
the company wants to create entirely new markets and "revolutionize
the way business is done," says Fox.

  Telebit sees the market for Cellblazer for such applications as:
on-site insurance adjustment, for faster settlement of claims; field
sales, for faster processing of orders and for verifying
availability; field maintenance, for accessing mainframe databases;
government use, for Internal Revenue Service agents to access records
and for security agents to check photographic I.D.; and for
establishing temporary office communications.

  The Waters conference was the first public introduction of
Telebit's modem (see Mobile Data Report, December 4, 1989). In
November, Microcom had announced its MNP 10 modem that was designed
for "adverse environments," such as cellular (see Mobile Data Report,
November 20, 1989).

                        Electrocom Automation

  A new marketing strategy for penetrating the Specialized Mobile
Radio (SMR) industry is under development at Electrocom Automation in
Arlington, Texas. More than a year ago, the company unveiled a
generic dispatching package for E.F. Johnson SMRs that would use
Johnson's modems in conjunction with Electrocom's software and mobile
data terminals.

  But a massive reorganization at Electrocom resulted in layoffs,
including the person charged with selling the SMR system. This has
placed the program on hold. However, Electrocom has just completed a
major survey of the SMR industry and will be rolling out a new
marketing strategy in 1990, says Roy C. Emory, a senior staff
engineer at Electrocom.

  Rather than offering a generic dispatching package for all
potential users, the Texas company is developing a targeted approach
that will focus on individual niche markets. Products will have to be
"cheap," says Emory. A customer who pays $1,000 for his radio doesn't
want to pay more than that for a mobile data terminal, he says.

  * Modems Plus, Inc. in Atlanta has sold its first mobile data
system, Commrad, to the Duke Power Company in North Carolina, says H.
Thomas Thorsen, president at Modems Plus. The Atlanta firm offers an
80386-based network controller/protocol converter that allows
vehicular terminals to access IBM systems running 3270 SNA/SDLC. The
system uses Dataradio's packet modems to support transmission rates
of up to 9,600 bits/second.

  Duke Power has been testing Commrad since September 1989. Service
technicians can remotely access customer accounts and enter work
orders. By August 1990, 60 terminals will be installed for Duke
Power's field service force, Thorsen says.

  * American Mobile Satellite Corp. and Telesat Mobile will award a
contract for their satellites this month, says David Castiel, vice
president of marketing and business development at AMSC in
Washington, D.C.

  * Within two years, the shared-used data network of Mobidata in
Canada could be transmitting at 19,200 bits/second. Mobidata, which
is owned by BCE Mobile Communications and Motorola, now transmits at
4,800 bits/second.

  * Racotek is likely to unveil its completed Specialized Mobile
Radio data network software sometime during this quarter, says Dr.
Isaac Shpancer, director of research at the Minnesota company.
Racotek is adapting by the Open System Interface model for SMR
networks. Later this year, the company is also expected to offer a

  Qualcomm, Inc. in San Diego will replace Loran-C with its own
proprietary location technology by the end of the first quarterof
1990. QASPR -- Qualcomm Automatic Satellite Position Reporting --
involves triangulation with existing Ku-band satellites and ground
stations (which are regular Omnitracs receivers), says Tom Bernard,
vice president and general manager at the California firm.

  QASPR's accuracy will be one third of a mile in virtually all areas
of the country, he says. This compares with Loran-C, which ranges in
accuracy from one tenth of a mile to several miles. The increased
accuracy will be important mostly to truck companies carrying
hazardous materials. Qualcomm developed the system primarily for
overseas use, in Europe, Japan and Australia, where Loran-C is not
available, Bernard says.
